i will
plenty of time dave and i should have called it
but you know with the cratering out here if youre going to see the liftoff im almost tempted just to take a shot up on a rise here if i take it right to the exact spot im afraid that youre not going to see it joe because of the depres sions and the hmmocky and everything what do you think about that
sounds good
i think ill just stay out here and put you at about 300 feet which we are theres a nice little rise here and ill point you  you want to be heading 255 yes thats all messed up too just slightly okay south and west i got a good spot for you joe joe whats my relative azimuth at the sun right now with west

okay i think ive got a good place for you right up on a rise were about 300 feet away i think youll like this
okay switches are off brakes on now tell me what else you wanted to do joe that was different besides dust
okay dave tap the amphour meters just to see if the readings change
okay wait a minute ill dust off the lcru
crwras dusted and the lcrus dusted tap the amphours and the amphours read 83 and 90
okay dave and the rest of the readings please
oh okay 00 on the amps of course the battery temps ll2 and ll9 and motor temps are still off scale low
okay dave set up your circuit breaker configura tion and open the bat covers please

okay
so youll know what everything looks like
why not 06 23 39 b1 cdreva okay im going to power  theres so much dust on here the down position is r2ote right joe i mean external aux
thats affirmative
use that dust brush dave to dust it off
its in a shadow and i cant see
oh
no problem dave the down position
and dave wed like for you to aline the high gain per the checklist procedures but were standing by for your readings on how possible you think that is because of the dim intensity of the earth
dave do you read houston
hadley base do you read houston
hadley base do you read houston
yes now 5 by joe
okay and i guess were standing by for your high gain alinement per the checklist
okay stand by

and joe let me verify that the position of the earth and the grid is the important thing and not the angle at which the grid intersects the local vertical is that correct
dave thats more or less correct i think were satisfied with the alinement here we just need some help on tilting our camera up to the level
okay just a second
dave we need some help bumping our camera up please
okay joe work camera

a falcon feather yes indeed
how about that
al were up to the time to turn pan camera mode standby and power on
okay karl
hey we got a few special words also on water dumps  i guess you got one coming up in about 3 hours theyre anxious in the future that we dont run the waste water below l0 percent be cause of possible malfunctions of the waste inlet valve causing the suit exchanger to have oxygen breakthrough so theyd appreciate your keeping a close eye on the  on waste dumps and  waste tank water quantity
okay karl will do
endeavour pan camera power off now please
power is coming off
al while youre eating up there weve got the morning news are you in a situation to listen
okay yes ikarl glad to hear it 
okay it looks like weve avoided a steel strike down here the steel workers and mauagement agreed to a onedollar per hour day increase last night boosting the straight time rate to 445 per hour maybe we should take up that trade huh r rape1084l
sure sounds like it
the mercury dipped to 68 degrees yesterday a  record low for the 1st of august in houston weve had some real pleasant weather here too bad that either you or i havent been  had a chance to get outside to enjoy it huh
yes wait until next week and well take a vacation
you said it representative edith green democrat of oregon said students and parents have been misled into thinking that a college degree is the only road to success she advocated more vocational and technical training on the sport scene arnold palmer and jack nicklaus combined their talents to score an easy sixstroke victory in the national pga championship at ligonier pa they were 27 under par into 72 holes the astros smothered montreal 8 to l but are still in the second division ll and a half games behind san francisco and here is aflash hot off the wire its only  its only 200 years old but very apropos of the leak that you sprang a couple of nights ago and also the big leak in the lm a couple of days ago and the  the dispatch is as follows the en deavour the original endeavour sprang a leak off the great barrier reef at llo0 pm on ll june  on 11 june 1770 it was necessary for them to dump 40 tons of consumables to prevent sinking then they sailed on with 40 feet of water in the hold and this information comes to you courtesy of honeysuckle tracking station in australia
hey thats very nice of honeysuckle to tell us that and i guess you ought to know that when we spraug a leak the other night we didnt notice that any water had escaped but when i made the planechang e burn today i found it and it was sitting right in the middle of the after  of the heat shield
laughter very good how much water was there can you estimate that
had a great big puddle of water
a pint
oh id estimate maybe a pint yes
0keydoke
al heres a little more of an update on the opera tion of the sim bay experiments the gammaray xray and alphaparticle spectrometers are con tinuing to collect good scientific data i already told you about the  the xray data showing regional differences very clearly i went downstairs and and looked at it myself and it really is almost on a kilometerbykilometer basis you can see when you go from a highland in  into a mare very interesting the laser altimeter as i already told you has shown a lot of interesting things about the altitudes on the moon but im not sure whether you know it or not but its essen tially belly up at the present time we dont have much hope for it in the future but the data that we did get out of it was very interesting and very good and i guess thats about all i can say at the moment
roger karl thnk you that all sounds very interesting
im not sure i told you previously  
and karl you say  that the laser altimeter is just about gone now huh
yes i think most people have admitted that its not  its giving us useless data it has given us useless data on the last couple of attempts to use it and we have very little hope for it now
indicentally the pan camera is deteriorat  deteriorating to some extend that v over h prob lem is getting  getting worse not  its  its not completely bad yet but were getting a lower percentage of good frames maybe 60 or 70 percent now
and in connection with this de  deterioration of the pan camera there is some feeling that as time tape10843 goes by its getting poorer end poorer and that maybe we should occasionally pulse it on the self  test cycle to take just a  five frames on  on interesting regions as we go along in order to get the film used up before it really deteriorates to a greater degree i guess were asking for your opinion on that do you have any feeling about that
no but it sounds like a good idea it seems to me like good or bad itd be a shame to leave some unused film in the camera
roger well well hang loose on that and i think  i think really we ought to get a better evaluation down here as to how we  how to really use up that remaining film people are thinking about it now
right i agree
al when i talked about pulsing the selftest there  i  i didnt completely have the picture clear in my own mind if the v over h sensor is giving us problems this is one way to get around it be cause if we take our five frames in selftest were essentially cutting the v over h sensor out of the circuit and taking a  a nominal image motion compensation there which would be better for us so its possible that when we wind up using that film that well have somebody sitting down in the lower equipment bay probably after youre all three together again  pulsing that switch every 30 seconds 06 23 40 41 cp roger karl understand it sounds fine transcript of communications between cc and i34resumed f apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription

very good
did you see the seven rilles of aristarchus al
certainly did  not much to relate at this time as far as aristarchus  descriptions  visual observations are concerned in earthshine as a matter of fact it was so close to the terminator that i wasnt really darkadapted enough to see much except the very lightcolored crater aristarchus and its ejecta pattern and a very lightcolored schroters valley and which kind of surprised me schroters valley has about the same lightness as the interior of aristarchus itself 07 o0 05 b9 cc roger didnt see any red spots up there huh
no i sure didnt
al the time line on the surface is going very well now and theyre just about ready to repress

yes its morning down here al al weve got a couple of changes for you were going to delete the p22 because the lm crew needs a little extra time and substitute a p24 from the command module for it if youve already got your camera on the sextant sorry about that if not delete it
okay ive already got it on but thats no problem
okay well give you a p24 land mac  landmark track pad whenever youre ready 07 01 07 05 c okay go ahead
okay your targets the lm tl 1693408 t2 3815 tca 4038 t3 4106 south 3 nautical miles and your attitude will have changed a little al were using roll pitch and yaw of 000 350231 and 000 noun 89 latitude 26107 longitude over 2 plus 01828 altitude minus 01326 and at 16925 in your flight plan change the r2 of noun 78 to minus o8o00
al i gave you a wrong time one  
roger ed copy
16915 is the time where that should be i dont see it there
okay ed i have  i have that one in the flight plan now at 16915 r2 is minus 06800
thats affirm and were substituting minus 08000
understand substitute for that minus 08000
thats affirm al
okay here goes the landmrrk tracking pad p24 on the ir tl 1693408 t2 is 3815 4038 4106 thats 3 miles south roll pitch and yaw are 000 350231 000 noun 89s are plus 26107 plus 01828 minus 01326 and ive changed r2 of the dap load
okay al and we will need marks on them of course
roger
be back with you in a little while
okay
endeavour houston
houston endeavour go ahead
al it sems like we had a  error on that last pad i read you the altitude should be minus 00133 understand
understand the altitude should be minus 00133
thats affirm sorry about that
endeavour houston omni charlie please
omni charlie transcript of cojnications betwrm cc and lm resumed apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
falcon the computer is yours
roger thank you
endeavour and falcon houston were going to delete the vhf check at this pass just to give you a little more time
roger
thats fine we just wont  bother with  the lmwith it
houston falcon do you have the torquing angles
okay you can torque
roger torque at 38
falcon houston how do you read
go ahead houston 5 by
roger how are you coming with your stowage we have these locations available  still if youre not too well stowed up yet
well we were just mushing along with it by the checklist here and why dont you go through what you have in mind im sorry were pres sing on well take a listen to what you got here
okay what we were expecting was bags 4 and 6 in the isa bag 3 on the aft engine  behind the aft engine and 2 and 7 in the right and lefthand stowage compartment with 7 in the lefthand 2 in the righthand
ed let me tell you where we  where we have them
okay
we have  the aft engine cover is bag 3 the lefthand mdsection is bag 2 the righthand  side is hag 7
and the one remaining bag we figured wed put in the isa
okay jim we seem to have bag  that would either be bag 4 or 6 and we seem to have both of them indicated for the isa
okay  well put  in other words youd like bags 4 and 6 in the isa that would work out fine
thats great and it sounds like the rest of its as per plan and be advised were showing total weight of slightly in excess of 230 pounds which is a little over what we expected however by deleting a plane change were going to have plenty of fuel for it
roger thank you
falcon houston
go ahead ed
give us a little bit of idea of where you are jim were starting to worry about time a little hit
were just configuring circuit breakers right now
okay one thing we do need did you weigh your isa and we need a weight on it please
its all weighed and stowed
okay have you got a weight that we can have
stand by 1
ah if its too much trouble ignore it jim but if you have it real handy ill take it
well give you a weight here shortly
okay thank you
okay houston falcon
go ahead falcon
okay in the rendezvous radar self  test and a verb 63 i have no shaft variation  on the noun 72 the trunnions going about a half a cycle per second but the shaft seems to be at 220  although the crosspointers are moving

no  stand by on that
falcon houston if you are having to dig the prds out skip it for now please 
okay we will
okay houston the rcs hotfire looks okay

okay thank you
and be advised i have some new rendezvous radar angles for you dave ill explain them when we get there
okay ed stand by 1
okay ed go with the  radar angles
roger 186 and 277 and the reason for this dave is that the command module is a little bit more in an elliptic orbit than were used to and ill have some more words about your tpi burn after while  after we look at it a little more
okay fine
roger his orbits 64 by 54 about a 10mile difference in perilune and apolune

roger endeavours got the vhf set up anyway
thats fine we just wont  bother the lm with it
okay you might tell them though i got my  if you want to check out the rendezvous radar ive got the transponder on

okay i understand 127 al you reading
roger go ahead 07 03 46 46 cdri24 okay were pitching up the radar track attitude we didnt get a lock on it on the way up well give you a call as soon as we get locked up
okay i was watching for that and ill let you know
and houston were watching the roll angle
falcon houston we have you at a 42 by 9 youre looking good
okay 42 by 9

roger
vhf range has us at ll7 now ll7
endeavour houston were ready to uplink you
go ahead youve got po0 and accept
what kind of range is radar giving you dave
and falcon houston we will not uplink a state vector to you your pgncs and ags are both good and we will keep them independent
falcon roger
endeavour houston the computers yours
roger  07 03 52 06 cc okay falcon houston i have a mbfn tpi for you and some words 07 03 52 16 ipi go ahead im ready to copy the tpi ed
okay its an offnominal tpi and angle deltav x 663 deltav y plus 78 deltav z minus 312 total 737 tpf deltav will be 260 youre going to be pointed lmost along the line of sight for tpi you can omit the roll maneuver for tpi your choice and you will undoubtedly break lock 07 03 53 03 i24pi24 okay on the pad i have plus 663 plus 78 minus 312 and total for 737 and 260 for tpf
thats affirm and the approach at tpf is going to be right along the local horizontal 07 03 53 25 cdri okay thanks for the information houston i think if radars working good and we get a good solution we will probably stay heads up and go ahead and accept the breaklock
roger roger and endeavour houston the same goes for you your attitude if you were to have to make the burn would be along the line of sight as well
endeavour roger 07 03 53 55 cdri4 and houston falcon i have a visual on the endeavour now and the coas is exactly boresighted the radar needles are boresighted and the pngs needles are boresighted and the ags needles are boresighted so were looking pretty good
very good dave
and falcon houston as far as we can tell your ags is completely go we see no reason for the master alarm yet 07 ob 54 b3 cdri understand 07 03 55 07 cdrim okay endeavour falcon im looking at about 94 miles 355 feet per second
oh roger im looking at 94 miles also 07 03 55 17 cdri24 okay good show and the pngs state vector agrees with that
and falcon houston youre go for an aps tpi you have 180 feet available 07 0b 55 48 cdrlm oh roger understand go for the aps tpi thank you 07 0b 56 38 cmp falcon endeavour you got your lights on jim
okay
falcon houston 07 03 57 04 cdri houston falcon go 07 0b 57 05 cc be advised your direct rendezvous tpi charts are no go because of this elliptical rendezvous your midcourse charts are good 07 03 57 19 cdri4 okay understand the tpi charts are no go and the midcourse charts are good
roger tracking lights on
i dont see your tracking lights 07 0h 02 13 cdrlm falcon endeavour i dont have your lights 07 04 02 28 cdrim okay

okay falcon endeavour im getting some large updates on you there dave on the first mark
okay 07 04 04 49  thats right yes thats right vhfs going okay first optics is  is off i bypassed two of them ill take the third
falcon houston
houston falcon go
roger we need to tweak up your pipas a little bit more dave before tpi
okay fine pencils out go ahead
address 1452 05210 address 1456 03170 and those are both verb 21 noun 01
okay we copy a verb 21 noun 01 1452 should be 05210 and 1456 should be 03170
good readback
okay dave the first update was the only large one the rest of shem are all falling in
okay very good 
okay houston falcon were seeing a fairly large difference in z between the onboard solutions and the ground solutions but i guess that can be expected at the recycle
im checking it for you now dave your pgns and ags seem to agree pretty well
roger and i think we can expect a fairly large z at the recycle
ill give back some words on the msfn tpi in a minut e 07 04 09 35 cdri roger
falcon houston were going to watch it for a few more minutes and see how they converge with the other solution
roger
okay dave ive got a recycle solution for you roger minus 694 minus 62 plus 120
endeavour houston i need omni alfa
omni alfa t 07 04 12 15 cc and falcon houston
houston falcon go
roger fido thinks you had a good solution but not a great solution before hes now saying the z component will be  should converge to about a minus 19 and if it does your approach angle with be more nominal  rather than along the horizont al
okay that sounds like were all converging to the same spot thank you
we agree dave 07 04 14 14 lmpim okay houston falcon our polar plot is showing us pretty nominal i guess well probably stay with the nominal procedures on the tpi
roger falcon we have you a minute to los your solutions look good in both computers well see ou on the other side and be advised we did ttoour iiff 6n  can confirm you lfted off
well very good thats nice to know thank you much save the tapes for us will you
say again please
save the tv tapes for us will you please

okay houston were stationkeeping at about 120 feet or so
roger dave during the command module pitch around wed like for you to take a look at the v over h sensor in the sim bay if you can do you know how to spot it
the which sensor
v over h 07 05 16 17 ip yes its  its on the pan camera gadget
okay i guess were not  well als talking to us
okay what were looking for is to see if any thing is in the way of the lens of that sensor if youre not filiar i can give you a page number in your lm data systems book just take a look at it
okay stand by 1
no its not  its not on the lens dave its right alongside the lens on the body of the cam era  
weve got a picture of it al
  it tells us what speed to take the pictures at
okay well get a picture of it
okay  07 05 17 20 cmp okay ill go ahead and do your piteharound

okay
okay on the righthand side dave you see that one little line that says mapping and pan cameras n2 press systems assembly f 07 05 18 21 cdrlm we havent got it out yet stand by
okay
yes ill go the higher rate dave
okay here we go 07 05 19 03 lmp go ahead
hey it looks good youre going the right way
dave while hes pitching ill tell you  should be about the middle of the sim bay by the mapping camera
very nice maneuver endeavour
okay houston we dont see it labeled in here where  is it labeled on the picture
negative as soon as you have the picture ill tell you where to look
okay we got the picture tell us where to look
okay way over on the righthand side where it says mapping and pan cameras n2 press system assembly
its on the right picture

thats affirm between the end of that arrow and the lens about halfway is a little dot that represents the v over h assembly now the camera lens will be covered  rather it will be folded up so you will not be able to see it however that is the item you are looking for represented by the small circle about halfway in between the end of the arrow and the lens of the camera
okay i see a small circular object there just  just to the right of the handle and i dont see anything covering it
are you talking about the diagram or in the sim bay
no in the sim bay 07 05 22 b0 cc okay thats what we wanted to know
yes its a little round black  
thats it  thats it 07 05 22 h0 cdrlm    type of affair right

roger we want to get a little data down here
okay do you want us to select 2 or just let it run
negative just wait for 30 seconds
okay well stand by for your call
thank you

roger closing glycol pump 1 now  auto transfer now
roger and i thank you
go ahead all right i got it
and endeavour houston a couple of changes to the command module  i4command module transfer list on stowage items when you get a break
okay houston stand by 1
and falcon well take data and uplink you
youve got it
okay houston endeavour you might as well give me those updates now
okeydoke endeavour on page 2  283 
okay go z
okay al about the middle of the imto command module transfer list the second decom bag and the fourth decom bag  scratch
understand scratch second and fourth decom bags
thats affirm and the  at the bottom write collection bag 3 in a9
understand add collection bag 3 in a9
roger and theyre going to give you a  a sec tion of core stem three sections long youll have to put that on the lefthand tray along a1 and a2 and secure it with  with either you i tiedown rope or your extra webbing in there
roger i understand the core tubes go along al a2 tied down on the tray
thats affirm you got it
dave you want to verify that the dump valves in auto
roger standby 1
verify
okay ill go ahead and start equalizing the pres sure
okay good
and falcon flight  or rather falcon houston fidos on pins and needles for your tpi solution if you can get a moment to read it to us
roger well do it right now
okay houston i assume that you got the recycle before we went around the corner there
thats affirm 07 05 4b 47 cdr okay on the final comp ill read pgns ags and cmc if you are ready to copy them in that order in localvertical coordinates
roger ready
okay for the pgns plus 703 plus 59 minus 177 for the ags pius 704 plus 59 minus 191 the cmc minus 691 minus 61 plus 161 we burned the pgns on time and we had about a 4 footpersecond overburn on the aps which we trimmed out to 210ths
copy
okay the residuals were  for the pgns after the trim  were plus 2 plus 2 and minus 4
copy and assume midcourses were 
roger well give you those too
okay and ill give you the same answers for mid course 1 if youre ready to copy houston  07 05 45 31 cc okay

okay you want midcourse 2
no well take you pgns  well take all the rest of them well get them later
okay fine it was pretty smooth all the way every thing looked nice and the data went in very well and i thought it was a super rendezvous
very good getting homes the main thing 07 05 46 b2 cdr yes but you know these systems are just magnifi cent 07 05 46 b6 cc yes they sure are dave okay we suggest you press right along with your transfer and cleaning up
roger were in work right now
and whenever jims ready to do the targeting well read him a pad on that
okay stand by well give you a call 07 05 47 42  okay ed im ready to copy the impact pad

good readback jim
and falcon houston the computers yours
roger
and we want to leave it in data of course
okay well leave it in data its all yours now
and endeavour houston before you get los and get too busy with transfer i need to give you a camera photo pad for the next pass
okay go ahead houston
okay this is the one on that 17450 al tstart  for the map camera  tstart 1745004 tstop 1754936 your image motion bp plus 4 at tstart and bp at 1753000 and your pan camera photo pad to be copied at 17520 tstart 1753432 tstop is 3652
roger ed understand mapping camera photo pad is tstart 1745004 tstop 1754926 and at t start you want image motion to go barber pole plus 4
thats affirm
and at 17530 understand you want image motion to go to barber pole
thats affirm al and the correct time for the tstop on that was 1754936
understand 4936
and the pan camera photo pad is tstart 1753542 tstop 1753652
roger the tstart 1753432 tstop is good
understand tstart is 1753432
thats a good readback now al
yes its pressurized jim can you read me okay tunnels pressurized and im up in it now checking the latching
hello houston the falcon is back on its roost and going to sleep
very good
shes all yours now ed were going to go off coremand put her to bed
okay one item dave youre not marking these bags before you hand them to al are you
the bags are all numbered weve got the collec tion bags in the cover bags with the proper numbers on them and that was all we were planning to do
okay youre not helping him with the stowage when you pass them in are you i would change your flight plan if you did otherwise ill just give it to him
well i guess the best thing would be to go ahead and give it to him because well just pass them over then
okay ive given them to him already thank you 07 05 58 4b cdr yes that fine he  hes got a much better handle on the stowage over there anyway than we do
endeavour houston
houston endeavour go ahead
al we observed when you were in p79 just before the docking that you got a p00 d00 do you have any words on that
no i dont ed
and endeavour houston were going to have to update your flight plan with a couple of items before you go around the corner whenever you can get around to it
okay ed lets go ahead and do them now
roger and al give us a verb 74 while im talking to you
roger verb 74 07 06 0b 24 cc okay the first flight plan update is the  at 17412 07 06 03 b7 cmp okay go ahead 07 06 0b b9 cc okay where it says the mapping camera laser ex periment covers open et cetera et cetera  de lete that
roger go ahead

okay understand
okay down a little bit in the next group of words where it says laser altimeter on at 17417 were going to scratch that
okay scratch laser altimeter
were going to move that to 17449
roger move to 17449
okay and at 17549 going to add a  another laser altimei 0ff 07 06 05 07 cn5 roger understand at 17549 laser altimeters off

thats affirm
okay
and at 17602 the next page right after all those words we want to add in the map camera  thats about 17602  map cameralaser experiment covers close talkbacks barber pole flash gray then off
looks like that item came down there about 4 min utes later al
roger that i see it now
yes i just now saw it too i presume they want it moved up there a few minutes and at 17802 oh sorry about that  at 17756 put in a logic pow 2 off 
okay i understand logic power both of them off at 17756
roger next page 17802 laser altimeter on delete
delete laser altimeter on at 17802
okay and at 17940 following page delete laser altimeter off  and about 17941 delete those two lines map cameralaser experiment covers and logic power 2 off delete those apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription

okay mark on and lets take the map camera on switch to standby and the map camera image motion off
okay map camera standby image motion off
that about cleans us up al
okay ed thank you much for your help
oh ed im back on comm over in the falcon
okay jim sounds good should be in attitude in just a minute and your angles 205 and 70 as in the flight plan should be good and were about 13 minutes from los
okay do you have any updates for me before we have los
negative all we wanted to do was just  the guidance systems state vectors okay and con figured before los and i dont believe we have an update ill check
falcon houston wed just like to complete down through step i or 2 of configure ags before los and endeavour if you can give us an accept well shoot you an uplink before los
okay getting accept
falcon copies
you got accept

roger ed
okay endeavour houston were a minute and 20 seconds from los your ascent capcoms going off duty and ill see you back on earth its been a lot of fun getting you up there

apollo 15 houston over
hello houston 15 how are you
roger doing fine down here can you fellows confirm lm closed out and ready for jet page 1223
roger lms closed out and were just now run ning our pressure integrity check and well be all set in a jiffy
roger
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay we are goingto be a few minutes here we got to put some lcg plugs in our suits and its going to take probably about l0 or 15 minutes to get all that done
okay and wed like a verification from a1 that xray is in standby and xrayalpha covers are closed before jet and sep burn  07 09 04 37 cdr okay well get that for you when we get squared away here
yes
apollo 15 houston
houston apollo 15 go
say dave beautiful job there today all the way around hey one quick question  how come you guys need plugs for those suits
well because apparently the lcg connection on the inside wont hold  an air seal so were getting them taken care of with these special  extra little blue plugs we got that are air tight on the inside
at least thats our first guess of  of why we didnt get a good suit integrity check or didnt even get a good buildup in the suit pressure
roger we  we had a complete misunderstanding on that so thats the reason i asked the ques tion because we thought those plugs only were required when the lcg was not on were trying to crack that one for you down here dave theres something screwy here tapell6 07 09 ll hl cdr okay well well put these plugs in and run another pressure integrity check and see how it works 07 09 11 h6 cc roger · page 1225 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
15 houston
houston 15 go
roger dave you guys talking about inside plugs or outside plugs
inside plugs
roger
okay houston 15 weve got a good suit circuit now
roger weve been looking at it copy agree
and 15 were still looking for an xrayalpha cover door closed
okay stand by l houston
roger
okay houston the xrayalpha door is closed
copy 07 09 21 bb cmp houston 15
go
okay were ready to arm the logic
roger were looking
okay logic 1 logic 2
roger youre go for pyro arm

15 lmcm deltap is 25  20 excuse me
copy 20 tape 11512 07 09 2b 00  okay 07 09 2b 26 cdr houston 15 o7 o9 2b 28 cc go 07 09 2b b7 cdr houston 15 07 09 23 b9 cc roger 15 go
okay the lmcm deltap doesnt look exactly right to us what do you think 07 09 2b 49 cc stand by 07 09 24 b2 cc 15 houston wed like to get another pound out of there were showing about 35 in there
okay we had a suspicion that possibly the lm overhead dump valve was open and it might be
we dont think so down here
okay well well go to tunnel vent for a little longer must just be slow then weve been in it for probably about 15 minutes
copy
15 what position are you in when youre reading that out in vent or in deltap 07 09 25 b4 cdr deltap 07 09 25 b7 cc roger 07 09 25 4b cdr its up to about 2b now and ive been holding it in tunnel vent
15 well take that itd take too long to get it  down we believe so lets press on with jett at that pressure
okay well the strange thing about it is that we had it up to about  oh 27 or 28 at one time and then went back to lmcm deltap and for some reason it built back up in the unnel and i guess the only conclusion we could come to was  from the lm because the hatch is pretty simple and secure in here
dave we think that the increase in the cabin pressure during the suit integrity check could have raised it frc  from your side
well okay thats  thats true
bye dave confusion reigns down here 07 09 27 l cdr could you see any ch  well i guess it sort of does up here too i wonder if you see any dif ference in the  you cant read the tnnel thoh can you 07 09 28 2 cc and 15 this is houston wed like to verify that you did get a good hatch integrity check back there a ways
yes thats firm we got a good hatch integrity check but  i guess what im thinking is theres  you know there could be something in the seal there and perhaps the thing to do would be to repressurize the tunnel and pull the hatch down and take a good close look at the seal and then stick it back in it shouldnt take too long 07 09 29 3b cc apollo 15 houston that seems to be about the best conclusion we can come to down here but were  kind of like to go into a hold briefly another indication is that we would  we are seeing the i2cabin holding steady and not using any oxygen from the ascent tanks which seems to say that were not leaking into the tunuel from the lm 07 09 bo 02 cdr okay understand 07 09 30 08  do we 07 09 30 4 cc 15 houston wed like to verify that the pressure  equalization valve is closed 07 09 30 5h cdr thats verified its closed and on the yellow strips
roger
and 15 wed like to back out of your pyro arm situation right now
okay houston 15 pyro arm is safe logic is off and the pyro arm circuit breakers are pulled
copy
15 can you give us a lmcm deltap reading at this time please
okay right now its 30
copy 30
and ive had the valve in tunnel vent for the last 5 minutes or so
copy
apollo 15 houston recommendation right now is to stop the  the lm tunnel vent and then we will sit and monitor the cmiam deltap for a short while to see what happens to it and after that were still considering opening up the tunnel to check the seal over
okay were in lmcm deltap right now and its reading about 31
copy 31
15 wed like to pull the bd roll jets 07 09 36 43 iamp roger bd roll jets coming off
and 15 if one of you has a chance would you put xray to standby please
roger xray to standby
okay houston its in standby
thank you
15 houston you give us a reading now on that
okay houston stand by 1
its just a little under 31 just a  just a hairline
roger copy and were still looking at the possibility of opening the hatch were just trying to  right now trying to understand the f situation before we open the hatch and destroy the configuration were in
okay well stand by
and 15 houston could we have another reading in l0 minutes
well its reading right now just about the same that it was when i last called you
roger copy theres certainly enough uneasiness down here that we think we ought to proceed back through and open both the command module hatch and the i hatch check the seals on both and the relief valves on both proceed back through that doing  doing those checks because there could be a very slight leak from the iamthat the telemeter guys  would not see at  for this small volume in the tunnel over
roger we sort of think thats a good idea too well proceed 07 09 47 b1 cc roger keep us posted when convenient 07 09 47 b6 cdr roger will do
15 just in case you havent got the idea when i said check the seals i mean clean them too 07 09 48 ob cdr roger understand well make sure theyre good and clean
okay houston 15 both hatch seals are clean and both hatches are now closed and locked do you want to vent the tunnel again
roger go ahead dave thank you
and 15 are you guys all still fully suited
roger we did not break down the suits were still locked up
roger
and the lm overhead dump valve was verified in auto
copy
okay houston were 13 on  deltap and coming  coming up
copy
okay houston were about 22 07 l0 01 h6 cc copy
and houston do you want to go to 3 and let it stabilize there
i guess well do per the checklist which is 35 right
well not really our checklist says before jettison onlyi tunnel vent valve itunnel vent at least l0 minutes period
okay stand by
course thats after the hatch integrity check if we want to go ahead and run through the full hatch integrity check then wed run up to 35 and then run another l0 minutes i guess 07 l0 02 h8 cc yes thats the point dave we want to run a complete ha  hatch integrity check in fact well proba  we may ask you to run it longer than usual
okay
obviously what were thinking about here is a bad  hatch seal so were particularly interested in that
roger 07 l0 0h 09 cc and 15 a reminder when youre on the back side lm is still in 5degree dead band so play it cool with the candmodule 07 l0 oh 22 cdr roger pase 1233 07 10 05 58 c  and 15 what wed like to see you do is leave hat tunnel at 35 for the entire backside pass and well see what happens to that leak rate that gives us a nice long leak check on the hatch and well be satisfied with that deltap for jett if thats the way it works out on the other side
okay and i guess in that case well probably break the suits down and then run another suit check before we see you around the corner so 
okay well buy that
its about time for dinner
i knew there was a reason
roger okay were about 32 now on the deltap well leave lm in vent
roger i understand 32 and still venting
roger
dave stand by on taking your suits off if you havent taken them off already
okay we hadnt planned to take our suits off were just going to break off the helmets and gloves so we could get something to eat
roger but stand by on breaking the suits down because its a debate as to whether we want to do another suit integrity check
okay
15 press on you may  you are permitted to  break the suits down but do not do the suit integrity check until you come back around the other side we can take aother look at that tunnel over
roger understand well break them down and hold off until we see you on the other side
okay good luck apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription 07 10 33  begin lunar rev 52

roger
apollo 15 houston reac and narrow over
apollo 15 houston over
houston apollo 15 go ahead
roger do you  roger do you have any good word for us
id say ln cm deltap is off scale high
roger and how did the hatch integrity check go
well weve just had it in tunnel vent all the  the way around the back side as i think you suggested
15 did you have a look at holding it in deltap to see how the  see how it was holding on that
no we just left it in tunnel vent all the way around the back side i  thats what wed thought youd said to do we can check it now
15 why dont you bring it up to 35 and let us watch it for a while i think we garbled some  and you watch it i think we garbled something there
okay our understanding was to let it go all the way and then you get a good look out on this side so well bring it up to 35
15 houston two items one we want to make sure that youre aware that we cannot read the tunnel pressure and so were depending upon your read outs of this deltap to give us the confidence here in the hatch integrity one other item that we do know is that during all that period when the tunnel was vented our 02 flow was offscale low which does give us some confidence in the integrity of the hatch and meanwhile were waiting for your ca on a 35 reading so we can begin a hatch integrity check over
roger
mark two minutes and 35 plus or minus 0
roger copy
and  and i think we had the same confidence bob we noticed the low 02 flow also the only ques tion we had was why did the deltap change
thats the same question that was bothering us
but its steady at 35 and has been now for about 2 and a half minutes
copy
okay 15 this is houston wed like to run that  hatch integrity check to about 5 minutes total because of what we suspect was the problem before and if it passes at that point welll press on per the flight plan for following the normal steps and you can plan if we have time for it were looking for a jet at 17930 at the present time over
roger 17930 and well give you a call at the 5minut e point
thank you
okay houston theres 5 minutes at 35 and it looks solid 07 ll ot 43 cc roger dave lets press on with a nominal time line
roger
and houston are you happy with 35 or would you like to bleed it down a little more
roger dave were happy with the hatch integrity and lets open the tunnel vent and bleed down to wards 0 at  for the nominal setup and i guess its on the decal there
roger no the decal says go for l0 minutes in lm tunnel vent
roger and i guess that means after hatch integrity which means beginning now
roger step 7 and its in work
15 houston youre suit integrity check looks good as far as we can tell down here 07 ll l 48 cp well we had it for about 5 seconds there and then the 02 flow went back up so well hang on here and see if it comes back down f
roger 07 11 21 0 cmp okay houston 15 we got a good pressure integrity check were ready to press on 07 11 21 6 cc roger we agree
and 15 were still aiming for 17930 for jett and be advised of course this means were going to have to retarget p30 to 17935 and other than that all attitudes will be the same although of course since youll be local vertical your inertial attitudes for the burn will be slightly different than what youve seen
okay understand and your deltap is offscale high now
roger and youre 14 minutes past that time
houston 15
go  go ahead 15
roger understand the retargeting on p30  you want to target that for 179 plus 30 plus 00 and the same deltavs as before
negative al its going to be 179 plus 35 plus 00 for the sep burn
sorry about that i meant 179 plus 35 three zeros jett huh
thats affirm
houston 15
go 15 go ahead
roger were ready to turn the sequence arm on
roger youre go for turning them on
okay and logic l on logic 2 on
and 15 youre go for pyro arm
roger
and 15 we need direct rcs on please
okay directs are on
and 15 3 minutes to jei and were wait  were watching for pyro arm
okay were preceding through the prejett check list at this time and well get right to you 07 ll b0 17 cmp and its away clean houston 07 ll bo 19 cc roger copy hope you let her go gently she was a nice one
oh she was at that
houston 15 question on the separation maneuver do you want us to burn the residuals in p41 or  just make a 1footpersecond burn
roger dave terry burn them in p41 please
roger
you understand thats burn the residuals right
just  just making  just making sure
houston p41 says 710ths forward
yes 7loths forward 710ths up
roger dave
and forward takes us right back to the lm  07 11 33 42 cc stand by dave were looking into that of course
okay we got about a minute and 15 seconds or so
roger
average g is on  07 11 34 50 cc ah hold the burn dave
okay well hold the burn
15 this is houston wed like to have visual reference relative to your position to the lm wed like you behind the lm and well give you a burn attitude for 5 minutes from now
roger okay i guess shes about 150 feet dead ahead
okay copy dave thanks
and dave can you verify were you behind in local vertical or body attitude coordinates
well give us a little while to figure that one out
roger are you behind it in the orbit or are you just  is it just sitting there in front of you as you look at it
its sitting in front of us when we sit there and look at it 07 ll 38 41 c2p bob were almost directly radially inward from the lm right now
copy that
houston our attitude is 150 degrees relative to the local horizontal
say that again please dave
roger our attitude according to verb 83 down there is 150 degrees relative to the local horizontal which means were  i guess fairly close to local horizontal at least within 30 degrees
stand by s confusion still reigns i think
roger understand
15 do you have an ordeal ball going at the moment
sure do and its on the dsky you can see it right down there
thank you tape 1167
roger dave we would like you to do a vfr burn which means go  maneuver to a trailing position  and fire i foot per second retrograde understand
that sounds like a good burn roger well do that
houston 15 this ought to make for some interest ing discussion but i guess what you want us to do is point at him and burn aft to i foot per second is that correct
roger dave thats probably the best way to keep an eye on him
well were having a toh time doing that because hes right in the sun right now
but houston i think at this attitude of i foot  per second aft will give us sufficient clearance don t you
as long as youre trailing him dave i guess right now we cant give you any sound advice down here
okay well if we burn i foot per second on the local horizontal which we are 81most on right now i think that will put us in an orbit which re  remains clear from it
okay houston as far as trailing goes right now as we look over the ground were leading him
roger thats our  
were about on a horizontal in front of him
roger we need you behind him dave that  we were gradually coming to that conclusion that was the only way you could have him in the sun we need you behind him and then a firing of retrograde
yes thats going to take an awful lot because  were a fair ways out now and well have to maneuver quite a ways to get behind him itll take quite a while and a little bit of gas
roger dave understand that stand by
okay dave how about 2 foot per second posigrade as long as youre in front of him understand two foot per second posigrade
okay so thatll be a minus x deltav for 2 feet per second at our present attitude right
roger thats affirm dave
okay were all on the same frequency well do that
okay houston we put in 2 feet per second aft and that was done just at local horizontal
roger copy thank you
and 15 if you can anticipate why dont you give me a call when you get yourself partially powered down from this then well read you some flight plan updates which are mostly just the deletion of activities so you can get to bed
okay houston appreciate that thank you and well call you back
15 houston you got a moment for this update
just a minute bob 07 ll 56 06 i24p okay bob what changes do you have for us
okay these will start out in the flight plan here and after lm je2wed like you to proceed with the activities that run on the original flight plan from 17730 through 17801 so that last  entry that we will be doing will be the line that says xray on at the very top of that next page after that  during that though we will delete at 17753 the line that says mapping cameralaser experiment covers open talkbaek barber pole then off center its the second line in the block at the bottom you got that 07 11 56 56  okay understand well delete that particular line mapping cameralaser experiment off and well do all the activities up to  through 178 there the mass spec xray on
roger and at the  on that same page beginning at 17820 to 17830 we will scratch that particu lar  that whole block of items and going along with that at 17839 it says dac on we will also scratch that over
roger understand we will scratch the activities from 17820 to 17830 and at 17839 well scratch dac on how about the activity there at 178317 we  guess well do that huh
roger 17831 that mass spec multiple low discriminator high ion source on will be done 30 minutes  three zero minutes after the mass spec experiment on ion source to standby which is over there at 17801 other words we need a bominute delay between the top item on the left hand column and the top item on the righthand coll
okay we understand
okay well delete the pan camera activities over on 179 hours theres one at a hundred  15 if you read  theres one item at 17916 and another item at 17921 that pertain to the pan camera we will delete both of those 07 11 59 02 imp okay understand delete the pan cameras at 17918 and 17921
roger copy and when youre ready to sleep i  guess you can start with the systems checklist  presleep checklist at 17931 there
okay thank you bob 07 ll 59 2h cc and you noticed we didnt delete the eat period 07 11 59 32  thark you
and  and jim do you guys want a tei58 pad 07 ll 59 52  okay well take one
okay if you got  have you got the pad out
no stand by
give me a call
okay
okay jim understand you have the pad spsgn 36363 plus 061 plus 093 192133330 plus 27997 plus 06095 minus 00980 181 ll2 015 rest of the pad na ullage 4 jet 12 seconds over

roger jim except its tei58 07 12 o1 41 imp roger its 58
okay jim and while we got you  this is deke id like to have you and dave at least take a seconal here before you go to sleep so you can really power down for the night you gvs need it its up to a1 whether he wants one or not
okay thank you deke 07 12 02 06 ncc roger
15 houston we have a correction to that update if youd get the flight plan back out please 07 12 03 47 imp okay go ahead
roger that item 17830 on the ms spec the discriminator value there should be low copy
roger understand discriminator low
thank you jim
apollo 15 houston youre about i minute until los sleep tight

go ahead 15
okay were just about getting bedded down here bob i wanted to check and clarify one thing with you before we did
please do
okay the flight plan updates that you gave to jim a little while  earlier included mass spec experiment on and some switching with the dis criminator and multiplier now as of yesterday we had decided not to use the mass spec because of boom deploy problems has somebody decided that we now should deploy the boom
roger my understanding is that we didnt want to do it before the plane change because we might have to jettison it and its  now that weve got the plane change accomplished well run it and if you have to jettison before tei well do that over 07 lb 16 9 cmp okay i understand i guess i didnt understand that yesterday and well go ahead and deploy it and get the mass  mass spec going now
roger al and one more thing wed like to make sure tonight that jim is on the ekg for the  evening
thats affirm jim will stay on the biomed tonight
roger and one more thing al we would like to verify high gain antenna angles are pitch 25 yaw 185
right thats what theyre set on now bob 07 lb 17 28 cc okay we had a long while picking you up i guess we were a little worried there
no we just got our signals crossed in here and we had some different numbers on them before so i got them were fixed up now
okay and well be expecting you to be in vhf bistatic later on right
i guess  do you want us to go ahead and do that
yes please al
okay
okay one last little check is optics power is on wed like it off eventually i expect you havent gotten that far yet al
thats affirmative well get it
okay and otherwise you call us we wont call you
okay well call you thank you bob good night
good night

famous last words go ahead
yes hows that for broken promises hey r oso  just came out of the woodwork and was worried because he doesnt have xray and gmm rays and all those on yet either id assume you probably have  just havent done any of that block right
yes hey bob were still trying to get cleaned up in here and get suits put away and all that sort of stuff well get with it as soon as we can but its awfully cramped quarters and theres an awful lot of stuff to move around
roger we were afraid youd get use to the luxury of all that space
i kind of liked it here by myself
this tme ill keep my promise
okay apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription 07 14 29  begin lunar rev 54
houston 15 i
15 go ahead
is it time to get up yet bob
roger weve got about 15 updates here for you if you want to get ready in the sim bay
thought wed give you a crew status report and the onboard readouts before we called it a night i just wnted to check and make sure we got every thing turned on for you
roger well get the guys looking at that   f 07 14 55 50 cmp  the mass spec out okay bob we got the mass spec out and i think weve cleaned up everything else for you for tonight and ill give you the readings here and then well call it a night
roger were listening and i hope everybody else down here will be getting with me so we can give it to you at the end if anybody wants anything go ahead
okay the prds 25023 23174 08029

and we are configured for the bistatic radar test
al that should be bistatie vhf
thats correct bob the bistatie vhf radar test
and can you think of anything else that needs to be done
stand by al
okay
okay three verifies for you al can you verify the gamma rays out the xray is ready and we need a verify on jim for his ekg
okay houston hes not hooked up yet but will be shortly and well verify the gamma ray out and on and the xray on
thank you
and al were working a state vector uplink for you stand by a minute and well get a decision on that
okay rob i guess we didnt have the gamma ray out so its going out now
roger thats a verify i guess
and the xray is on
thank you
okay the xray is on seems like we had quite a few loose ends tonight
and al how about a verify on xray covers open
roger thats verified its open
thank you were still discussing the vector here
okay
if you can give us p00 and accept well have a load in about a minute stand by just accept  
okay
  sorry
do you want po0
negative accept only
okay ill leave it p20
swinging  07 15 02 37 cc okay and 15 you can have block back again good show thanks for the patience this evening and karl will wake you when he wakes you and not a moment before good night
okay that sounds like a winner bob good night 07 15 lh 52 cc apollo 15 houston
houston 15 go ahead
roger this isnt karl waking you up but we dont show the mass spec experiment to on and if the out  outgassing has been completed we need the i0n source on over
okay weve got it on and its been on for about 45 minutes now and we now have multiplier low and discriminator low
beautiful al
stand by on that bob stand by
standing by
okay bob we got it now
understand you got experiment on now  
 it should be on now

hello houston apollo 15
good morning alfredo this is houston
good morning dr joe how are you
couldnt be better al hows it going
just fine joe you all talked out
no sir just getting ready to start and pleased to have a chance to talk to you
very 
ive got all kinds of things for you al when r you  
very good joe glad to be taling to you
okay ive got all kinds of things for you which i can start handing it up to you at your conven ience pretty much were going to change the flight plan around a little bit  primarily lifting out things because of our getting a somewhat later start than normal and a couple of other minor modifications i also have a lot of news to read to you and some other good things you might be interested in over
okay joe lets  why dont you give me a couple of minutes here to get some pens and the flight plan out and  and in about 5 or l0 minutes or so ill have the guys put the headsets on and well all listen to the news 08 00 46 bo cc al out of curiosity is everybody awake up there 08 00 46 b7 cmp yes man 08 o0 46 b9 cc good morning davy    r
yes joe sure are were just in the middle of breakfast
hello joe how are you
weli im fine drhow are you today 08 00 46 50  morning joe
oh were in great shape hey you sure did a fine job for us down there joe jim and id like to really thank you that was a superfine job of taking care of everything for us
i think the superfine job is the two of you it was just most remarkable everybody down here is still fl0ating so high theyre havlng a hard time getting down to all that data you gave us and youll be interested to know that  that we have sitting in front of us a preliminary report from each eva of the geology of the area that i would say is more complete than our 90day preliminary reports which  were issued on some of our other landings its just most exciting
well its because youve got the real professional backroom there those  those guys really know how to put  put it together especially with the way they were coming up with the new ideas while we were on the surface that was really neat
and dave i do have to ask you one question is there a threeunit segment of deep core stems some place in that command module apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
joe we wouldnt lose sight of that for all the tea in china thats number i priority
yes sir
oh as a matter of fact joe we made a good thor ough search of the lm before we let it go we went from top to bottom to make sure we got everything and im sure we got everything we brought up off the surface and im pretty sure we did  did fairly well cleaning up the surface
okay dave good news good news al if youre ready ill start hitting you with a few things were interested in knowing from you right away and then when we get those ill give you the gen eral plan for the day and i think in some cases well want to just talk you through some of the changes while youre mking your frontside pass theres no need to feed up all the data in detail to you at the beginning here my first question we need from you a configuration of panel 230 particularly  in fact only really the mass spec switches could you  call out the settings for the mass spec experiment switch ion source switch multiplier switch and discriminator switch please
okay joe im right there experiment is up and on ion source is centered the discriminator is low and the multiplier is low
okay thank you thats  thats what wed guessed and al i  i guess the first thing we want  were going to want you to do today is to start to get ready to go plusx forward p20 option 5 were  going to want you to retract the mass spec boom and close the xray and alpha particle cover
okay joe well do all that how about putting it on a  on a time basis for me so i can write it in the flight plan  08 o0 50 44 cc okay real fine you can start that right now at  just put it in at 19252 i guess and also right after that list fuel cell purge h20 dump and lioh canister change
okay joe understand you want us to go ahead into plusx p20 sim bay attitude and pull in the mass spec and the gamm ray booms and i guess turn off the mass  turn the mass spec to standby
al let me hit you with that last statement again we want you to retract the mass spectrometer boom but not the gamma ray and close the xray and alpha particle covers retract mass spec boom and close two covers over
okay understand you want us to pull in  to retract the mass spec boom and close the xray alpha covers then do the fuel cell purge the water dump and canister change
thats affirm
okay joe ill get that in work
and one more item you can start to charge bat b  at your convenience
okay
okay and looking downstream here as soon as you get turned around and these other good things done were going to ask you to open the xray and alpha particle covers and for rev 60 the agenda calls for an eat period for you and gamma ray xray and alpha particle data being taken during that time sounds like youve got your eat period pretty well out of the way
yes thats right joe
houston 15
go ahead al
okay joe while were maneuvered here to a plusx forward how about reading some news to us
okay sure will let me  let me begin with just a note on that water dump itll take about 15 minutes to run and theyre interested in your dumping it to close to l0 percent onboard reading over
roger understand probably the same as weve been doing before we dump down to l0 percent but not below l0 percent
thats correct and ive got several things to read to you here i have the official morning gold bugle zeitung report and  that comes from two rows behind me here and ive also got a telegram for you jim and i have some history  a little bit of history thats been researched for you by the people at honeysuckle concerning a small problem with a leak on the endeavour about 200 years ago and ill start with whatever youd like to hear first
okay joe go ahead
okay let me just start with the mornings news the weather report in houstongalveston area calls  for showers and thundershowers through wednesday todays temperatures will be in the lower 70s and upper 80s 08 00 58 2 cc the united states will support communist chinas amission to the united nations this fall secre tary of state william rogers announced the us will also fight against expelling the nationalist chinese government on taiwan us steel the in dustry pace setter announced a price hike averaging 8 percent on virtually all its products and several other companies followed suit as an aftermath of a new 3year labor contract trainmen won pay in creases of nearly a dollar and a half an hour spread over a 42 months in a nationwide contract settle ment and called off their crippling strike against l0 railroads the union yielded on the railroads demands for some workrule changes yet to be worked  out among those viewing apollo 15 activities monday in the mocr was artist robert mccall de signer of the commemorative stamp for apollo 15 and just an edited note here he was also making sketches of the scenes down here as he saw them and he would turn them out almost as fast as the photog rapher would take pictures that was most interest  lng turning to the sporting news don wilson  pitched a twohitter and jesus alou drove home the  winning run and then made a gamesaving catch as i the houston astros downed the chicago cubs 2 to 1 f and apparently rain is slowing up the oilers s preparations for the giants the oilers  giant exhibition game is scheduled for monday night in the astrodome and ive got the mondays baseball scoreboard  which ill run through quickly for you baseball fans in the american league boston 7 baltimore 4 new york 7 cleveland 0 oakland 2 kansas city l chicago 7 minnesota 5 detroit ll washington 7 california 3 milwaukee 1 read back

and ill go over now to  jim a special telegram for you which reads essentially mother dad and your brother charles are proud of you we were thinking of our trip together on top of mount whitney and we are with you in spirit on the moon love mother dad and your crew and i might add that there  an occasional piece of mail for all of you that is starting  is starting to come in to the manned spacecraft center here in fact i think a truck pulled up there yesterday to deliver some of the first
im going to go on if youre still listening to read some history that was sent to us by the honey suckle people and the subject is a leak on the endeavour at 62 hundred get following the above incident and the wonder from the apollo 15 crew whether captain cooks endeavour had ever sprung a leak the staff at honeysuckle creek tracking station has searched the records and come up with  the following incident which may be of interest information has been extracted from an old news paper article and an entry in captain cooks log book it was ll pm on june ll 1770 a clear moonlit night when his majestys ship endeavour under the command of captain james cook sailed serenely under fully furled sail within the waters of the great barrier reef off australias northeast coast then disaster struck the ship had got up on the edge of a reef of coral rocks which lay to the northwest of sic having come in places sic run the ship 3 or 4 fathoms and in others about as mny feet and im quoting james cooks diary here but about a hundred feet from her star board side she laying with her head to the north east were 7 8 and 10 fathoms with a grind and a roar the endeavour rose in the bow and came down hard empty water casks broke their lashings f and lay in a tangle with the rigging on the deck the captain clad only in drawers which i guess is a constant wear garment rushed on deck he snmmoned all hands to the pumps and ordered all unnecessary stores to be thrown overboard such items as iron and stone ballast from deep in the hole casks hoops stays oil jars decayed store and then six cannons which fired 4point shot probably one cannon to fire long one cannon to fire short and two to fire for effect these in fact are the cannons discovered in 1969 off the coast of northeastern australia by a team from the philadelphia academy of natural science and after restoration one each was presented by the australian  to  by the australian government to the us british and to new zealand the remain ing three cannons are in australia the original endeavour was finally freed from the reef by means  of oakum and wool wrapped in a sail being sunk under the ship and plugged into the hole in hope that it would be sucked into the leak and would close the leak the experiment was entirely suc cessful and i quote again from cooks diary in about a quarter of an hour to our great surprise the ship was pumped dry and upon letting the pumps stand she was found to make very little water  subsequently the endeavour arrived at the austra lian mainland the landing place is now called cooktown by the way and after two months the damage had been repaired and the ship returned to england and thats the end of your history lesson for today over
thats quite an analogy isnt it
quite an analogy dave certainly is back to reality al i have a csm consumables update for you if youre interested in that and lets see  the other item on my desk  well ill get to it a little later ill be standing by for your go ahead on the csm conslmable update
okay stand by joe  08 o1 07 b6 cmp houston 15 im ready to copy the consumables joe
okay alfredo get 191 plus 25 rcs total 47 quad a 50 47 46 47 h2 tank l 56 5b 42 02 tank l 64 67 54
roger understand joe at 19125 rcs total 47 quad a 50 47 46 47 h2 is 56 5b 42 02 is 64 67 54
copy al and ill be right back
okay joe 08 o1 09 b7 cc endeavour this is houston again
go ahead houston
okay al let me lay some more words on you con cerning your flight plan when youre  youre ready to talk about that
roger joe go ahead
okay youll be in the configuration plusx for ward and will be taking gmma ray xray and alpha particle data data during rev 60 we want you to do at 19b plus 45 a p52 option 3 and were going to add a map and pan camera pass sometime during rev 60 and ill be coming at you with the necessary data for that also 
roger joe understand
okay al now i guess a  a word about biomed configuration today in order to get some very interesting baseline data medical data on you al  and jim for your eva coming up later  were requesting that the two of you give us that biomed data today i think dave you were scheduled for it but i guess wed prefer jim on the line with a1 to get baseline data for later now al let  let me run through in just some blocks here the next revs as we see them and the approximate activ ities and then ill come up with specific data concerning those revs later on perhaps actually during the revs on rev 61 were going to have the uv  
 that
okay on rev 61 will be uv photography of the lunar mare were coming up on i guess an hour of light flash experiments and its pretty much dealers choice between dave and jim who  which ever one of you would like to do that rev 62 will be a crew exercise period science photos and science visuals and well be taking the mapping camera and laser altimeter data during rev 62 and it will end with terminator photos on rev 63 more mpping camera laser altimeter and a burst of the pan camera uv photos and terminator photos again rev 64 will be eat period boom photos lioh canister change and that brings us to about 204 hours and itll be time to go to bed again over

mapping camera standby please 08 07 32 lb cdr roger standby
laser altimeter off please
apollo 15 houston if you have a chance wed like to tlk to dave and jim about this lcg con nector problem sometime 08 07 b4 37 cdr okay stand by
and auto on high gain please
auto
houston 15 go 08 07 b5 09 cc 15 two questions wed like to ask first ones specific and that is if you noticed anything about the connector between the lcg and the suit when you took it out in order to put the plugs in yesterday afternoon was it already out was it loose was it not lock  locked or what and secondly a general question building up from this can you tell us anything  any insights you ac quired in taking the suits off and looking at the connector or just in general about what this problem may have been caused by
well i guess  i guess our first indication was lack of a good integrity check as a matter of fact we couldnt get much more than about a pound in the suit and the first  in thinking it over we  we thought the only thing it could be would be those connectors because that was the on  only semiopen port even though it shouldnt  shouldnt be leaking and everybody checked their helmet and gloves and they appeared to be locked so we broke open the helmet and gloves and jim reached in through my zipper and pulled out the lcg connector and stuck in the plug and  then we rezipped or i did jim rezipped me and we tried another integrity check and it  worked okay i guess beyond that  i dont have any explanation for it other than the only pos sibility is that the lcg connector was leaking or that somebodys glove or helmet was leaking be cause the suits have been as you know very tight all the way through
roger did jim notice when you  when jim took out your connector there to put the plug in did he notice it as being loose unattached or  not locklocked did he have any  could he tell any of that just reaching in with his fingers
bob this is jim the locklock was engaged on that water connector on daves suit
okay copy and do we understand that daves suit was the only one that did not pass the integrity check that first time around
no you cant isolate it the whole suit circuit is the integrity check its spacecraft plus three suits so theres no way to tell
roger but on  what i mean is that you did not put  did you put plugs in jims suit too or just in daves suit 08 07 37 50  no only  only in one suit but we did go through the operation of taking off helmets and gloves which also may have been the problem
roger copy that
in  in other words there may have  even though we checked the locklocks on the helmets and gloves why somebody could have had a cocked one and  and missed it these  es  especially the  the surface equipment was  had an  an awful lot of lunar dust on it and it was sort of hard to work were  were going to get them cleaned up before the eva but after three runs down there why the connectors were getting pretty tough to work even though we did lubricate them
roger copy i dont think we have anything else dave we noticed you did seem to have some trouble getting a suit integrity check the second time around also is that right
yes there was a glove that wasnt locked
okay guess that was c the loop thanks
i think the suit circuits tight i think that just might have been one of those things because the last one we ran was real good it  the flow dropped down to like 6 or 710ths i guess and it would have stayed there all day long i think weve got a good suit loop but  im not worried about that at all just a matter of getting all the connectors cleaned up so they all work well and insuring that everybody gets a good locklock
roger dave we agree too i  it seems to us that that sounds like it was just one of those situations we run a suit integrity check for
roger thats exactly right
and 15 houston you are go for los
thank you very much houston apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription 08 08 12  begin lunar rev 63
endeavour this is houston over
hello houston this is endeavour
roger we got the usual flight plan updates if youll get a flight plan out and copy them in please 08 08 46 37 cnp okay stand by 1
okay and if someone could give us high gain antenna to auto wed appreciate it
go ahead with the update
okay first oe is the uv photo plan  pad at 20105 in the flight plan the tstart for that will be 201ll19 over
understand uv tstart 201ll19
roger next at 20120 we will delete pcm cable
okay got that
roger at 20230 its discriminator low in that line on the mass spec
okay discriminator low at 20230
roger at 20321 we will delete laser altimeter off
understand delete laser altimeter off at 20321 and lets hold up on the rest for now
and 15 30 seconds to pan camera mono
hey go with the rest of the updates bob
okay at 20323 well delete the apping camera track retract talkback barber pole 4 minutes gray then off center  that whole line
okay thats deleted next
and we want pan camera mono please
its there
roger sorry
okay 20327 well delete mapping cameralaser experiment covers closed talkback barber pole gray then off center et cetera that whole line there 20327
okay next
okay now we have here a little test the guys down here would like to run with the laser to see if we can zap it a little bit and rejuvenate it perhaps the first step is back on 20130 we will delete the laser altimeter off and apping coverlaser altimeter cover close at 201 plus 30 over
are you making an update to the update
stand by here stand by a minute
okay i didnt exactly find that one
yes stand by i got to check with oso
okay 15 we got a clarification on that the laser altimeter off is at 20130 the mapping cameralaser altimeter cover close is called out at 20132 and we want to delete both of those
stand by bob were taking pictures well come back to you
yes give me a call
and 30 seconds to pan camera stereo
okay houston 15 go ahead with some updates if youve got them
okay al did you copy what were doing is were changing that update deleting the laser altimeter off at 20130 and then were also deleting at 20132 the callout to close the mapping camera laser altimeter covers over
okay i understand at 20130 you want the laser altimeter left on and the mapping camera left out and the covers open
thats affirmative okay now after the mappino  
is that what you want
thats affirmative and now after the mapping camera is off at 20130 we want to cycle the laser switch off for i second then on for 15 sec onds off for i second on for 15 seconds et cetera for 20 cycles and after 20 cycles we will leave the laser altimeter on for mefn analysis over 08 08 57 08 cml okay understand you want at 20130  you want to cycle the laser altimeter off for i second and on 15 seconds for 20 seconds  for 20 cycles and then leave it turned on
thats roger and well get back to you at that point
okay
and thats all we have for right now al
roger
and al 30 seconds to pan camera standby power off
and 15 we verify the pan camera lens is stowed when convenient we d like battery b charge  battery bravo charge terminated
understand b terminated
and endeavour houston one more request please
go ahead bob
roger since we dont have the pcm cable wed like to  for these uv photos  to have you give us a mark each time you press the shutter button please on the airtoground
okay if youd like
houston 15
go ahead go ahead 15
okay bob would you like me to hook up the pcm cable to it
well the word that i was given down here was that you couldnt reach with the pcm cable
no were taking  were taking the pictures out of window 5 and thats where the scientific in strument outlet is
stand by 15 if you can do that thats fine
okay ill tell you what bob ill go ahead and hook up the pcm cable and  and you tell me if youre getting a signal down there after i start taking pictures
okay
and the word you got on it was  was correct it looks like window 5 is about the only window that can be used for the pcm cable
roger
and endeavour we wont be able to see that pcm real time but we ll just assume that its coming down if youve got the pcm cable hooked up
okay bob i got it hooked up
thirty seconds to uv photos
okay thank you
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay bob when i took the  the shade out of window 5 window 5 still appears very clean
copy
and endeavour two questions if youve got a chance between now and terminator photo
say again on the terminator photos bob
roger do you have time for a couple of questions between now and the start of the terminator photos  08 09 19 34 cmp yes sure go ahead
roger first any comments on the mass spec boom retraction you did a half hour ago
no no comments on it and  i guess were back to the position we were in before that the thing is sort of half barber pole and when i go back out with it  fiddle with it a little bit the barber pole goes full up and then comes down about halfway again
okay we copy
and thats where it stands right now
okay second question  
i played with it for a while and then got busy in other things but ill continue  ill continue working on it
copy al second question do you want me to con tinue giving the  you these realtime marks on air  airtoground just before and after various camera passes tape1bo6
yes i like the reminder bob
okay 30 seconds  
dont expect an answer ill probably be busy doing it
hopefully thirty seconds a good time
roger
and houston 15
go ahead 15 go ahead
okay for your info the mass spec took about  oh maybe seven or eight cycles this time before it came all the way in and the same operation as before
roger copy it took you seven or eight cycles to get it all the way in
thirty seconds the terminator photo start
terminator photo stop
roger bob
mapping camera off ·
and endeavour houston be advised wed like  accurate 15 seconds on i second off no more than 16 or 17 seconds on
roger understand
and 15 roger thank you unfortunately like  everything else the laser didnt do much good wed like now mapping camera to standby laser altiier off then well do the retract and door close over
okay bob well go mapping camera off and laser off
we need mapping camera standby please
roger standby and image motion off and laser altimeter off and retracting the  retracting the camera now
copy
and endeavour houston over
go ahead
roger al if you could get us a filmbudget status on the backside to give us when you come around wed appreciate it and except for that you re go for los
all righty thank you sir and well see if we can conjure one up for you f
good enough apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription 08 l0 l0  begin lunar rev 64
and endeavour houston over
houston endeavour go
roger if you  roger if you guys give us an accept well send you up a state vector and time uplink
roger youve got it
copy and if you fellows will give me a call in the middle of your eating there when youve got time well do some talking at you
okay give us about 5 minutes here
okay f
and 15 its your computer over 08 l0 4b 23 cdr roger
houston endeavour were ready to chittychat if you like
okay while you guys are eating your supper there it might be  good time to get a report on your food so far hows it been going
oh i think we have consumed every meal as planned and weve made a pretty good cut into the pantry
youve made a pretty good cut into the pantry you say  08 l0 44 17 cdr roger that extra little box over there with extra little goodies
okay and can you gbs give us any estimates on the water that you and jim consumed on the surface say in the lm and on the eva and any differences between this and what als been consuming tap 1312 pg1300 08 0 44 39 cdr not without sitting down and doing some thinking about it well be glad to do that if you like
roger if thats not too much trouble i guess we could start out by some estimate as to how much you guys were drinking in the lm and on the eva was the drink bag adequate or what
oh i think that is probably a good discussion for the debriefing after the flight
okay sounds like you are at least eating and drinking a lot so far we are anxious for you all to continue eating and drinking well because of the eva yet to come
oh okay well if thats your  your interest yes we  we consumed quite a bit of water on the surface and we were quite satisfied with what we had we had plenty and weve been eating and drinking a lot up here i think everybody is in fine shape and ready to take care of what is on  on the flight plan the rest of the way
sounds good one other specific point wed like to clear up dave which i guess was a little muddled this morning did you and jim take a seconal last night or not
no theres been no medication taken by anybody on the flight
okay however i  we down here would like to recommend for all three of you to take one tonight just to make sure we get another good nights sleep
i think thats unnecessary
well thats our recommendation anyway and can you tell us who plans to sensor up tonight dave 
okay roger i guess as per our agreement this morning why  youll get a cmp and an i24ptonight
roger understand and then well press on with the normal flight plan tomorrow and al wed like to have you  you wear the lightweight headset tonight because then wed like to wake just a1 up on schedule so he can do us a p20 to  give us some plusx time on the mass spec and so wed like to  arrange it that way if its conven ient with you guys
no i dont think thats practical bob you cant have one person awake in here and the other two sleeping it  just cant do it
okay understand and to avoid what we had last night with all those last minute calls again and again and again why dont you guys give us a final call just before youre ready to go to sleep well get a final status down here and then we wont  we wont have to keep calling back tonight
oh thats a good idea all right well do that
it got a little embarrassing down here after a while
oh aw thats okay yesterday was a long day
roge that and we got a tei 69 pad down here when jims ready to copy and were also ready to copy some torquing angles from that p52 if you got them and wed like you to leave your high gain antenna at plus 25 and 185 on yaw and in narrow and reacquire as you go around the corner this time
oh okay you want narrow reacquire and plus 25 and 185 well do that if youre ready to copy ive got the p52
roger ill copy that now
okay noun 05 was 01 noun 93 was plus07 minus 47 minus 05 they were torqued out at 2020030
roger copy o1 plus 07 minus 47 minus 05 and 2020030
roger thats cricket
and dave wed like optic zero at this time piease
oh yes optic zero hey by the way i  i should have said 007 pardon me i had nf decimal point in the wrong spot
understand 007 and was the  
just  just put a zero in front of all  the three torquing numbers the  the platform is too good and the numbers are so small we  were not even thinking in three digits anymore
okay we got 007 047 and 005 understand
thats correct

roger and just below that the msfn verify len  lens tuck in and also the pan camera power off delete both of those
roger copy the next two deletions also go
at 214 plus 02 we want to change that camera configuration to the 250millimeter lens 250 the fstop should be 56 the exposure time should be i over 125

roger at 214 plus ll if ion source off 5 min utes mass spectrometer boom retract 08 20 33 lb cc 15 wed like high gain auto
okay at 21411 if ion off for 5 minutes mass spec boom retract go
at 214 plus 12 we add mapping cameralaser experiment covers open mapping camera track extend mapping camera image motion on
okay 21412 maplaser experiment open map track extend and image motion on
roger at 214 plus 16 we change the el on to  tstop minus 140 to tstart 140 simply change stop to start
roger stop to start go
and at 214 plus 17 again change stop to start and at that time also add laser altimeter on
okay 21417 stop to start and laser altimeter on go
and at 214 plus 18 change mapping camera on off to mapping camer on on in other words change off to on add parenthesis tstart delete the next line mapping camera  delete mapping camera on to standby and the third line change mapping camera image motion off to mapping camera image motion increase barber pole plus four stepson
okay 21418 map camera image motion increase barber pole plus four stepson
roger and did you get the mapping camera  mapping camera on on tstart
oh roger map camera onon tstart and scratch the map camera on to standby  08 20 36 14 cc roger that takes care of ali the  ail the updates required for the next rev
roger understand thank you
15 this is houston a couple of comments and then a  one change in your gc checklist the comments are as follows as you will note from the consumables update we now have singletank capabil ity at the 40amp level and concerning the mass spectrometer boom problem it appears to us that this is temperatureassociated problem and the next time you retract the mass spectrometer boom we suggest that you retract it only once for 4 minutes and if it hasnt gone gray just leave it there there is no need to go in and out until it turns gray that wont be a critical problem until we come closer to a burn f
okay i understand just retract it for 4 minutes and leave it there okay
thats right and has somebody got a gc checklist there on page 94
okay stand by well pull it out
ail right ive got page 94 go ahead
ail right wed like to correct one of the short  burn constants and its in collmn d row 5 the number should be changed from i  01605  it should be changed to 01614
say again the location
its column delta row 5
okay ive got it now im sorry i thought you said b bravo how about reading the number again pleas e
roger the correct number is 01614
okay 01614 by 01605
thats correct
and whenever somebody tells me hes ready to stop breakfast and copy a pad i have tei71 and also a mapping camera photo pad
all right stand by l please probably be a couple minutes
righto
okay karl im ready to copy the tei pad

yaw trim was plus 098  page 1315
thats all correct thank you and the last bit of information i have down here is a mapping camera photo pad at 214 plus  
okay go ahead
roger its at 214 plus 20 in your flight plan and there is no slot for it youll just have to stick it in mapping camera start 2142003 stop 2151949 08 20 46 43  copy 2142003 and 2151949
thats correct
15 this is houston with just a passing comment to dave we have lee silvers and jim head in the back room available for any questions or comments concerning the lunar surface activities that youd like to make is there anything on your mind youd like to discuss with them
well it shouldnt take more than about a couple of weeks i guess if we started now i guess we got a lot to discuss with them weve talked it over a little bit and weve come to some con clusions about rilles and mountains and those sort of things and i  i guess rather than get into the details now we probably ought to wait until the debriefing if they have any questions for us wed be happy to answer
okay its my understanding that they didnt  you  you gave them so much data they didnt really have any questions left but stand by ill see if they  if they come up with some after youve invited them to joe says hey they just might have  
okay
  something so stand by
yes thats right ive never seen the day yet when those two didnt have some questions  08 20 49 47 cc you opened yourself up there dave
yes thats good were ready
15 this is houston
go ahead karl
lee and jim are sitting right beside me here and their comment is they  they dont really want to ask very many questions and perturb the debriefing a week from now but they do just have a couple and the first one  the first one concerns a unique crater close to scarp that you described as having about a 40meter diameter with a very soft rim and the texture of the material in it was  instead of being fine angular fragments was more in the form of clods theyd like to know a little bit more if  if possible about its location relative to scarp and any other comments you can make about the unique  the particular uniqueness of this crater
okay stand by 1
okay houston i guess our answer to that is that we had interpreted that particular crater as being scarp perhaps it wasnt perhaps we were near scarp and that was a somewhat smaller crater but i guess as we remember it that was the one we had called scarp and it was i believe the only crater we really sampled as we approached rim crater in the terrace there and that particular crater had very soft rims  extremely soft and all the frag ments  the apparent fragments were very frangible they just fell apart like dirt clods and we did sample some and we had a discussion i think at the time and  and i guess we still dont exactly agree relative to the amount of glass that was present in the fragments jim seems to think there was a fair amount and i  i dont remember any in  particular but it was a fairly uniform crater and all the debris around the crater  as i remem ber there was something like 20 percent or so of angular frags  all of it apparently would break apart very easy and there were no solid fragments that we could see or distinguish of course every thing is covered by dust and we did sample some and i guess thats about the size  the size of it is there anything more specific youd be interested in
dave this particular crater sounds more and more interesting to the people down here and i guess  the next question is what  was there anything about the crater its shape or anything else that would lead you to think it had a different origin than most of the other impact craters
no it  its depthtodiameter ratio was about par for the  for the course up there and it had a slightly raised rim and the rim may have been somewhat higher than  than others but i wouldnt be able to distinguish that specifically it  it was a rather standardappearing crater until we walked up onto the rim and it was extremely soft and of course we only sampled one edge of the rim there we didnt get any circumferential sampling on it so it might have been a  a unique part but it looked pretty uniform all the way around  08 20 59 21 cc roger
and we did get the appropriate photographs plus a pan at that site which i think when we go over during the debriefing  perhaps we can extract some more of what we saw as you remember at that particular time we were pretty well hustling and we didnt have a chance to do much looking at the maps as we got there
they say thats great thanks a lot
okay anything else
hey dave youve done a lovely job you just dont know how were jumping up and down down here
well thats because i happened to have had a very good professor
a whole bunch of them dave
thats right as a matter of fact so many of them its just hard to  hard to remember it all but we sure appreciate all you all did for us in getting us ready for this thing and ill tell you i think jim and i both felt quite comfortable when we got there about looking around and  and seeing things i just wish we had had more time because believe me there is an awful lot to be seen and done up there
yes we think you defined the first site to be revisited on the moon
well as we go around in lunar orbit here i can look down  and i could just spend weeks and weeks looking and i can pick out any number of superb sites down there which would take you several weeks to analyze on the surface there is just so much here to coin a phrase its mind boggling
beautiful dave thank you so much
yes sir and i hope someday we eau get you all up here too i  i think we really need to have some good professional geologists up here as a matter of fact good professional scientists of all disciplines not only in lunar orbit but right on the surface because you all would just really have a field day where  with your back grounds and what you know theres just so much to be gained up here
great dave thanks a lot

okay i guess when you run out of film you run out of updates
thats about the size of the situation apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription  08 22 47 09 cc 15 houston if youre willing to listen i have about a 3minute update on the morning news
stand by 1 karl
okay houston 15 were ready for the news
roger 15 the flight of apollo 15 is still front page news around the world even yesterdays rela tively quiet activities were noted by most news media the rail strike with the united transpor tation union has ended and 10 railroads that were out of operation for 18 days are back on the tracks growers in california were hardest hit by the strike losing an estimated 45 million dollars in sales and related industries president nixon has asked congress not to allow the use of federal funds to pay for busing school children the administration  also announced that it is appealing a bench mark court ruling against massive busing in the public  in the public schools of austin texas treasury secretary john b connally is attempting to stop a rumored increase in bank interest rates connally said he is distressed to hear reports that bank prime lending rates are to be raised again rates were increased only last month new york stock exchange prices fell yesterday in the second largest decline of the year with the dow jones industrial average dropping almost 15 points analysts say that the decline may have been caused by the rumored increase in interest rates you got up too early to hear much news of last nights baseball games but we can report that the astros lost to the cubs 5 to nothing they did better monday night when they beat the cubs 2 to 1 the weather report from the houston area is one word soggy rain has fallen  off and on for more than 24 hours and there was a long steady rain most of yesterday afternoon going to be a lot of grass cutting to do when you get back down here guys
oh yes but we sure got nice sunny weather up here
no clouds up there huh thats amazing
no its just clear as crystal
thinking about all that sunshine up there remnds me that were in a bind down here about your expo  sure to uv and we recommend that on the several times on the next couple of orbits when youre re quested to take the  the lexan cover off of win dow 5 that you alternate handling that photography to keep under the legal doses
ail right well do that
15 houston the doctors down here with their  with their electrocardiograms see that the cmp  or at least they think the cmp  is on the  the biomed apparatus and according to the flight plan theyd like to have the lmp on
okay we thought wed give you both since you were sort of interested in that yesterday
okay that would be great
15 houston we have a couple of camera pads when you have time to copy
okay stand by a couple of minutes will you please karl
roger
okay karl ill copy those pads for you
roger theyre in the flight plan at 216 the first one is the solar corona photo pad tstart is 2160355 down below the mapping camera photo pad start 2161830 stop 2171815
copied 2160355 2161830 and 217185  15
thats correct
15 houston if youll give us accept well send up a new state vector
roger
15 houston the computer is yours
roger
hey al ive sort of got an itch to hear what the aristarchus region looks like in daylight you got any comments
well ill tell you karl weve all been setting here kind of looking at aristarchus a little bit in awe it looks like probably the most volcanic area that ive seen anywhere on the surface and certainly its just very covered with rilles very  quite deep rilles too some of them schroters valley for instance is a magnificent big rille which looks like its worked  been worked twice of course the large rille and then a smaller rille inside
what about the source of schroters valley  08 23 19 56 cmp several cones  say again
what about the source of schroters valley does it look volcanic
well that whole area in there looks volcanic yes and that certainly comes from  from up on the plateau there i would guess that the cobra head is the source for schroters valley the elevation is  is a little subtle from this  from this vantage point but i  i guess that would be my guess and as far as where the  think weve found something interesting anyway about the  the ends of the rilles particularly around the schroters valley area it looks quite distinctly like the rilles  the  the mouths of the rilles  or the deltas have been covered with rising maria  mare materials  from the lower  from the  from the lower elevation almost as if there was a  a  a rille with a deltalike deposit at one time but then the mare  the elevation of the mare  or the height of the mare came up into the rille far enough to  to cover all that delta area so all you see now is what would look like a  a  a river into a lake whose elevation has increased
ah ha very interesting thought
15 this is houston im turning you over to joe now ill see you on the way home tomorrow
okay karl talk to you tomorrow thanks for coming out so early for us
it was a pleasure believe me

hello houston 15
hello 15 this is houston
okay joe were reading you and we were in reacq and narrow and couldnt seem to pick you up so were back in manual and medium now
okay al we copy that thank you while were thinking about that one weve got a couple of  requests for you here wed like for you to turn on your rcs propellant secondary were expecting a crossover in the d and c quads during the shape ullage and we can i guess use those on now and ive got some small changes to your flight plan when you are ready to copy
okay joe im ready to copy the changes in the flight plan
okay jim i assume youre reading me loud and clear youre still a little bit  have a little noise in the background if you have your flight plan in front of you the first entry is at 217 plus 17 and it is an addition retract map camera the next one is at 217 plus 21 addi tion close map camera and laser experiment covers the third is at 217 plus 58 delete  those two lines 02 heaters three auto 02 heaters i and 2 off those are two deletions another deletion  
okay let me read that back to you joe
okay fine jim
you have 21717 retract the mapping camera at 21721 close map camera and laser covers and then the deletion at 21758 of the 02 heaters three and 02 heaters i and 2
thats correct jim and the next change is  its a deletion at 21802 and that is delete the pcm cable line there and down a couple of inches at 21808 an addition map camera and laser experiment covers to open and extend map camera read back
okay i understand to delete the pcm cable at 21802 and then at 21808 map camera and laser covers open and extend mapping camera
the readback is correct and the next  next change is at 21907 and once again delete the pcm cable line and at 21917 add laser altimeter off close map camera and laser experiment covers and delete map camera extension and the last addi tion that is to say the last change is at 220 plus 05 delete the pcm cable line over
okay i copied 22005 delete the pcm cable and go on back to page 4 before we deleted the pcm cable there at 21907 and at 21917 a new item laser altimeter off close mapping camera and laser experiment covers and then delete the next line  the map camera track to extend
sounds good jim and thats all i have for the moment we do want a verification that all four propellant secondaries are opened on your rcs please
okay thats verified just opened them
okay thank you
endeavour this is houston wed like auto on the high gain please and we show your optics in the cmc mode wed like that zeroed at your conveni ence please

hello endeavour this is houston with photog raphy pads and a tei73 pad when youre ready
okay joe im ready to copy the photo pads
okay jim ive got a map camera photo pad a pan camera pad and a terminator photo pad for you and before i start just a word of ex planation because of your change of trajectory from what we considered a nominal one weve got some details to add to the pad that involve image motion setting changes and exposure changes and ill read those in detail in a moment i just wanted to give you a word of explanation on it the first pad is the map camera photo pad copied at 217 plus 10 and at 217 plus 10 it is tstart 218 plus 16 plus 59 tstop 219 plus 16 plus 44 over 09 00 53 0t imp roger copy 2181659 2191644
thats correct jim and if youll turnthe page now i want you to delete two lines one at 218 plus 35 and that is map camera image motion  increase talkbaek barber pole on delete that and delete the line at 218 plus 55 which read map camera image motion  increase talkback barber pole plus four steps et cetera and in stead put in the instructions at tstart it should be barber pole plus four at 218 plus 39 plus 00 barber pole plus three and at 21849 plus 00barber pole plus four read back please  09 00 54 4g  okay the instructions are that at tstart it should be barber pole plus 4 at 218 plus 39 plus 00 barber pole plus three at 218 plus 49 plus 00 barber pole plus four
thats correct jim and those are your image motion settings and youre to delete the other two imagemotion instructions in the flight plan one at 21835 and the other at 21855 and i know you got that the second   09 00 55 29  yes i made those two deletions
okay the second is the terminator photo pad to copy at 218 plus 07 and it is tstart 218 plus 15 plus 19 over

okay jim right on thk you  09 o1 04 09 cc endeavour this is houston
go ahead joe
roger jim just for your own thinking wed like to advise you that we have reviewed the cue card fk1 for the planechange burn that a1 copied and its update is still valid for your shape burn later on were in the process of going over your eps thrusting procedures on g51 in the checklist and we see very  only very minor changes that well be coming up to you with regarding your burn later on today so i think things are pretty well in hand down here over
okay we copy thank you joe 09 o1 05 lb cc another item regarding that fao wants me to urge you again just to follow the flight plan items  regarding sim bay operation before and er these burns coming up and well get no  well get into no problems at all over 09 o1 05 b5 cmp roger understand 09 o1 28 5b cc endeavour this is houston we have no problems at all as you come up on 5 minutes before los al we do have a question for you if this is a good time to ask it over
yes go ahead joe
roger alfredo were sitting down here wondering if perhaps at sometime over the past few days youve gotten a visual c the mass spectrometer boom and unit and if so has it been possible at all to determine which direction the mass spec might be twisting as you move through the orbit over the mock over 09 o1 29 b7 cmp yes i have seen that joe and ive  havent watched a great deal of twisting and as a matter of fact i was rather surprised that there wasnt more twist than what i observed i may not have picked up the maximum deflection but i only ob served about a  maybe a 5 or 10degree rotation on the end of the boom and as i recall as i was looking at it from inside the spacecraft the rotation was counterclockwise
okay al thats interesting information we dont necessarily expect it to have rotated more but just wondering if you had some good visual data for us and thats excellent another com ment and its more in the way of a reminder during your eva were going to ask you to look very closely at the v over h sensor and the symptoms weve had concerning that sensor down here is as though it has a small crack in the lens or perhaps theres foreign contamination of some kind down in the barrel and were going to ask you to look particularly for either a crack or contamination in the barrel during the eva just wanted to lay that one on you now in case we forgot it later on well most likely remind you of it later on
roger joe i understand that one
endeavour wed like a pro on the p20 now please
okay thats in work joe

and jim i guess those high gain angles are to be applied to the shaping maneuver not the subsat launch
okay
and houston were ready to talk over the proce dures anytime you are now
okay endeavour i guess were ready to start i want to put one final note on the subsat launch wed like for you to reverify for us the talkbacks on the rcs after the launch
okay understand check the rcs talkbacks after the launch we ll do that
okay dave and i guess you might cast an eye up at the  the few  fuei cell  talkbacks as well over
roger
endeavour this is houston ready to tag up with you on the tei procedures and dave i guess were standing by for your recmendation do you want to read through the additions you now have in your p40 sps thrusting checklist or do you want us to go through the changes we want you to have there it looks pretty much exactly like your tli maneuver therere just two changes therere two differences from that i guess over r
okay why dont you give us the two differences and then well read it all back to you to make sure weve got it straight
okay dave that sounds like a good way turn to page g54 and right down at the bottom of the page  
54 go
roger right at the bottom of the page after the two lines sps fueloxidize pressure and pugs balanced add the step cutoff minus 10 seconds circuit breaker sps pilot valve main a to open
okay bottom line on page 54 cutoff minus 10 seconds circuit breaker sps pilot valve main a open
thats correct and turning over a page to 55 you have an addition underneath the normal step which reads circuit breaker sps pitch i and yaw 1 to open your addition reads circuit breaker sps pilot valve main b open and we have still another step to add in there which is circuit breaker ems two of them main a and main b to open and also we would like to delete one step below that the three lines map camera on to off pan camera power to off and smac power to off over
okay on page 55 beneath the addition of cbsp 
 sps pilot valve main b open add cb s two open and then delete the three lines on map camera pan camera and s4acpower below that
thats correct dave and were standing by for the other additions youve made now
okay well go back to the beginning here okay our initial configuration has the addition of both pilot valve circuit breakers open and to verify that both eps group 5 circuit breakers are closed and also on page 51 beneath the cautionwarning test ecb jnction off to verify and the cb ems a and b both closed thats wat we have on 51
okay thats good turn the page
okay on 52 under tvc check and prep second ·f line cb sps10 closed thats ail on 52
roger
page 5b at minus 2 minutes cb sps pilot valve main b closed instead of delta3  deltav thrubt a and b normal
that ts correct
okay and on page 54 at 5 minutes prior to ignition when we get  5 seconds prior to ignition when we get the flashing 99 we deltav thrust a and b to normal after the pro and then on down at ignition if we have a flashing 97 the sps thrust fail cb sps pilot valve a closed and if everything goes according to hoyle why at 5 seconds well close the c  cb sps pilot valve mi  main a and then of course the step you just answered  just added  at the bottom of the page at cutoff minus l0 seconds to close the pilot valve  or to open the pilot valve main a
okay dave thats right on the money
okay and then on 55 we just discussed those two which were a cb sps pilot valve main b open and the ems circuit breakers open
roger dave that sounds good to us
okay and i think weve practiced one of those once before i think well be able to handle that
dave just out of curiosity we know you or a1  
yes
  marked up the cue card for the plane change maneuver and we wonder if youre going to use that markedup card for the shape burn over
no no we wont well use the checklist straight  through on the rest of the burns
okay dave thats fine with us as we know youre aware its a single bank b burn which has been makred correctly onto that cue card
roger yes i guess all  all our burns in orbit are just a straight single bank b
right on thank you
and coming out well have all the ball valves open and all the eyeballs watching
sounds like a good idea
and houston endeavour
go ahead
we were just getting the hoses set up here for the burn and noticed that theres a little bit of water ccming out of the  the blue hose in the suit loop thought you might be interested
okay dave we copy that thank you
roger
not much its just if you put your hand around the nozzle there why you can get some water on it
okay we copy that we think its probably normal but well look into it real closely sounds to me like the endeavour has a few plumbers aboard as well as experts in other things
well by the time this is over i guess we will be plumbers
well all be plumbers davy apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
endeavour youre looking good youre go for the shaping burn
roger go for the shape
okay houston endeavour with a burn status report
go ahead endeavour
okay burn was on time and it was a 3second burn we had about 10 or 11 residual and that was trimmed to 01 minus 02 minus 02 deltav c was minus ll0 fuel 2650 oxidizer 2625
roger dave we copy that 09 05 22 0 cdr and it has us in an orbit of 760 by 543 09 05 22 8 cc sounds just right 09 05 22 5h cdr and very smooth burn
okay dave great and you just gained about 20 more days for our subsatellite something like that
very good
endeavour this is houston youre looking good at ids minus 5 and i have a reminder on your water dump wed like you to monitor it down to l0 percent and well see you on the other side over
roger understand will do 09 05 28 oh cc endeavour this is houston and weve copied your torquing angles
roger thank you houston 09 05 51  begin lunar rev 74
hello endeavour this is houston tape1432
houston endeavour go
roger endeavour were requesting you verify your systems  data systems on and the sband aux switch to science please
okay thats verified now the data systems are on now
okay dave we copy that ive got a map update rev 75 when youre ready to copy and i have a message for a1 from the king when hes ready to copy
go ahead joe
roger al the message to you is to stand by to copy your finalexam grade in orbital science and observation its an alfa plus with a subnote of well done over
tell the king thank you very much joe
roger al and ive got the map update  
and i expect to see him back in houston soon
oh oh no  no problem there
go ahead joe

this is endeavour can you verify the 
  arm and  your rates look good to us down here 0ver
okay you had us all figured out well go free
roger dave
and we know one of you will be watching out the window were particularly interested if the spin of the satellite is sweeping out a cone or if it seett to be a fairly flat spin as it comes out over
roger
endeavour were requesting you go back to auto and do another verb 49 please we see youve drifted off about a degree
in work
okay endeavour were recommending that you go back to free at launch minus i minute 09 06 35 32 ip okay free at launch minus i minute

sounds good jim thank you and im standing by for your call for the flight plan update
go ahead joe ill take that  09 06 48 58 cc okay jim and its your computer the flight plan update begins at 223 plus 51 and change the verb 49 maneuver from the numbers listed to the numbers 127 270 030 over
read you for the verb 49 that occurs at 22351 change the numbers to 127 270 and 030
thats correct and the next entry is at 224 plus 00 change the line omni delta to read 0mni charlie and i have a map camera photo pad to be copied at 224 plus 10 the tstart 224 plus 03 plus 00 tstop nsfn cue the next entry is listed at 224 plus 15 and change the mp camera image motion requirement to read tal  takback to barber pole plus two stepsoff and then i have three deletions at 224 plus 21 delete the verb 49 at 224 plus 23 delete map  camera track retract and 224 plus 27 delete map cameralaser experiment covers closed and the last item is an addition at 224 plus 40 add verb 49 maneuver 127295 and yaw is 030 and the high gain antenna angles pitch 23 yaw 229 over
okay joe going back to 22400 thatll be omni charlie instead of omni dog then on that map camera photo pad its 2240300 and stop on msfn cue then down to 22415 on the map camera image motion t will  itll be barber pole plus two instead of three at 22421 well delete the verb 49 maneuver at 22423 well delete the map camera track at 22427 delete map cameralaser experi ment covers closed and at 22440 do a verb 49 maneuver to 127 295 030 high gain pitch 23 yaw 229
right on jim thank you
good ship endeavour be advised that our tracking stations have acquired the satellite
oh very good
apollo 15 houston 09 07 01 07  go ahead
roger jim this is a comment for you when i was reading the flight plan update to you we noticed that you might be coming up on something not too clear in the flight plan and it involves the long list of steps between 224 plus 00 and 224 plus about 15 and there are a nmher of steps in there that have to be accomplished before the tstart time on the map camera photo pad it may be you  youll want to start on a few of them i guess a little early over
okay thank you joe
endeavour this is houston well be requesting 0mni delta when you lose the uplink
roger omni delta  to go
hello endeavour this is houston
houston endeavour go
roger endeavour i have three requests for you the first the optics is in the cmc mode and weve noticed it drifting off wed like you to drive it manually back to a value less than l0 degrees in trunnion and then zero it were also waiting for a dap load and a p40 and i have a guaranteed last correction to your flight plan when youre ready 09 07 17 40 imp okay number l weve still got to mke the star check well take care of that and i hope  i  hope youve already seen the dap load and the p40 but well take a look at it again for you
okay joe we  im ready to take that last change to the flight plan
okay jim stand by 1
okay jimmy this is an easy one at 224 plus 14 we want you to delete the line that reads map camera image motion to on talkback barber pole in 3 to 5 seconds then gray delete that line please over
okay thats an easy one ill delete that line that says map camera image motion on talback barber pole in 3 to 5 seconds then gray
roger jim thank you
hello endeavour this is houston
okay houston endeavour go
roger dave al and jim be advised youre go for transearth injection set your sails for home were predicting good weather a strong tailwind and well be waiting on the dock over
okay thank you very much houston well see you around the corner
roger well be watching apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
apollo 15 houston over
hello houston endeavours on the way home with a burn status report for you
roger sounds good striding by
roger ignition was on time burn time was 2 plus 21 no trim our residuals were minus 02 plus 06 and plus 02 deltav c was minus 167 fuel 235 oxidizer 22 the unbalance was about minus 25 and what a smooth burn that one was
roger sounds very good to us dave
just cant beat these rocket engines for traveling  09 08 05 05 cc i should hope not
apollo 15 houston over
houston 15 go
roger two questions one we notice you have ac roll jets selected i guess we arent sure whether you have b  ac roll jets selected on dap we arent sure whether you have ac or bd selected on the panel
okay ill check it  okay ac youre selected
okay and could we pry out of you guys any comments on the moon as you leave
well were almost speechless looking at the thing  its amazing looks like were going straight up and were leaving theres no doubt about that and were right on the terminator it shows very distinctly all the topography  all the topographic highs and lows and we can see some major rilles and we noticed one large lava filling within a de pression with domes very prominent within the lava fill oh its just really pretty spectacular we have one crater almost below us that has a flat floor with radial rilles and circumferential rilles extending from the central peaks i think we saw that as we flew over
roger copy sounds beautiful
its really spectacular the elevation  the topography on the ridge line is quite clear and of course all the features near the terminator stand out quite well because of the shadows and were busily taking pictures so mybe we can bring some of it back for you to see
be looking for it in 3 or 4 days
roger its really spectacular though and theres no question that were leaving as a matter of fact the first glimpse we got it was quite obvious that were on the way
thats a pretty good view after all those days of  going around and around isnt it dave
yes boy
looks like were going straight out dick
yes reminiscing for me thank you
although ill tell you we never got to see half of what we passed over im sure theres just so much up there
well ill tell you dave im not so sure you guys didnt get at least your share or maybe a little more spectacular
roger
well i guess our orbital geologist up here just figured out which way we were i guess we were sort of momentarily disoriented there because south is up and were looking right up and down the terminator so i guess were upside down look ing at new territory that we havent seen during the flight
jim just said gee maybe i ought to look out my window and by golly out his window he s looking up  hes looking up to the north as a matter of fact out window number 5 now you can get a full half  halfmoon view and you can see it all in one big gulp and boy what a gulp
well look at tycho now before too long
thats a good point we cant see it yet
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay bob im looking from humboldt straight south now and in fact you can draw a line between humboldt and the  and a great ditch or scarp to the south and theres quite a change in the light level or the intensity of the albedo in  between  those two areas and it looks like theres some  you know  very smooth fresh lava flows throughout that area and in fact we noticed that while we were in orbit also that in several of those areas around humboldt there to the north of humboldt and to the east of humboldt that the flows in some of the craters there  and theyre quite distinct flows you can see where theyve lapped up against the sides and you can also see where theyve come  where theyve spilled down over the sides sort of reminiscent of the coso hills flow  you can  we looked at these flows and realized that they looked fresh and yet they had a lot more  the crater count was a lot higher on them than it was on the surrounding terrain and this flow were  kind of looking at now looks  its a very large area and it looks like its just filled  seeped into some craters down there some of the large craters it looks much fresher in color it hasnt  it doesnt look like it has been worked up as much the craters that pit the lava flow are much sharper than they are say farther to the east but the count seems to be much higher the crater count seems to be much higher even here
copy al very interesting
and houston 15 as we leave and look back why i guess we still have the impression the moon is mostly gray however when youre upsun as we were just prior to tei when youre looking upsun it does definitely take on a chocolatebrown color  we came around prior to tpi on the dayside  or tei on the dayside looking backwards into the sun across schroters valley and that was a pretty spectacular sight and it did start turning a chocolate brown but now everything is a variation of gray from very light to a gunmetal gray near the terminator
well is that a unanimous vote in the spacecraft dave 
roger i got three ayes on that one
roger well add that and continue to keep the score
good
someday ill get up there
hey bob we dont report to you the other kind
someday ill get up there and make my report
i hope so
we can see a point on the terminator now where we mentioned we saw a lava filling and some domes in a depression which is not the circular craterlike depression its a big cavity and now i guess as the sun angle has changed some we can see where the lava has apparently spilled over a scarp into a deeper cavity which is in  in shadow and its very clearly a filling of the cavity with two levels
roger dave we call that a polye dont we
well i guess if we were in hawaii
you guys dont see any motion of that stuff do you
stand by well watch it
and houston 15 we got another unanimous vote up here that was really a great trip
roger i think thats unanimous on everyone isnt it
roger
and 15 if youll give us accept well uplink a refsmmat for desired orientation ptc
roger youve got it
and 15 its your computer again
roger houston
and apollo 15 houston wed like that verb 49 maneuver so we can pick up high gain please
roger we just did it bob
thank you
hey houston take a look at the dsky i think those are the numbers you gave us
roger 15 those are the numbers look good thank you
and 15 houston wed like gamma ray gainstep on up three clicks over
okay gainstep on up three clicks
apollo 15 houston
go ahead bob
roger wed like to move that verb 49 maneuver to lunar surface photo attitude that youll find at r  22530 in the flight plan wed like to move that up to 22524 over
roger understand move the verb 49 maneuver to 225 24
roger
apollo 15 houston 09 09 25 b1 cmp houston 15 go
roger be advised well be monitoring your maneuver here in case you get in your gimbal lock and the high gain angles in case you lose antenna lock in  the new attitude will be pitch of minus 45 and yaw of 024 over
roger understand pitch minus 45 and yaw 024 if we lose it
roger
and thanks for watching it for us bobby
and 15 if one of you has time i have a few more flight plan updates for you
okay houston stand by 1 go ahead bob
okay the pitch and yaw angles for the p20  p52 attitude at 22600 is pitch is minus 37 yaw of 322 
understand at the p52 attitude its pitch minus 37 yaw 322
roger at 22615 were changing that verb 49 maneuver attitude to the following coordinates 327 143 055
roger copy the change to the verb 49 maneuver that occurs at 22615 to 327 143 and 055
roger and the high gain angles will be pitch 13 yaw 212 09 09 27 58 cml roger pitch 13 yaw 212
roger stand by
and 15 were observing yaw of 61 degrees right now
15 houston we have 65 degrees yaw
roger bob were watching
okay three more flight plan updates jim if youre ready
go ahead bob  09 09 29 06 cc okay at 22622 on  it will be a line above the line that says xray on the new line that will be added will be xray off for i second then over
understand the new line added above xray on and itll read xray off i second then
roger thats good at 22732 well add a line on top of the verb k8 line that says xray standby
roger understand at 22732 xray to standby
roger and at 22757 on a line with the mass spec on it well change that discriminator high to discriminator low
understand discriminator low instead of discriminator high
now that completes the update for now
roger apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription  09 09 44 43 cdr houston apollo 15
roger 15 go
roger do you have any best guess on mcc5 yet  whether or not well have one
standby its not going to be very large 09 09 45 0b cdr well the question is whether or not we have to prepare for it and we have another request wed like to reschedule the uv photos presently scheduled for 23910 to some other time primarily because of the stowage in here weve got most of the uv equipment already stowed beneath the rocks in prep for the eva and  to go in and go out of the stowage container takes a fair amount of time and wed like to reschedule that if its possible
roger assume you mean after the eva
roger
okay stand by
okay this is a  this is a crowded fellow up here
you guys shouldnt have brought so many rocks back
well i guess every once in a while we wonder
but we dont wonder very long
okay dave first of all no problem we can de lay those uv photos until after the eva second  right now midcourse 5 looks like 2 feet per sec ond and we do want to do it over
okay thank you thats a couple of quick answers appreciate it that  that will help us in our planning  09 09 47 17 cc okay that is only a preliminary estimate on that midcourse 5 though
thats okay that tells us the difference between simsand rcs kind of burns
oh roger
and 15 houston one more thing if its convenient
go ahead
go ahead bob
okay at your convenience wed like to verify or check the primary accumulator fill valve on until the primary accumulator quantity  thats for the glycol loop  is up to 50 to 55 percent this is the result of a review of the eva checklist for tomorrow it asses that this has already been checked and that wre at the 50 to 55 per cent level so wed like this check  you could do it tonight when youre getting ready for sleep or something
okay well do it right now thats planning abead
copy
okay houston our prim accumulator quantity is now about at 51 percent
roger we copy thank you 09 09 50 0 cmp and we filled it from about 45
thnnk you
and if you have any other goodies you think we ought to check over might as well do it this evening
roger dave thats the only goody we came upon 
stan  stand by okay 15 thats the only goody weve had from the review of the eva check list for tomorrow that  thats the only one we could find an extra goody that wed like this t evening sometime if you fellows intend to use the vacuum cleaner  is for you to give us a  a cue when you turn it on so we can check and  watch the currents they saw a  lny on a ac bus  or an extra current load on an ac bus and they think you were using the vacuum cleaner then theyd like to verify that by watching it again when you use the vacuum cleaner
okay well weve been using it quite often on and off
okay just sometime when you use it if you give us a cue as you turn it on that would help
okay i  i guess we dccft see any need for it this evening and we could check it out if youd like  
no no
   pretty well the cabins nice and clean and i 
roger dave no thats just a callout the next time you happen to get around to feeling dirty and want to use the vacuum cleaner give us a call if you would please
okay well do it
houston 15 did you get the p52 numbers 09 l0 l 20 cc roger we have all your p52 numbers al
al we know that one of them wasnt five balls
say again  09 10 1 44 cc roger we noticed one of those didnt have five balls on it 09 lo l 50 cmp roger did you get the torquing angles on both the p52s
roger yes we got them
okay thank you tape 16
and endeavour houston over
endeavour houston over
go ahead houston endeavour
roger if one of you guys has time we have what may or may not be the last iteration on trouble shooting the pan camera this afternoon over
okay have at it
okay step 1 wed like to know  you  you can give us these afterwards but the first step is to determine the status of the service module sector 1 ac 2 circuit breakers on panel 181 those are three circuit breakers number 2 is to deter mine the status of the pan camera mode switch nmber 3 after these have been done pan cafa mode standby power on t1kback barber pole for 2 seconds then gray and then stereo number  pan camera mode operate tlback barber pole for  2 seconds then gray number 5 operate pan camera until msfn cues or until beginning of the sleep period and number 6 on msfn cue pan camera mcde to standby and after 1 minute pan camera power off 0ver
okay bob you clipped the first part of number 5 say again please 0g l0 19 12 cc roger number 5 says operate the pan camera until the ground gives you a cue or until the beginning of the sleep period then well give you a cue
0keydoke stand by a minute
okay houston sim sec ac 2 circuit breakers three closed verified and the pan camera mode switchs in standby so would you like us to go to step 3
endeavour endeavour this is houston roger that appears to be the problem stand by and ill see what we want to do do we 
okay

roger 15 we see you maneuvering to ptc and were requesting that you not maneuver to ptc until the sim bay covers are closed i dont know whether theyre closed at the moment or not
roger theyre closed up
understand and if you fellows  
were just following down through the flight plan  09 11 37 44 cc good we werent sure where you were if you fellows are through eating we have two or three calls to send up to you when its convenient
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston you can go to tstop for the mapping camera now and that would be  to follow the checklist from pages 139 steps  sections 6 7 and 8 first one being mapping camera on to off 30 seconds and then standby over
houston 15
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston go
houston 15 okay  
apollo  
  listen bob is this the tstop on the mapping camera photo pad at 224107
apollo 15 apollo 15 thats a roger
okay houston go with the rest of the updates to the flight plan
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston roger we  want to remind you when you go into pc  tc to follow the block in the flight plan for the usage of quads rather than the section in  in the checklist where it calls out to disable all jets on two adjacent quads this is to avoid contami nation of the mass spec its just to remind you to follow that little box in the flight plan over
you mean that little box on page 3343
apollo 15 apollo 15 thats a roger
okay well follow that little box just like its in the flight plan go ahead with your  the rest of your updates
apollo 15 apollo 15 roger on  one discussion here on the uv photos which were delaying until after the eva it looks like the last chance to get these photos is at 24615 which is about 3 or 4 hours after the nominal end of the eva wed like to propose that for your consideration over
thats just fine well do it 24615 thank you
okay bob do you have anything else to add to the flight plan
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston roger one more item we just got is a request that now that the covers on the xray are closed were requesting xray on for l0 minutes and then off over
okay xray on for l0 minutes and then off
apollo 15 apollo 15 the posit  the last posi  tion should be standby rather than off over
roger standby
okay houston the xray is on and well turn it off in l0 minutes anything else tape173
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston thats a standby in 10 minutes· i believe you understand that  dave anyway and i believe that the next  
roger
  thing we will want from you is a call when youre ready to go to sleep and we will verify all systems at that time so we can get a solid goodnight rather than tagging on again like last night
roger that
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston· we see you cycling through the dap we suggest you need a zero in r2 to get bd roll over
houston 15
apollo 15 apollo 15 go
hey bob you didnt update the  arrange the load in the p20 for ptc· was that meant to be updated to 375 or shall we leave it at 35
apollo 15 apollo 15 lets keep it at 375
understand you want the flight plan updated to ·375
apollo 15 apollo 15 thats a roger
roger th8k you we got the update
houston apollo 15
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston go ahead
yes bob were trying to retract the mapping camera but the time has been well exceeded and we still have the barber pole indication
apollo 15 apollo 15 stand by  09 ll 59 59 cc apollo 15 apollo 15 wed just as soon you didnt spin up quite yet we still think the rates are a little high over
okay houston well wait on your cue then
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston concerning the mapping camera retraction problem the question is did you get a barber pole during the alpha xray cover procedure over
you ought to amplify your question there a little bit bob you mean when we are  operating the covers
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston jim the question basically is did the barber pole  did the talk back function properly when you just closed the alphaxray covers over
yes dave said it works fine
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston jim stand by on that we got your last answer and theyre working on it
okay i think ill take the  go out of the retract position on the switch and just wait for your word
apollo 15 apollo 15 that sounds good to me jim
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston wed like to hold off on ptc a little bit longer until we get this mapping camera business straightened out and jim for some troubleshooting on this wed like to have you check on panel 181 the main a circuit breaker closed and the deployretract switch in the retract position and on panel 278 the deploy main a circuit breaker closed over
those two circuit breakers and the switches are verified bob closed
apollo 15 apollo 15 copy 09 12 l0 40 i4p and on the presleep checklist been no medication today onboard readouts are bat c 37 pyro bat a 373 pyro bat b 373 on the rcs its 56 55 54 and 55 and i guess after we get ptc squared away well give you ememory dump tape 175
apollo 15 apollo 15 eouston copy the crew status and the onboard readout and stand by on the emod we may ask you for that before ptc but well be back with you on that in a minute 09 12 12 h8 cdr houston 15
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston go
roger un  unless you got a solution for the camera now why dont we troubleshoot it in the morning and get on with our evening powerdown okay
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston thats a roger weve just come to that conclusion ourselves down here were ready for an emod dump before the start of ptc please
okay its on the way 09 12 l 18 cc apollo 15 apollo 15 houston one last attempt on the mapping camera we suggest you try mapping camera doors open then retract and then doors close if successful on the retract and you can do that while  after you start up ptc if you like 09 12 l 38 cdr roger weve already attempted to do that bob 09 12 lh 3 cc apollo 15 apollo 15 houston roger youre ahead of building 5 and apollo 15 apollo 15 we have a good emod dump
houston 15 how do the rates look now
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston your rates look good youre go for ptc
okay well try 09 12 15 6 cc apollo 15 apollo 15 houston as soon as you configure the mass spec  multiplier low discriminator low experiment on i0n source on et cetera youre go for sleep then no more comments from the ground until morning
roger
apollo 15 apollo 15 houston is out for the  evening
dont go too far out though
apollo 15 apollo 15 our ever watchful eye will be on you while you sleep
very good
houston 15  initial rates 
apollo 15 apollo 15 nouston you called just as we lost and locked onto the heigh  onto the omni
okay bob just wanted to know how the initial rates of ftc looked
apollo 15 apollo 15 initial rates look good well be keeping an eye on it though for you al
okay bob it just didnt look like i got quite as much rate when i entered on that as i expected apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription 1
apollo 15 houston over
apollo 15 houston over 09 12 43 03 cmp houston 15 go
roger 15 would you believe that we have one more call on the pan camera we  do not show pan camera power to off please and unfortunately that means that we might heat up the film too much so we would like pan camera power to off and guys as long as youre down there would you mind trying mapping camera rdhact once more 15 we see a certain rise in temperature there which may mean that it was frozen itll improve and we do not see any  the mass spec configuration yet and a progres s report on our ptc says its about 60 40 but  but itll  it will last the night
houston it doesnt look like the mapping camera is going to come back in whats the problem if its left out
15 houston would you believe weve just deter mined that it doesnt seem to be a problem if it stays out overnight 09 12 48 35 24p great then i guess we can call it quits for tonight okay
i sure hope so
laughter okay   
15 we dont have tm on you right now is the mass spec taken care of
roger the mass specs taken care of theres one switch out of position and the mapping camera is going to go to off
roger copied dave well try again
okay
apollo 15 houston in the blind no need to reply our pan camera data still shows power on this is the middle switch in the bottom row the power boost switch should be in the center off position no need to reply over  tapes 1491511 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription rest period  no communications apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription 09 19 5 6 cc good morning endeavour this is apollo control in houston texas tuning the band over 09 19 6 21 cdr good morning tuning the band this is endeavour go 09 19 6 30 cc roger good morning endeavour this is houston with csm consumables and a few good words about your flight plan when youre ready 09 19 6 46 cdr just stand by 1 09 19 46 h8 cc okay dave and you troops sure start the day early up there i must say
yes seems that way doesnt it
okay houston weve located the flight plan go ahead with your updates
endeavour this is houston were you calling
roger joe weve located the flight plan go ahead with your updates
okay dave i guess let me start with the csm consumables at 235 plus b0 rcs total hl quad a 43 h0 38 l h2 tk 1 41 0 36 02 tank l 56 58 5 flndthe only mmediate other thing i have for you dave is a comment on the maneuver at 236 hours  about the gaaray boom retract wed like for you to confirm  ill be back when 
15 this is houston how do you read
last i heard was gma ray go ahead 09 19 53 2 cc okay the rest of that mysterious transmission is essentially the following dave weve got a funny in that gamma ray experiment and  so were going to  to want to modify the use of it a little f bit today it should be no major imposition but the flight plan calls out for the gamma ray boom to be retracted at 236 hours wed like to modify that by saying turn the gainstep shield off at that time and well want you to retract it about l0 minutes later well give you a cue for that over
okay gainstep shield off at 236 and stand by for your cue for retraction
thats correct dave ive got a few other good things here but theres no hurry on any of them be willing to stand by if you wanted to get squared away and give me a call later or whatever youd like to do its your preference
well lets go ahead joe were getting squared away up here
okay if you have the flight plan then let me add the following at 236 plus 45 add the step xray to on and then turning over several  pages  
roger 23645 xray on
okay and turning over several pages to 241 plus 25
go
roger after the step 02 heaters l 2 and 3 to auto add 02 tanks i and 2 50 watt heaters main b 2 to open
okay 24125 02 riater  or 02 tank i and 2 50 watt heaters main b to open and 02 tank heater  theyre 50 watt also main ai open 
stand by dave im sorry about this one stand by
okay
okay endeavour let me try that again had a typographical error down here it should read 02 tank 1 50 watt heater main b l open and 02 tanks 2 and 3 50 watt heaters main a 2  open over
okay 02 tank l 50 watt heater main b l open and tanks 2 and 3 50 watt heaters main a 2 open
thats correct dave i apologize for the slow start there now ive got some dap load changes that cover the times from about 27 hours to 252 hours and  the change is apparently because of a mis  of a mistake in the flight plan you have on board that we in the meantime have caught down here and  so there are several deletions and additions during that time the first one starts at 27 plus 28 09 19 58 4 cdr go ahead ive got it
okay delete your verb 48 11111 and xllll and add  stand by a second
thats twice 09 19 59 l cc ill be very careful from here on stand by
okay dr im ready to try it again youve deleted at 24728 the line with all the funny number ones and youre suppose to delete in the dap load collm also that same entry its in the time collmmn i guess and then turn the page
yes roger
okay go to 248 hours on the next page and in the note colln change the dap load status to  read 11101 and the rest is the same and this dap load status continues through the ptc until 251 hours and the next change is at 251 hours and 4 minutes
okay 2510 and i got the other three changes go ahead  09 20 01 17 cc okay delete the verb 8 line and the dap load over in the time colmmn there tape 152
okay
and the next change is at 25147 delete the verb 48 line and the dap load in its corresponding time collm
okay and i guess over in the notes column were still carrying 11101 right
thats affirmative dave and starting at 252 hours your dap load status should read 111  stand by
okay let me try again starting  
okay starting at 252 plus 00 hours in the notes codmn the dap load status should read lll01 times llll and this should be carried through the rest period until 261 hours over
okay joe you were saying something there about 25230 as we lost cow i got the entry at 25200 was there any change at 25230
negative dave the change at 25200 should just be continued through until 261 hours and thats just the dap  dap load status  should be changed correspondingly through until that time
okay i see and then were  were just 11101 all the way
thats correct
okay go ahead on your next
dave thats all ive got for the time being and i think id be afraid to go ahead much further if youre really counting those times maybe i  should start keeping score on you as well
laughter okay
were happy for the time being were  were standing by for a crew status report at your convenience and well be watching for the gainstep shield to come off
okay well get right back with you in about 5 or 10
thank you
endeavour this is houston wed like for you to retract the gamma ray boom for us please and well be watching for your torquing angles also if youd like some news reporting in the background i have the morning news here if youre interested in that at all over
roger gamma ray going to retract now and stand by on the news
okay roger you can use that as background for the p52 i guess president nixon in effect declared us responsibility for offensive ground combat operations in vietnam at sm end with the draft still in limbo selective service went ahead today with the lottery to determine the order in which next years 19yearolds will face military service secretary of state william p rogers plans to go to the united nat  nations to push for a more energetic international relief effort for east pakistan today the senate armed services commlttee completed action on a 21 billion dollar military buying bill that meets most nixon admin istration weapons requests president nixon and his fmly will fly to manchester new hampshire and then to a private island in maine this weekend when visits to new hampshire also are planned by four democratic presidential hopefuls and republican challenger rep  paul n mcclosky jr predicted weather for recovery day is 2000 feet scattered l0 miles vis and waves approaching 6 feet wind is north by northeast 18 knots i have a long list of baseball scores here which i think ill just glance over in the american league new york beat cleveland 7 to 3 ive had a local request for the dodgers who lost to the astros 2 to 0 the american classic golf tournament starts today at the firestone country club in akron ohio and the win ner will get 30 000 dollars sounds to me like the pays pretty good and i expect the hours are short the us pan american team went on a fantastic gold  medal spree yesterday winning 17  rather 16 of the 17 medals at stake the only one the americans escaped getting was a gold medal in weight lifting and the total in the games which are being held in colombia is 78 for the united states 36 of them gold and 51 for cuba 12 of them are gold and ill end with a story comparable only to that incredible contest between the apollo 15 all stars and the north american rockets last night in the texas league 21yearold righthander tom walker pitching for dallasfort worth team pitched a 15inning norun nohit game against albuquerque he retired the last 21 men in a row only four albuquerque players got on base and all of them were on walks walker got the first 18 batters out before he walked the first one he threw 153 pitches in the game and the nohitter is an all time record in the texas league and may very well be an alltime record in major league baseball walkers manager told him that if he did not win the game by the end of 15th inning he was going to have to pull him out walker said his arm felt a little tired but he felt okay understandably like doing three evas i expect and thats all the news for  for this morning apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
boy it sounds like hes as good as our very own linky
that may well be dave i  that never occurred to me
at least the equal thereof
roger at least almost
endeavour weve copied the torquing angles thank you and dave if you can get a volunteer to work on the mapping camera for us wed like to try to pull that mapping camera in and get the covers closed in preparation for the eva were not quite sure the position that the cameras in right now and the procedure ill  can read up step by step but its basically to open the covers try to extend the camera well confirm the extension and then well have you retract the camera and ultimately retract the covers and ill be stand lng by for your advice on this over
okay joe well see if we have time to work on that but its my understanding we do not have to have it retracted for the eva
dave thats my understanding too i think  the main reason  for wanting to do this if time is available and its o  and its only  would be a nicety  would be it  gives us a warm feeling regarding the film
dave just to complete that last statement youre correct we dont have to have that device re tracted for the eva but apparently it  it gives the film people a nice feeling regarding  their film not getting too cold or too hot thats the reason for that
okay well let us see if we can get to it
roger just give a whistle
okay and we sort of flipflopped that p23 and eat period so that we could take advantage of our setup for eating and all and well get on with p23 as soon as we finish breakfast
sounds good
apollo 15 this is houston all other things being equal troops wed prefer that you do the p23 before you begin the eat period because it gives us an hour of pointed xray data during your eat period
okay joe but i guess the inequality is the stowage situation in here and assuring that we can get properly prepared for the eva so  well start the p23 in probably about  oh  5 minutes or so because were almost through eating but we sort of have to take advantage of our configuration here in order to stay with the time line iater on
thats fine dave we understand thank you
endeavour this is houston
go ahead
roger ive got some information about your mid course 5 which is scheduled to come up here we have a firm decision that there will not be a mid course 5 maneuver required and the numbers behind that are a gmrna of minus 669 your vacuum perigee is 184 and the midcourse 5 correction that were showing now would be 310ths of a foot per second the corresponding midcourse 7 correction runs at about 18 feet per second and based on that new information were wondering if youre still inter ested in doing the uv photography at its scheduled time or waiting until after the  the eva and were also wondering what your choice will be on the solar corona photography over
okay thats pretty fantastic guidance isnt it let us  take another look at the flight plan here and come right back at you
okay dave fine and no hurry on  on the  on that decision we would like the gamma ray step shield on now please  09 20 45 06 cmp okay gamma ray gainstep on
thank you
and joe i guess on the corona photography mag r has been ex  expended and as far as the uv its not so much a problem of time its a prob lem of stowage its stowed way down deep in one of endeavours lockers here and to get at it re quires quite a bit of manipulation of bags and thats the reason we wanted to delay that if it was possible
okay dave we understand that and that  that sounds like its a far more reason  reasonable to delay that the timings not critical as far as were concerned we just wanted to give you a balanced workday
okay fine we dont mind loading up a little after the eva because it really saves us a lot of work in the long run and you might wonder why we didnt put  the uv stuff somewhere else but theres just nowhere else to put it but in its  in its own proper little spot
no we understand thank you
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay have a crew status report for you and you can have the doctor take a look at the lmp bio and see if thats acceptable  09 20 58 00 cc okay
ready to copy
go ahead
okay seven hours sleep apiece and prds 25028 23193 08031
okay dave thank you and we see that weve got the xray going wed like for you to change the setting on the gainstep give us a oneclick in crease which will move us from  the position 7 back to position 1 over 
okay youve got a oneclick increase
okay we see it dave and jims bio looks clean to us down here thank you
okay
endeavour give us six clicks on the gamma ray gain switch please
okay six clicks
endeavour this is houston
houston endeavour go
roger dave a couple of miscellaneous items id like to ask you about first of all the trench sends their congratulations to whoevers doing the p23 for us the errors are less than 7 sigma  and theyre awarding the honorary vasco da gama navigation award for excellence in this secondly were puzzling over your remark about magazine romeo which you reported to us was exhausted and were wondering if you just read  the frame number fom the mag and if so what it read over
yes joe this is al the last reading on romeo i think was ll0
okay al thank you and were you doing the p23s for us
si
okay ill tell you a little something about vasco da gama later on another easy item here youre going to come up on a bat charge  i guess bat b charge  starting at 239 hours and wed like to delay that to 244 hours please
okay delay the bat b charge to 244 and be advised  youve got to know that weve got the best navigator in tranbearth lunar space up here
at least one of them im sure
in fact the only one
roger we copy and finally id like to get a volunteer to take a whack at this  configuring the map camera properly and its going to be a few short steps and if it works great well have a lot of good engineering data regarding the thermal properties of that beauty and if it doesnt work were just going to turn it off and leave it and  when somebodys ready to do that ill go through the steps therere not too many
okay joe somebodyil be ready in just a few minutes  09 21 38 40 cc roger thank you dave
okay houston endeavour if you want to try your camera techniques again lets give it a whirl
okay endeavour ive got five steps here and i think its easiest for me just to read them to you and have you carry them out rather than copy ing them down and the first one  first two steps  
roger
  on panel 181 verify logic power main a cir cuit breaker closed
okay verified
and same panel verify logic power switches two of them to deployretract
verified
step 3 on panel 278 the experiment covers deploy circuit breaker main a to closed
verified closed
step 4 on panel 230 the map camera verify standby
verified to standby
okay and coming up on step 5 and let me read through this  and  ill stand by for questions then if there are some we want the map camera track to extend and simultaneously we want the experment cover map cameralaser altimeter to open and we want those two things done simul taneously
okay understand go to extend and open the covers map cameralaser simultaneously
roger and a note on that  i guess  on the map camera track to extend well be watching that for about between 4 and 5 minutes or until you get a gray talkback on there and  we think this is going to clear up our problem and if it doesnt were just going to turn the whole ball of wax off and go ahead and do the eva as normally planned over
okay joe in 3 seconds well execute
roger dave were watching
well i got a gray on the mapping camera how about that
okay stand by
dave do you have a gray on the door as well
thats affirmative but i did not get a barber pole on the door it just stayed gray
okay thats good that just means that it was open already
right
okay then that  thats worked out fine apparently we were having a temperatue prob lem with that thing before and were back in business just like normal wed like now the  mapping camera track to retract and that 11 take i guess about 4 and a half minutes
okay map camera track going to retract now apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
endeavour this is houston be advised that be cause were not going to do a midcourse 5 well continue the xray pointing to about 238 plus 30 and well be ccing at you with a list of the steps at 238 hours that you can delete because were not doing the midcourse
okay fine 09 21 57  cc and dave could  could you have someone check the barber pole on our map camera track to see if you have the grayretract indication please
roger joe i been watching it you got about 7 minutes and 20  20 seconds now and its still barber pole  09 21 58 l0 cc okay thats what were showing down here and stand by
okay endeavour were satisfied with that mapping camera exercise two more requests on that go to off with the extendretract switch and to off with the mapping cameralaser altimeter cover switch please and were finished with that 09 21 58 5 cdr okay extendct to off and a map camera lase altimeters going to off
thats right dave and a note for al we think that the mgazine romeo based on the frame count you gave us still has enough frames left to take the solar corona pictures and well have some special words for a1 on how hes to take those pictures i guess well delete a few of the solar corona requirements also word about the prd configuration for the eva apparently well want the cmp to have the prd whose number reads 25028 and i guess thats the one youve been carrying dave and jim well  well use the one that reads 08031 but we would like to have him recon firm this number before he starts the eva over tape1542 09 22 00 lb cdr okay let me get that in the checklist here joe stand by the cmp is 250  say again
roger we want a1 to wear the prd thats now reading 25028 that will distinguish it from the other two with no ambiguity and jim to take the one that begins 080 and we want him to give us the full reading off of that before he starts the eva though
well well have to give it to you now because it will be in the suit and we wont be able to get to it
thats fine any time any time
okay the one jim will wear will be 08037
okay dave thank you and if youll give us po0 and accept well let you have a new state vector 
roger youve got it 09 22 04 b3 cc endeavour its your computer 09 22 04 s7  roger
and houston endeavour you want to go through the change in the flight plan at 238 hours if you haven t
standby
okay dave this involves delaying the sim bay turnoff until 238 hours and 30 minutes and in detail at 238 plus 05 delete the p30 external deltav and the verb 49 maeuver lines at 238 plus 20 delete sextant star check at 238  plus 28 delete all the steps from there starting with circuit breaker scs et cetera up to 238 plus 55 ending with rhc power direct 2  off et cetera over
all right i got all that thank you
hello endeavour this is houston tape15k3
houston endeavour go 09 22 lk h5 cc be advised at mv mak you are leaving the sphere of lunar influence end its downhill from here on in 09 22 14514 cc mark
roger thank you joe thats nice to know
did you notice anything there dave discon tinuity in velocity or anything like that
well joe thats one of the mysteries that well probably have to keep to ourselves
i was afraid of that
endeavour this is houston  09 22 22 02 cdr go ahead
roger dave were looking down the lne here towards the eva and the surgeons getting good hiomed data on a1 now except one of the three ekg sensors is apparently marginal and theres some noise creeping in were just wondering what your standard procedure is regarding sensor ing before the eva exercise if hes going to resensor its probably no problem if hes not planning to maybe we ought to talk it over a little over
okay were all three ail sensored ready to go if they have a problem lets get it squared away right now
okay do you have  maybe a1 could try pressing  down on the three ekg leads cue at a time for us that may help us out
okay here we go the upper right
okay  09 22 23 22 cdr okay the upper center is being pressed
okay
okay and the lower left
okay stand by
okay
dave it looks to us like its one of the two top sensors and we were wondering how difficult it would be to reseat both of them now 09 22 25 i1 cdr okay ill tell you what well do a little further down the line here well take care of both of those well  them and reseat them and everything
okay fine thank you
and thank you for thinking ahead on that one
endeavour houston
houston endeavour go
roger ive got an update to your corona  window calibration photography and the uv photographs when youre ready
okay stand by 1
houston endeavour cant seem to get the mass spec boom all the way in and i guess als had a little trouble with it  now and again with the barber pole being half  the talkback being half barber pole and seems to flutter there close to the gray position and doesnt really come all the way in
okay dave we copy let us think about that
okay and were going to go ahead with the dumps if thats okay
okay
and if youd like a visual check of just exactly where thats hanging up why we can give it to you in a couple of hours well have a1 go out and take a look
thats not a bad idea does he know about this plan yet
well i dont know well check with him yes he nods his head like hed probably be obliged to do it
okay break it to him gently though
okay
and dave while i got you here i do want to cmment that the first change in the flight plan is to delete the step at 238 plus 23 that says enable all jets we think that there is a  a  certain chance that map camera may be stuck out and we particularly dont want rcs jets a4 a2 b1 and b4 to be enabled because they may give us trouble with that camera
okay understand joe well scratch that step and make sure a4 a2 b1 and b4 stay off
okay and ill  standing by to read you some more photo pads just at your convenience
go ahead ive got the flight plan out
okay if youll turn to page 3352 which is the corona window calibration and uv photos procedures page
ive got it
okay the attitude involved in the corona photo graphs should read 057 005 025 and the time on that 239 plus 08 and the high gain numbers pitch minus 48 yaw 238
okay joe 057 005 and 025 at 23908 minus 48  and 238 for the high gain
thats correct and moving dowua couple of lines the shutter speed should be changed from l500th to 1125th and change the inhibit jets line to read mp rates for 5 minutes cmc mode to free
okay understand scratch inhibit jets and substitute damp rates for 5 minutes and then cmc free and the 1125th replaces the 1500th on the camera
thats correct dave and moving down a little further delete the line cycle i frame change shutter and delete the line cycle i frame and finally change the last line enable all jets to read cmc mode auto
okay delete line cycle i frame and cycle i frame and cmc auto replaces enable all jets
thats correct and assuming youre going to take the uv photographs after the eva i have a photo pad for that if that assumption is correct
looks like that assumption is probably correct joe and well take the photo pad later on let us get on with corona or we wont mmke it
okay sounds good
apollo 15 houston
houston 15 go
roger jim we understaud you are going to delete the u photograph but after you complete the corona window cslibration you will have to do the first step in the uv photos transearth coast procedures there and that first step is verb 49 maneuver to earth uv photo attitude and  it lists the attitude there we need this for thermal reasons
roger well do that
houston 5
go ahead 15 tape15 17
hey joe just a point of clarification on the backing to be used for the corona i dont know whether you are aware or not but the backing that fits into window  which is the righthand ren dezvous window has two different mounting pads for the camera one is 250 and the other is 80 and the 80 is pointing 12 degrees below the xaxis and i just wanted to check and see if you wanted us  if thats the proper pad or if you wanted us to use the 80 on the 250 pad
al use the 80 the one pointing 12 degrees above the xaxis
okay joe thank you tape1551 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
15 this is houston
apollo 15 this is houston
15 this is houston broadcasting in the blind with a request that if possible we bring back daves lcg if its already stowed in too inaccessible a place in the  in the jettison bag dont bother but if you can possibly save it please bring it back
okay sorry houston we were getting suited here and didnt realize we were off comm but we copied your request let us think about it some for a minute
roger  09 23 52 45 cdr well houston i guess that its a good reason were about an hour ahead so well go ahead and dig it out
thats your choice dave
well were sort of ahead and expecting little things like that to pop up
fine
say houston by the way the lcg youll get back is the one i wore on the third eva only
roger dave thats fine thats the one wed like
okay okay
and 15 whenever a1 has a quiet moment i have several prebriefing questions to send up to him about what to look for on the v over h sensor
okay give us about an hour for that then well be able to talk to you  09 23 55 12 cc very good
15 this is houston wed like to have manual on the high gain whenever one of youhas a chance to get there no need to answer
let me do it
okay go to manual
okay houston apollo 15
15 this is houston go ahead
were all suited up and down to the coma check portion of the eva prep and were ready to tk to you about whatever youd like to talk about
roger stand by
i guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the v over h sensor of the pan camera are you ready to listen al
okay he can read you but hes got to reconfigure his panel in order to talk to you so well do that
okay karl how do you read me now
loud and clear al hey on this v over h sensor i have a set of five steps or five questions that wed like to have for you to have in your mind
okay go ahead
okay number i is inspect the general area this is sort of a general point of view inspect the general area around the v over h sensor and comment on any evidence of thermal or mechanical degradation and 2 3 4 and 5 are sort of more specifically number 2 is there any evidence of v over h sensor lens cracking or debris on the lens in other words have a good check of the lens itself num ber 3 is any large amount of the black paint around the v over h sensor opening missing number 4 is the plume shield in place around the v over h sen sor opening and the plume shield is what id gen erally call the  or  the  its the guard around  the lens sticking out about 3 inches there and number 5 is anything obviously obstructing the v over h sensor field of view
okay karl we got all those  10 01 02 29 cc okeydoke no other special questions at the moment stand by
okay
okay well proceed on here then
incidentally i guess were  we both understand each other on the status of the mapping camera so far as you know it hasnt retracted is that correct 
that is our understanding at this point ill let you know when i get out
roger
oh al one more point that i overlooked down here and that is the people here would like to have you look at the mass spec boom al if its at all fea sible if its not convenient to look down at the base of that boom and look at the coils forget it but if you can get a look in there we would expect to find a coil crossover jamming down in the base there and wed like to have your visual confirmation of that
roger karl i had intended to do that
very good

roger 
houston 15 were getting ready to open the hatch how does everything look to you down there
roger al everythings looking good to us here
 out dave
okay unlatch unlatch ready roger  10 02 04 19  no
15 houston we dont see the tv camera on yet
the hatch is open
huh oh we havent got it out yet well have it out there in a minute it should be on though
okay i got the latch  the handle and latch
roger roger
okay
okay 
 zero clips l0 02 05 b2 cmpeva jettison bag is gone and jettison bag number 2
okay
okay houston you should be getting a picture about now
roger 15 were getting a signal
okay
okay fine first thing is that the map  the mapping camera is all the way out
okay l0 02 07 b4 cdr okay
15 this is houston were getting a clear picture now but the aiming of the tv camera is poor is it possible to open the hatch wider
yes thats what  were  were looking at that too stand by l and well do that
yes i can see the tv is pointed right at the com mand module there right at the interface
thats affirm
push it back a little there jim okay
thats excellent l0 02 09 lb cdr you should have a picture of a man in space
very good
okay you ready jim ill work my way down okay its reading 4 0kay
well have your picture back in a minute houston were turning on the 16 millimeter
we copy
yes
okay
okay im in the front restraint
yes thats good work up there al
okay the pan camera cassette is tethered theres the pip pin
good
get it inside there if you can jim get it inside 10 02 14 26  okay 10 02 i4 30 cmpeva roger would you like to exchange  would you like to get a hold of it laughter
thats the pan cmra right okay houston the pan camera is safely inside over
jim hold this
beautiful job a1 baby remember  remember theres no hurry up there at all
roger karl im enjoying it
okay houston rest break well take a look at the v over ih sensor
very good
uh hum i see nothing on the v over h sensor there s no back  black paint missing there s nothing obscuring the field of view the glass is not cracked l0 02 16 lb cmpeva the shield is not obstructing the field of view theres nothing in the way karl
we  
its perfectly clear 
we copy your report al thank you
okay and as i look around the mass spec is  oh it looks like about  not quite in  the cover it looks like maybe its the cover thats jmmed yes in fact it is the cover thats jmmed see l0 02 16 9 cc roger al we copy that was most unexpected news
no i cant tell from here i cant really  i cant really tell from here karl whether its the cover or not i thought the cover was jmmed one corner of the cover is overlapping a  side section of insulation which i wasnt expecting it to but it doesnt seem to be  it doesnt put any force on it  on the mss spec if i could get around and take a look at it the mass spec is in the guide pins and the mass spec looks like as it is fully retracted the mass spac is fully retracted karl
roger al were reading you loud and clear
any  any diffi  any difficulties with the talk back has to be associated with that cover because the cover is not closed how far through the slot should the guide pin come on the  on the reel
stand by al 
okay because i can see the guide pin coming through you do that and ill get the map  mapping camera
okay jim im ready to bring the other one back
hey al it looks like youre running a pass up there that s beautiful
okay
jim you look absolutely fantastic against that moon back there that is really a most unbelievable remarkable thing
okay houston the mapping camera casette is inside
we copy
houston is there anything else you want me to check in the sim bay before we go back in
al wed be  
is there anything on the mapping camera i can check
al wed be pleased to have any general comments you had about the sim bay experiments otherwise than what we ye specifically asked you did every thing look in order
okay well everything looked good as far as i could tell all except for the cover on the mass spec and the fact that the mapping camera is up maybe i could make another quick check back here and see if i can see anything on the mapping camera
roger
okay you ready you guys
ail right
oh just a second ive got to get the mask and get the tv
okay tv coming in got it dave okay
okay take your time
i  im doing fine
okay
hung up  on something
ah yes its about the same place it was when we opened the hatch l0 02 25 15  okay hatch is locked
neutral gear box is in latch
can you do it dave okay
15 houston you can turn off the tv anytime you like
let us get depr  pressurized first karl
okay
can you get it there
okay
very good
okay
tell me when to close it thats it
 take it down here before its too  okay okay
okay l0 02 27 ll cp i said i wish i were back outside its hell in here okay
closed
i cant no  10 02 27 43  hows that there we go now we should get our positions straight you see it now dave okay make sure we got a good seal
okay houston 15 it looks like we got a good seal hows it look down there
15 houston your seal looks good to us
okay thank you is 601 open
its open
and it looks zero now dave
roger
you should have stayed longer 
15  15 houston as long as we have the tv camera on go  go to average and we should get a better picture down here
well its just down in the leb sort of stowed away but well do that
were just not in a position to get the panel 3 switch right now  10 02 33 31 cc we  we copy and thats fine
you my have something on your picture now ill check
cabin pressure rate is coming up 10 02 37 22  theyre out of lockup
heavy breathing
ill get it apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
got it
pga pressure
  
yes
   l0 02 41 b1 cdr on l0 02 41 b5 cdr why dont you do it so i dont get my gloves dirty get my helmet get that stuff off and leave them
15 houston we see your cabin at 61 you might want to keep a close eye on that
okay well do that thank you l0 02 52 b8 cdr houston 15 were prepared to maneuver to the thermal attitude a little early if youd like us to go over there
15 this is houston that would be fine with us l0 02 52 5b cdr roger
15 houston wed like to have auto on the high gain and go from reacq to auto quickly
roger going auto  l0 ob 25 57 cc 15 this is houston
go ahead houston 15 l0 ob 26 l0 cc after some discussion down here wed like to disable your jets a2 alfa 2 and bravo l mainly because the mapping cameras still out and our concern is that the plume will be deflected down into the sim bay and possibly damage some of our electrical wiring or some of the  the n2 plumbing which may give us other problems
roger that sounds like a good idea if theres any other particular configuration you want just let us know
roger
and a2 and bravo i are disabled
thank you
houston 15
15 go ahead
roger the ops pressure is 2000 and well be off coma for about 5 or lo minutes here while we reconfigure the suits and everything
we copy
go apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription  10 04 34 13 cc 15 this is houston
15 this is houston how do you read 10 04 b6 43 cc apollo 15 this is houston how do you read
apollo 15 this is houston how do you read l0 04 b9 41 cdr houston apollo 15 well start to charge on battery b now if youre ready l0 04 b9 46 cc roger 15 were ready for the battery charge and while were about it the experimenters are getting a little fidgety about the waste water dump be cause that will impact their mass spectrograph work so we would like to get the dump and the 02 fuel cell purge started also
roger well get on it right away
and 15 whenever a1 has a couple of minutes we have a few questions about the se bay that wed like to debrief on
okay give  give him another 15 to 20 minutes here 10 04 41 lb cc roger
15 this is houston
houston 15 go ahead
we need to make a small change in the flight plan because theres a need now to turn the xray ex periment on if youll go down to that group of steps at 24530 wed like to do four of them wed like to get the data systs on  switch to on wed like to disable the jets wed like to get sband aux tv  science 
hey stand by 1
roger
okay go ahead
roger four of those steps down at 24530 we want to do right away if possible we want to  get the sband aux tv to science we want the data syston switch to on we want to dis able all jets except  and we want xray ex periment on
okay understand at 4530  24530 you want sband aux tv to science data systs on to on disable all jets and xray experiment on mmediat ely
thats correct
apollo 15 this is houston were having some ground problems in communications networks and wed like to have a comm check
apollo 15 this is houston how do you read l0 05 17 39 cml hello houston this is 15 loud and clear and i got your first message karl im sorry
hi al yes weve got some sort of problem on ground circuits here just wanted to make sure we were in contact with you
no were here
roger very good
al we have some questions for you on the sim bay experiments whenever you have some time to answer them
okay karl tell you what ill give you a call back in about l0 minutes when im ready
very good
15 this is houston
houston 15 go ahead
roger just sending up a reminder about the xray pointing attitude which is due very soon  now and the activation of the sim bay experiment
okay karl thanks
apollo 15 wed like to have omni alfa
roger omni alfa
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay karl im ready to talk sim bay but first a couple of questions
fire away
okay what attitude do you want us to do the uv  photo  photography at
roger al the information on uv photos is to follow the procedures  okay  you want the attitudes  the procedures on page 3352 and the attitude to be used is 210 242 322
say the attitudes again please
210 242 322 also note use of magazine p and also the time  the time that we start the maneu  the time that we finish the maneuver is 247 plus 45
and let me clarify that magazine that is the magazine for the uv color for photographs that is magazine p instead of magazine m
okay understand use the procedures on  page 3352 except change the attitude to 210 242 and 322 and this whole thing is to be done at 24745
roger thats the time for completing the maneuver
well what time would you like us to maneuver to that attitude then
roger the time to start the maneuver is 24  247  plus 36 10 05 43 03 cml i understand 247 plus 36 roger thank you karl
okay al are you ready for the sim bay questions
roger karl sure am
okay first of all the guys down here would like to send up their warmest congratulations on such an ex  successful eva you sure made it look easy up there and the questions the questions we got are about the mapping camera and theyre directed at the general problem of is there  was there anything you could see which might indicate why it jammed and there are three  three partic ular items that you might have looked at first of all it was the main camera cover at the bottom of the camera was it touching or scraping the camera in any way that you noticed l0 05 44 29 cml the answer to that is negative in fact i checked it i checked the mapping camera cover laser altimeter cover quite carefully to make sure because i do know that there have been some interference problems with that before particu larly with the pan camera so i was looking at that in particular to see that it was maybe ad justed too close or  or interfering along the side of the pan camera and it was not there was about half an inch clearance between the upper edge of the cover and the body of the mapping camera so that i  i dont see that that was responsible for the thing jmming
roger i think youve very clearly put that suspi cion to rest there are also two covers to the solar camera in the upper left side of the mapping camera and did you notice any  any distortion or any scraping in  in these covers theres one possibility the one that stuck out to the left  it  it might have jmmed and the screwjack that controls it might have twisted it or distorted it was there anything you noticed like that l0 05 45 b7 cmp negative karl i noticed nothing out of place with the mapping camera nothing interfering i checked all the way around it down into the  cavity nothing interfering i saw no evidence of anything interfering and it looked clean under neath so i dont think there was anything blocking it from underneath i dont know my distinct impression after surveying the mapping camera and looking around the cavity where the mapping camera fits was that there is a problem with the drive
roger you didnt see anything inhibiting its motion not even the electrical cables up on the top huh
negative and i guess i can ask a question along that line has anyone noticed any high current when weve gone to retract on the mapping camera to indicate that it was hanging up
we didnt see any al although there had been a long controversy down here about the long amount of time required to extend and retract it was even though it was about the 4 minutes predicted several months ago it was somewhat longer than what wed observed at the cape people had been worrying about that for some time
yes i realize that and i also as i re  as i go back to what we saw at the cape there were some problems with that thing hanging up in the drive itself at the cape
roger okay a couple of questions on the mass spectrometer you gave us some good information there but when you said the mass spectrometer cover wasnt completely closed could you give us some idea at  as  to  to what degree it had  closed to what angle and was  was there any pos  any cocking any  any twisting in  in that cover
well i couldnt tell whether there was any warpage in the cover or not particularly because that kind of a cover is a little  looks like its warped anyway it looked to me i could  i pulled  the cover out of the way enough to look at the mass spec inside and i could see the guide pin and along the sides of the carriage coming through the holes all the way up so that they were plainly visible from the outside which  which meant to me that the  the mass spec was either very close  to being seated on the carriage or it was seated i  i guess i dont really know how far those guide pins extend out beyond the  the carriage the other thing was that the  that the cover  the inconel cover was  it  was rotated about 30 degrees on its  on its hinge point from a full close position and i thought at first as i in dicated when i was there that there  there looked like there was some interference in one of the outer covers or one of the outer edges but after playing with that and pulling it a little bit when i was out there it was quite obvious to me that that wasnt the problem either and  and beyond that i couldnt see down around beside the cover enough to tell whether there was something internal between the cover and the mass spec that was  that was binding the cover
roger al we copy that and would you open the xray and alpha covers right now please
okay xrayalpha covers coming open
okay i guess youve answered most of our questions on the mass spec and youve approached one that we might get a little more out of and that is those guide rails sticking through the guides there is a tapered portion and when its com pletely seated you actlally see the  the  the cylindrical portion beyond the tapered portion did you actually see the cylindrical portion or was it all tapered area that you looked at on the guide rail 10 05 49 32 cml okay thats good scoop all i saw was the tapered area
roger you probably  if it was fully seated you would have seen about a half inch of  of the cylinder there and this is a good indication that it was not all the way seated even though it was close
heres a couple of other questions give me a second to look at them lo o5 5o o4 c okay apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
okay al mostly questions here about the con tamination status and things in the sim bay first of all how about the  the  the door eder  the door edges did they blow off smoothly and cleanly
yes very cleanly i saw no rough edges at all
stand by a moment al
okay
al were anxious to bring up the high gain antenna ive got a couple of angles here if they ll help
okay f 10 05 51 49 cc minus 76 and 117
okay minus 76 and ll7
okay we copied your comment on the sim bay door jettison and further questions go as follows the white coatings in the sim bay were  did you notice that any of them why  were obviously dis colored or  or coated from contamination or over heating
i saw no evidence of heating in the sim bay i saw no evidence of discoloration of the white surfaces there were  cough  as  as best i could tell no particulate matter that had come to rest on any of the surfaces in the sim bay it looked very very clean and  even across the top of the mapping camera where there was a  such a heating problem expected i saw no indications of heating whatsoever particularly on things like the cover over the mapping camera cassette which was sup posedly a very hot spot and it was just as clean as a whistle there wasnt  there wasnt any evidence of scorching or contamination anywhere that i could see tape1592
roger and on the insulation and foils i guess theres a question here  were any of them burned or discolored you probably already told us that were any of them torn or were there any attach ment failures
no i couldnt see any evidence of  of any burning or tearing or anything else back there karl
okay we got one more general question there and our flights dynamics officer who is vitally con cerned about our reentry weight would like to know whether we jettisoned more or less than a nominal 32 pounds and if so by how much
okay stand by 1
say houston weve talked it over and i guess wed say it was pretty close to a nominal  as far as weight we have no idea of  of determining exactly what the weight was but were going to try and work  our reentry stowage over this afternoon and tomorrow morning and we hope to give you a  a plan by  somewhere around noon tomorrow of where all the rocks are stowed and where everything is stowed and what we have on board so you can start  so mr fdo can work up his entry plan
roger and if somebody has the time to copy it ive got a small flight plan update available now
okay karl ill take that
hi jim howre you doing
just fine
okay 246 hours 20 minutes we have high gain angles of pitch 00 yaw 240 at  
 o0 and 240
roger and at 246 plus 46 we want to add change discriminator to low
understand scratch discriminator high and make it discriminator low 
thats correct and on 247 plus 28 delete that dap load  10 05 57 20 lmp okay we already have that change
sorry about that on 247 plus 30 wed like to have the alpha xray covers closed then off and delete the note on the cover open close
okay understand at 24730 youd like alpha xray doors closed and to just delete the note here
roger and stand by 1 second
247 plus 30 also we would like to add mass spectrometer multiplier high discriminator low
understand at 24730 you want to add mass spec multiplier high and discriminator low
roger and at 247 plus 32 wed like to have mass spec multiplier high discriminator high
okay 24732 mass spec multiplier high and discriminator high
roger and i guess you need to save room if theres any left there because at 34 and at 36 we want to change these two switches again at 34 we want mass spec multiplier low discriminator high
understand at 34 you want multiplier low and discriminator high
affirmative and at 36 we want multiplier low discriminator low
okay at 24736 its multiplier low and discriminator low
affirmative also at 24736 is add the uv photos and weve already sent up the changes required for that the changes over and above whats on page 3352 and theres one reminder there and that is to verify that when you use filter 2 that you take one frame for 20 seconds and one frame for 2 seconds l0 06 00 31 imp roger we remember that
okay the next step is 247 plus 45 xray to standby  
okay at 24745 xray to standby
and at 247 plus 50 we want to move the ptc initiation steps from 24730 to 24750
okay understand the initiation of ptc to be delayed from 247b0 to 24750
thats affirmative at 248 hours and 0 minutes wed like the following wed like the mass spectrometer boom retraction sequence each retraction step will last 20 minutes instead of 12 and terminate this test at 249 plus 30
go back to 248 karl on that mass spectrometer boom retraction sequence
roger i  
i have that in there
i  i guess all  all were doing there is changing  the  the retraction step will be 20 minutes instead of 12 minutes down at the end of the writing there it says each sample period will last 12 minutes wed like to have that at 20 minutes
okay ill change the note there then it occurs about 24820 the 12 will be 20
thats correct at 24905 wed like to move the mass spec boom deploy from 05 to b0  from 24905 to 24930 
understand move the mass spec boom deploy from 24905 to 24930
roger and one final one at 25148 which you may already have is delete the dap load there
i do we have that one karl
okay that completes the pdate thank you
thank you
15 houston wed like to have gamma ray gainstep up four clicks
okay thats gamma ray gainstep up four clicks
15 this is houston we trust youll be pleased to hear the news that the high voltage has been turned on to the subsatellite and that they find that all systems are operational
oh thats very good glad to hear it
15 houston we have a couple of more comments on the uv photo procedures if somebody can copy
go ahead karl
roger we overlooked the fact that you are taking these photos in the midst of sim bay operation so a couple of little things change going back to page 3352 you can first of all delete below the damp rates notation in  you can delete inhibit all jets except the jets that are there and just keep the jet configuration you got right now l0 07 05 43  okay i copy that do you have any other comments
roger under remove the cm 5 window put in there cmc free and likewise about four lines up from the bottom just above note put in cmc auto and the final comment enable all jets you can delete that and thats all
okay understand just below remove cm 5 window cover put cmc free and then down at the  the bottom there just above the note put cmc auto and scratch enable all jets
roger apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
houston 15
15 go ahead houston
dr parker i presume listen bob weve got to pull the gmrna ray to 15 feet at 50 and wonder if youve got an updated retraction time for us
thats affirm al we have a retract time of 247 plus 50 for 72 seconds over
understand 72 seconds
thats affirm and 15 if youve got your flight plan out we can update a couple more times in that same general vicinity for you
okay the flight plan is out and the door is open
okay at 24802 the ass spec boomer track time  that should be 33 seconds and that time will apply to the first retraction the second third fourth and fifth retractions will be 32 seconds over
okay bob understand that the first retraction i 33 seconds and the succeeding retractions will be b2 seconds is that 4 or 5
stand by
apollo 15 houston that will be 32 seconds for all succeeding ones and we are going to do that up to 24930 and so all succeeding ones you get will be at 32 seconds and we will finish that test at 249b0 no matter where we are and i believe i see that karl has sent up comment that the sample period would be 20 minutes instead of 12 is that right
thats roger we have that
okay and another change at 249b6 the gamma ray deploy that time will 6b seconds over
copy 63 seconds
okay thats all we have for right now 
0kay thank you bob
apollo 15 houston request omni delta please
roger 0mni delta
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead
houston 15 go ahead
roger 15 if you guys will give us a hack when you start the first mass spec retraction well keep an eye on those 20minute periods for you
okay good deal
bob we just completed one retraction for 33 seconds
okay were starting our time
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead go ahead houston
roger 15 wed like to get a pitch of minus 40 and yaw of 90 for the high gain antenna and then if youd change your antenna switch to high gain without hitting the cgmmand reset switch well maintain comm that way please
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston 
negative you did the right thing without us calling you thank you
whatever that was okay
15 houston your rates look good to us for a spin up
okay bobby
and 15 time for the next cycle on the ms spec 32 seconds
okay we were a little ahead of you that time
roger
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead bob
roger if you guys are  have a moment free well pass up three comments to you preparatory to some stuff you want to do later on
yes go ahead
okay first is a reminder that were counting on using the 0ps to pump up the cabin for sleep tonight  another way of bleeding off the 0ps guess well remind you now so you dont stow it away down underneath something where its incon venient and wed like a readout on the ops after you finish pumping up the cabin tonight second comment is a reminder that wed like a cue on the vacuum cleaner if you intend to use it for this contamination control period coming up in a half hour or so and third one is that as far as the medics are concerned its dealers choice on who wears the biomed tonight over
okay we copied bob
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston
roger wed like to confirm auto auto off on the 02 heaters it looks like weve gone beyond the point where they should have come on
theyre all off right now bob
roger that explains what we are seeing roger wed like abo auto off please
understand auto auto off
thank you
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay just wanted to clear up the 02 heaters with you are you aware that the last instruction that we had of the flight plan was at 24330 that said 02 heaters three off
stand by that wasnt on my shift
youre not the regular crew chief huh
15  apollo 15 houston that callout at 24330  is the 02 heaters for tank 3 only
okay robert i stand corrected
thats one i owe you
15 you called
negative negative
apollo 15 houston its retract time
thank you bob
and apollo 15 houston its time to retract again apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription  l0 09 01 07  okay thank you
and 15 be advised that this is the last retract well do we will not do the fifth retract in order to ensure that we dont damage the filament by getting it in too close well sit in this retracted position for 30 minutes and then de ploy the mass spec boom as per the flight plan at 249 30 over
okay understand
apollo 15 houston about 2 minutes to mass spec boom deploy and wed like a deltat on the length of time it takes to deploy it please
roger bob
bob the flight time on the mass spec was 3 and 25
roger copied 3 plus 25 jim
roger
apollo 15 houston while you re eating your supper there thought you might be interested in knowing how the vectors are going your vector and the grounds vector are extremely close and at least at the moment well see what happens when we take the next p23 right now were looking at no midcourse 6 and about 18 foot per second for midcourse 7
houston 15 that sounds pretty good and it looks like well see what happens on the p23 one  you say 17 on midcourse 7 is what it looks  like right now l0 0g 57 32 cc roger 18 the vectors i guess right now are about 4000 feet apart and about a couple of feet per second in velocity and no more
sounds great apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription
apollo 15 houston we can terminate battery bravo charge now
houston 15 roger will do
and 15 houston a reminder that when we exit ptc in about 15 minutes wed like to do it using the sim bay rcs configuration
roger houston understand
and 15 this is houston we have your torquing angles thats some platform isnt it
yes sir bob you bet you it sure is beautiful
apollo 15 houston over  l0 ll 17 45 cmp houston 15 go
roger mr lightning fingers wed appreciate it if youd keep your noun 49 on for about 5 seconds on this p23 so we get a nice chance to look at it here on the ground laughter
i will do my best sir l0 ll 2 53 cc apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston 15
super mks al you can do my p2bs any day
they looking okay down there now
roger we caught all of them hey when you go back into ptc now wed like to change noun 79 the rate one anyway to a minus 42 over
going to try a little higher one now okay minus 42
roger
and 15 houston if youve got a minute weve got a couple more comments for you
okay anything i need to write down
negative number  
okay go ahead
  number one wed like to know the film status of magazine victor and number two if youre planning on being on the loop tonight al for the biomed your harness needs some attention the heart rate that were getting down is getting a little noisy over
well in the first place my heart rates always noisy and in the second place i guess jims going tobe on tonight
understand
houston 15
15 houston go
okay bob mag victor is 12 frames expended
copy 12 frames expended thank you
15 houston we suggest that you go ahead with your gmma ray deployment while youre doing your rate damping
roger houston
and 15 houston if you feel like it we can take your emod now
okay coming your way
and 15 we have your ememory dump
okay good
15 houston were go for spinup  for ptc
okay good apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
houston apollo 15
apollo 15 go
hi bob got a presleep checklist for you
shoot were ready dave hold on we got a  
okay
oka 15 were back with you we just had a sit changeover
okay crew status is all good no medications and ive got the onboard readouts if youve got a pencil  10 12 20 31 cc ive got a pencil
all righty starting with bat c 370 370 370 rcs a is 56 b is 50 48 and 52 and i guess everything else has been done and i guess you got your ememory dump we pressurized the cabin with the ops and when we got up to about 57 or 58 the ops was down to 800 and i reckon thats the size of it
roger dave that sounds like the size of it to us we copy all that and there will be no vector update ground says your vector is just as good as theirs right now
how about that oh thats pretty good we got a good navigator
and 15 lets hold a couple of minutes while we check some data on sim bay and while we go around the mocr one more time and well be back with you in final status i hope
laughter okay we got  we got time were not quite ready to go to bed yet
apollo 15 houston the only thing we show lacking at the moment is gamma ray gainstep shin on other than that youre go for sleep
okay understand gainsifshield on tapes 1641671 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription rest period  no communications l apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription 10 21 30 07 music  anchors aweigh
good morning endeavour this is houston
hello you guys
good morning
good morning dave a little something special for your i24pfrom your lunar liftoff flight director with young ed fendell on the cymbal
oh man hes standing at attention right now
roger we copy that
endeavour this is houston with our first request of the day wed like the xray spectrometer on please
roger coming on apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
okay dave and ive got high gain antenna angles for you when you exit ptc
okay standby l joe
okay go with your high gain angles
roger high gain pitch plus 24 yaw 264 and dave ive got csm consumables if youre interested in copying those
okay go joe
roger get 261 plus 00 rcs total 38 quad a 42 39 32 38 h2 tanks 34 32 33 02 tanks 49 50 40 and theres a note on that which reads fat city over
yes man i guess so thats pretty even isnt it
yes sir and dave a comment  
what a machine
roger a comment youre being served now by the mocr shift that witnessed a new endurance record for apollo flights being set during the night
ohhh thats interesting wed forgotten about that
and endeavour ill be standing by for when youre ready to copy down the few changes in your flight plan for today i can bring you up to date over  the next 7 hours or so and get all that out of the way im also curious to know if youve had time to listen to any sea chanties from the hms endeavour up there over
no we havent had a chance to joe stand by and ill get my trusty pen out after we get through with this  coming out of ptc and well do the flight plan
okay fine you should ask your trusty record librarian a1 where the sea chanties are if you have time today
okay we were talking about that last night and came to the realization that we brought all these neat things along and we hadnt had time to listen to a single one of them
not at all surprised to hear it
ill tell you yesterday we finally got to catch our breath
you always said the hours are long
roger
the hours are long but the accommodations are palatial
was that the way it went dave
sounds like youve recovered from all that  the other  couple of last few days too
very nearly l0 21 49 00  houston this is 15 standing by to copy flight plan update
roger jim good morning the first   l0 21 49 l0  good morning joe
  entry should be at 26142 and it is a  a change in the first register of the dap load  the time column we want that to read lll01 over
give me the time again on that joe
roger 261 plus 42
okay at 26142 i dont see any dap information i see one on 26135
i may have done it again jim let me see
stand by on that lets  lets continue on with some of the easier steps at 262   l0 21 50 36 ip roger laughter
  plus 05 it should  that  that  thats 262 plus 05 add gamma ray gainstep two steps
understand at 26205 gamma ray two steps
roger and at 26355 under the line noun 70 et cetera add xray to standby and at 26359 delete the verb 48 line and the dap load over in the time colmu
okay at 26355 well add a step there after noun 70 xray to standby and then at 26359 well delete the verb 48 and also delete the dap load thats in the time colmmn  10 21 52 18 cc roger turning the page to 26402 the dap  load in the time collu should read lll01 and at 265 
okay understand
  the dap load status in the notes column should read lll01 xllll and this continues through for 2 hours over
okay understand that 26400 in time comn changed the dap load there from all ones to lllo1 and then at 265 the dap load will be changed the same way to continue for 2 hours l0 21 5b 43 cc thats correct jim and moving on to 266b0 delete the gamma ray gainstep to shield on line
okay 26630 to  eliminate the gamma ray gainstep l0 21 5 l0 cc roger moving to 267 plus 20 add the two steps gamma ray boom retract talkback barber pole for about two and a half minutes then gray and then off and the second step gamma ray gainstep to shield on
okay understand there are two steps there the first one is gamma ray retract barber pole for about two and a half minutes then gray and then turn it off the second one is gamma ray gainstep to shield on
thats correct moving to 267 plus 42 change the dap load in the time column to read lll01 xllll 0vet
understand from all ones to lll01
thats correct turning the page to 26802 the dap load in the time collmn the same change
okay i copy
okay on the same page 26830 gamma ray gainstep five steps
understand gamma ray gainstep to five steps
thats correct jim now looking at page 3378 the ltvphotos  transearth coast a couple of changes there about halfway down the page where it reads two frames filter 2 exposure time 20 seconds delete that line and add the line  the to lines one frame filter 2 exposure time 20 seconds one frame filter 2 exposure time 2 seconds
okay i have that joe its kind of our standard change in the uv procedures 
thats correct jim and the mag  metro under the configure camera section should be changed to read mag papa
okay understand mag papa
okay jim and the last one for you a biggie turning over 4 pages to the sextant photo test strike the line pcm cable
okay eliminate pcm cable on  on the sextant photo test
roger
can we go back now to the very first one
jim i knew you were going to ask that the first one i guess was a small typographical error and theres no change required there and please dont tell dave about it hes keeping score against me
okay laughter
endeavour this is houston with a forecast weather report for your landing area theyre calling for high scattered  2000 scattered l0 miles vis  winds about 15 knots out of the eastnortheast waves going to 4 feet and were predicting no midcourse 6 correction for trajectory reasons and from the weather report none is required for weather reasons over
gee that sounds pretty good joe except we saw a movie about that weather stuff once
roger we copy that and dave we do have one question is it true that nothing can stop the armv air corps
thats true joe thats true
im beginning to believe it
well that means youre just about qualified
im glad you still have reservations though your grmma by the way is right on 65 as close as we can tell right now
well thats pretty good must be compensating errors along the way somewhere
say houston 15
go ahead
we reviewed our entry stowage last night were going to do the stowing this morning and in the process why we came up with one extra little bag up here which were labeling lm return items which is essentially the same thing as 14 brought back and i wonder if you might check with our good fido and see if he wants the details of that or whether maybe ed mitchell can give you the  the general kind of items and that would be acceptable but we have one  one bag which im sure youre aware of and well stow it and tell him exactly where we stowed it and if he wants the details well well give it to him
okay fine dave we copy that and pass that information along i have the morning news report if youre interested in listening
roger everybodys hooked up and listening go

oh thats very good news joe thank you we hadnt heard about the lr cubed but we were hoping it was superclean
roger and its your computer
roger
and an added note for al alfredo im not sure if you got a report on your bistatic radar ex periment taylor howard got very very clean echos on both the sbamd and the vhf frequencies and hes busy analyzing that data right now
very good joe
endeavour this is houston with a final update con cerning the trusty lcru on the lunar surface we turned it on yesterday and it worked beautifully for about 13 minutes we w  we were panning around zooming in and out got a few more good pictures of the  the surrounding mountains and suddenly we lost the tm downlink in fact we lost everything in a very short time about 160th of a second almost as though someone had turned it off we tried  we waited awhile and tried to reactivate it and did such things as send signals back to it to pan around while we looked carefully on the passive seismometer for evidence of motion apparently it was not responding to the signals the temperatures were completely normal right before it went off the air were not exactly sure what happened over
gee thats interesting joe its  you sh  i guess it completely went off and just didnt get hung up somewhere huh
thats right dave it wasnt a mechanical problem we most likely popped a circuit breaker or something like that its a little difficult to sort out
would you like us to go back up and check it for you
knew you were going to ask stand  stand by
joe im  im in  im interested in hearing you say that the temperatures were normal one of the things that  of course well debrief them on it when we get back but jim and i both noticed that each successive day was warmer than the preceding day and on the last day if you held your hand or something in i position for any period of time it would really  the suit would really heat up on that particular surface and im surprised that the system ran this long with that temperature up  there because i suspect it really got pretty hot
dave thats interesting comment by normal i guess i mean within limits it apparently was about 90 degrees on the lcru and about 90 de  92 degrees on the camera when it gave up the ghost however thats well within its limits and we dont think that circuit breakers or whatever let go because of the temperature the one thing we did not have sensored as i understand it were the  the bat temperatures of the rover that was  that was feeding the power into the tv however
gee 92 sounds pretty cool to us i  i would have guessed much  much hotter than that thats a pretty good thermal system on it if it kept the temperatures down that low  l0 22 20 23 cc thats correct
or maybe laughter jim mentioned maybe thats centigrade huh
negative on the centigrade dave however when we turned the camera off at the end of eva 3 the temperature was up around 122 degrees
yes id believe that easily
endeavour this is houston the surgeon reports that we have good respiratory data from your biomed volunteer but we have evidence that one of the three ekg leads is opencircuited either not attached or broken somewhere and sometime over the next few hours wed like  wed like you to troubleshoot this for us please and if need be there is an extra biomed harness in the medicine kit over
roger okay well check into that
endeavour we have the angles
roger houston
good ship endeavour this is houston wed like a crew status report at your convenience please
roger stand by
okay joe i have the crew status we all got 8 hours sleep prd readings were  a1 was 25031 and mine was 08042 consrmbles at 26100 rcs total 38 quads 42 32 39 and 38 2 34 32 and 33 02 49 50 and 40 over apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription  10 23 09 07 cc okay jim thank you
houston 15
go ahead 15
roger weve resensored the ekg and appreciate a checkout from the docs down there
roger stand by
good morning karl
good morning al how are you doing 
just fine
says the ekg looks good down here hold 1
okay
al your new cap comm is just coming up to speed this morning i understand that there has been a problem with the bicmed harness and they want to know if the one you have on right now is the one that gave trouble shortly before l0 23 29 hl cmp thats affirmative and i did find the loose one
okay were getting a good signal on you and i guess that information makes everybody happy down here thank you l0 23 29 55  okay
15 this is houston we still have a concern  about your ops pressure and would appreciate it if its at all accessible to have a reading at the present time
okay its  its pretty well buried right now karl whats your concern on it
well first of all theyre anxious that the ops pressure be down close to zero at  at entry and theyd like to figure out how much theyre going to use tonight and how much tomorrow night in order ·to bring that down i guess we dont have it tomorrow night theyre  theyre anxious to know  whether or not its  were going to be able to bring down its pressure in using it tonight 0 23 59 34 cmp okay i guess it came down to 800 from 2000 last night but probably came back up as soon as we get a chance to do some shuffling around here why well check it and give you a call
good enough thank you
roger its sort of down in the bottom of the pile right now and were getting ready to start reentry stowage so well be able to  to get to it in a little while
we understand
al the way people talk down here theyre going to give you a medal for good sightings up  up there they say that the  the gamma from this last series of sightings was 655 whereas the value we have down here is 650
roger karl
houston 15 you may have seen an  an excursion there as we started the verb 49 maneuver to ptc and were trying to figure it out too
we copy
what was that
15 houston we didnt see any obvious glitches down here but were going to go back and look at the data 
okay what happened was we were loading noun 22 to the verb 49 and apparently on the  the last entry on the third register we got about a 1degreepersecond pftchdown pitch rate and went to scs and then back to ch  to cmc and tried it again and it worked just fine
roger
houston it looks like we might have got that old  22degree glitch in the cdu
we copy
and houston right now were reading about 93 93 and 33 on the ball
roger
15 this is houston we feel that we can get rid of that discrepancy if youll do a verb 0 noun 20
okay well do one of those
yes looks like thats what it was
dave we suspect the cause of that glitch back  there was possibly due to the fact that you might have loaded a noun 20 instead of the noun 22 is that possible
were thinking stand by
karl i guess its a possibility but we were both looking at it and i guess we dont think so but thats a distinct possibility
15 houston about all we can say is that every things looking fine at the moment and well go back and look over the data we havent had a chance to do that yet
okay yes roger understand it  it looks fine up here and that  that could have been the problem ll o0 l 19 cdr houston 15 talking it over i guess that must have been a  a noun 20 load because i guess as i remember it the cdu glitches occur in incre ments of ll and ll plus ll doesnt equal 26 i dont think
okay we copy
and houston in our present attitude a yaw cdu change would be converted to a pitch rate so that sort of all adds up
very good
15 houston when you have some time to listen i have a couple of sentences of crments on the procedure for the  the lightflash experiment
okay why dont you stand by until we get our trusty crew all lined up and ready to go
very good
incidentally dave as we line them up one of the changes is that wed like to keep the cabin lights bright this time
oh you like the lights bright okay
15 houston we see indications that the optics  arent zeroed and wed recommend that you zero them with the reminder of course to bring the angles down to l0 degrees  less than l0 degrees before you zero them
okay thats  thats standard procedure well get it thank you its even been written up on the panel for about 8 days now or so
very good
okay houston go ahead with your procedure on the lightflash
roger wed like to have you put the window shades on as usual but leave the cabin lights bright and what were going to do is to sort of calibrate one crewman in terms of the degree of  a dark adaption required to see the flashes that would be interesting to know after you don the eyeshades and give us a mark and go ahead and count things after a while you  one of you  and we prefer you dave just to be specific  can expect for us to callup to you to take off the eyeshade for i minute and after a minute well do the timing for you if you like well tell you to put it back on and in this minute time look around at the lights get back to sort of  your eyes normally adjusted then put on the eye shade again and  and give us marks as you start seeing things and thats  thats the only dif ference from the normal procedure we would  we would prefer to have all  all the data on the voice down link if possible
okay understand the  open the eyes and  stand by 1
and houston weve talked over the  the down link bit and its just impractical if were all going to try and keep up with the cnmments on where and what we see it would just be too con fusing for you and i think  if  if you cannot get your data from the tape well dothat but i think its much more practical to go ahead and put it on the tape and just inform you of when we get the marks  ll o0 28 05 cc okay weve had  weve had  weve had some trouble with the tape in the last couple of times around is the reason the people are sort of saying hey if we could possibly get it down in real time wed feel happier
oh you  you mean you  you cannot get the data off the tape huh ll o0 28 4b cc i guess weve been having trouble with voice quality on the dse and gerry just now says hey lets check it right now see how its doing and well let you know in the next few minutes as to whats pref  preferable
okay thats a good idea
15 this is houston it looks as though the dse voice down link is acceptable now and well do it your way
okay let us get squared away here and make sure we get all the shades up and all ll o0 bo 42 cc 15 one more comment on that dse voice problem this is to sce extent dependent on how well  your mikes are adjusted so make sure that theyre in a good position tage162
roger i guess a down link would probably be the same problem well get them all squared away
houston 15
go ahead 15
how do the rates look for ptc now
just got the word that they look good for spinup
okay ll 00 32 bt cc i think thats another great example of esp at work
okay houston 15 were experimenting
roger apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription i 1i 00 46 19 cdr houston 15 were still here it just looks like a quiet morning

looking as hard as we can

mark cdr right eye point source 7 oclock about halfway out intensity 2
15 this is houston we find an hours passed now and we thank you very much for the data and theres a general question since the counting rate was less than previously is there   is there any impression that you have that the inten sity may have been less than previously also the intensity of the individual flashes
roger i think thatd be a general comment that all three of us experienced
and houston also you might note that we all saw flashes last night when we went to sleep  just before we went to sleep and i guess  we feel like theres a surprising decrease in number and intensity today
roger we copy that you feel todays frequency is less than last nights and also that the intensity is less today ll o1 38 09 cdr roger thats correct
thank you very much for the free information
okay
houston this is 15
go ahead 15 11 01 40 5b cdr looking back at 26416 theres a callout there to close the mapping camera cover we did not do that because the extension of the mapping camera
roger we concur with you that that was the right action the one that you took
okay
15 this is houston wed like to set your mind at ease about that attitude glitch it was indeed due to loading a noun 20 in place of a noun 22
okay thank you
houston apollo 15 the ops pressure is 1000 li 02 04 18 cc roger 15 we copy 1000 on the ops pressure  and we have a suggestion down here that may make the ops  simpler to handle wed like to put the hose over its connector there and simply turn the ops on to bleed down gradually and simply replenish the cabin pressure and then you dont have to bother with you  operating it tonight
roger that sounds like a pretty good idea okay we ll do that
roger and then everybody will be completely satisfied that its bled out by the time you reenter apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
15 this is houston with a couple of comments about the sim bay experiments if youre willing to listen
roger houston go ahead
first of all on the gamma ray experiment dr arnold reports that a1 worden probably performed the first recorded repair of a scientific instru ment in space because earlier in that day hed begun to experience some problem with excess noise in the grma ray experiment and when a1 went out in the eva  we dont know what happened there  but at the end of the eva the gamma ray cleared up and has been doing beautifully ever since you must have given it a pretty good kick there al
well not  not only is he a plumber hes an electrician as well
roger on the xray spectrometer the work youve been doing on the galactic sources of xradiation has  is already showing considerable interest and in particular the scorpius xray i data gives us a longer continuous observation of  of this source than weve ever had before and shows a fairly longperiod variation whi  which  i  with  i should put in a word of caution  which still might be instrumental but looks real and was previously unrecorded and has the  has dr adler rather ex cited and im sure the other as  astronomers will be much interested also indeed we may go back to that source later today although i dont think that s clearly decided yet
roger that sounds interesting
and otherwise i guess  that  thats about the most exciting news from the sim bay
okay very good were ready to talk about entry stowage if youll get out your  your map and your little legend there  
okay
   and well run down the line here
okay weve  incidentally  one more comment the mass spectrometer on the retraction sequence yesterday showed us no increase in contamination which was something of a surprise and its prob able that we might try that once more today to make sure that there wasnt some sort of instru mental difficulty there maybe we just have a cleaner spacecraft atmosphere than we thought though
yes from what a1 said when he was looking around out there it sounded to me like things were pretty clean
roger
okay 15 if you will turn off your squelch it will help because we may occasionally have periods in  when coremis rather weak and otherwise go ahead 
okay what  what we use as a reference is the entry stowage map spacecraft ll2 26 july 71 which is in the front of our flight plan and if you have that in front of you why ill just go through that and give you the additions dele tions and changes of which there are very few
okay were  stand by one moment
okay
okay go ahead
okay a1 is stowed as prescribed there top of a1 has a bag  a decontam bag in which we have sample container number 2 for 23 pounds and the i return items
roger
a2 is as you have listed
roger
and on top of a2 we have the isa decontam bag for 64 pounds  ll 03 14 22 cc we copy
okay a3 a4 a5 and a6 are as you have on your list right now i1 03 14 33 cc we copy
a7 is as you have on your list with the addition of the lm dac and the i4 70millimeter camera that failed on the surface which we thought you might like to take a look at
right both of those are  are added items i take it i1 03 14 56 cdr thats correct
we copy
side of a7 is the eva umbilical and bag as per  perscribed sic
roger
top of a7 is sample collection bag  0h stand by
okay let me  let me go back and make a correc tion here karl look over in the lefthand column where it says top of al and scratch sample col lection bag number 2
okay
and then go back to your righthand colmn there on top of a7 we have decontam bag with sample collection bag number 2 and the bslss bag for a j total of 48 pounds
we copy
okay
could i clarify that  both of those bags together were 48 pounds or do i also put over the 20  the 23 pounds we had on al 11 0b 16 35 cdr no the total of collection bag number 2 plus the bslss is 48 pounds
i understand
and you can scratch the collection bag number 2 for 23 off of a1
roger 1t 03 16 58 cdr okay and then in a8 its stowed as perscribed sic with the exception of one less lightweight headset which is some  somewhere on the moon
roger
okay on the side of the next page in the left column on the side of a8 in the bag as you have there with the additic of the core tube pole
say again
okay i  i figured that would be a strange one on the side of a8 in bag there are four items there and one additional item has been added the drill corestem which we just labelled as a core tube pole because it looks like a pole
roger thats the 3foot core stem
thats correct
okay
and a9 is collection bag number 3 for 30 pounds
we copy
bl b2 and b3 are as you have them listed
okay
b5 is rockbox number l for 36 pounds and b6 is rockbox nmber 2 for 40 pounds
okay we copy il 03 18 57 cdr and then b5 and 6 b8 l2 and lb are as you had them listed  ll 03 19 06 cc okay
and r1 is the flight data file and lm ppk
we copy
and then on the next column they are all as you have listed for the top r2 r3 and in r3 we have the entire i data file and weve taken r12 out of r3 and put it in another spot
okay
r  far  r4 is as you have it as is r5 r6 r8 r11 r13
we copy  11 03 20 06 cdr okay u1 will only have one temporary stowage bag in it
we copy
u2 will have the items listed plus the accessory bag in which we have  the contaminated gloves and ill read you a list of those items if you are ready to copy i1 03 20 29 cc okay go ahead 11 ob 20 33 cdr have one set of ev gloves and one set of iv gloves the tethers  the  the waist tethers paper towels and i guess thats about it
roger  ll 03 20 51 cdr u3 its as you have prescribed there
roger
stand by l karl
okay houston ready to go with the righthand column u4 is as perscribed sic and r2 is as perscribed sic
roger
okay the pga bag is as perscribed sic with the following additions first we have  in  in the bag where well put the lunar sample  well have r12 with the csm malfunctions procedures and systems book
we copy
and the lunar sample is bag number 7 for 24 pounds
roger
okay and then everything else is as perscribed sic and the cmlpga will be in the sleep re straint under the righthand couch with two tsbs which are now acting as waste containers
roger and that  that location was where again
underneath the righthand couch strapped down as  as its perscribed sic we just wanted to note that within that sleep restraint with the pga will also be two tsbs
roger we copy
and thats just light waste material in those tsbs and i guess that pretty much takes care of it unless you have any questions
thank you dave we copy all of that
okay and as you go through it and look it over if you have any questions or anything youd like us to shuffle around why let us know
okay we sure will thanks
15 we have your torquing angles
ro  roger apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
15 this is houston the next several attitudes are going to require us to use omni delta and we suggest that you go manual and wide and stow the high gain antenna
okay well do that and go to omni delta
apollo 15 this is houston wed like to have you retract the mass spectrometer boom for 85 seconds
understand retract the mass spec for 85 seconds
thats affirm and then well leave it there for about 5 minutes well cue you when to extend it again
okay
15 this is houston would you please extend the mass spec boom all the way out again
roger in work
and i have a tstart for the lunar eclipse photos when youre ready to copy
okay go ahead with the tstart
tstart for lunar eclipse photos 2685947
understand 2685947
thats correct al
al we had a question on the mass spectrometer and t it may be too late was it possible to confirm by visual look through the window that it was retracted
negative karl you cant determine that its retracted all you can determine is that its full out
roger well when it was retracted you wouldnt be able to see it thats what im asking is it possible for you to take a look now and see if it slowly comes in to view
roger in other words youre asking to a con firm that it does come full out
thats correct
okay
just to clarify our question al the main ques tion was just to confirm whether or not it did go out of your field of view did it actually move from the full  from the fullextended position since we saw no change in the data when we re tracted it during the test yesterday there is a suspicion that even though you actuated the switch that for some reason it didnt retract ll 04 27 26 ctp understand okay its fully extended now karl but it may be too late it may have already been out by the time we looked
roger
15 this is houston we have a rather extensive update to the flight plan and also a change to the procedure for the contamination of photos which we can read up to you at your convenience li 04 37 09 cmp okay does it involve the things going on here in the next couple hours
it  its pertinent beginning at 271 we probably ought to get it in before the press conference at 270
okay stand by 1
okay go ahead karl
okay if youve got the flight plan out we go over to 271 hours and at 27120 just under sband ox tv science we add vb 49 maneuver to contamina tion photo attitude the attitude is 014 195 016 high gain pitch minus 23 yaw 252
okay at 17120 sic just after sband ox tv science verb 49 to 014 195 016 high gain pitch minus 25  23 and the yaw 252
roger just after that we delete mass spectrometer ion source off and in the space there add configure for urine dump
roger delete the mass spec and ion source off and configure for urine dump
okay delete the next one two three four lines but we  and that brings us to gamma  gamma ray gainstep shield off which we leave in
roger delete four and leave in the gas4a ray gainstep shirld 0ff go 1t 04 39 48 cc delete all of the rest of that page and add at 27140 verb 48 11101 01111 and p52 option 3
okay 27140 verb 48 11101 01111 and at p52 option 3
roger and at 27145 we add gamma ray boom doy 4econ henoffga94a ray gain step center antistart contamination photos
okay 27145 gamma ray boom deploy 41 seconds then off gamma ray gainstep to center start the contamination photos
and theres a note on the photos that you begin to dump according to the photo procedures which are  i have an update to that ill give you later and that we dmp the water to 40 percent in order to have the right weight at entry roger its important that we dont go below 40 percent on  the water dump ll 04 42 o1 c okay understand dump according to photo proce dures and the water dump to no less than 40 per cent for entry 11 o 2 08 cc thats affirmative on the next page 272 hours and 00 minutes we  i  i presume you know that  were not doing the midcourse correction 6 we cancelled the p52 there and we keep the h2 purge line heater on but we cancel the p30 external deltav we cancel the verb 49 maneuver we  cancel the next one two three four five all the way down to the h2 and 02 fuel cell purge which we keep
okay understand keep the h2 purge line heater cancel the p52 and the set of lines below h2 line heater on and keep the h2o2 fuel cell purge
roger and at 27228 a note that you should be ending the contamination photos at that point
say again
2 27238
okay 27238 end contamination photos go ahead
right at 42 we cancel  we delete the wastewater dump since weve already done it and at 42 we add start the mass spec boom test and the pro cedures are to be read up in real time at 58 we cancel the mideourse 6
at 27301 we  
okay at 27247 thats the  hold on let me read it back 27242 the mass spec boom test procedures in real time and cancel mcc6 go ahead
roger at 27301 we cancel the burn status re port and we add xray experiment on alpha x ray covers open and record the get
okay 27301 xray experiment on alpha xray covers open and record the get go ahead
roger at 03 we delete the gamma ray xray alpha particle m80 on and down at 27347 we add gamma ray boom deploy
okay a deletion at 27300  or 03 the four items there and then ga ray boom deploy at 27347 go ahead
roger and one final item on 27405 in the mass spectrometer instructions there the dis criminator should be low instead of high
okay 27204 sic mass spec discriminator low vice high
roger and if you have the time i can give you the update on the contamination photography which is on photo 25 and 26 in the back of volume i of the flight plan
stand by l please
okay houston lets hold off on the updates of those other photos so we can get squared away for the eclipse photos
roger
15 this is houston your astroncmer cap comm is  getting curious to know whether you are seeing anything of the lunar eclipse anything visible
oh sure weve seen it come down to about half to about 1sth illumination at the present time relative to the suns illumination
roger and what percent of the disk is covered now ll 05 13 35  stand by ll 05 15 47  okay karl looks like about 910ths of the disk is covered at the present time and weve been taking the pictures all along its a very pretty sight out there
roger sounds like you are getting close to total  eclipse there hey we note down here that in your free mode you are drifting somewhat in pitch and you are about 5 degrees off now the recommendation is to go auto and stop the drift if you can and cycle back to free before you take your next photo if there is anything you can do to correct the pointing it might be a good idea
okay right now the photos are handheld so well get to it when we get to the nikon
okay 
houston 15 the moons in the shadow now and we have a variation in color from a almost a light gray to a burnt orange from one side of the moon to the other lmost like the old harvest moon except that im not sure theres any atmosphere up here yet
roger we copy
houston 15 weve finished the photos and a1 had the moon in the reflex part of the nikon all the way so im sure the pointing was okay
very good
right now the moon is sort of  varies from sort of a very pale orange to a good deep burnt orange on one side and a very gradual change and i hope the  the photos come out because it  it certainly is pretty
very good it sounds like a beautiful view from up there youve seen a lunar eclipse of the moon twice as big as anyone else has ever seen such an eclipse
that was very interesting and it certainly is a  a pretty view itd be a a great place for sombody like you to come up and use your trained eye to interpret all this and understand it
sounds like it would be fun someday
i see you have your e entry check coming up if there is any chance of my slipping in this change of procedure on contamination cloud photog raphy id be pleased to  at this point ll 05 26 42  okay give us a couple of minutes to reconfigure here well have time to do that
okay fine ill stand by for your word apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
okay houston go with the contamination cloud photography update
roger dave are we on photo 25
photo 25 go
okay the reason for this change is that we have to use the dac instead of the nikon since weve run out of nikon film the first change is under procedure  l configure camera we go down to the second line in the cm 4 et cetera we  we x that out and we substitute  cm 4   11 05 31 4 cdr stand by 1 karl we want to find out if we have any more nikon film we may have some  11 05 31 58 cc okay
15 houston our records show that you will be out of nikon film when you finish the lunar eclipse photography and wed prefer that you use it for the lunar eclipse
does that include mag w
stand by
oh disregard that we just found a  a little note on mag w it says do not load in camera i guess that takes care of that go ahead with your update
okay fine the basic specs there in  are  were using window 4dac  dac18vhbwbracket mir for mirror pcm pic cable ti 11000 infinity 24 feet per second
okay dac18vhbwbracket mirror pcm cable t1 11000 infinity and 24 frames per second go
correct the next line its magazine h maga zine hotel and magazine  and instead of frame number its magazine percent to be filled in there tal1742 age 1480
roger hotel and percent go
okay completely delete number 2 and substitute instead the following utility power on cover  lens dac on 2 seconds change shutter to 160 change frame rate to time
okay utility power on cover lens dac on 2 seconds change shutter to l60th and frame rate to time in place of the number 2 you have go ahead
roger in step 3 we delete inhibit all jets and at the end we add cmc node free
roger delete inhibit all jets and add cmc mode frwv at the end g ahead
roger at the  at the end of step 4 before repeat 4frame sequence we write cmc mode auto and we delete repeat 4frame  
we  we  we  we delete the repeat 4frame sequence
okay step 4 add cmc auto and delete repeat 4frame sequence go ahead
roger step 5 instead of t plus 6 plus 630 we  its t plus 330 3 plus 30 dump waste water  
roger t plus 330 vice t plus 630
roger and it says waste water or urine its really waste water and urine  the  and we dump 
and vice or
go ahead and  okay and we dump to 40 percent as youve been previously advised also a part of 5 add repeat step 4 damp rates
okay in step 5 add repeat step 4 and damp rates go
step 6 the time there is not 26 plus 30 but its 28 plus 30 also  
roger 28 plus 30 vice 26 plus 30
roger at the bottom we delete repeat 4frame sequence and we add the following t plus 32 plus 0 cmc mode auto and below that repeat step 4 damp rates
okay at the end of step 6 can  cancel repeat frame sequence and add t plus 32 plus 0 cmc auto and then repeat step 4 and damp rates
roger on step 7 its t plus 43 instead of 48 and at the end delete repeat 4frame se quence and add cmc mode auto
okay step 7 is t plus 43 and delete the repeat 4frame and add cmc auto go
roger step 8 we delete enable all jets and what we record is the magazine percent and thats the end of the correction
okay step 8 delete enable all jets and add percent instead of frames
roger thats got it
all righty well do all those
15 this is houston sorry to tell you but i made a couple of errors in that readup can we make it two corrections
okay stand by l please karl
okay karl where are the corrections
its photo 25
okay im on photo 25 tape 144
right at the end of step 5 and step 6 i put in a little statement ssing repeat step 4 damp rates thats really meant to say repeat step 3 which is dsmp rates in both cases
okay understand
15 houston ll 05 45 50 cml go ahead karl
guys at the end of photo 26 when you get through with this sequence requesting 2 seconds of pro tect frame also
okay i  
okay got you
15 houston have a lunar eclipse photo pad on your flight plan page 384 when youre ready
stand by dick
okay im ready to copy the photo pad on the lunar eclipse
okay 2704953
roger 2704953
roger
15 wed like to have omni charlie
omni charlie
15 houston wed like to get the high gain up pitch 22 yaw 261
stand by were maneuvering
okay houston are your high gain angles for the sextant photos or for the lunar eclipse photo attitudes 
sorry about that dave when you complete this maneuver theyre in your flight plan fitch minus 22 yaw 227
roger
15 wed like to have 0mni bravo
0mni bravo
15 houston give us auto and narrow on the high gain please
roger auto and narrow
houston 15 you ready down there
roger 15 were close to ready are you ready for the big press conference
roger were ready anytime you want to go to transmit let us know
okay you can go ahead to transmit
roger
hey 15 were getting a beautiful picture coming through
 roger go ahead with your questions
roger well  well admire the beautiful picture for  for a few minutes here deke just passed out from the shock incidentally
okay fellows i have a preliminary statement to make here the questions you will be asked in this news conference have been submitted by newsmen here at the manned spacecraft center whove been covering the flight some of the questions they raised have been answered in your cmmunications with  with mission control but the public at large has not necessarily heard them the ques tions are being read to you exactly as submitted by the newsmen and in an order of priority specified by them question number 1 since last week we have shared scores of exciting moments with you which single moment would you most like to live again and is there any moment which you would never like to repeat
well i guess we all probably have a different idea on which would be the single most exciting moment of the flight and maybe well just run through it one at a time i guess the most im  pressive moment i can remember is standing up on hadley mountain hadley delta and looking back at the plain and seeing the lm and the rille and mount hadley and the whole big picture in one  one swoop and i think weve got same pictures for you from up there and i believe the tv was running at the same time and i think that was probably the most impressive sight that ive ever seen al
i guess id have to say  sort of two events occurred which were exciting for different reasons and i guess they were really kind of the highlights of  of the flight for me one was right after loi when we got our first look at the moon and it was a fantastic spectacular sight and the other i guess was when tgi burned so beautifully and right after tei that was an awfully good feeling
okay well i guess there were a great many new thrills for me and the one that was most im pressive though was the liftoff it began the flight and i knew that i ws going into space after a few years of waiting and training and then as far as the event that i would not like to  to repeat again was probably the time when i fell down in front of the tv when we were deploying the rover
question number 2 near spur crater you found what may be genesis rock the oldest yet collected on the moon tell us more about it
well i think the one youre referring to was what we felt was almost entirely plagioclase or  perhaps anorthocite and it was a small fragment sitting on top of a  a dark brown larger frag ment almost like on a pedestal and jim and i were both quite impressed with the fact that it  it was there apparently waiting for us and we had hoped to find more of it and im sure had we more time at that site that we would have been able to find more but i think this one rock if it is in fact the beginning of the moon will tell us an awful lot and well leave it up to the experts to analyze it when we get back to determine its origin
question number 3 apollo 15 is already being described as one of the great events in the history of science aside from the crystalline rock what other findings at hadleyapennine seem most im portant to you ll 06 27 06 ib5 i guess immediately i think of the orientation or organization that was revealed in the side of mount hadley theres 14000 feet vertical relief of vast mountain face exposed to us and there was layering in there that was most impressive for the total 14000 feet and we commented on the number of beds we could see that really impressed me that you could have that much organization in  on a large mountain on the moon
question number 4 this is the toughest landing area we have attempted to  to reach on the moon describe what it was like flying into it
well i think to begin with we had every con fidence that we could get to the landing site the trajectory had been modified such that we had ade quate clearance over the mountains and the first sight i had out the window was somewhere around probably 9 or 10000 feet as we passed down below the upper elevations of mount hadley and i could see mount hadley to my left before we pitch  pitched over and saw the  the plain at hadley and that was probably as impressive sight  a sight as ive seen the landing itself once we pitched over was somewhat of a surprise in that the  the craterio was much more subtle than we  had expected there was a great lack of any large fragments or boulders on the surface it was ap parently quite smooth and those rather deep craters which we had anticipated using as landmarks because of their subtlety did not appear quite as readily as we had hoped i think we did recognize our relative position eastwest of the rille be cause of the size of the rille itself i think we were a little off on the northsouth but close enough to handle the traverses in the rover i think that having a vehicle such as that  as that enables us to go into more cgnplicated difficult landing areas because its not necessary to land on an exact point we can take advantage of our mobility and land anywhere within a certain prescribed area which was initially our goal on this flight
question number 5 for a1 worden in lunar orbit you too carried out geologic observations for example you reported cinder cones could you discuss this and other observations from 60 miles up
yes the cmment on the cinder cones was one df color but we noticed particularly on  on some of the lighter part of the back side that many many of the craters that we flew over were filled with what appeared to be lava there seemed to be a great number of lava flows in the  in the mare area particularly mare imbrium mare imbrium  seems to be a just a  countless numbers of  of lava flows which were all apparently very thin and very fluid and you can see  you can just count number  numbers of flow fronts covering mare imbrium so we got i think quite a distinct impression of a  of a  of a great deal of vol canism around the moon and in same particular isolated area such as the littrow area and such as areas like probably the aristarchus plateau theres a great deal of volcanism and some cinder cones and  and certainly a lot of lava flows
question number 6 do you feel that the workload during your three lunarsurface excursions was too demanding you appeared at times to be reaching the limit of your endurance any recommendations for apollo 167 ll 06 b1 24 cdr i think anytime you set out on a task such as the one we had youre bound to at certain times get a little tired which i think we probably did however i think we came back and i dont think we ever reached anywhere near the limit of our physical endurance i think apollo 16 probably has everything in hand its just a matter of conditioning yourself jim and i have discussed it since we got back onboard the endeavour and concluded that our training is what really pre pared us and the many hours we spent during geology field trips and in simulations at the cape in our suits we feel was the factor which really contributed to being able to proceed with those duration evas i see no problem in the future with conducting three successive 7hour evas neither one of us were particularly physically tired i think the fatigue is really in the  the mental regime in which youre concentrating very intensely for 7 hours and youre pressing to do your best all the way through and  and keep your eyes open to make the appropriate ob servations and gather the samples and i think its really more of a mental factor than a physical factor
question number 7 you described the lunar rover as a bucking bronco on the moon would you elaborate and assess the rovers performance and tell us what changes you recommend for the 1972 model ll 06 33 13 iaip well there were several times there when we were riding along where wed hit on a sizable bump and you could  you could see the  the wheels come off the ground and then float through the air and  but dave should cmment more as far as the  the driving and it was really like a bucking bronco thats true because i was strapped in as you know dave had to strap me in because i had some trouble with my seatbelt but i  i really did feel like i was on a  a bucking bronco
i think i might add that its a  its a very stable machine but because of the  the 16th gravity it tends to float in  in the simula tions we ran in houston we saw the same amplitude or the same degree of bouncing but a different damping in other words the  the vehicle would come off the ground or one wheel normally would come off the ground and it would take it some what longer to return to the ground than in one g and i think its just a matter of being  becoming accustomed to the to  driving its a very stable vehicle the suspension system  system is excel lent we had to make some rather sharp avoidance turns periodically and in  in these turns we could tell the vehicle was quite stable no tend  ency to turn over whatsoever i think the only recommendation wed really have would be to come up with a new idea on the seatbelttype arrange ment and we weve discussed that also i think we have some suggestions we could make when we get back to ensure that you can have both crewmen securely in their seats in a short period of time other than that i think the vehicle is about as optimum as you can build
question nmber 8 for dave scott the drill seemed to drive you up the crater walls what was the problem and was it worth the time
i guess id anticipated that question i think the problem was a  a striking discovery when we went to hadley rille we expected to find a regolith or the soil about 5 meters thick and with that in mind like 25 feet i expected to have no trouble putting the heat flow probes in or dril ling the  the core stem because of the expected soft soil after about 1 meter i ran into hard rock and my first thought was it was an isolated rock somewhere within the  the soil but that was not the case apparently what we have is a very thin regolith or a thin soil layer above solid rock and with this in mind i think we brought back a core stem or a deep drillcore of the moon of basic bedrock or foundation rock on hadley plain i think thats a very significant find i think it will be very meaningful to the scientists when they analyze it the perplexing problem was doing the actual drilling and extracting the core stem if you put a drill into solid rock its very diffi cult to get it out and there at the end it took both jim and i with our shoulders pushing as hard as we could up  to extract the drill stem but in the final analysis as i look back on it i think it is indeed worthwhile at the  at the time it occurred we were both interested in mov ing out to the  the northern complex and further geology which jim and i are both quite interested in and the mechanical task of doing the drill at that time seemed what  somewhat less important than seeking new  new finds in a new geological area but in retrospect i think we have in fact brought back one of the most significant samples of the whole trip
question number 9 for dave scott in view of your comment to geologist leon silver about the need for trained scientists on the moon do you think that scientistastronaut jack schmitt should be included in the crew of apollo 17 the last of the apollos 
well since i really have very little sayso as to which  which people get selected for which crews i might sort of bypass it with a  with one com ment that i think the more qualified a man is on the moon the more results youre going to get and i think thats one of the reasons that we put as much time as we did into the geological aspects in hopes of  of learning enough to bring back some significant data i think that in any situa tion such as this in any scientific endeavour that you want the most qualified people possible you must also remember that this is a  a highly complex operational mission it requires a great deal of  of training and skill in order to fly these machines i think in particular jack schmitt is a very highly qualified individual in both as pects and i believe its up to the  the manage ment that when they select the crews to select the best people for the flight
question number l0 for a1 worden what runs through the mind of a man orbiting the moon alone
well i guess  i guess the  the thing foremost in nv mind during those b days was how i was going to keep up with the time line and the flight plan and how i was going to keep track of all the ex  periments we had going and where they were and  and whether they were operating or not and i guess that was a very very fast b days for me when i wasnt looking at the sim bay experiments i was looking out a window and taking pictures and it was a pretty crmmed 3 days as a matter of fact i  i guess i didnt really have  have much time to give any thoughts to being alone up there ljage1490
question number 11 again for al you said after your spacewalk you wish youd stayed out longer what was it like out there between the earth and the moon and why did you come in so soon
well let me answer the last one first i  i guess i didnt come in soon i came in when the job was done and as a matter of fact i made an extra trip back out to take a look at the map ping camera now as  as far as what i felt like when i went out there we talked a little bit about if after  after the eva and decided it was sort of like walking on stage at your high school  dinner dance or something we opened the hatch and it was pitch black and as soon as we got out the sun was beating down on everything and it looked like a very lamge floodlight on a stage and then putting the tv camera out on the door just added a little bit more to that sort of un real feeling that it was time to get out on the stage and do something i think as far as the eva went we did it just almost exactly as wed practiced it it took almost exactly the same amount of time we did it the same way and of course we had practiced that with pan  with the mapping eawra in the extended position and so that  that really posed no difficulty to us
question number 12 for dave and jim you  you didnt have time to get to north complex craters which my have been formed volcanically and where you thought some surprises might be found was this a significant loss
well ill start out and  and throw an answer there i think if you look back at the original requirements for the landing at the hadley apennines they were primarily to inspect the front and the rille it was only after a  a consider able amount of study had been done and some re arrangement in the flight plan  the timing on the surface that we found we had enough time to plan to go to the northern complex so the northern complex was in fact an addition to the original requirement it was bonus and i think because jim and i have spent so much time with volcanics in our terrestrial geology work that we were quite interested in getting to the northern complex to see if in fact it was a volcanic area but i dont believe we lost anything from the lunar sur face by not going there only we would have had an  extra bonus had we been able to reach that point and with that in mind i hope that some day some body gets a chance to go back and take a look at the northern complex jim do you want to answer
no i agree with everything you said it was just a little personal disappointment that we couldnt get up there because we  we thought wed have another beautiful view of the  the plains there and the i24a view almost as beautiful as it  as it was from the side of hadley delta
question number 13 for each of you would you please in your own words tell us what you gave the american taxpayers besides a few hours of good television
well i think  the magnitude of the scientific  data we return will speak for the taxpayers money the small amount of time they had for television i think is rather insignificant relative to the amount of return weve gathered in the sim bay and in the lunar samples we have aboard right now i think these data will not only en  enhance the progress of science but it will reach the common man on the street directly by the  the byproducts of what we learn i think man must extend himself the new frontiers must be open in order for us to  to propagate mnkind and i think this is one way in which we do it i  i feel that the taxpayers got probably  as a matter of fact i hope they got more than their moneys worth out of the flight and if you could see the size of the film maga zines that a1 brought in yesterday from those ca meras why youd see that we have indeed at least a great deal of data on film alone
well i really guess that theres not much to add to what dave said he  he expressed my sentiments exactly in that the  the knowledge that hopefully weve  weve added to our store of information about the moon and about ourselves will be increased in an extent which is greater than  than the   than the capital that was  spent on the flight itself and i would certainly think that  that the full theory adds significantly to  to mans knowledge about hqelf primarily and about hmelf in those areas where it will help future genera tions maybe 
i can only add that were bringing back just a lot of  lot of data and a lot of material and its going to take many years for people to really appreciate how much was gained from  from this flight
question number 14 it seemed this flight has as many problems as some of the old gemini missions which of these gave you the most concern and for dave did you ever feel you were back on gemini viii
well i guess we werent aware we had that many problems i thought this was a rather trouble free flight myself we went a long way we spent a long time doing the job and i think relative to the number of systems we have in all the space craft that we had very few problems i can think of none that were significant that would enable me to compare it with gemini viii at all we had a  i guess the first little problem we had was a  a leak in our water system which was cleared up rather rapidly by somebody having already done some investigation and having a procedure at hand i believe our system is such that people have all the anticipated problems understood and when they have them understood they come up with solu tions which are quite meaningful and successful and i feel like the spacecraft and the lifesupport systems on the moon and everything worked exceed ingly well i  i guess really i couldnt ask for much more how about you
you know really we had very few problems it seemed like a very tame simulation as far as i was concerned certainly there were  there were  there were irritating things that happened like some circuit breakers in the spacecraft here that gave us some trouble and some lights that arent working exactly right but certainly none of the important aspects of the flight or  or none of the essential pieces of equipment have malfunc tioned and i think its been just great
gentlemen wed like to continue the press confer ence in a few minutes but in the meantime wed be anxious to get  start  get one of you started on the lunar eclipse photos we have three more questions question  
okay 
question number 15  for dave and jim how many times did each of you fall down on the lunar sur face did any of these falls hurt you or give you any problems ll 06 47 57  well i fell down twice and it was never any real problem actually i could have got up very well by myself without any help
yes i guess i fell down twice too and as jim said it was never any real problem its a matter of if you start to go  and of course the terrain there i guess you could see in the television was quite rough and irregular with occasionally rocks around and we were pressing to try and get things done and it was just a matter if you just start losing your balance to go ahead and go easy and accept somewhat of a  a light fall because of the 16th gravity there was never any impact when we hit take it easy and get up slow and i dont think either one of us ever came anywhere near the point of being hurt in that sense of the matter its just a matter of slowing you up for a minute enabling you to re gain your balance and go ahead and i  i have a question do you want to have the photos of lunar eclipse with the television now or do you want us to get on with the  tha camera photos because if thats the case we have to turn the lights out in here
roger were going to skip down to the last question dave which says your cabin must be jammed with moon rocks core samples suits and assorted hardware can you show us what its like in there and as you show us around you can get set up for the moon photos and dim the lights when you like
okay i guess to show you around we have to un stow everything were  were pretty well stowed for reentry right now we have all the samples stowed the suits are all stowed and i guess in  order to show you around wed have to do some unstowing because under  beneath the couches right now its jsmmed full and i guess wed like to do that for you but its some  somewhat imprac tical in that all you can see would be some edges of some white bags and thats why we have the room in the cabin here every  everythings pretty well squared away hut when we get back im sure youll have an opportunity to see the many things we have and theres really a lot of it
0  okay dave thats fine and i guess one last request is when you get over to that window to  and before you take the photos could you give us a quick picture of the moon with the tv camera
sure will
15 the word here is to proceed give your photog raphy first priority there and maybe we can see the  the moon out of the other window
okay were working on it
15 houston we hear that your attitude is very good right now theres no need to trim the maneuver
okay thank you
okay houston i think you have a picture of her now there she is
15 so far we have a blank screen down here
oh really ive got a good picture on the monitor
hang on for a moment please
its coming through now
thats a beautiful picture with just an edge of the moon coming out of eclipse
roger thats right
15 houston wed like to ask if youve got full zoom there
roger its all the way out
could you please give us alc to peak
i think we are just stand by 1 1t 06 56 43 cdr 
hello endeavour this is yankee clipper over
hello yankee clipper how are you 11 06 59 59 ncc roger ive got a naval tradition to pass on to you
go ahead
roger when ships of the line have completed a mission such as yours and they return to home port they always have a broom flying from the yardarm over
roger well well do that
thank you
we wouldnt want to break any traditions dicky ll 07 o0 33 ncc dave im watching you i wouldnt let you
that a boy and im glad
okay houston were going to switch windows herewith the tv camera so we can switch windows f with the camera cameras
roger dave
15 houston when somebody gets a free hand up there could we start the charge on battery a were afraid that might keep us from going to bed if we dont get it started soon  tape 1751 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
houston the moon is an orange ball now  a dull orange ball with a sort of a gray area in the cen ter on  on one side opposing the side thats slowly coming into illumination at the present time and youll possibly get more and more of the lunar surface exposed to sunlight as we go along here the picture you have is really pretty good for what we see because theres very little illu mination on the moon and only when we get the cockpit lights down reasonably low and get our face up in the window can we see the definition so its really not a bad picture
roger 15 thanks for the description and the picture were getting down here is quite good also
okay im sure youll have a much better one here in a few minutes ll 07 202 cc apollo 15 houston over
houston 15 go
roger it looks llke youve had enough of the pho  photography for right now its beginning to get pretty bright on the tube i guess we can go ahead and power it down
·okay
thats interesting houston because it looks like only about  oh maybe 120th or so maybe of the moon is illuminated at this time just a thin sliver but very bright
roger copy dave  11 07 15 49  roger
apollo 15 houston request sband aux to science please
roger
houston apollo 15
roger apollo 15 go ahead
in getting ready for the contamuation photography we find that weve got a  a certain number of exposures left in the nikon namely were on exposure number 29 in mag victor and we think we have 45 total which would enable us to complete the contamination photography with the nikon if you desire rather than with the dac as you changed
15 they plan on using those last 15 frames or so on victor for postmission callbration so we still intend to press on with the dac please dave
all right understand thank you
and dave if you give us a start time on that ill give you a call at the end because we want you to cycle some extra film through the dac to give them a little leader there at the end to protect their film or something
okay well do that stand by
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead bob
roger we were seeing the optics tripped around against the hard stops wed like to have you bring them back and then zero them in per the usual procedure we kind of guess youre getting ready for 52 anyway arent you
pretty soon
and 15 we have your torquing angles you go to  torque
roger in 30 seconds
apollo 15 houston if one of you guys is free weve got some updates we could read to you
okay houston 15 stand by 1
okay understand youre ready what  the first thing is an entry pad so you might whip out your entry checklist
okay houston 15 go ahead and  from that
roger would you believe it were going to land in the midpacific and after that its 000 153 000 2944137 267 plus 2612 minus 15810 062 36097 650 10848 36179 2945837 0029 noun 69s are na 400 0213 0018 0338 0744 04 1403 375 213 down 096 right 47 lift vector up comments 1 use nonexit ems pattern 2 ret of 90 k 6 plus 06 ret of mains 8 plus 32 landing 13 plus 29 constant g roll right moonset time 2945620 over
okay houston understand entry pad midpac 000 153 000 2944137 267 plus 2612 minus  15810 062 36097 650 10848 36179 295837 0029 400 0213 0018 0338 0744 04 1403 375 213 down 096 right 47 lift vector up comments nonex  use nonexit ems pattern ret 90 k is 6 plus 06 ret mains 8 plus 32 ret landing 13 plus 29 constant g is roll right moonset at 2945620
roger al good readback and wed be interested in knowing the status of the ems check you ran 2 or 3 hours ago if you have it
yes sir the ems check was just fine
okay thats good to know at the end of your contamination experiment here well be going into this mass spec boom test and if you guys let me know when youre ready weve got a procedure to  read up to you for that  that well read up to you at that time i assume youve been told that we arent going to a midcourse 6 and right now mid course 7 is looking like 09 which is  makes it kind of problematical as to whether we burn it or not weather in the recovery area is currently predicted to be for your splashdown 15knot winds 4foot seas 2000 scattered l0 miles in other  words looking better and better all the time
roger bob that sounds great
apollo 15 houston if youll give us accept well give you a very slight clock update to sync you for entry and be advised we will not be sending a state vector uplink at this time your vector is still just as good as the one on the ground
roger understand and youve got accept
15 your computer
roger thank you apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
15 houston request you trim back to the original attitude now
okay
and again if one of you has a couple of minutes we can tell you a couple of other things
okay in  in other words you want us to maneuver back to the original attitude rather than just damp rates huh
roger yes wed like to use the same star back grounds so that means going back to the original attitude in the flight plan around 27120 or so 
okay  ll 08 38 16 cc which is what you got called up
no we dont have that called up all we have is damp rates but well do that oh what we have called up here yes okay
and 15 houston if one of you has some time wed like to talk about some stowage please
okay go ahead
okay weve gone over the stowage which you read down this morning and everythings shipshape except we have one question on one item and that concerns the stowage of the core stems the core stems should be stowed in the sleep restraint that has the cmps pga in it we understand that its now stowed in the bag on the side of a8 i guess our first question is how many  how long is the core stem at the present time did you break it down or is it still three sections long which we think it is on the ground
no its still three sections long and we could put it in the sleep restraint it just seemed like a convenient place to stick it in the bag over there to keep it tied down well
okay next question is howd you get it in the a8 bag which according to our measurements on the ground is only 36 inches long and therefore apparently not long enough to hold the three lengths of core stem
well its sticking out a little bit i guess we have to admit but its pretty well cinched down
okay stand by
but its no problem we can put it anyplace you like
okay dave i guess we  i dont think it makes an awful lot of difference but itd probably make a lot of other people happy if we ended up putting it inthe sleep restraint they wouldnt worry about that loose end hanging out there  if its not too much trouble
oh its no problem at all be glad to do that
thank you
you know we know what number one priority on this spacecraft is
we wouldnt  we wouldnt lose that or misplace it or get it rattled around for anything bob
no comment
and you say everything else is okay huh
roger everything else is aokay
oh boy
and 15 reminder or a question did you guys get the word that they like a pad of about 2 seconds worth of 24 frames per second at the end of those photos to protect these things
roger we got that bob thank you
and if you guysil give me a call when youre ready to do the mass spec boom test ill read it up to you
all righty houston stand by
houston 15
go ahead 15
okay you going to read up the procedures real time on the mass spec boom
roger
okay why dont we go ahead and do that the while were finishing up the contamination photos
okay standby okay 15 the first step is mass spec boom to retract talkback barber pole for 4 minutes or until gray if talkback fully gray within 4 minutes deploy boom and return to flight plan over
roger understand you want retract on the mass spec boom for 4 minutes and if it goes gray be f fore then go back to deploy and return to the flight plan
thats affirmative and give  give us a call when you get done
roger
come in houston 15
go ahead 15
okay theres 4 minutes of retract and its still barber pole
okay if the talkback is not fully gray in 4 minutes lets go to mass spec boom off center for i min ute thats just to let the motor cool down
okay its off now
okay
and what at the end of the i minute
okay at the end of the i minute we will deploy it for 20 seconds and then off center and then we will retract for 40 seconds or until the talk back is 12 barber pole or fully gray and then off over
okay got you
okay going to extend
okay
and do you want to pause it off between extend and retract ih 08 53 53 cc stand by not necessary to pause between deploy and retract on this
okay its in retract now
copy 11 08 5h 43 cmp okay houston thats the 40 seconds of retpct and its at half barber pole and i turned it off
okay in that case wed like you to repeat the 20second deploy 40second retract sequence twice more and if gray talkback is still not obtained well turn it off and wait until 275 hours at which point well give you a call and well replay  well repeat that over
okay fine well cycle that whole thing twice more
roger 1 08 57 16 cc 15 houston wed like to proceed with the fuel cell purges now to get those out of the way before the p23s i1 08 57 25 cmp roger houston
houston mass spec boom has been cycled three times ail i can get out of it is a half barber pole and ive got it turned off right now
roger copy al well call you at 275 hours to repeat that the reason for that is that pres ently were sort of sitting in a coldsoak attitude were going to repeat it at 275 hours when were sort of in a hotsoak attitude 11 08 5u 43 cmp okay r
apollo 15 houston wed like to go to ion source off and mass spec experiment to standby
ion source off and mass spec to standby
roger i1 09 28 48 cc 15 houston al we missed your last noun 49
okay ill show you this one
thanks
15 houston looks like a good set of p23s again al and your gmma right now on your vector is 65
it sounds like after a whilejwe might get along without you huh bob
no comment
as a matter of fact if you guys keep working on your ground vectors they might even converge to the onboard vectors pretty soon
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston 15
roger 27405 wed like to delete the mass spec line where you turn on multiplier low et cetera well delete that
okay well delete that line robert thank you sir
thank you
and houston 15
go ahead 15
roger want us to  delete the logic power two if were going to do the mass spec at 275
15 thats affirmative
okay
and 15 houston you got any more updates to our flight plan
no but ill scan it over and if i find any ill let you know apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription
apollo 15 houston over
houston 15 go
roger we have an update to the flight plan if you guys are ready to copy
roger were ready to copy
okay the attitude that we maneuver to at 27446 there for the second set of xrays should be changed  that verb 49 maneuver should be changed to 196 346 012 over
roger understand the verb 49 maneuver to xray pointing attitude should be changed to 196 346 012
roger and before we start that verb 49 maneuver at 27445 or thereabouts wed like to cover the ex  wed like to close the experiment covers alphaxray to close thats the one on panel 278 and then after we get to attitude at about 27500 well go ahead and open those covers again the alphaxrays
roger understand you want the alphaxray covers closed before the maneuver and opened after the maneuver
roger these  the new position i sent you up on that  those two steps there in the procedure are to keep from getting sunlight right in on some of the stuff to protect it and   11 t0 39 19 cdr okay
  and also at this time you may terminate the battery a charge
okay terminating battery a charge
houston 15
go ahead 15
roger bob do you want us to go to standby on xray while the door is closed or is it okay to leave it on
roger you can leave it on  dave
okay
apollo 15 houston request omni charlie please
omni charlie
apollo 15 omni delta please
0mni delta
apollo 15 houston over
houston 15 go ahead
roger remember back a ways we were talking about doing some more mass spec boom tests at 275 hours which has gone by were right now talking about delaying that until 276 hours approximately or at least until before you start your verb 49 maneuvers for the next set of p23s over
okay fine
were just letting it heat soak a little bit longer
and houston 15 i have some command module rcs injector temperatures for you
ready to copy
okay these are readings off the systems test meter 5a is 4  or 5c is 42 5d is 39 6a is 41 b is 42 c is greater than 5 and d is 45
roger copy 42 39 41 42 greater than  and 45
roger apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead bob
roger if one of you fellows has the time we might like to continue on with the mass spec boom retract test
okay is it something i should write down or can i just do it real time
ill give it to you real time its not that com plicated jim
okay go ahead
okay we need the experiment switch to on down there in the alpha  excuse me the mass spec ex  periment switch to on and the i0n source on over
okay understand mass spec experiment on and ion source on stand by
okay bob theyre both on
okay and then next you go down to the other panel and we go deploy for 20 seconds on the mass spec boom and then retract for 40 seconds or until we get a gray indication over
understand you want deploy for 20 seconds and then  on the mass spec boom and then retract until we get gray for 40 seconds  11 11 56 44 cc roger whichever occurs first
okay 11 11 58 17 i2v5 okay bob it went gray after 30 seconds
roger copy stand by
okay 15 looks like its a cold soak problem then jim well just deploy it all the way out and leave it there 
okay you want us to deploy it all the way now huh
right after we did all that work and succeeded in retracting it now well deploy it
okay well deploy it
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead bob
roger al recommendation from the ground here theyd like to see  maybe as many as five optics calibration marks the next time instead of the two its just to give them some data
okay ill relay that information to our navigator 
sorry about that jim you sound like a1 these days
oh were getting so we all sound alike up here
apollo 15 houston were standing by ready to copy your noun 49s
15 houston wed like high gain pitch at minus 30 yaw of 150
okay pitch minus 30 and yaw plus 5  150
roger
and do you want us to go ahead and try and lock it up
please do
thank you al
apollo 15 houston over
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston
roger guidance says thank you to al and if  a couple other things here if one of you guys has a chance wed like a mag  magazine status read out tonight and were seeing some noise on daves biosensors he might want to check them or push them down a little bit or something
okay ill do that and you want a magazine status readout what do  what do you mean by that exactly
roger that means how many pictures been taken in some of the magazines there i think als been doing it he probably knows whats going on if he can tell you
okay i  i guess we dont have a good answer for you on that bob theyre all stowed away and  theyve all been recorded as weve gone along is there any particular need for them before tomorrow sometime
negative dave thats a good answer it turns out
okay i think youll find them all neatly tucked away and recorded when  when you get them on the ship
if youre wondering how many pictures we took at last count night before last it was something like 1840 some
understand 1847
or somewhere around the ball park  11 12 45 56 cc is that plus or minus one
i think that was lm though maybe yes then you have to add to that the command module
you mean like a mile of pan camera film huh
something like that it looks like it ought to hold a mile by the size of the thing
houston 15
go ahead 15
well i had  had the log out here and i took a look at it and as last count last night we were 2631 on hasselblad pictures total
copy
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston 15
roger dave the interest in the mags was with reference to uv  the mags for the uv photography tomorrow so the interest was in the number of frames remaining on magazine mike and magazine papa try  trying to determine which of those would be usable for tomorrows uv photography
okay i think weve got that log in the flight plan stand by until a1 finishes his p23s and well take a look
roger understand no big rush
think well use a mag that has some film in it
say again dave
i said at  at any rate well use a mag that has some film in it tomorrow
thats a good idea
apollo 15 houston requesting gamma ray gainstep shield off now please
roger shield off now
that was a good mark al
yes and it didnt update the state vector very much
apollo 15 houston
go ahead
roger congratulations al youve just been voted to receive a second vasco da gama award for that we were afraid you were going to do them all the way through the rest period
well theyre fun enough i wouldnt mind
so were we
laughter okay and  
it wouldnt have taken nearly so long if you hadnt wanted five mks per each star
roger al ill tell you about that some time and 15 were configured for the emod dump if you fellows want to give it to us
okay its coming does our bio data look any better
roger yes it does
okay
and as you get ready for the ptc wed like to do the ptc at 042 there again tonight as last night although its changing the noun 79 value there at 27714
roger bob i guess we use that as standard pro cedure now the 4200 ll 13 17 21 qc roger you dont have to do it tomorrow night f that way though
okay use a different number tomorrow night
and apollo 15 be advised that tomorrow when youre taking your p23 marks five marks on the cal and then three marks on the stars for the p23 itself will be sufficient
okay understand five marks on the cal and three on each star
roger roger
hey houston 15 weve got the presleep checklist ready too
roger were standing by
okay the crews all ready for bed no medication and the onboard readout battery cj37 pyro bat a 371 b 371 rcs a 55 b 50 c is 48 d 52 and i guess everything else is done youve got your ememory dump and were ready to power down as soon as we get the ptc going apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription
roger dave as far as were concerned were all finished also we will not be uplinking a state vector to you we might have to do that some time just for practice but so far we havent needed to uplink one to you you guys are doing pretty super on those p23s
compensating errors
i cant believe that was a unanimous vote dave
no it was only two to one
apollo 15 houston youre go to start to spinup for ptc
okay bobby thank you
and apollo 15 wed like you to check that the potable tank inlet valve is open please
roger understand potable tank inlet valve open
houston 15
all right go ahead 15
okay listen potable tank inlet valve is open and has been the whole flight what prompted the question
stand by
were just curious  ll 13 30 56 cc 15 we saw a drop in the potable at the same time that the waste tank was staying stable and we were  just concerned that it might have gotten out of configuration we certainly expected it to be open we just wanted to check it before you went to sleep so we didnt have to wake you up
okay understand yes  were reading potable  at 90 percent
roger were reading 94 11 13 43 2 cc apollo 15 houston no need to acknowledge but wed like to put the dsky to sleep before you guys go to sleep tapes 1801831 apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription rest period  no communications apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription

oh my yes
good morning dave
good morning joe that got everybody up 11 22 32 55 c morning jp
morning alfredo
joe sounds like youre really in harmony this morning
thats one
okay houston endeavour we got a postsleep checklist for you
okay dave go ahead
okay about 8 hours apiece on the sleep and ready for your consumables
roger at 286 plus 30 rcs total 36 percent quad a 41 36 30 37 h2 tank 27 24 and 29 02 tank 43 44 and 37 ive got the worlds smallest list of updates for your flight plan and ive got the news snmmary when youre ready
okay give us a couple of minutes on those thank you apollo 15 airt0ground voice transcription
houston endeavour
go ahead
well we just got our first view of the earth this morning and can you believe its getting larger and its getting smaller we see just a very very thin sliver of a very large round ball
roger dave i believe that
and go ahead on the updates joe
roger dave these are the flight plan updates for today and  would you believe  i dont have any dap load changes to give you which is fortu nate the first addition is at 288 plus 18 and it reads xray to off alpha particle to off
okay 28818 xhay off and alpha off go
roger and all the rest are just reminders really the first one at  on  at 290 on the uv photos page youve already changed the two frames line to read one frame at 20 seconds and the second frame at 2 seconds a reminder to use mag papa instead of mag metro and finally wed like to remind you to enable all jets before beginning the maneuvers today and were  were thinking now well likely do amidcourse 7 correction of about  probably around 5 feet per second over
okay i got the uv on the change and the  enable all jets prior to maneuvers and youre looking at midcourse 7 of 5 thats very interesting
its also not certain but well keep you posted on that and thats all the official updates i have for you i have a news smmary if youd like to listen
okay everybodys in  go ahead
roger and this will be a short one the rest of it you can read for yourselves today in the papers congress has started a monthlong summer  recess setting the pattern for a governmentwide exodus likely to make washington a virtual ghost town for the rest of august the senate finally quit at 730 friday night more than 6 hours after the house had adjourned at about 1 in the afternoon and after passing an 18 billion higher education bill and three key appropriations measures besides the laborhew appropriations the senate approved friday a 1 billion measure to provide public ser vice jobs mainly for vietnam veterans and a con tinuing resolution to fund agencies still without regular appropriations until the 15th of october in chile four sic government ministers present their resignations to president salvador allende on friday causing the first cabinet crisis since the president took office last november i have a long list of baseball scores which i think ill skip over here in exhibition football the buffalo bills downed the new orleans saints 14 to 10 and the cowboys won over the la rams 45 to 21 in the american golf classic at the firestone country club in akron ohio jerry heard is still leading with 7 under par 133 at the halfway mark and bob lunn is next with a 4 under par 136 the united states basketball team was eliminated yes terday in the panamerican games in colombia and the us baseball team was upset by the dominicl republic 5 to 4 in tennis stan smith is the last seeded player still in competition at the western championships in cincinnati and today in chestnut hills massachusetts marty riessen meets australian ken rosewall and south african cliff drysdale meets john newcombe in the semi finals of the us professional tennis tournament d thats all i have from here over
okay thank you joe thats interesting
hey houston 15 by the way where did the 5 feet per second come from should we get our trusty navigator up there to navigate some more for you
dave it probably came for  from the uncoupled  thrusting we were doing yesterday other than that im not really sure its  its by no means certain anyway were just i guess  well be watch ing it today and get back with you with the final bit of information on it
okay very good just thought maybe wed get our navigator to navigate again and it would probably go away as most of them have done so far
endeavour the saturday morning weather report for the landing area reads high scattered 2000 scat tered 15knot winds out of the eastnortheast 10 miles vis and waves going to 4 feet it should be well above your personal minimum

roger correction of the flight plan wed like to have all crewmembers on the biomed harness for entry i suspect that means that dave wont be doffing his about now
okay i guess we could give you two the  our trusty cmp has his off and stowed for entry
roger copy
okay 15 looks like the surgeons can live with that without too much trouble 12 00 34 18  roger
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead houston
okay if you guys have a moment or two we have some flight plan updates concerning entry  entry cue cards and entry checklist over
stand by
well bob itll be about a half an hour before were ready to talk about those changes
okay jim give me a call when youre ready
okay
houston 15 i have some valve temps for you
roger 15 were ready to copy
okay 5c is 45 5d is 44 6a 44 44 46 and 45
roger copy
apollo 15 houston be advised we are looking at the present time at a midcourse 7 burn of 56 feet per second retrograde over
okay we copy
15 houston we have your torquing angles
roger thank you
apollo 15 request omni chariie please
roger omni charlie
houston apollo 15 were ready for your entry updates now if you like
roger 15 understand youre ready for the update tell a1 that was another super set of arcs certainly
yes that one came out pretty fair didnt it
okay 15 the first change is in the entry check list second page and on page 12 we wish to delete step 21 which is the dsky condition light test
okay step 21 deleted
you may remember that one from the sim thats the one with the  gives us the p35 and turns the pipas off momentarily
yes i guess we dont want to do that today   
thats  thats a roger okay the next one dave is on page 6 when were checking the circuit breaker configuration on panel 8 and were going to add sps pilot valve a main a and b main b open verify over
okay sps pilot valves main a and b both open and  configuration of the circuit breakers on panel 8 go ahead
okay then if we go down to the entry cue card down to the p67 section
okay go
okay down there near the middle where it says steering commands downrange error minus 6 to 0 that should be changed to downrange error minus 24 to 0 over
roger just like it is in the checklist right and i think we noticed that last night looking it over
okay and next on the second line under the noun 68 theres a comment that says negative if plus ems and theres a certain amount of unhappiness with that statement down here they say that you can have a positive hdot in p67 nominally and therefore the statement on the cue card that this is a fail indication is not a good idea i understand vance discussed this with a1 beforehand
okay well scratch that i dont think well get to a p66  67 turnover anyway but well scratch that one out thank you bob
roger we hope not and we have a question here dave that we need an answer for apparently con cerning stowage people are concerned about the hooks on the back of the r12 the flight data file container which is now stowed in one of the pga bags and they are concerned that those hooks be placed in such a way that they will not be in any danger of piercing the aft bulkhead  the pres sure bulkhead so i guess you can tell how theyre placed or whats underneath them to prevent such occurrences
okay well make sure of that and i guess the problem with r12 was that once we got all the lm data onboard we didnt have any place to put it or else we didnt have any place to put the lm data and if you have any better suggestions on where to put them well be glad to do it
i dont think we have any right now dave i guess the quickest thing would have been to just put it in the pga bag with the hooks pointing up
okay well do that
and one reminder dave you guys undoubtedly know it just a reminder that you will not have any back lighting for the scroll and no lighting on the roll bug today
okay no back lighting for the scroll and no lighting on the roll bug thank you
have anything else bob
no dave thats all i have for the moment
okay thats pretty easy
houston were standing by for a vhf cbmm check
stand by jim well see if theyre ready
15 houston well have to stand by for another few hours to get you close enough to do that vhf comm check 12 01 38 54 up all right roger we understand

eightytwo percent
copy 82 percent 12 0i 42 07 cc apollo 15 houston over
houston 15 go tape1865
roger could you guys check the potable tank inlet valve again for us and find out whether it is in the closed or open position once again what were seeing is the waste tank increase and the potable tank has been staying constant all morning
okay last night when you called i even went down and recycled that valve and made sure it was in the detent in the open position which it was
okay in that case could you go down and cycle it from closed to open again for us please
roger were doing that right now
okay it was still open and a1 cycled it from open to closed and back to open
okay thank you its no big deal dave nothing to worry about
might as well get everything all trmmed up
thats what were trying to do apollo 15 airtoground voice transcription j 12 02 00 24 cc apollo 15 houston requesting omni delta

roger
15 houston were noticing some drift in roll if youre not through with the uv photos wed like you to retrim back to attitude please
okay and we are finished with the uv photos
okay takes care of that one
apollo 15 houston over
go ahead bob
okay if you guys got a minute we can do a few things here number l if you give us accept well send you some state vector and target loads and number 2 we have a couple comments to read to you
okay you have accept and stand by
roger youre getting the uplink and were standing by
15 the computers yours you have state target and refsmmat  12 02 32 01 cdr roger thank you
and houston were all on you can go with your comments
okay first one news concerning the water business  weve been having you check that valve it looks to us now as though theres a blockage into the potable tank you got obviously  a  far more water than you need to survive the rest of the mission but it does mean that the waste tank will be filling up and there is a possibility that it will start to vent about an hour or 2 before ei its been discussed down here and decided that the best way to do this is  far as not perturbing the vector too much  is to let it relieve overboard and not to do a dump ahead of time or turn the water boiler on ahead of time in line with this we might just verify that the pressure relief valves down on panel 352  the water control panel is in the relief position it certainly should be there its just a  a little verification to make sure were  were not going wrong there second i  
okay thats verified
okay thank you second item is we suggest that it might be reasonable to put some tape over the sps light on the ems to keep you from confusing with the 05g light in case you have a problem there al thats your option obviously it just a suggestion
oh i dont think hell have any confusion with that
okay
 make sure we watch it
and the third question is from your comments when we were talking about r12 some people believe you may be asking us a question that you have a problem with stowage of some of the extra lm data file or have you found a place for that already
oh no thats all tucked away in r3 very  very neatly we have no  no problem at all with the stowage we just wanted to locate r12 in a nice soft spot and secure it down which it is
okay we  we were  crank up building 45 to find you a location if you needed it  12 02 34 20 cc and 15 houston weve got an entry pad and a midcourse 7 pad if youre ready to copy

okay very good 04 17 48 33 lmi okay jettison bag coming at you
okay okay ive got it now standing by for the lec 04 17 48 48 4p okay it confidentiaii
okay houston while hes working on the lec let me comment that it certainly is a stark place here at fra mauro i think its made all the more stark by the fact that the sky is completely black
roger
okay i have the conveyor now have the bag and its deployed and standing by to deploy the mesa and the mesa has released mesa has released properly houston
starting down the ladder
roger al
oke al beautiful we can see you coming down the ladder right now it looks like youre about on the bottom step on the surface
okay youre right a1 is on the surface and its been a long way but were here and i can see the reason we have a tilt is because we landed on the slope the landing gear struts appear to be about evenly depressed
im moving around getting familiar  
roger al
  getting familiar with the surface the surface on which the forward footpad landed is extremely soft as a matter of fact its in a small depres sion the  the soil is so soft that it comes up all the way to the top of the footpad it even folded over the sides to some degree the same is true of the plusy strut
okay well move on over take a look at fra maro i  take a look at cone crater i should say which is right where it should be and is a very impressive sight you can see the boulders near the rim as  
antares this is houston you are go for twoman a over onfidentt
roger hou  houston thank you
and continuing we can see the boulders that are on the rim it looks as though we have a good traverse route up to the top of cone i can see cone ridge going along to the north thats very apparent
im moving over to adjust the mesa
roger al
and houston im finishing up my circuit breaker check will be ready to go out shortly
roger ed
okay the mesa is adjusted going over to remove the met blanket
okay al im starting out
okay
okay ed we can see you coming down the ladder now
and its very great to be coming down
roger bottom step
the last one is a long one 04 17 56 17 p ascent check very easy to do a little push and just spring right up
we got there with those lightweight units
yes sure glad they did too thats great 0b 17 56 45 cc al this is houston have you released the met yet over 04 17 56 51 p hes releasing it now
okay houston the met is finally clear of the sa confidentiai
al im going to come over how about getting my antenna out before i lose comm here in a minute
okay
if i go around the corner or something
okay just drop this baby over here
okay
its bright upsun isnt it
okay if youll stop here a minute ill get your antenna out stand by 1 okay youre now deployed okay
thank you
okay houston the mesa has been stowed on the plusy footpad
roger out
im going back to adjust the mesa
mobility is  very great under this crushing onesixthg load houston
roger
and looking at cone crater where a1 was looking a short time ago it doesnt appear there is going to be any trouble getting the met up cone crater
the backup crew copies
i knew they would
we knew the troops on the ground would be glad to hear that
the mesa blanket is coming off here age330 ccinfidentjtill
here comes the lens cap
youll lose television for a moment
roger mesa blanket
okay thats beautiful
okay senor
let me give you a hand and well get it dcne
okay 04 18 00 24 lm put this back on
ed  04 18 00 31 lm great 0h 18 o0 36 cdr okay the lens cap is going on now houston while we set up the tripod  move the tv to another location
antares this is houston request emu statu check here 04 18 00 52 i okay houston lmp is 375 psi reading  5 85 percent all flags go on  
min cooling oh 18 01 10 lmp min cooling
okay cdr here is 81 percent
and a1   oh 18 01 17 cdr cdr is 81 percent 375 no flags min cooling
roger out youre looking good down here
and houston while als getting that television ill go ahead and get my contingency sample get it out of the way iikdnfide
roger ed
houston the contingency sample is being taken about 25 feet to the  in the 0100 position of the lm adjacent to a  about a 5foot crater ill identify it for you later ok 18 03 08 cc roger out
do you want to watch the cable as we go out ed
okay
al this is houston would you verify the lens is still capped over
thats affirmative 04 18 04 38 lmi keep going oh 18 04 40 cdr okay its about 50 feet id say 0 18 ok 4 lp why dont we get al2 the cable out while were at it
okay go ahead and pull it out and ill 
okay let me get this contingency sample folded up
okay houston the lens cap is off were aiming for the general area of mesa 04 18 05 h0  akcan you pull this  the rest of this cable out away from the mesa here
and we got about  foot zoom how does that look
okay i think you can zoom in a little more lets try 40 here
okay and on the fstop al wed like to stop it down one additional stop thats toward the higher numbers
okay its going from 22 to 44 and ill zoom it in to 40 stand by confident
okay hold the zoom there and the position looks good also
okay how about the fstop
is the fstop satisfactory houston
al this is houston see if you can stop it down a little more run it up  run the diaphragm ring up against the stop there its still a little bright
okay its right up against the stop
its up against the stop houston
roger stand by al this is rouston request you goto peak control
okay going to peak satisfactory
okay al now wed like to open it up to f22
okay this is the  the adjustment to f22 there you go
al this is houston would you confirm that youre at f22 now
okay im confirming that im in peak and that im at f22
and while were waiting for the television adjust ments the 0230 position approximately 50 feet where the camera is is slightly uphill we see that the lm did in fact land on the  sort of a  a downslope it appears to be in  almost a basin
al this is houston
go ahead
roger al this is houston wed like o go back to average and f44 stop it do all the way and then leave it there it confident4 iii
okay this is the last adjustment going to f44 and going  
roger and back the zoom out to about 35
  and going to average and back the zoom out to 35 how does that look
beautiful
okay pressing on sband antenna  
roger press
again continuing  continuing the soil is very fine here  very fine grain and as we mentioned before there is  there are very few samples that  of any size at all mostly handsample size and stacks of generally under 2 inches or less
roger houston as you can see the src table is deployed bb is emptied and im putting the lioh canisters in it now
roger ed and you did leave the contingency sample on the ladder
thats affirmative thats where it is
houston it looks as though weve landed in a fairly rough place
yes indeed it does evidenced by the fact that you dug your front landing gear into a hole
and houston i have the swc out and setting out to deploy it
roger ed
am i still in your field of view houston
affirmative
okay pag e34 c nfident 5 jl day
okay a1 is bringing the sband antenna around positioning
roger al were watching you
and houston the swcs in place
roger ed thats 114 plus 53 plus 48 get swc
and houston the lr cubed is coming off
roger ed
al this is houston if you would give us the commentary on how the legs go into the surface
okay the legs are in the surfae approximaey 1 inch i would say appear to be fairly equal all the way around  perhaps the leg to the left is in an inch and a half
roger we were driving more at force penetration and did you meet any rocks or anything like thav
i didnt attempt to run any kind of an experiment  forcing the legs down i just  just  
roger i copy 04 18 17 17 lm and here comes the sband antenna cable al youre too far away 0b 18 17 2k cc looks more like a kangaroo 04 18 17 25 4p it should have more cable than that its hung u
okay how are we in respect to the cable 04 18 17 45 l im afraid youre too far away 0b 18 17 9 cdr well i wanted to get maximum length im moving on in 0b 18 17 53 l thats better lets see yes i want to do that too confident
this is all she  ive got al
okay well bring it in
right over here right about in here anywhere will probably do it
well have to put it right here to get it level
okay
 okay can you reach that
oh yes
okay if you want to stand clear well deploy the antenna 04 18 18 36 l let her rip
okay here we go
its hung up at the top
yes if youll tilt it over toward me without drcpping it ill get it unhung for you
ail righty ready for it
ali right lower it on down

appears to be oh 18 20 oh  okay
okay there is earth way up there
how does that look   
looks like its getting close let me get on the lass 04 18 20 h3 cdr take that  turn it to the left a little more wait a minute because that changes the whole deal 04 18 20 58 l  step over here
thats about it for azimuth
okay i dont see it al
well just put it back down again okay
okay i think my plss  my ops is hitting it oh 18 21 17 cdr ail rig just a second let me back it offs minute and move this a little bit
okay thats about it for azimuth ill come down a little bit oh 18 21 32 l okay
let me just check through which way we want to go 04 18 21 4h cdr 
okay
okay coming down a little bit
youre dom
hold it son fidenti iim
back up just a bit right there okay i have the earth centered
okay
okay houston boresighted the  the earth dark side and all
this is houston roger
okay the sband anterma has been erected and alined and the cable has been attached  
and ill go back in to switch okay
roger ed and wed like to get an emu status report as you go by
okay the cdrs reading 375 reading 76 on the 02  i have no flags im still in minimum flow and im comfortable
okay and this is ed im reading 375 about 75 percent 02 no flags minimum cooling and im very comfortable too
roger out
ands i guess  contingency sample into the etb
okay
bruce is any appreciable dust flying off of these boots id like not to take all that dirt in there
i didnt notice any on the tv
okay
and houston im back in the lm without a great deal of problem
roger ed
im getting ready to switch to lunar stay give me a call and if i dont hear you in about 30 seconds we will go back okay
ed this is houston youre go to switch to lunar stay go ahead 04 18 25 17 limp and houston this is ed how do you read
loud and clear ed
okay youre on the erectable antenna
roger and how are you reading us
loud and clear
beautiful 04 18 25 39 p okay alan im ready for the etb most anytime
okay take it on up its ready for you
and did the contingency sample get in there
thats affirmative
itd never do for us to leave that one behind bruce
okay well bruce is loading up the etb
who
oh excuse me while ed is loading up the etb  
dont i wish it  
while ed is loading up the etb ill describe the general landing site we are in fact in a  in a low area there seems to be a general swale or a wide valley between the triplet craters and the doublet craters and we are on  we are on the downhill side at this particular point it levels off at a lower elevation to the left of the lm approximately 15 feet lower there and then it  confidentj starts back up to the rim of doublet its a very uneven landing area here and of course like all of the sections of the moon its pock marked by a  enormous amount of craters the surface here as we pointed out is mostly fines and i hate to discuss any kind of lineations here in the immediate vicinity of the lm because i can see very definite indications of the radial dust pattern caused by the descent engine and  any other lineal pattern as such right here in the area 0 18 28 09 cdr there are perhaps half a dozen very large rocks at the i oclock position from the lm but per haps theyre ejected from cone although they don5 seem to have any particular ray pattern they probably are ejected from  from doublet since they appear to be closer to doublet than they do triplet they are a lighter gray in material  excuse me  the material is lighter gray in color and im certain that well get some of those samples on the way back from our als deployment its very difficult to assess any kind of stratigraphy in cone right now look ing back at it because were looking into the sun at a low sun angle and its just not the right direction to view that crater when looking for stratigraphy but there certainly are boul ders on it from here it looks as though theyre at least 20 feet in diameter perhaps at least the ones e can see here in the western slope they appear to be grouped fairly close to the rim of he crater and not too many large boulders on down the sides of the slopes the outside rim okay it looks as though the lm was traveling slowly forward and slowly to the right as youll see from the photographs thats the direction of the landing gear probes as theyre bent the footpad plusy for example has a drag pattern of approximately 1 foot
okay ed howre you doing up there
okay al ive got it loaded im about ready to start down with it now
okay age3 0 c nfident  ulii 5
just another minute i have  the isa came loose from its straps and is being a great major headache
ed before you start transferring you want to verify contents in the etb
okay let me give you a call on them bruce i put in one blackandwhite camera a television camera two hasselblads one tds two 16millimeter  millimeter mags and two maps oh 18 31 36 cc okay did you get the 16millimeter camera wivh mag attached 04 18 31 45 l no thank you guess we kind of need that neo
yes thats the one thats supposed to photograph you coming down the ladder
uhoh all of the contingency the disposal con tainers just fell out on the floor just a minute get the camera ob 18 32 32 cdr okay houston with respect to he erosion pattern directly under the engine bell there is  3 feet to the southeast of the location of the bell thats probably where the thrust was when the engine was cut off and the ilslowly drifted to the northwest from there
as perhaps you can see from your camera houston the view off to the south is an undu2ating hill and i would estimate that hill back there to the south is oh perhaps log feet higher than we are 04 18 33 53  okay al i am ready to bring this down
okay 04 18 34 o1 l wait a minute got it
okay
okay let her come gently cipnfidenii

okay cameras stopped houston
roger
okay up one flag
okay were right on the time line right to the minute
okay ill take the camera while you get the flag set up okay ill go off to the left over there by the swc it will be on television

okay
there you go you got 25 on the mag
 al age3 6 dnfidenttmm day5
okay houston
thats good on the flag
okay 04 18 46 34 l did you shut qff 167

and theres a little bit left   04 18 46 h9 cc you have about 3 minutes remaining on that maga zine claremontcalifornia 04 18 46 54 lm roger we wont change it okay im going vo press on out for the tv pan houston
and ed  while ed is doing that a1 is going to proceed with photographing the landing gear and general features about the lm oh 18 47 18 cc roger using indianapolisindiana
okay houston i will on my  for my firs sector per pan ill point a little bit more to the south oh 18 47 38 cc okay we want to go to a zoom of 25 on this 04 18 47 k3 lmp roger 04 18 47 57 i2 okay youre zoom of 25 focu going out toward infinity and hows your picture houston 04 18 48 15 hi houston this is ed al
yes
think we lost comm
go ahead ed
okay hows your picture now onfident
roger it looks good
okay can you see the horizon
 affirmative the horizon is about twothirds of the way up from the bottom of the tube the flag is over near the lefthand corner of the field of view and that little rise is sort of centered  
0k thats just about where i wanted it
  with the small crater off to the left
roger the horizon that you see  far horizon bruce is a ridge that seems to run around this bo that were sitting in  appears to be a ridge it runs down from what we called old nameless to the south and it runs to the west it seems to be roughly circular but of course we could be a little bit deceived at this point on that  that score the little rise you see in front of us is a rise thats shown on  on the map with  the craters are on the map since i dont have it handy it  ill have to give you the coordinates later but i think you already know them they are about 150 feet south  south  of the lm go ahead
roger if youre going to spend several seconds describing each of these locations here after the camera steadies out you might just as well zoom out a ways and well pick up some features at random on higher magnification and zoom back in when you go onto the next 45degree sector
okay ail right ive moved around to the next sector now and its looking down over what we used to call cloverleaf  although its not obvious from here what the cloverleaf was there is a fairly significant crater of  about 250 to 300 yards out ill try to come  bring it in for you
can you see it out there houston
yes youre doing fine keep zooming if youve ge left
okay lets zoom all the way
well centered
okay that crater is  
okay beautiful oh 18 50 55 lmp   its kind of in a low spot but its not the lowest spot in this dip that were in the lowest spot we will pick up in our next sector although well shoot across it because you wont be able to see it
okay bring her back in
okay now another sector to the right facing almost domsun and
roger we got your shadow 04 18 51 25  okay its a very low spot the deepest part i guess of what we were calling cloverleaf be fore although i did not realize how deep that depression was and i still dont quite get the  
okay zoom out while youre talking 04 18 51 50 l   okay cant quite get the relief in my mind because it is so different than what i expected where youre looking at now this deep part is to the south of doublet and its probably 75 to 100 feet below where we are rising up on the far side to above us
okay youre aimed up a little high 04 18 52 17 i2p okay hows that now
a lot better say ed you dont need to stop talking when i talk if you can do both at once 04 18 52 24 ixmp okay i have a little trouble listening to you and talking at you too not polite laughter okay im bringing it back in and coming around through the westnorthwest and you should be able to see in the distance doublet crater and ive lost it now because of the sun angle but its cj fident iiim just about on the  on the near horizon im sorr2r there are three mounds three ridges the nearside  the nearest one  the ridge that doublet is on and then the far horizon and im bringing them  bringing it on out for you doublet is on zhe second  second hill that you see pick it up out there bruce
roger we can see the ridges and i  and i can see  craer that probably is doublet 04 18 53 24 ijqp okay well zoom back in and move on around i think ais about to finish up his task over there
negative im still working at 8 oclock
oh 0h 18 53 37 cdr ed i just wonder how come mccandless has the audacity to presume that were wrong about doublet crater laughter
very presumptuous okay bruce im coming around one more sector and you should be able to  im going to move it just a little bit more  you should be able to see the large rock the four or fiw rocks i was talking about in my discussion before we got out of the lm now ill zoom in on those if i may oh 18 54 13 lmp here we come
okf now point the camera down a degree or 2
ok hows that oh 18 54 29 cc begtiful you might come right a degree or so i see the small rocks off to the right okay 0h 18 54 41 lmp okay and i might add  i mentioned a quadruplet chain of craters well theyre right here in front of me  
point it down a little 04 18 54 52 imp okay the quadruplet chain of craters starts right here in front of me well its halfway between the rock and myself and moves across here now therere quite a few  
youre getting all sky 04 18 55 07 imp let me zoom back in again
hold it 04 18 55 23 imp okay hows that now
good  2 0h 18 55 29 lmp okay theres the south quadruplet crater and fithe t5exone and the next one and the largest one you can see   3cci

roger lets press on with the tv panorama
were about 2 minutes behind time line at this point ed youre looking at sky again  her don  ed were recording all this on video tape so that it only takes a relatively brief period of time looking at the  the scene that we can ply it back frame at a time later on  25

hows that
pan left about 2 degrees  2 degrees okay that looks  
is that okay
crank it out about to 40 on the zoom 0b 19 00 37 imp okay

  tv camera is covered and proceeding te the rear of the lm to observe the deployment of the alsep
okay houston the cover is coming off the lens now how does that look to you confidentia it
roger al are you  are you all the way back at the 30foot position there  30
well its about  its abouz 30 right there id say a little hilly here
okay our picture is moving around a lot youre going to have to set it down and let it stabilize before we can tell you anything about it
im trying to find a level spot bruce were in 
okay what zoom are you on
were on the side of the hill as you probably have heard and it may not stay it may tip over
can you poke one of the legs into the surface there
thats what im doing at the moment
thats a pretty clumsy tripod i realize
okay do you know i think it will stay now 04 19 07 2 cdr okay hows that oh 19 07 25 cc okay what zoom are you on back off the zoom some

okay im going to move it over a little bit here 04 19 09 14 i okay its almost as heavy as you are
whos talking
 move over man its rough to find a level soot to put anything okay number 2 is comin gut
okay can you get that by yourself
well its  i think so let me  make sure its not going to vibrate too much okay and its on the surface oh all this beautiful white paint is sure going to get filthy out here 04 19 11 04 l ill have to bend a little bit i just cant bend down to that
okay 02 19 12 09 isp and the handtool carriers clear 0b 19 12 12 cc roger 04 19 12 36 sccc 
say again houston

see this  okay i think theres a pretty level place right there
0ops excuse me
okay im ready for the fuel cask
okay
roger ed 04 19 15 17  the handtool carrier as you can undoubtedly see is on the met no problems
okay temperature indicators on the mast show that theres been no heat
roger
and the cask is coming down
 ed 04 19 16 27  and its down far enough i believe
okay stand by 1 not the best place in the world to work there we are 04 19 16 59 imp okay if we can get the lid off of it 04 19 17 53  watch it thats probably pretty hot okay its locked

roger ed
okay the doors are closed 0h 19 21 32  okay
okay houston were going to lover the teievison camera load it back to its original location
roger al for your information youre approxi mately 7 minutes behind the time line at this point
okay
okay where do you thinks a good spot for the alsep 
oh boy thats going to be tough al id just head out toward doublet out there and lets lcok
which way 04 19 22 00 lp rlgt toward doublet
i think thats the best way aim for the center ofdoublet aim for the  yes aim for the center of dublet and lets go from there however i think maybe we better go a little further south or were going to violate that ccig constraint if we go too far north how about toward the south edge of doublet
hey why dont you point it  point it at us and well just pick it up on the way out
whats that
you ought to point it at us and well pick it up on the way out
well were supposed to  okay right now  you can put it here and watch the t deployment if you like 04 19 23 29  okay
okay houston were about  a 40foot zoom now  on the area of the mesa and the met how does that look
houston are you with us
roger levs go to 50 04 19 2h 03 cdr okay 50
and come right about 3 degrees very good
okay oh 19 24 46 cdr okay got the television camera there 04 19 24 49 l yes its down in the bottom

bey bruce as i mount these 70millimeter cameras on the met i just flip the little spring clip i just pick up the whole met and drag it along i cant do that when they get  get a little more weight on there age60 cionfid
okay we got that ed be sure you get the large scoop on there replaced
yes okay bruce ive put on two hasselblads and im going ahead and getting the t6millimeter on and getting it out of my way right now
okay ed two hasselblads plus the 16millimeter
right and ive just started the tv bracket and im open  getting ready to open src number 1 okay blackandwhite television  
and al have you gotten  roger
blackandwhite tv cameras on the plusy strut  on the footpad
with the white surface normal to the line of the sun
thats correct on dimension horizontal
roger roger and on magazine charliecharie i show you still have 3 minutes remaining 04 19 27 04 l okay well leave it on there then

okay src1 is open okay 04 19 27 41 l oh damn dropped the weigh bag
wait a minute 04 19 27 56 l ill get it

0ky houston ive got three core tubes no tabs
roger 04 19 32 k4 cdr and houston i finally succeeded in getting two weigh bags and one sesc in so far  in addition to the other things plus the core tube cap assembly 0 19 32 58 cc roger 04 19 33 10 l okay you putting on the other sesc
ive got the other sesc now
okay very good oh 19 34 04 lm the problem here is the clips are so tight tt it takes a monumental amount of force to get them in there course thats the way we asked for them cant complain and houston im sealing the organic sample at this point
roger oh 19 34 31 cdr okay antiwell put this one in the pocket 
okay houston i have the closeup camera oh 19 35 26 cc roger still reading on even hundreds 04 19 35 29 l im not vhere yet 04 19 35 hh lp didnt want that to get away from me but it did got it okay houston its turned on ana izs reading 300

let me doubleeheck lets see 1 2 3  
okay houston well start a rundown here i think we are about ready 0h 19 38 42 lmp yes
got the core tube cap assembly extension handle two sets of  two sets of tongs we have a numfoered geophone anchor on the front we have the tether the gnomon the hammer the scoop three core tes 35 bag dispensers closeup camera two sescs two 70millimeter cameras with solar ex terior one 16miilimeter camera and one g four weigh bags two maps extra number geophone flag large scoop is on right large scoop is on and were taking the trenching tool with us
okay and you should have 16millimeter and two mags
tkt correct we have a total of i was just going to say a total of three gs one is almost used and the other two are clean you with us you with us
roger looks good
okay let me just look at something
arldwhy dont you give us emu status check before you set out
okay the lmp is reading 375 and about 55 percent medium to low  low cooling doing great
okay say again the percentage ed 04 19 40 14 p it looks like im reading 50  no sorry about that
man its hard to see
yes im reading 55 percent bruce iicon fidenii iim a5
youre reading lower than that it must be
roger
no im reading more than that im reading 55 percent 04 19 40 35 cdf you are okay
go ahead al
okay al is at 375 reading 62 percent and i have no flags im on min cooling and im very comfortable
roger out and we need to point the tv caera out to the alsep site 04 19 40 56 qp al ill go get it
let me zoom on out and get that i think ill aim it a little bit to the left of  that bright crater on the side of the west wall of  of doublet 04 19 41 08 mip hey thats a good place al
say al if theres any uncertainty as to the deployment area wed rather go to a zoom of 100 instead of a zoom of 150 but if you think youve got a good site picked out now why we can go to 150
i think we can find a good site we may be a little closer to doublet than the  than the map shows because of the grade going up there but i think theres a level site fairly close to the south rim of doublet and well aim the camera in that general direction and give you 150 zoom focus at infinity
roger out
okay you should be able to seeon the right side of your picture when i settle dcwn here you should be able to   ico nfident ttlm
al you can get quite a ways further out if you want to youtve got a little cable left
 were aimed right for the south  doublet now south doublet and youll probably be able to see  star crater right in the very edge of your field of view  stop okay
yes fstops fine ive got what looks like two ridges and then the horizon in the picture and i see a  just past the second ridge  
it may be two small boulders
okay may be 04 19 42 57 l okay i think we can find something out there that fits the bill
okay ill go pick up the barbell
ail right the lr cubed is there on the front step
al this is houston wed like to try f22 and peak
okay you caught me just in time
okay f22 and peak how does that look to you
roger al and wed like to elevate a little bit so that we get the horizon in 0k 19 44 31 cdr okay well try hows that 0k 19 44 41 cc see if you can depress a little now its real touchy at this long focal length 04 19 4 50 cdr okay well try to depress a little bit
okay you still have the horizon o 19 45 20 cc okay that looks good for elevation and if youve got us aimed at your proposed deployment site were go age366 cj i4fidentia
well it looks like thats the way were going youll just have to stay in that line of sight bruce
okay very good
roger you want a gca
yes i think if you aim for a little to the left of that  
well our asr isnt working very well but if we can once get you in the field of view well acquire you 04 19 45 59 p roger im headed over that way
can you see  yet bruce
negative ed i believe youre off to our left 04 19 47 08 p they wonv get in the field of view until we get up pretty close to the site okay
okay youre coming in now 04 1 47 13 lm okay im going to stop here and rest for a minute al this darn thing is heavier than i expected
okay ed weve got you in the field of view cvet to the left now
okay a1 should be coming in right now too c4 19 47 49 cdr looks as if it might be a little secondary impact crater here by me
man theres so many different tpes of craters around here you could  we could spend the whole eva within a hundred yards of the lm okay lead on and ill follow and watch the met for you
okay going to your right
okay houston were proceeding over a very fine grain regolith we described before undulating surface getting more sloped   tonfident
oka you need to angle left just a little bit 04 19 h8 40 cdr left
yes youre doing fine now o 19 48 49 lmp say houston this looks like brown talcum powder its so fine in most places 0 19 49 01 cdr i think the sun angle is increasing now
the mts going off to the right 0 19 49 04 cdr the mets trying to find a smooth place to go 02 19 49 09 l al i think youll have to go around this crater here to the left i think we can find our way dorm good heavens thats a deep hole but i guess we can get it  make it either way
say again
i said we could make it either way 04 19 9 35 cdr okay 04 19 49 43 mp see those two over there at 10 oclock al we can see those are on the map
the two at 10 oclock
yes
yes okay houston well be dropping down out of sight for a while probably going down in  in a depression o 19 50 27 cdr well i dont know 04 19 50 30 lm1d i dont know either lets stop a minute al
im not sure but what weve picked just about as gcod a spot as anywhere 04 19 50 38 lm i think so
it looked a little further out here because of being closer to zero phase perhaps age368 ionfidentiat4i
i think thats it but its no1a bit smoother than the other ill be darned if i know what to do 04 9 51 02 cdr well well move on a little closer to doublet
okay okay
well i think the first ridge over there about another 75 yards might be our answer right beyond this next  these next two craters 04 19 51 47 cd yes i think so its probably a pretty good spot about right up there 04 19 51 52 4 yes
okay houston were in the general area of the planned alsep deployment now  on the chart its in a depression and i think well move on a little closer to doublet to give it a zhigher elevation 0 19 52 18 cc roger youre visible from  about the armpits up right now
okay
think you ought to press a little  bear a little to the left al
yes i guess well have to nothing like being up to your armpits in lunar dust
i think just to the left of that rock thats ahead of us it provides a path through here
the met seems to be riding very well houston its bouncing a little bit making nice tire marks but not about to turn over it jumps about a foot every time it hits a small rise but very stable
are you getting any dust thrown up by the tires 0 19 53 23 lmp no there is a little bit bruce but its not  the dirt feels to be kind of clumpy 0 19 53 51 cdr okay i guess that ridge is the best place tonfideni oh 19 53 54 lmp i think so
how are you doing oh 19 53 56 lmp fine
you still on your television bruce
yes indeed youre very well centered
 ought to be coming back in now were coming up to  the grade here oh 19 54 14 cc roger i can see your shadows now so  i guess  in fact i can see your feet so youre well in view 04 19 54 21 p okay about another 30 40 feet now and i think were as good as were going to get
yes at were discussing here houston is  grade going up to south doublet it is very consistent and its difficult to find a level place
okay lets set it down and look for a minute al
all righty
hen we can see here where we are oh 19 55 07 lmp i dont know but what this  this rise were standing on right here  its about as good as ar okay now theres a 20meter crater there
okay you got that other map on there too
yes its in the pocket now lets see okay the one  that one rigb  right there lets see if we carlfind those the big one may i see i a minute can we spot that one and those two
that ones right over there i believe isnt it taats an old rounder one right there see what i mean 7 jlifidential
yes that may be whats this one right here that one right beside it oh i dont know whether were that far out or not al
 that little looking for that little distance thing here we go
okay id say were probably about 400 feet out almost directly out in front plusx
okay
i think  80 meters along the track 04 19 57 37 dp look here see that crater right in between those two traverse tracks
yes
okay those two craters and that crater that you pointed out
right 04 19 57 46 l okay i think that one between the traverse tracks is that one right there
okay
on the hill the two  those right over there and the one you pointed out this one is that one over there the big one behind it now i think its out of sight unless its that one over thera
well where do you think we are
i think that we are to the north  i think were about br and lets see were south of that  were about cq 08 and 625  615 oh 19 58 35 cdr did you read that houston2
roger charlie quebec 8 at 615 nfidentiii i
okay lets move directly toward that big rock ut there about halfway between here and there its about right up in there 04 19 58 54 ip yes i need his clear area down here for that thper
okay lets put it right up in there 04 19 58 59 lhp righ up there on that spot 04 19 9 o1 cdr yes you got it okay houston wetre going to move about 10 meters to the westnorthwest from those coordinates tht ed gave you that will be waere the alsep central station will go we reserve the right to change our mind as to where we are when we get up on the hilltop o 19 59 26 cc okay
okay 04 19 59 k5 cdr m going to have tc pull it over here a little zd theres a crater there 04 19 59 50 iip  vhats  thats right about where we are
2kay weve lost the het off to the right of our icure 04 20 00 03 iip kats wrong with right about here it would just be a nice clear shot down there with the thuper 0 20 00 09 cdr an you still see ed houston
yes hes at the extreme righthand edge of our picture al and youre off 04 20 co 17 odr okay well turn them back on this is where ere going to deploy oh 20 00 22 oc well i guess the primary consideration of course is to find a good site and our being able to watch zou is secondary
yes we understand but its all pretty much the same the upslope is abcut   or 5 degrees ae tonfidenti ii day pockmarked by all types of craters theyre all old craters but nonetheless they produce a very uneven surface and i think weve found a spit here as reasonable as well find anhere
roger out 04 20 o0 52 i2ip lets see al but those two craters right vhere are going to be in the way i thinc id lie zo move back here about 5 feet better than having to run through those going soutlh cr i can leave a central station about where ie got it i mean the power generator think thatli he all right 
ye you done with your thumper iecplone line 04 20 01 22 12ip yes im through cl 20 01 23 cdr your line will put you right tlrougl those wc craters thatll give you a good reference c4 20 01 26 121r well im going to have to go this way sc  cause i cant fire into that ridge ive gom zj puz it more north right up fha way then r going to go right down across through there iia this looks good to me if youre hacy with iz 04 20 01 43 cer lets see southwest is right  the best sot is right through those two craters 04 2c o1 47 i2cp im going to have to go almost due souzh of the

okay we have 16millimeter camera and two and a half magazines two sescs and mssc two 70millimeter cameras and one extra magazine black and white and we have a partial magazine of color closeup cameras turned on and we need some more weigh bags 05 11 35 02 ipp have you gotten the polarizing filter and the tds yet al
the polarizing filter is  is  is already in and the tds ill be getting now 05 11 35 19 i2p okay so it looks like the met stowage is com plete let me look over my list 7gmillimeter mags 
negative we need some more weigh bags 05 11 35 30 i2p okay 05 11 35 3h cc roger a1 and ed i show you short the weigh bags mesa brush and a map
okay the mesa brush is there and the map is there 05 il 35 25 cdr okay here we come 05 11 35 h9 ij4zp  close that
okay the tds sample is on 05 11 36 28 i24p okay and we need two weigh bgs on 05 11 36 39 i2p thats all the weigh bags we hvethere o5 1 30 0 3dr pardon 05 11 36 tl 12ip thats all the weigh bags we have there we have two more in here confid entia411 05 1 36 h5 cdr okay we have a total of four 05 11 36 52 i2p jhy dont we get thor stowed on outside then
okay why dont you put this one on the back
and iil nut this one down here
okay the mets loaded houston
roger al the met is loaded
okay well go to pick up the   09 11 37 48 lyp lpm right now
  lpm and then well move the television carera after that 05 i 37 5h ildp just watch your cables  05 1 37 55 cc okay were right about en the time  05 11 37 j cdr oct it 05 11 37 59 iip okay i got it
okay  the cable 05 1 38 05 cdr 5ll go around the sband 05 1 38 29 cc y3u really look neat there
say again
i said that really looks neat i can see it cuncing a little bit   05 11 38 o cdr yes it bounces a little 05 11 35 h3 cc   and your tracks are quite visible
kau on top of the hill
nd its very level here 05 11 39 44 ip okay the pallets removed the thermal cover is replaced 05 1t 40 00 cdr and lets do this slow
okay its all yours
okay
wait ill give you a little more slack you up there
yes
201 in the sun 05 11 41 11 imp okay
got it
okay ail right well take off the electronics package throw away the caging device 05 11 41 38 lp high scale on 05 11 42 26 cdf that nearly caught there okay clear 05 11 42 45 f houston you wanted lpm temperature its 125 05 11 42 51 cg  ed 125
okay okay 05 11 43 24 j2p ail right and houston the lpm is loaded on board the met ill start on ot if you want tc turn the camera around o 11 43 33 cdr yes i ust wanted to give  get a goo  direc tion actually our sight to a direcvly toward the center of the crater   05 11 43 46 ip yes thats right over that way
and its   about 350 meters a thousand feet 05 11 43 57 p okay well start off that direction and take a look around qonfidenti
okay and ill aim the camera toward cone 05 11 4h 04 lmp okay
ckay houston were going to try to put the tv camera in the shade aim it up toward cone not sure were going to be successful in doing that 05 11 4h 24 cc okay al we dont want to tarry too long on that one were about 2 minutes behind starting out 05 11 4h 26 cdr  05 11 4h 27 cc you can leave them just as they are right now 05 11 h4 37 cdr say aain 05 11 h4 40 cc the settings that are on the tv are  right now are good 05 11 44 h6 cdr you dont want to aim i oard cone crater 05 i1 h4 51 cc sive al you can do that task but we wont wcry too much about fineness on aiming it the sevbings on the carera right now should be good
okai well aim it up toward cone its going to be fairly close to the sun well see what happens
 al 05 11 h5 26 cdr do you have the image sf the sun yet do you have the image of the sun yet 0j 11 45 h2 cc okay we have a litie bit of a glare in there hut we have a picture al
im going to bring it a little further to the right hows that
 al we can see the slope  flank of cone coming in 05 1 45 58 cdr okay okay youre looking at cone onfiden  iii 6
roger al we have little bit of a glare across the center but in the background we can see the crest of cone 05 11 46 17 cr okay okay well probably be off the camera to the right 05 11 46 42 ip  ought to check our position right about here al see if we can find out where we are 05 11 47 0 cdr okay while youre checking your position ill be using the ctoseup
okay taking the picture of he met tracks houston with the closeup and the sun angles  
 al
 at i1 oclock
okay 30 one and two my tracks ag 11 23 and 4 footprints sun at 10 oclock
 al i copied the frame numbers and we still have you in the picture
okay head on out man 05 11 48 29 i2z yes lets go 05 il 48 30 cdr you get it 05 11 48 31 22 i dont know exactly where we are
well keep the map in your hand   c5 11 48 34 i2p right
  and keep going i got this 05 11 48 37 l2p if i can locate a fmiliar craler 05 11 48 4 cdr okay houston were headed just about toward the cener of cone crater 05 11 45 50 12p okay al is this north triplet right here to  to our right it is isnt it dldnfidentrr411
yes sir
oksy this nice big depression over here
houston were again proceeding directly toward thc center of the crater point a as ed pointed out were passing north of north triplet the area over which we are passing again of course is poskmarked by craters however the land is generally flat right here we have a  sort of a  a  i was going to say mesa but i really dont thnk its a mesa its more of a ridge which extends to the southeast almost normal to our pah of travel i think point a is probably down in thav valley 05 11 49 58 hmp ye look ai ive spotted it see he aater anost directly up front from us in the valley rifht in the middle valley
rifht
thavs weird
okay
mc head to the north of that were in business
okay that means that poin a is in fact right in the valley
roger al 05 i1 50 19 cdr the  there seems to e quite a few large rocks as we progress along here  rocks of up to 2 or 3 feet in size and one would  would fairly easily postulate hose came directly from cone crater of course we will  get sarles of these a little further along 05 11 50 48 p a iitle furher to who left okay point a al is right  its not quite in the valley its right beyond over here
okay  fairly subdued craters now age llconft t  ay6
yes okay this chain that were going through right here   c5 11 51 16 c3 is there any basic change in the  any basic change in the surface texture as youre heading out across toward a there 05 11 51 25 p no it looks all the same fredo were  fredo see the crater  
 what i was afraid of 05 11 51 31 p see the crater 60 meters tc the west of point a the fairly sharp one
roger ed 05 11 51 4 p okay were coming up on that one right  
i think i have it on the chart 05 11 51 50 ip okay were coming up on that one right now its the sharper one in the east northsouth line of about three craters and our traverse supposedly passes right between them got it 05 11 52 06 cci okay we got you right on the map ed 05 11 52 09 p okay the  the kind of doublet crater supposedly just south of our track at 71 and ct and ct 03 were passing exactly on the sout rim of those two now
roger ed 05 11 52 35 cr probably a right here is it ot 05 11 52 36 p its right over here to our isft a little bit al i believe now let me see a is right beside a  
and one other question from here dia the blocks you described as you moved across there do they appear o he in the form of rays from cone or are they pretty widely spread nffdenttat j 05 11 53 06 cdrlmp no
we dont see any ray pattern i would say theyre fairly generally scattered
fred right here in the center of these three for a okay
buy that
wei its pretty close i dont think its ex actly at a but its close real confusing this  
okay ill  clock you at a right now 05 il 53 42 lmp ok that large crater zo your right al just doesnt snow up aha it doestoo thats the one just beyond that is a
thats what i thought right about 20 feet ahead of me right 05 11 53 57 p ye3 yes
okay babe fred the surface here  talk about that is  is textured it  it is of course a very fine grain dusty regolith much the same as we have in the vicinity of the  but there seem to be small nebbles  more small pebbles here on the surface than we had back around the lm area an the population of larger rocks perhaps small bsuldersize is more prevalent here okay this is probably pretty good 05 11 54 30 dip yes this is a good place for a and yall might also caent fredo that the  they have an appearance here quite often like raindrops  a very few rain drops have splattered the surface it gives you that appearance obviously they havent but its that sorv of texture in alaces
yes i think  i was  i was just about to say that theres a relationship between the texture and these snali surface pebbles okay point a pag4e26 jonfidentiajlm da6y
okay at point a we do a doublecore lpm ill start with the lpm and a pan
okay ill start with the tds
fred did you read were proceeding as written on the checklist
roger i copied  i copied all of that
the point where were samplin is  just about in the center of three craters of almost equal size i would say perhaps 20 meters in diameter the ones to the north in  are more fresh more sharp the one to the left is more subdued im pretty sure were just about where point a is on the map it fits  well it fits the description of it 05 11 56 37 cd okay in the tds houston serial nurber102 05 11 57 11 cd5 and the frame counter on the cioseup is no 335
roger serial number 1002 and 305
roger and im now dusting that sample
 remark before i start thatnumber 3 block on this sample appears to have a smudge cn it before i start  a very light black smudge
okay we copied al
okay 05 1t 57 56 lmp okay fred the lpm is in place imlevel  its leveled and alined and im returning to the mkf
okay give me a call when you get there and ill start the timing 05 11 58 12 p okay im here now
starting the clock 05 11 58 19 p okay may i get a hasselblad idnfidentia
sure you may have a hasselblad what would you like
iltake mine if you dont mind
okasenor
no sun i want f8 thank you
and houston the locater shot for the placement of the met  of the lpm is frame 7 magazine mm ill take two of them
roger and you can go with reading
 i took two shots of that for your locaters
 ed and were go for the readings
okay be there in just a second fredo okay im on high scale
go ahead ed 05 12 00 o1 i2p x is a 52 z73 x 9 point  
okay copied
  96 y 38 z 67 x 96 y 37 z 65
ckay i got all  al readings ed 05 12 00 54 ip and that was the highscale reading
refer high scale
and now verifying the second tds serial num ber 2001 05 12 02 19 i2p okay redo zm leaving the lm nuber 2 and  
ckay let me know when youre back at the met
ckay just a second i wanted to tell you that in mb leveling of these things the bubble is tan gent to the inner circle to the north on both the first and he second  alinement 4 8 izonfidentiat 6
roger copy ed 05 12 03 06 imp  im back at the met
and the clock is starting
okay
and white we got a few seconds there ed the raindrop pattern you mentioned was it  is it pretty general or is it just here and there that you noticed this texture 05 12 03 38 4f no it seems to be fairly general fred
okay houston the tds sampling is complete and the final counter closeup is reaciing 311
roger al i copied on 1001 serial nmber final count 311 and ed you can  youre go for the readings 05 12 04 16 p okay
get in there baby okay 05 12 04 26 p okay fredo on high scale again x 01i  hold it
im holding it oh okay
roger you bumped the met i was afraid you were going to turn it over x 11 y 37 z 40 x 11 y  point  no y is 20 z 37 x 11 y 39 z 36 over
okay ed weve got all of yo17 readings 05 12 05 44 lhp okay returning to the thir cae
okay i got closeup shots 12 13 and 14 and 12  all at 9 oclock shadow 12 and la are two typical examples of the rainroptextured pattern which ed  of which he spoke now 13 is a picture of a foot track   05 12 06 lc 4p  tconfidentiaji
  foot track in the same  area
and i see some  
roger al
i see a fairly large rock here at the  at the north of these three craters its embedded right at the rim its about 2 feet long i can see some crys tals in it it has a good fillet pattern im shooting a closeup of that and the sun angle again will be 9 oclock
roger al
okay and al a word from the backroom says go at least two crater dismeters away from  i guess the crater youre just describing when you get ready to take the double core
okay well try to put it in the center of the three craters to get all three  well to get whatever stratigraphy we have here and the last fillets  picture shadow 9 oclock  was 18
 al
ky and since ive already taken a couple of pistures of the met tracks i wont do any more cf that here and probably wont again unless we see some difference in zhese tracks theyre  theyre fairly what you might expect because theyre smooth theyre well packed and vary in depth only as a function of the  of the surface tension 05 12 08 22 i24p fredo ive left the lpm returning to the met had a little trouble with it that time the bubble is tangent on the east side of  of the center ring
okay on the eas side let me know when you get there
i m at the met
shay ill set up for the double core here 30 ionfidentiai 6 05 12 09 00 imp okay ill be with you in a second i have a pan to take and ill be right with you now be care ful with the velcro on the tongue you can see it came off except for one batch
god damn why dont we just   its about the right size
itll go in that outer pocket fine ill carry it  one of us can carry it when were going between stops   05 12 09 20 cdf it wont go down that way also lomillimeter m 05 12 09 24 f okay
okay core tubes 05 12 09 33 pf okay fredo you about ready
okay 1 minute you go ahead 05 12 09 42 kmp okay y  this is high scale  y is 1c im sorry x is 10 y is 81 z is 66 secon set x is 10 y is 81 z is 66 hir set  is 10 y 81 z is 665 okay
roger ed and i assume all of those were hii scale aain 05 12 10 25 p beg your pardon those were all high scale 2hats affirm
okay we got them 05 12 i0 36 cdr okay ne bottom core tube wil be nsber  no tab tolg core tube will be nmer 3 no tab 05 12 10 5 cc roger al top number 3 no tb bottom nmv ber 2 no tab 05 12 11 01 cer that is correct 05 12 12 o lmp okay i need a pair of tongs 
and have you started reeling it up yet ea nfid enti
im starting that right now fred the electronics are in the box and im  
yes i just  
 up the reel now 05 12 13 21 iafp oh no
 the mazter
this is a can cf worms
youre having some problem reeling it in there ed
yes an awful lot of problem with it fred the set in the cable is so much that if i ever let go of the handle it winds down about three or four turns on me and i have to  at least  then i have to take it back out and the cable is all bunched up and curled out here its  im not sure im going to get wound or not
roger ed
 a different method of holding it
okay houstcn a couple of quick stereos in the locater of the core tube as its about to be driven and the locater of the m is in the background
 al
okay fredo z got the lpm reel reeled in just enoagh to keep it off the ground im trailing a can of spaghetti here
okay ed
al you havenz taken a pan have you
no
okay im starting with the pan
okay just in the way of bookkeeping we need the double core and the pan and a sample pag4e3  confidentiadii 05 i2 16 42 imp okay
okay houston we got almost two complete  tubes here about one and seveneighths tubes i would say
roger al
okay houston the pan is complsted and i took it from the rim of a  old crater with fresh crater right in the bottom of it and several small ones  small ones around it 35 12 19 28 zdr yes thats a pretty blocky one that new one i think if we take samples from right along that rim there youd probably get some of that from the bottom 05 12 19 33 imp yes okay 05 12 19 37 lm  better give them map coordinates   
okay we copied a1 and ed
okay and the core bit just for the fun of it is going in bag 2november 35 12 19 51 imp we need a dac
and al theyd like a description of the surface where you drove the core tube c5 12 20 29 cdr okay fred nothing but its titlesrmetextured pattern of which we spoke coming up in this traverse c5 12 20 4 imp uh oh c5 12 20 46 cdr what 05 12 20 47 imp wheres ou color chart
here yoa go did you read the core tip  2november fred confidential
roge al weve got that and for your information were about 5 minutes behind in the total time line for departing a
okay continuir  our description of the surface it ppears to be a scatered population of very small blocks some of which ed is going to photo graph here and his documented sample i believe they came from zhe crater to the north of the sampling sites other than that the  that little coresample site is not unie to the traverse so far the first core went in fairly easily i had some  difficulty with the last core
roger al
okay 
get zhat by yourself
yes
andhouston the rock im sampling is a  seems to be a fairly typical one of this little crater  multiple crater that were working around right now near a and its goirg into the bag 3november
roger ed copy 3november
ocps its breaking apart on me as i pick it up ill try to get most of the pieces
 ed and  we need to move on here to b and before we depart a were going to need an huu check
okf this is als 5mi3reading 375 oxygen is reading 71 i have no flags im on min cooling and im comfortable
al
yes
can you hand me another baggy
okay pag e34 t onfidentia da6y
houston i cant get all of this sample in 3n consequently it will go into 3n and the next one it looked like it was fractured and when i picked it up it fractured into about four pieces
okay
roger ed
okay now head on up the hill ilob 05 12 26 lk  okay
okay and we still need an u cheek from yo ed 05 12 26 22 p okay fredo give it to you in a minute 05 12 26 29 2dr can you catch up with me all right
yes ill catch up go ahead
okay a1 is heading up with th met from a we go down into a valley we drop down a  a fairly consistent slope of approximately oh 8 to 10 de grees the texture here again is pretty much the same on the surface the basic regolith of course is  of comrse is the fine material which is now at this particular sun angle kind of a grayish rown with the light pebbles on the sur face making the raindrop  the small pebbles on the surface making the raindrop pattern
and houston im  im treading along behini a1 now starting to catch up with him it  it hasnt been described for you before the met tracks make a very smooth pattern in the  in the surface reminiscent of  of driving a tractor through a plowed field it smooths it out and makes a very smooth distinct pattern and probably oh a quarter of an inch deep no more 05 12 28 o0 2c roger ed
and it leaves gaps every now and then as it cunces
think youve found b jconfidenti
yes its this  this big crater over here isnt it
its way up the hill
pardon
i think its up the hill 05 12 28 23  oh thats right b is the crater we go  this is the crater we go by on the way to b
roger 05 t2 28 45 cdr okay houston im locking for a contact somewhere in here but its not apparent at this point sur face texture seems to be very much the same  the standpoint of  bearing properties its still about the same softness and it still has the same raindrop pattern
roger al
oh fredo you wanted a mi check from me im at 37 going 67 percent im on min cooling no flaes
roger ed 05 12 29 38 i4p and continuing the description a little bit houston the  trying  trying to think of an adequate de scription or comparison to something weve already seen but i dont think there is one incidentally i see a string of craters down to the south  a string of boulders to the south of us that may prove to be a ray pattern as we  from cone and i observe as we get closer to the  to cone the number of large boulders is increasing were going to go past some here in a couple of minutes  near a  about a 20footwide fairly fresh crater the boulders  a dozen of them or so  are 4 or 5 feet in diameter lot of filleting around them
roer ed
okay lets see if we can find this  6 age436  ay 05 12 30 hl lmp this craters the one i think al its halfway between a and b isnt it
yes i think so this little  
can you see the boulders off to the side there on the map
no they dont show very well i think 
ah you should be able to spot that little chain of craters just to the south of it on the map  if that  if thats where we think we are
ed i donmt see any craters right there 35 12 31 29 p kind of small
that will make us right here huz 05 12 31 32 p pardon
theres ncbig one to go with it a sharp one ts go with it this is that one right up there hsw about that 05 12 31 h8 lmp yes lets take a look
thats probably weird right up there were pr3b  ably about even with weird right now although we cant see it on the ridge
thats weird that big one right sver there 1
yes thats what i say i think b is that deep crater right directly ahead of us ed c5 12 32 05 p nc i disagree i think  see that crater right over there we came by to the south the big cne
yes
i think this is the crater thats at  thats at b i think this boulder field we can see it here if you look onfidentia
this crater right here
yes yes we have to he considerably past weird
not even halfway to the  to the rim of cone yet 05 12 32 43 i24p yes this place all looks alike out here
well lets go on ahead  
and a1 and ed i dont  yes i dont think you have to worry too much about the exact position of site b if youre  it appears youre getting close to the general area that should be good enough on
okay i think were very close to it i think this crater we just went by is probably it but itsvery hard to tell fredo i dont see any thir else that might be it unless its the next crater up al ive spotted it that crater  next crater up is this one right here
which way are you pointing
pardon
where at
right behind you that crater is that crater right up there that crater is the crater over to the left of it
there do you think b is 05 12 33 40 lm i think bs the one we just passed back there where we were alking
ail right 05 12 33 46 imp and heres the little  aha it is heres the little double crater right beside it look here see theres that crater see theres the little double crater its right there in front of you
0ks lets go sample b pag4e38 confident bj 6
lets sample b
okay  
okay and a1 and ed this is a grab sample at b and we need the panorama and while someone is doing that we can get our site description 05 12 3h 20 cdr ill get a pan then 05 12 34 21 lm okay and while a1 takes the an ill go ahead and give you a site description the area here is an area of considerably more boulders a larger boulder field more numerous boulders than weve seen in the past weve just come into it as we  as we approached b from a now there are  here were boulders to the north of us we previously talked of boulders to the north and doggone it they may turn out to be a ray pattern it iks suspiciously like  like one however where we are now were about on the edge of a genera boulder population lining the flank of cone crater now theyre not too numerous at this poina theyre somewhat patchy theres a lot of tham buried half buried a few of the smaller ones sitting oa the surface there are  these boulders are fiiletei and well have to sample that filleting later the surface texture  the fine is very much  appears very much the same as what weve been walking on all along and about the only difference we can see is probably a larger number of smaller craters i say probably theyre so numerous unless you really make a population count you cant tell a large  im guessing a larger number sf craters  rohably secondaries from cone perhaps and certainly a larger number of boulders lying around now most of these boulders are rounded there are a few angular ones there are a few rocks with angulars but  angularities  but by and large you can see edges that have been chipped off indicating the beginning of a smoothing process and some of thegn are far beyond the beginning of smoothing theyre  theyre worn down pretty well and most of the rough edges are where they have frastured aha per haps turned over most of them appear to be along fractures of where other rocks are sitting near them that might have once been a part of hat boul der out confidentiaty
roger ed and has a1 got the grab sample completed now
hes  
im grabbing it now
  grabbing it now
houston give you a quick stereo on it
okay and we need the fine count before departing b and right now were about 15 minutes behind in the time line
okay fredo we expect were going to fall behind you theres no way we can help it well pick it up later
well well see about that
0ka grab sample from the west rim of bravo crater bag 5november
and fredc to complete this description  
 a1  
  we are standing on a fairly high point  well not really on a high point about halfway up the slope to our north and slightly to the west of us seams to be the low point in this area its surrounded by a rim thats reminiscent of a very very old crater topography doesnt show up on the map but indeed is there about 500 yards to the north and  and west is the lowest point that i can see in this area okay you ready to press on
as soon as i get my handle screwed back on here
okay the next stop is the top of cone lets get everything secured for that trip
okay houston 
okay and wed like the frame count before you depart age 40 onfidentt 6
yes
yes
yes youve got a frane ccunt of 32 from al
and 29 from ed
roger 3h and 29
handle was loose 05 12 39 03 12p handle work loose for you
yes
okay ive got the met
okay you want to go first and ill folicw 05 12 39 13 lhp okay to the top of cone crater 13512 39 17 cdr yes and now lets  stick to the action hsre were supposed to  512 39 22 3c  were starting the clock   c12 39 25 lmp okay
we could go almost to the east here and then u   512 39 28 imp yes
  by flank bl12 39 30 lmp east a ltle bit to the   512 39 31 cdr see see theres flank u there  12 39 34 lmp oh yes i can just barely see he rim of it cn the far side of it
right so we probably ought to had directly fcr flank and on up from there
okay jjonfidenttaw
okr and 
houston as we go across here this ground is  als probably previously described it but its vef undulating i would suspect that there is not 10 yards at the most between what were once old craters they are most of them worn down 9 but the surface is continuously undulating theres hardly a level spot anywhere
roger ed
lots of  as we come on up toward cone were getting to seeing lots more buried rocks bigger rocks
were keeping our eyes open for a contact here but i guess the sun angle makes it very difficult to see however i expect that by the time we get a little closer up to flank  let me pull it fora while
i have to shift hands im good
oks by the time we get a little closer up to flank we might find some kind of a contact the ee of cone crater to the north is very apparent as we expected that it would be it stretches off into the distance and meets with the far horizon
roger al
fredo im trying to find something distinctive to say about some of these craters were going by and its very hard to do so theyre all smooth walled except the very freshest one and were coming by a wry fresh one now which is rubbtely on the in  hey it may even  that has some pretty good chunks of rubble on the inside this is about the freshest crater this size weve seen al 05 12 2 14 cdr thats correct this is a very fresh crater its about  its about opposite to the crater at stop e its a crater about 20 meters in diame ter and about 2 meters deep and ill get a quick  rcck from the side l 05 12 42 40 imp very soft too a1 just dropped dcwn on a knee  
roger al
  to pick up a rock and he went  went in  or 4 inches need some help al
yes i think so i cant get any 05 12 42 53 i2p okay come on give me your hand
wait a minute i got it now okay 05 12 42 59 i2p okay come on up
okay grunt thank you
youre on your feet 05 12 43 06 dr okay thats just a quick hand sample from he side of that crater 512 43 09 fjp do you think youre following us and know ahou where we are fredo
thats going in bag   512 43 17 cc well the board i think is   05 12 43 1p cdr say thats good and  
  looking about halfway between 3 and e
roger and  25 12 23 30 ip yes and were starting uphill now climbs fairly gentle at this point but its definitely uphill
okay baby  12 43 2 th ckay i got it c5 12 43 22 mp almost turned didnt it
yes now that grab sample from the west rim of the crater  described as blocky is in bag 6
roger al bag 6
okay the going is still very smooth as far as the  the area that were able to pick out of course were tracing a kind of sinuous course hers staying out of the craters
and fredo were  to help further locate us if ycu can were going by two very  well fairly fresh craters i dont think quite as fresh as the one we were just talking about the eastmost one is fresher than  the westmost one is the freshest theyre separated about 75 to 100 feet and theyre about 25 to 30 feet across and 5 or 6 feet deep  5 feet deep i guess the westmost one has got small blocks in it the eastmost one is very smooth heavy breathing
roger ed and you described the blocks there a couple of times now i think you used the term rubble by that i assume you implied they were just lying loose just nothing really in place 05 12 45 24 ip im not sure thats quite true fred some of it looked like stuff that belonged there that had not fallen there
theres a lot of glass in that rock ed 05 12 45 34 limp yes oh there sure is it looked like  some of that socalled rubble looked like it had  might be the  the residual of an impact just lying in the bottom and houston were passing a rock muh too big to pick up theres a whale of a lot of glass in it
it was splattered with glass 05 12 45 54 limp yes
roger about how big is it 05 12 45 56 imp its about a foot and a half 2footer  yes about a foot and a half across iconfidential 6 0 12 46 06 cdr that was a glass splatter fred
roger id and we copy the glass
and im going on medium cooling for a minute
okay and a1 and ed why dont we take a little rest here for a minute and wed like another camera count too
take a what 05 12 46 24 p we havent taken any pictures snce the las one i dont think
okay ed
okay well slow down the traverse here okay should be flank right here ed 05 12 47 10 mp pardon
should be flank right over here 95 12 47 13 p just out of sight you mean
right  yes right there 35 12 27 17 p dh lets go over and see 05 12 47 3v 3c okay a1 and ed i assume youre on the move now and heading toward flank is tat correct 05 12 47 43 p thats correct heading toward where we think flank is ill pull for a while al
thats okay i got it for a while 05 12 48 07 ip why dont we pull up beside this big crater 05 12 8 10 cdr okay 35 12 48 11 ipp take a break get the map and see if we can find out exactly where we are press on from there this one should be distinctive enough confidentia
and  05 12 48 28  if youll take the pan al ill grab the map and get ver here and see if we can find the 
pull it up on a little more level ground
okay give you a push
okay there we are level
that looks good
okay 05 12 49 39 izip that old lm looks like its got a flat over there the way its leaning
say that last again ed
just talking never mind
okay houston the pan is complete on magazine  magazine limalima frame count is 57 05 12 5o 45 cc 
youre breaking up fred o5 12 5o 55 cc 
 reading him ed are you reading
yes i read
read him
i cant read fred no
fredo youre breaking up completely  state merit
okay pag4e46 iconfidential
sigh start on up toward the rim 05 12 51 35 imp yes just 1 second though i think i got i just a minute 05 12 51 ho cdr okay ill head on out
fredo can you read now im getting the feedback from my own voice
okay ed im coming through 05 12 52 02 p okay do you want me to pull awhile al
no thats all right 05 12 52 07 p 
i cant really spot this  this crater but i think i know where we are were pretty close to where you said we were
houston your transmissions are still unreadable is flank over there
 05 12 52 33 p i think its dead ahead of you al oh wait a minute this is probably it right here yes d5 12 52 41 cdr am i right 5 12 52 42 lm yes lets just doublecheck and see 5 12 52 47 cdr its got a  about a hmeterradius crater in the  in the south wall 5 12 52 59 p tha has to be it 5 12 53 03 cdr okay houston were going by flank on the way up were passing to the north sideof it
roger  05 12 53 18 dr fred youre still unreadable onfidentiaw
let me pull awhile al youre having all the fun
well we still have a little way to go
yes we sure do putting the map away
huh
im just putting the map away
ail righty
okay fredo you back with us
okay ill try again how do you read ed
okay thats much better you got a background squeal
okay evidently that station switch gave us some problems ive been ccpying 
okay weve been copying you most of the time and i have you by a point now
thats affirmative and the grade is getting pretty steep
and the soil here is a bit firmer i think than wee been on before except around what  the mounds in between craters where its been thrown out but by and large it seems to have a little firmer footing were not sinking in as deep 05 12 55 h7 cc that should help you with the climb there
yes it helps a little bit als picked up the  als got the back of the tet now and were carry ing it up i think it seems easier
left right left right
theres two guys here that figured youd carry it up age day6
say again
said theres two guys sitting next to me here that kind of figured youd end up carrying it up
well itll roll along here except we can just move faster carrying it
okay you want to rest here by this rock
okay
 i think its worthwhile taking a picture of it with the closeup go ahead and keep going
ill pull on up we probably ought to take a pan to locate everything here while youre taking a closeup heavy breathing okay you get that  
okay i understand al youre shooting a 31oseup shot of a big boulder
about whats the size of this one al
okay the shots been taken on the closeup counter number 317 sun angle was 8 oclock the  this particular one is only about 12 feet long by about 4 feet wide its about onethird buried its old very weathered there are some evidences of some crystal shining through some of the fractures
and im taking a hasselblad of the rock and will take a pan now  at  from this location help document our course going to the top of cone crater
roger copy
and i can look right across into the breach in the north rim of 01d nameless were about even with it now and my frame  
okay and copied ed and was there any noticeable dust on the large boulder
not where i took the picture bu some fillets around the bottom ieonfident 
okay copy and out
okay and 44 fred was my frame count i believe that was  if i remember it
roger ed 05 12 59 37 imp now im going to move on out als ahead of me here
okay were starting up the last flank of the crater now houston the slope is probably about  oh 18 percent the surface texture is still pretty much the same as far as the raindrop pat tern is concerned but we seem to find an increas ing populavion of small rocks
small rocks and smaller  
roger al
  smaller fresher craters as well well  well wait a minute maybe im being deceived with this slope the sun angle is entirely differ ent than it is on the flat land the craters look shyper in these shadows heavy breathing
okay lets mske an tu stop
okr let me pull awhile
id like to stop and rest here for a minute
okay
boy i tell you were really going to get a pan orna weve got a tremendous one here houston already and were not quite to the rim head towards out sic old nameless over there right along our track  or just south of our track i shoald say we made the right approach we came up through the valley and over the range and down into the bowl couldnt have planned it better
i thought we were in a low spot with the im but it turns out were really not in the lowest spot around i dont think age jonfidential 6
well i dont know i tell you its probably the lowest spot right 
oh right in that particular local area
right in hat area yes
but thats the low spot over to the right that i was talking about and theres a low spot  
well theres a crater over there its true yes
yes yes doggone it you can sure be deceived by slopes here the sun angle is very deceiving
yes
okay let me pull awhile you ready to go
yes all set
go back to min cool minimum cocl first
i guess right straight up is the best way to go
beg your pardon
right straight up is the best way to go
yes i think so
stay away from the rocks
okay get a little momentum going
okay houston were proceeding onward now
roger al
and the boulder fields that a1 pointed out  the rocks and boulders are getting more numerous toward the top here however its nothing like the rubble and the large boulders that we saw at the nevada test site now this is surprising to me i expected it to be more lillethat but it is not at least not where were lcoking now heavy breathing jonfidential
wel we havent reached the rim yet
oh boy we got fooled on that one im not sure thawas flank we were in a minute ago either heavy breathing wait a minute yes it is the rims right here thats the  thats the eas little shoulder running down from the cone tha5s flank over there heavy breathing were going to hit iion the south side well have to move on around it this looks like easy going right here see theres the boulder field that shows in the photograph  right up ahead of us
theres a crater up there ed
yes pardon
crater up there
okay a1 and ed theyd like you to take another stop here
okay were really going up a pretty steep slope here
yes we kind of figured that from listening to you
okay well now thats apparently the rim of cone over there and were about  almost 2 hours now is that right fred
oky were showing 157 and a half now al
okaqf thats at least 30 minutes up there
ye
and  i would say wed probably do better to go up to those boulders there document that use that as the tmnaround point
ye its going to take longer than we expected otupositions are all in doubt now fredo what we were looking at was a flank but it wasnt really  the top of it wasnt the rim of cone weve got a ways to go yet age  confidenti a ay6
well perhaps you can think  
okay ed and  
  perhaps you can think with us if you want id say that the rim is at leas 30 minutes away were approaching the edge of the boulder field here on the south flank
lets look at that map
and what im proposing is perhaps we use that as the turnaround point it seems to me that we spend an awful lot of time on traverse if we dont and we dont get very many samples
roger al and just a couple of questions they have up now theyd like your note if you do see any dust particularly on the top surfaces of boulders in the  in the area and any compari sons between the boulders you see distributed around are they all the same or do some tpes appear different
 were not really in that boalder territory yet
i think fredo if youll keep hose questions in mind the best thing for us to do is to get up lere and docmpnt  and sample  what i feel is pretty sure is cone ejecta and then when we head downsun well be able to see these subtle variations and rock types a lot better than we are right now
roger al
well lets head for these two babies up here
hey al
yes
id   keep going around this crater but  except youre right here
well maybe i thought wed get those boulders up there ed they   itconfidentia
yes
  undoubtedly came from  
yes lets head right for that boulder field at the top i think well be where we want to be
right here
pardon
right here
yes right  clear on up at the top you mean
no 05 t3 09 12 lmp huh
i dont think well have time to go up there
oh lets give it a whirl gee whiz we cant stop without looking into cone crater
yes
 everyvhing if we dont get there
i think well waste arawful lot of time traveling and not much documenting
well the information were going to find i think is going to be right on top
we establish 
okay ed look at this  youre going through  just kicked up a layer of some very light gray fine underneath the 
yes as you look back along your path theres quite a bit of it
yes this crater 
fredo how far behind time line are we age 54 tconfidet tia 6
okay the best i can tell right now  about 25 minutes down now
okay
well be an hour down by the time we get to the top of that thing you got six samples
well i think were going to find what were lock ing for up there
okay a1 and ed in view of younassay of the  where you location is and how long its going to take to get to cone the word from the backrcom is theyd like you to consider where you are the edge of cone crater c5 13 11 11 lmp think youre finks
that decision i guess was based on als estimate of another at least 30 minutes and of course we  we cannot see that from here its kind of your judgment on that
well were threequarters there
why dont we lose our bet al and leave the mt and get on up there we could mae it a lot faster without it
no i think what were looking at right here in this boulder field ed is the stuff thats ejected from cone 05 13 12 13 lmi but not the lowermost part which is what were interested in
okay well press on a little farther houston and keep your eye on the time
okay and as of right now we have a 30minute extension
and al did you copy 30minute extension
we got it iconfidential
yes thats affirmative fred thank you
ok stop at this little rise here and take a panorama
okr
0kt als going to medium flow
ok ill take a pan from here
roger ed
well ill tell you its a fantastic view from here as this pan will show
were approaching the edge of the rugged boulder field to the west rim it appears as though the best for us to do will be go to the west rim and document from there even though the sun angle may not be quite as good well were pressing on in that direction als back to min flow
roger al youre moving to the west rim
als back to n flow and were moving again
and a1 and ed deke says hell cover the bet if youll drop the met
its not that hard with the met we need those tools
no the mets not slowing us down houston its just a question of time well get there
roger al 05 lb 16 37 lmp give you a hand al
its all right
you caught a boulder with your wheel as you went round that corner heavy breathing
al
yes
head left its right up there
yes im going there
you need a little more lift go right up through there ill give you a hand
okay were now right in the middle of the boulder field on the west rim we havent quie reached the rim yet
okay want to rest here a minute
yes levs take a look at the map i think were closer than that heavy breathing
okay ill just go ahead slowly with this
okay find the crater
yes the rims right up here
lets see if we can spot this one a1  
okay 05 13 19 41 2qp   on the map
okay and al it looks like youd be a little more comfortable there if youre on intermediate
yes okay were resting now 05 13 19 57  look let me show you something
okay
heres that crater were down here we got to go there
what crater
that crater right there is that one right there
okay want to pull for a while onfidentiati41
yes
okay were absut the mmximum elevation now houston its leveled out a little bit and it looks like well be approaching the rim here very shortly
roger al and you can leave the dial in inter bdiate were fat on the  for the feedwater
okay thank you
let me set mine if were in that good a shape let me set mine houston if im okay too
thats affirm ed i guess the iow item is the bateries
okay
0opx its going over no got it
fantastic stabilization al its going to turn ove r
okay we better reconnoiter here i dont see the crater yet
i agree  rock under my wheels
see this boulder pattern and all that were in here right now this boulder field and all
i thought it was on the south rim
and a1 and ed do you have the rim in sight at this time
oh yes
thats affirmative its down in the valley
in sorry you misunderstood the question i melnt the rim of cone crater
oh the rim this is negative we dont  havent found that yet tonfidenti j
this big boulder right here alwhich stands out bigger than anything else  ought to be  ought to be able to see it
well i dont know but what the rim is still  way up there from the looks of things
and ed and al weve already eaten in our 30minute extension and were past that now i think wed better proceed with the sampling and continue with the eva
okay fredo
okay well observe with a pan from here ill take that
all right ill start sampling
okay houston we are in the middle of a fairly large boulder field it covers perhaps as much as a square mile and  as the pan will show i dont believe weve quite reached the rim yet although we cant be too far away and i think certainly well find that these samples are pretty far down in cone crater
roger al
okay come on 05 13 25 33 dr okay you about to start taking documented samples
right here
ail righty i would say houston that most of these boulders are the same browlish gray that weve fouud but we see one that is definitely almost white in color a very definite differ ence in color which well document we noticed that beneath this dark brown regolith there is a very light brown layer and i think well get a  a core tube right here to show that as a matter of fact i think ill do that right now
roger al and for your information we wont be doing the polarimetric experiment dnfidenti
i understand you will not be
thats affirm you can delete that one
kay als going back to min cool
roger al and ed i need an opinion do you think youd be able to deploy and take the second nd last lpm reading at this location
yes we can take it at this location
okay what i have on the board here to perform at  i guess well call it cprime  is a sample and i guess you already got a pan  i thought some body did  and the lpm then
okay
okay let me suggest that we take one of these footballsized rocks from here too fredo
yes
roger al vez7 good
this area that were in right now is  were sam pling in  is a pretty darn rugged boulderstrewn area one of the smaller rocks ive sampled is goiag into 7n
and a1 and ed when you can work it in wed like and emu check
okay al 375and reading 52 on the oxygen and im in medium flow and im comfortable no flags
okay im reading 375 im 48 on oxygen im now at min flow having just shifted and im comfort able 05 13 29 47 imp okay lpm deploy
roger
okay the coretube sample turned out to only be about threequarters of a tube the area is ap parently very rocky but i did get down into the page60 ijlfilli iiil lllll ill i1 a i  6 second layer the underlying layer of the regolith which was white as opposed to being dark brown
roger al understand you got down to another layer that looked white below the dark brown
on second thought forget that core tube its too granular and most of the material came out of the tube ill just scoop a couple of samples and bag it of the two top layers
roger al
hey fredo im having a hard time leveling the 
okay  05 13 31 49 lm okay there it is
lnd al about what sample bag number are you up to now
7n was the last one i put in
okay fredo were up on 12 here i dont know whether thats consecutive or not apparently not
okay fredo im  im back at the t having left the lpm took my time
the lpm is alined about 3 degree3  
roger ed 05 13 32 41 mp   3 degrees to the north of the eastwest line
okay 3 degrees to north
and it is level the bubbles just about in he center
whats the size of the largest block yall have passed ed
that weve gone past oh 
would you hand me the shovel please ed cidnfidentta
roger
hey fred are you ready to read the lpm
fredo houston you still with us
affirm ed
okay can i read the lpm
all right you can go ahead with the reading ed
okay im on  
ail right go ahead ed
  low scale 49 on x y 46 z 65 x 49 y 46 z 70 x 49 y 45 z 75 and its still going up in z better give you one more set x is 46 y is 44 z is 80 and it seems steady at that level
roger ed copied all four sets and all were taken on low settings and you can discard the instrument at this point
okay it is done
and al did you say you had taken a sample of the white boulder or was that too large to sample
no right now im sampling a layer that is sort of a light gray just under the regolith that went in bag number 9 and bag number 10 was a sample of some of the stufface rocks that were  that were right around that area it looks like kind of a secondary impact that had disrupted the surface regolith and gone on down into the gray area okay
roger al
you want to  
oh well rmnke  make a grab sample here as well as docmenting get one thatll 
okay and ed is the lpm still in your immediate area then l
yes
okay they wanted a temperature reading off of it
okay hell get it for you in a minute
here ill get it  minute okay
do you want the gnomon 05 13 37 23 3c okay and al did  did you mention either seeing a white boulder or a brown  a brownishgray boulder earlier
i mentioned theres a boulder definitely whitish in color fred and well be over vhere in a min ute not in our immediate vicinity but it def initely looks well worthwhile ssmpling
ail right the lpm 
thats affirm they concur here and wed like you to sample from the white boulder go ahead e
125 on the lpm
roger copy
okay where is it youre headed for al
well  
ill get the bag
  something we ought to do if we want to drag the met with us is  see that white boulder down there
yes i saw it and theres a  thats a  bumer yes 05 13 38 2 cdr we can sample both  both types of boulders right down in that area so lets go on down there
ail right cinfidentiaw
and can you give us a feel houston about when youd like us to leave the area
okay estimated time of departure is in about 8 nnutes  7 and a half minutes
okay
okay you want the hammer ill grab it
okay  guess we just run down there this way huh
yes okay i see  one of these boulders fredo is broken open theyre really brown boulders on the outside and the interface thats broken is white and then another one that most of it is white they are right in the same area
yess i believe thats probably a  
okay ed i assume youre going to sample some of those 05 13 39 37  thats where were headed right now its about 50 yards away
why dont you go on down and start and let me bring the met down
all right yes its further than it looks
thats the order of the day
okay fredo im right in the midst of a whole pile of very large boulders here its  see what i can do to grab a meaningful sample
roger ed
firs of all let met start my photographing this whole area
theyre all so darn big 5hat theres hardly anything that i can find let me see if i can chip one
okay fredo  pag4e64 gi onfidentia ilt 6
okay ed and al to get  to get us back on the old time line here when you depart c here wed like to proceed directly to f weird and well pick back up from that point en route you can make grab samples as you see fi
okay nld fredo ive just  
and another note ill remind you of later on go ahead im sorry
ive chipped off one of the white rocks i put it in bag 13n ill photograph it there dont seem to be any samples of the white rocks lying around that are small enough for me to sample and be sure thats what im looking for
roger ed 13n
now just going around picking up handsize grab samples from the immediate vicinity of where ed is  is operating i have a couple that are going in bag 16
roger al
 help with that one
thats all right i can do it
theres a footballsize rock houston coming out of this area which will not be bagged it is  appears to be the prevalent rock of the boulders of the area
thats better
that can go in one of the zbags
roger al we copy
okay you got a sample of that white rock
yes i got one batch of particles
okay put it right in here iconfidenti
i dcnt think itll go
yes core tubes out of the way itll go
okay well just try it back that way
okay lets get another one
okay a1 and ed we have about 1 more minute here at c
okay were moving on down the hill now okay can you see weird from here 05 13 45 39 lmi no
kind of hard to find
i cant even see triplet from here laughter
okay let  lets  
wai a minute al let me take one quick look at the map before we move waste a minute looking
why dont you take the map and ill just head down to the general area of the lm and youll probably get enough elevation view from down there so we can see weird
oka7 were leaving c now houston
hey al
yes
do you see north triplet
roger al and to rephrase the question earlier on the way back down you night integrate any dis tinction in the lithology on the way back with a better sun angle and youre free to take grab samkles  samples en route to weird
okay age 66 iconfid 6
al i think thats weird to the north  i mean just to the left of north triplet and north triplet appears to me to be right behind the lm
yes
you agree
its between  its halfway between those two large boulders and one way down 05 13 46 57 lmm yes i think thats right uhhuh thats the one 05 13 47 o0 cdf okay 05 13 47 09 cdf okay these rocks  these boudders in  in this field here appear to be very weathered obviously not by atmosphere but  but eroded by some process because they all show cracks they show evidences of being broken up either by impact or subsequently and it looks to me as though these rocks are really pretty old
roger al and do you have anything left on the 16millimeter or has it been running on the ret
no it hasnt we might turn it on now  follow the progress
roger al
it running now
have you checked the setting on it
guess i better
and al without taking any extra time if you  
come across
  come across any boulders large enough we might fill the comm check on the way down if you havent already done that on the way up dlonfident
i dont think were going to find any along our path big enough fredo the very largest ones are off to the right  south of us a bit  and up the hill a bit more
let s go on  did you want anything back there
no
oh okay
you want me to hold you back
no thats all right
watch out bet youre going to go over here a minute
i cant catch you okay
and here again houston the texture here appears to be  the regolith appears to be a lot of  of pebbles approximately a quarter of an inch on down to go along with the fines and the same textured pattern we spoke of before and photographed is also here
roger al
okay wy dont we stop here to see if were really going to weird
yes man the lm doesnt seem like its getting much closer
is that weird right down there you think
h no weird is  weird is almost due east of the lm thats  oh there it is look see  
and a1 and ed  
switch 
  wed like an etjcheek jjconfidential 
okay this is al 375 and 45 percent and on min  medium flow and im comfortable
okay this is ed im on 375 min flow im 40 percent and very comfortable and theres weird al you can see the triple crater in it its the  
okay
  the white spot
roger
got it
yes with the boulder in the near foreground
yes
okay were now out of the boulder field houston and proceeding on down to flank
roger al
and i believe  just get a shot  lets get a sample of that baby right there lets grab some thing from that one
ail right
hes going to get a quick grab here of a rock and ill  ill photograph it because its got same tremendous fillets in it
okay
dont hit the fillets until i photograph it
ail right
its not there why dont you let me get a quick shot there okay a quick pan across there okay that looks like  yes we ought ioget a piece of that baby jonfidentialm
no nanthats hard hard hard look at that melt in it
yes okay heres a piece of it ail right
come way on back here
crystals here dont lose it okay that was about  its about where we  no i guess not
hold it a minute hold itl let me get a bag
okay
this darn bag dispenser is not doing what its supposed to do
go daead and take twc small
houston the rock were taking is in 14n grab sample from a filleted rock
roger ed 14n
large filleted rock that  a1 photographed okay lets go on do you want me to pull awhile
no just watch everything we dont want anything to drop off
you want me to hold back awhile and 
no no no id let it  just let it run we dont want to lose anything
no its holding in very well  doesnt turn over a little higher eg now than we had before with that big rock in there
fredo could you give us an idea of about what time we should arrive at weird how much more time
roger stand by 1
that 16millimeters bouncing all over every place
0ht to be a good  good  c nfidentt ay6
its taken photos from every view
okay i hate to mke a grab here thats not from this crater looks like that cut fairly deep though
yes lets  hey heres a whole batch of them right down here al lets grab those
which way left or right
off to the left and ahead  aroad that little crater theyre all from this same area
houston unable to see any stratigraphy in any of these craters the slumping has been such that its pretty much destroyed  
ill grab this one right here
  any evidence of stratigraphy
roger al and i assume positionwise youre past flank now is that correct or at least the d position of flank
no were not fredo were  no were not at fank  at flank yet id say were probably 15 minutes away from weird did you get it on board
as a matter of fact i think this is  this is flank right here
get it on board
yes ive got the rock on board
okay lets press
roger and one other question thats up there is to check for the stratigraphy reported earlier of the light graywhite layer below the top if you see that exposed anywhere
okay now we did not see that until we started approaching the edge of the boulder field the  theres no evidence of that at all that we ncticed onfident
ot down this far one thing i did notice  further outside of where we saw the white underneath  but it looked like an impact had either been of the white rock or it was a splatter of white and it vas just outside where a1 was reporting that the underlying layer was white as a matter of fact  no that just  the sun angle was causing it right now some of the spray that were kicking up looks white underneath but im convinced its just the angle i looked back the other way and it  its not substantiated
roger ed
hold i
thats what im trying to do
okay were moving along pretty well fred at this point and idsay were still probably about l0 minutes away from weird
veer good al it sounds like youre making a litvle better time going down than up
yes the slopes a different way fredo in this case the met helps
okay dont let me lose thatbaby thats it right there with the three  
yes
  with the three rocks beyond it
yes were getting down to the place where we wont see it
this is probably flank right here isnt it
im not going to say until i get down and look at the exact pattern it probably is al but if this is really flank we should have been at the top of cone crater where we were
yes i know c nfidentia 6 05 14 o0 ok lmp i think weve already passed flank now its stopped well have to wait on it
okay it maybe  looks down here ed  that maybe what youre looking at there if youve got another flanksize crater is the one by e
no this is a big crater i  its 40  561meters across it has a fairly sharp crater in the south edge of it which is 20  30 meters across
okay that looks like it may be the one by e
yes i think thats it fredo and its  io its at least 50 or 60 feet deep 05 14 0t 01 cdr why dont we just grab a couple from right here
yes okay
that baby came apart very soft
yes its falling apart as you pick it up very crumbly isnt it
okay you got a bag ready
yes 05 14o1 33 cdr very very soft rock  remember that crater  plus another one very close to us with crystal in it its flashing now going in the bag
15n
okay
okay copied 15n
okay to rush
not quite let me get it in there
stay behind me we dont want to lose anything now
okay t nfidentajlm
okay thats where were going right there
yesgoing right for weird head right for the big boulder then weirds right beyond it
ail right
easy
okaf keep going
this is ed im going back to mdium cooling
roger ed
we  one of the problems of going downhill here is that you have defric  essentially defraction i guess around your body and it creates a halo effect in your shadow and you just cant see a darn thing right in front of you
its completely either blacked out or washed out right  
copy ed
  immediately  immediately downsun of you were going predominantly downsun now
okay fred were still moving and  looks about 3 linutes away now from weird
roger al
the crater were going by now were just to the north of it fredo is an old subdued crater
if you want to run over behind that boulder over there ill tiufto talk to you
youre the one that has to get behind it and try to talk to houston
oh thats right
ill pull the met go ahead age tconfidenti
okay on second thought maybe its not big enough ill just  
no dont think it is
no i guess not sure is a big old boulder ill take a picture of it anyway
okay and this  this big boulder al is  youre just about at weird now is that right
oh probably a couple of hundred meters short of weird
this country is so rolling and lmdulating fred with rises and dips everywhere that you carlbe going by a fairly goodsize crater and not even recognize it
roger
okay back with you
okay i think this is weird right  to our right here  forward al see that fresh one right there i think thats the fresh one of the weird pattern
well  
okay a1 and ed on the weird task wed like to pan and grab samples at weird gad well pick up most of our tasks that we had bypassed at e  when we get to triplet
okay
okay ill get the pan i think a itself is right in here isnt it
where are you
behind you to your left see rjght down there
no i didlt think so i think this is it right here onfiden j
no thats too small i believe well anyway were in the area houston
take us a minute to find it i suppose you prob ably  well thats a pretty big one over here
okay al i think the  the pan will fill us in as to the exact position
okay pans underway now
okay pans complete did you get a grab sample ed
roger al
 grab some right up here al
okay
and i guess this is going in bag 16 is that right ed
this is in bag 17 fred sixteen got used  some time back
okaf
oka lets press on
its so darn big its hard to fold out
weve got a pm and a grab sample what else do we want from here houston
okay thats  thats it al wed like to proceed on to the north  
whupl
  triplet and  
wait a minute
 ill give you  the  tasks when we get there
oks well try to get to north triplet pag4e r6 c nfidentia 6
you ran out from under me just as i was picking it up
oh im sorry
okay
okay
oh man
 some blocks from the  
and a1 and ed for your stop for the e wed like that  take an estimated onecrater diameter short of the crater  north crater
you want us to stop onecrater dliameter short 05 14 10 26 3c thats affirm because some of the items coming up are the core and the trench
okay 05 14 10 31 3c triple core
i think were seeing the rim of the triplet series right ahead of us arent we al
i would say so yes if we can say thats the rim of the north right there
yes its got boulders on it ndhats the only thing big enough to have boulders were probably about one diameter out right ncw
id say we are right here 05 14 11 05  the way weve been estimating distarces today that rim has to be at least 6 miles from here
okay houston were about one dliameter to the east of north triplet
to the west of  yes east of triplet excuse me
okay confideni
okay copied and the number 1 item is the triple cot8
okay
wheres the third core tube
well why dont you use clean ones
i dont have clean ones
yes you do theyre down in this pocket right there
this one 05 14 1t 39 cdr let me get my camera tightened up
this ones been used
no no no in here ed
oh okay
the three tabs should be clean
ali right
okay well pull it back together here
do you have an 0 to that 
now im clear to the bottom of that i think
okay weve got the camera back together okay fredo for your info the cdrs commander is reading 117
poger al 117
okay ill get it
start with this one weve only got two fresh ones in here youve got four out that are used  or hat look like theyre used
kay the three tabbed ones we havent used yet let me get them ed jidnfide 6
okay ill take the tabbing off of this one
yes i think thats the best way to go lets mrke  make them 1 2 3 for simplicitys sake
i dont have a back from that onewhered it go
the bottom one will be number 11tube with a tab fredo got 2 there
roger 05 14 14 04 lmi number 3
okay hold on to that one okay and the other one will be number 2 with a tab
and the top one will be number 3 with a tab
roger al and were going to subtract off 15 minutes from that  extension due to plss oxygen
okay you still planning on  
so that gives us about  05 14 14 55 cdp go ahead
okay that gives us approximately 25 minutes at stop g here 05 14 15 11 cd5 twentyfive minutes until what
 help you okay i got this one go ahead start your trench if you like
okay i11 dig the trench in the far wall of this crater here ed
right
fredo ive tried to push in the core tubes  triple core tube  i get maybe a  oh 3 to 4 inches of pushing in by hand and its just surface stuff very soft  it will not support the weight of the core tube now ive got it balanced and i can take a picture of it perhaps
okay were reading you ed
okay well try to drive it
and do i understand correctly ed youre taking care of the triple core on your own there
thats affirm als digging  busy with his trench
okay very good
ill go over and help him photograph it in  a while and it  its not going in easy fred
roger ed
ill try driving it a bit more but i think im on solid rock and im about one core tube down
roger ed solid rock about one core tube down
yes
okay the recommendation ed is to pull it up and more  over a bit and try it again
the way this one feels itll be the same thing
okay ed and when you pull it out theyd like to save the bottom core and replace it with another one there when you try  before you try again
okay
hcws the trench going al are you getting  getting down there
ive got a trench here its going fairly easily but i need the extension angle  handle to get it deeper so ill wait until eds through with that im cutting into the rim of a crater which is ap proximately  oh say 6 meters in diameter has a depth of about threequarters of a meter and were back in about one diameter away from the north  triplet the trench is going through at least three layers that i can see the finegrain surface dark browns then a layer of what appears l m age 80 l onfident 6 to be quite a bit of glass and then a third layer of some very light material and we should be able to sample all three of these
fredo the core tube cap  
roger al
  core tube cap from that sample is in 18n
roger ed roger ed
and a very interesting looking rock with really finegrain crystals in it its a grab ssmple houston from that same crater in which im digging its too large for a bag its dark brown except where its fractured its fracture face is very light gray with very small crystals
roger al and if you can get any with you samples down in the trench itself that have any  rock fragments you might include those as part cf your sample
put it in the side bag put it in that side bag if you can these are all  i1t  full back here
okay
let me help you okay baby
are you about through with the extension handle or are you going to go 
go ahead and take it i dont really need it to  to drive 05 14 23 10 cdp ill go over and cut that baby and well  over here okay houston i know that  we did not men tion this white layer  down in this area before  that was so obvious to us just below the surface up near the flank of cone but it appears as though it is  quite a bit  well itts relatively deep as far as visual observation is concerned and certainly not any would be kicked up by footprints or by tracks or the like appears to be some of that here in this trench ttconeiden
fredo did you get my  
roger al
  my report that the core tube cap  tip was in 18
roger ed i got that 18n 05 14 24 32 imp okay and i have taken the bottom core of that one whioh was core 1 flagged and its now by itself  as a single core tube im going to replace that with  number i unflagged which is one a1 started to le earlier but didnt get anywhere with it
0kf number 1 unpegged on the bottom
you know whats happening in this trench its the  surface fines are so loose that theyre just falling down covering the layering that we want to eet i say were not going to get a classic vertical wall here houston on this trench
yes
and ed are you having any better luck on the triple core this time 05 14 26 25 imp ive got it in about half a tube but im  getting ready to take a picture of it so you can locate it then well go ahead and drive it the rest of the way in
roger ed
oks fredo theres three frames here probably 69 70 71 that are core tubes the first ones the aborted one that i couldnt  couldnt get in the second one  the second picture is the  this new attempt and a 15foot shot that i raised up and took a locater shot on the horizon on this one i think it might go
vey good ed
okay im getting down low enough im going to have to have an extension handle to finish driving it i think age onfidentia4 6
okay ill give it back to you im really kind of through with this trench
roger al
yes
okay fred bag 19 for the saple of the surface fine  that is from the  the surface layer of the trench
roger al bag 19 is the sample of the surface fines
i am unable to take from the walls of the trench the type of material  blocky type of material that i could see while i was digging so ill ust get a shovelful of that and well mix the surface with the second layer
roger al how deep did you finally end u getting down
well the trench is about a   it was covering all the evidence of stratigraphy
roger al
and houston im over 40 feet  50 feet from where a1 is and on the east side of these craters i have the triple core in about a tube and a uarter and its tightening up again i just dont think its going to go the rest of thway im maybe driving it a millimeter a stroke
okay ed
ill hit it a few more licks nd well see if we can break through or move it a little more no thats as far as it is going houston one and a quarter
okay ed well just take your judgment on that when you dont think youre getting it in any further you can stop there onfident
okay i think i could probably beat it for the next 10 minutes fred and not get another inch out of it
well i dont think you need the exercise you may as well extract it now 05 14 31 44 lmi i agree ill take a picture of it a final pic ture of it to show you how far we got with it
okay houston this is al and bag 21 is kind of a collection of the  the combination of the top two layers second layer is a thin layer of small glassylike pebbles and i was not able to separate that by the trench method so i gave it to you mixed up in the  that bag and the last bag will be pebbles from the bottom layer
okay al and about whats the thickness of the j intermediave layer there
well its really ephemeral  its laughs almost  its very thin i would say no more than a quarter of an inch thick and i just noticed it because of the difference in the grain structure as z was digging the trench
roger al
and in bag 20 2 o well fill a sample of the botom materiad also mixed up with the  some of the surface material thats fallen down in on top of it and thats about  call it 18 inches below the surface
roger al and when you and ed can work it in we need another f2u check
okay
this is al at 375 and reading  about   05 14 34 05 lmi oh hell
reading 35 i have no flags and im in  medium flow now going to min flow and feeling good
okay this is ed im 375   ctdnfidenti im 6
okay and what kind of misery are you having now ed 05 14 34 2 lmp 375 32 percent minimum  intertediate  just a minute  im in medium cooling and doing great 05 14 34 41 lm now my problem is i cant get the   05 1 34 42 cc okay 05 14 34 43 lm   driving down  driving doltc that rock i couldnt get the core cap off im going to have to get some help from al soon as he puts his handful of samples down okay thats great
okay let me get rid of this trencher
okay on the  on the agenda here we have remain ing documented samples and we need a pan 05 14 35 19 lq roger well get it for you
oh god 05 14 35 21 i2 get another one skip it weve got plenty 05 14 35 32 t shit 05 14 35 33 cdf yes 05 14 35 36 lmf okay houst  
okay and al one question did you get the sesc sample out of the bottom of the trench 05 14 35 k7 cdr well i told you the trench was kind of a miserable failure because the walls kept falling down and i could get a sample from the bottom but it wouldnt be the bottom im afraid
okay fredo the bottom  bit on this string was at  what  23 isnt it al thats the one you got
twentythree right 23
roger ed r clrchlti
okt we need a pan from here i can get that
okay
okay
and al when you get done with the pan i guess wed still like the sesc sample from the bottom of the trench even though it probably isnt the bottom
wel ill tell you ill go back and whack at it a little bit see what i can do
ok and a1 and ed we have about 8 minutes left here at triplet
roger youre still counting on a quick trip out to the alsep antenna
thats affirm al thats included in this time and when  when you start out wed like you to me some grab samples as you pass by north triplet
okay
fredo the triple core tube the second core didnt have anything in it as soon as i opened it up a little bit fell out and the second core tube is empty even though it drove down 
roger ed
  even though it drove in about 3 inches it didnt get anything
okay ed
okay ill put a bit back on that one save it
okay and when you get done there ed i guess you can proceed with getting some documented samples bfore we have to depart
okay
okay sesc gan  thats over in that pocket right 05 14 39 09 lmf yes 05 14 39 29 lm okay documented samples coming up
this white stuff on the rim here ed
beg your pardon
this white stuff on the rim here
yes document some of that heres a rock right here
okay has a1 moved over by the rim of north crater now
oh no were still at the same place
negative
thats pretty well disturbed al ill grab it  ill grab it without much documentation
okay
were digging the bottom of the trench for you fredo
okay al
im redigging the trench 05 14 40 38 l im picking up one of the  socalled whiter rocks fredo near the area where a1 is digging since its already disturbed im not going to waste time on much documentation kind of a kickedup rock
roger ed
man its going into 25nancy
okay we have about 3 and a half minutes left at triplet
okay were packing up now
one more documented sample
okay there is a special request rather than grab samples at the north crater rim there theyd like to get a documented sample of a partially buried rock
okay i was going to try to get you one of those rig here but it looks pretty big i think maybe i can get it anyhow
okay ed
oh no 05 14 43 30  whats the matter
i cant believe it
whats the matter al
oh that  seal came off that thing and 
okay ed and al were going to have to be depart ing triplet here  and that one brief stop at the north rim to pick up one documented sample  and get on back to the lm area if were going to pick up the remaining tasks there
okay okay youre right
fred this documented sample that i got of the buried rock its too big for our regular weigh bas see what i can do with it the regular sanple bags  im sticking one over it but itll never close okay its going in it and will probably stay but it wont close it its bag naber  
okay thatll probably be all right ed were going to have to move out now
its bag 26n
okay ed
okay ill grab the gnomon were on our way 05 1 46 20 cdr  the last i see of that son of a bitch age488 confidentiadii ay6 05 14 46 29 lmm theyre miserable arent they 05 14 46 36 cdb okay 05 14 46 40 lmic oh let me grab it for you
what that thing what what do you mean  that can
yes
forget it 05 14 46 48 i4mp okay
were never going to use it again okay headed for the lm and were probably bout 2 minutes away from the lm houston
roger al
okay everythings on so far
okay were 
were close 
heres the   05 14 47 46 i2vip triplet right up ahead of us
could be
well have to do a little bit to the north to get around it i think
yes
were approaching triplet from the  from the  east north triplet from the east theres some  a little rock field down here  a small boulder field al to get a documented sample from
okay
looks good yes looks like they might have come from there  confidentia 05 14 h8 26 cdr oops
idyou lose something 05 14 8 20 cdr you lost you kno what
oh no ghat
laughter this shiny can
damn sesc huh
okay the shiny can is retrieved press on going to have to mush ed right down the mddle and get a dccumented ssmuple there
okay
man that pile of rocks  beautiful right there  right to your left oh just the right size 05 14 49 08 lmpcdr okay
dont walk over them
no im trying to stay away from them
there you go
are these the ones  the ones over here
yes
okay
god damn that zhing
okay
gnomon is in place
okay why dont 
ill get the  go ahead im on this side ill get the stereo
okay age 90 jonfidentiab
get the locater 05 14 49 49 cde cant even see the camera settings
yes thats got so much dirt orlthem okay 7 foot 
okay ed and al as soon as you wrap this one up were going to have to press on back to the lm or were going to be really tight on the closeout
okay
okay
all covered with dirt huh 05 14 50 30 imp yes god damn its bigger than we thought al well grabsample that one ill get you another one here
okay listen just put it in that  in that thing and lets press  because we dont have the time
all right ill grab itg and let me take a picture  an extra picture here
ail right ill grab one right here in the foreground 05 14 50 50 lmi okay
okay bag 27nancy and another documented sample  
roger al 27nancy 05 14 51 02 i    a larger documented sample than we thought we were getting here fredo agail it was a buried rock and its too big for the sample bag so itll go into the weigh bag
put it in that one right there can you get it
yes icon fidentia j
okay
it has a very definite shape i think youll be able to sort it out
okay
okay lets mush for the lm
okay
okay a1 and ed i guess we can skip the rim of north crater amd proceed right on back to the lm are a
thats where we are were at the  were at the rim of north crater on the west  
okay
  rim of north crater
i think you misunderstood the message we can prcceed right on by the rim we have the buried rock samples now and head on back to the lm
thats right thats where were headed
thats the antares
okay thats where were headed hold it
ill get it keep going he lost the core tube
okay got it
ill have it in a minute i got it
okay
everything still hanging on
yes everything is still there
good
okay were approaching the lm now coming in to fra mauro base age iconfident1ab ii 6
roger al and i guess from here well  we can split up and ed can take the iftand proceed to the cluster of boulders he had reported earlier to the north of the lm and you can proceed out to the alsep 05 14 54 31 cdflmp okay 05 14 5k 33 cdf id suggest  well you can do it vhe way you want to  i guess you can do without the lm 05 14 54 39 lmf without the met yes
without the met because theres nobody ko  if anything falls off weve lost all those goodies 05 14 54 28 l i think sl just take a couple of rock bags   05 14 54 49 c okay thats it 05 14 54 50 imp   fredo my tongs and camera and go
okay als on the way
thats a good point ed yes thatll be fine 05 14 55 02 i2p okay als on the way out to rhe alsep 05 14 55 15 lmip as a matter of fact fredo im just going to take a weigh bag and no sample bag that way i can get more the size of these rocks i  the sample bags are too small anyhow
roger ed 05 14 55 33 imp houston 
okay al the first thing when you get to the central station  is vo check tlhe alinement an2 verify the alinement and leveling
okay im just going to go throagh the same proce dure as i used during the setup that is   05 il 55 53 cc okay and i got  i got a change fcr you on vhe azimuth i confidenti
all right let me give you a call when i get there and when im alined and level 05 14 56 33 imp okay fredo my plan im out in the area of the boulder field im going to photograph many of the boulders the rocks the broken ones the big ones what have you  and then grab as many of the different fragments as i can around these piles of broken boulders i  now that im here i see a large number of inclusions  i cant tell whether theyre crystals or not  i think that they are and ill grab as many of these  and give you be fore and after shots as i can  of a whole weigh bag full of rocks
okay ed that sounds great 05 l 57 18 cdr okay the center alinement on the alsep has changed ve little ought to be a slight change in the bubble level stand by
roger al
okay alined and level go ahead with your readings
0k al the  setting we need is now  actually a change in the azimuth reading to 16 1600
1600
okay you have 1600 and you have  
okay would you verify elevation is still at 6417
641 is still elevation stand by  
okay stand by 1 al
okay
okay al you can proceed back to the vicinity of the lm and with the time remaining that you had for the alsep shoot a few closeup pictures here weve got about 4 minutes left
okay are the alsep signals satisfactory age tonfidentia 6 05 14 59 43 cc thats affirmative 05 14 59 45 cdp okay heading back to the 
and al houston 05 15 0l 01 cdf go ahead houston
okay a little change in the priorities when you get back to the lm wed like the qfturned to look at the msa area so we can watch the closeout number 1 and then you can shoot a quick picture of the solar wind
roger im going for the camera now
okay and we havent changed tlhe settings al so its  it should  should be in good shape when you turn her to the mesa
okay well be setting at 22
okay we need a little more to the right al
yes im just setting it up fled
okay
okay thats f22 how does that look
well should  a little more  more to the left just a minute
im shooting f22 in peak how does that look
okays if you can tilt it just uslightly al thatll be it that s good you got good azimuth on it now
okay hows that
okay thats great and you can go shoot the solar wind now
its on the side of a hill thats a problem out here confidentiaw
okay fredo im heading back from the boulder field ive sampled two of the larger boulders in the area rocks broken from them and lying on them and ive taken a pan and i have a  maybe a third of a weigh bag full of small rocks from these boulders
okay very good ed we need to proceed now with the regular program
okay
what setting would you like on that solar wind shot fredo
staad by
okay al id go ahead and use your  your stand ard downsun picture if thats the direction youre shooting it in they dont have an input here
ail right
okay the last  just got an input they want fll at 125th
okay will do
and al houston
go ahead
okay theyd like for you to return your camera so you dont have to bother removing the magazine from it you can just put the whole camera in the et3
roger
okay and i guess so you dont get confused that means well be bringing back both cameras
yes understand
okay als cmera is in and mgazine limalima has got a 109 pag e96 onfidenti 6 05 15 06 18 lp okay houston and i understld now the contami nated sample under quad 3 is not to be taken
thats affirm ed 05 15 06 32 l  okay
okay im putting my camera in the etb let me slide by you there just a minute
okay ed houston
go ahead
i stand corrected what they really wantea was to bring als camera back instead of yours so well only be bringing the one camera the cdrs 05 15 07 29 i2 okay houston 05 15 07 35 cd excuse me just a minute 05 15 08 01 lm right right fredo correct me now mg kilokilo has never been used isnt that correct
stand by
houston while youre looking that up you might recognize what i have in my hand as the handle for the re  contingency sample return it just so happens to have a genuine six iron on the bottom of it in my left hand i have a little white pellet thats familiar to millions of americans i drop it down unfortunately the suit is so stiff i cant do this with two hands but im going to try a little sandtrap shot here 05 15 08 51 ip you got more dirt than ball that time
got more dirt than ball here we go again here we go
that looked like a slice to me al
straight as a die one more
miles and miles and miles jconfidenti
vex good al and  to answer eds question earlier there kilokilo was used for the window shots ed so you ought to bring it back 05 15 09 41 ip hey thats right we got some of that to start wih didnt we
yes
okay
how many films did we take with this seven huh
approximately seventeen okay
okay ed houston
go ahead
one additional item on the return is to bring back the 100foot tether that should also go in the etb
okay okay theres three cassettes and three famcs 05 15 11 39 lm okay the closeup camera cassette is removed fred
roger ed
and stowed thatll go in there
houston do you read me
think thatll clear
yes okay
loud and clear al
kay tell me about this tube ed has this got anything in it
no thats  thats one thats left  nothing in it before you throw it get the number thats the tube that we didnt get anything from ik i111 ik irm age 98 t unilulrl day6
okay okay in src2 fredo we have the organic control sample and we have four core tubes
roger

start unzipping these suits
okay
  nasa msc coral houston texes
stand by for sivb to orbit
mark you have sivb to orbit now
roger sivb orbit
and its beautiful this trajectory is absolutely fantastic
right along the 
its better than the simulator
okay we got about 45 seconds now  nominally
eleven minutes
this guidance is steady as a rock
we are right in the numbers just right   seems like theres something i ought to be doing strike 20 seconds from the board  now
there its real comfortable
about 5 seconds
inboard cutoff
roger inboard
right on time
thats beautiful
that computes to   
there she goes
hey did you feel that pu valve
yes
yes sure did didnt hear it though 8 confide ayl o0 o0 08 02 cml well i  i had to give you noise from the simu lator good cant give you everything were within 2loths in altitude just right down the money
stay that way baby
about 20 seconds to level sense arm
14 houston youre go for staging the cmcs go 00 00 08 29 cm roger cmc go just a little high but its bringing the hdot down just a little vibration about    o000 08 42 cc we have level sense arm
roger level sense arm
very slight pogo and starting at 840
yes 00 00 08 53 ip time hack you ought to be pretty close to mode iv
just a little high were about a mile high it ought  
stand by for mode iv capability
mark you have it now
 seconds to speed roger mode iv 00 o0 09 16 c okay were at 100 
should have a cutoff we have a 
cutoff
roger cutoff o0 o0 09 22 v look at the flakes go
and staging
look at the ice go up there
yes 
and good thrust on 1
theres a big outside
a jillion stars
good thrust on 1
okay
14 houston thrust looks good on sivb
thank you
okay okay were at 1013 and its bringing the hdot down starting our run now
  
just about 2000 feet to go
 in mode iv 00 00 09 54 c at 1015 ill  okay we have 100 25 5 77 25 5 15 okay 256 60
256 60
is  is our shutdown
okay on the stage switch
on the stage switch
 get it  
14 houston everythings looking perfect here 00 00 10 17 cml roger
hdot is just about zero were 102  
here i can get it p elo    ayl 00 o0 10 26 cp okay got about 1500 feet to go

okay well holler when youre ready and ill come back to you
were probably pretty well ahead of schedule timewise arent we
well im a little behind on

okay
thank you
  42
okay can i help you with anything now
you can read the helium pressures  ill  ill get those i just thought that  
on the quads 00 00 29 25 l yes
okay you on b now
now why did they put those that way
yes
okay and you want  
4000
  quantitys 100 and full scale high and tank temp is 74
okay
you got tank temp down there ahmm
okay  
for    
  let me just get the pressures and then the tanks and the quantities because i have to copy them all down
1
helium 41 on c
okay
41 on b now what do you need
okay thats helium  i need manifold press
okay manifold pressure is 200 on d 
okay
200 on c 00 00 30 15  okay
200 on b
okay
and 200 on a 00 o0 30 19 l very good
okay helium tank temp  i need to record
okay tank temps on a at 75 00 00 30 26 i2p 75
b is 72 c is 81 and d is 77 00 00 30 36 i2p okay propellant quantity

okay okay command module rcs monitoring talkback gray
ill get the cameras in a little bit
yes okay were in no hurry  
im going to read y optics dust cover jettison
okay
yes we didnt have to worry about the cameras before
690 60 90
yes
that looks good  
okay install optics eyepieces and handles   00 00 31 08 4p   21 to 22  
  thats done gn power optics on up 00 00 31 11 p   manifold press 81 to 105 thats good those are good okay secondary radiator leak check
optics zero off 00 00 31 26 p  quantity  
optics zero zero
al could i have the secondary glycol to radiator valve  
optics mode n 00 00 31 31 p   normal fcr 30 seconds and then bypass
tzziiiil mconfide i
optics coupling  direct optics speed control hi
okay
okay thatll be 15 seconds okay lets see if weve got the monitor optics hand control okay is manual hi direct and going max right going about 0 degrees and this one ought to go about 150
man it looks  its pure black cant see be cause im not adapted  lens cover and you need to 
did you get all of your jettison  optics dust cover jettison checklist stu 00 00 32 39 cml yes i did 00 00 32 hl lmp okay gn optics on optics zero off
yes
zero for 15 o0 go 32 47 cmp thats verified
optics zero off optics mode manual then
thats verified
coupling control direct and hi speed  speed control hi and max right until ejected 00 00 32 58 c thats verified
okay
okay ed you want to go from normal to bypass now
yes for 30 seconds
okay here it is right now 
okay i got it confide l
oh wait a minute wait a minute somethings wrong here 
no no i wanted secondary glycol to radiator valve for normal secondary glycol
okay glycol secondary radiator valve  i cant see that mother 00 o0 33 24 c manx those stars are dimmer than they are in the simul ator
is our  light in here bothering you stuart 00 o0 33 30 cf no no i  ive got them
okay ed i think ive got it now 00 o0 33 21 ipip okay youve got her in bypass huh

okay im just watching the  quantity there 00 00 3h 47 cdr okay thats about 30 seconds 00 00 34 58 i24p it looks good we have no leaks
okay back in bypass 00 00 35 03 i24p okay im ready to set a configuration here i need the glycol reservoir bypass valve to open
okay stand by 1 glyc bypass valve open

optics zero to zero 00 00 38 32 p and if we torqued we should reatine the gdc 
okay now  yes just a minute go optics zero after we get them down to a certain angle right
yes im going to try to do that its really not part of our operation but you cant go wrong doing it
im  im going to bring the purge on well get a master alarm
okay ball 1 att set imu roll was about  180 fuel cell 2 okay and the yaw is set about  that much and the pitch is way over at 220
okay fuel cell purge is complete
okay does it call for me to turn the optics  gin optics power off 00 o0 40 06 iap  16

well youre probably not adapted yet 00 o0 41 57 cml yes yes i got down here with these floodlights flaring out   ieonfidentt
yes
after i turned them out i could see gienah through it the second time around so i was adapting okay looks like all i need to do is the  is to get out the stowage bag  
got a good horizon out here

yes might as well
· im going to load 2110 okay 03 11 56 11 cml before you  hold it just a second before ycu enter let me do that one more time just to make sure we didnt get out of  okay now enter it okay 03 i1 56 24 cdr what did you do that for 03 11 56 26 cma well see were in a 5degree dead band
yes
if you change that  if you change that to a narrow dead band it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5degree dead band what cycling this to free and auto does is  it centers the dead band ceonfidenti
i already did it once before i called up the 43 
well i was noticing the roll  the drift up see youre going to a  a half a degree dead band  
 drifted off 03 11 56 50 cml   so anything  more than a half a degree will cause a jet to fire
yes okay et was off half a degree 03 i1 56 56 cml well you knc what  whats a half a degree it was off a little bit
the att  it was actually rolling apparently 03 11 57 04 cml yes were  you know were  we were drifting in a 5degree dead band its just that im real  see we just had a firing there yes after we sat there and talked about it its  its the pro on that 21101 son of a gun see we just wasted some gas we were talking about it
we were talking  
yes but see if youre moving youve established it at that point but then if youre drifting along  and i should have remembered that as many tlmes as ive  watched that anyway you enter sad then when you pro on  on the 21101 what youre doing is youre shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead band but you dont change the center
you change your center by going to free  
yes
  and back to auto
see we had already drifted out because we got the firing
yes okay well we should have   03 ll 58 15 cml just before we proed   pag1e 4 onfidentj
just before you pr0ed

  not  not just before you eter

you had the right idea but you did it the ong way

do you want to use myrtle also
while its in here thank you i dont really need  no i dont really need  no i dont need to its going to be awhile before i really get a chance to again no i talked myself out of it

we could extrapolate from the   
oh well  yes the  at least as my  far as my solo book goes the aoslos was in a minute of  shown in the  on my solo book
ail they do is read me the 180 time so thats probably what they were doing here in fact i may have said that if anybody would say that i said that i would agree with them  not any where around the points of the moon are they
no  can say what way were pointing

theres our loveletts again little lovelett thats oriented like that kay that is chaplygin 
which ones chaplygin 03 12 17 13 cml its off my side
are we headed for mendeleev
that should be over on your right
thats what i hought
yes there it is the tracks are across the mid dle of it
those are definitely secondaries in the center of mendeleev
im  thats not the current thinking
isnt it
no
thats a crater chain
rater chain right davy and  confidentiatf
yes you can sure get fooled easily but it sure looks like a batch of secondaries
 crater chain hadnt ever seen it it ices make a difference doesnt it
im not about to argue with them at this pcint
what am i supposed to be doing 8458 im not doing anything just checking my camera ckay
and null bias check
they didnt want me to do that  the backside

hey my  my  03 12 21 10 lp are we supposed to be doing any photography at all on this  ·
i have got the crater king out here stu if you were looking for it
yes thats one of our targets thats one of farouks favorite craters 03 12 22 25 ip pretty damn interesting one too 03 12 22 39 i2p really an interesting one huh that one  looks like  got a rugged one right out here  with the central peaks
 03 12 23 05 il sure does really got a very complex central structure 03 12 23 08 cr its got one of the biggest central peaks aound its a very unusual crater but there are some dark areas in it that farouk has gone on record as saying they are dikes confidentia 03 12 23 37 cml high sun thats one right down there just shows how it dominates the whole photograph just an extremely bright crater sun angle just isnt high enough for you to see it here  yes tieyre mining it  i think
whats the name of that one
it has no name ive called it the bright one this is langemak that were just going over right down here
its got to be fairly fresh too 03 12 2h 42 cmp yes its a very bright crater

probably came from the lm a lot of those little baies floating around we brought them back and they probably just floated out of our pockets
ill put it over here but it will probably float out of there too
have you hooked the  on
208
208
okay whats your confidence on getting a hack on exct burn time now that you have looked at three of them ed
its within 2loths
okay great are you going to count down to zero  208 you have to shut it down on zero
were going to wait until he calls zero and then move the switches
okay
ill not try vo have them off at the time he says zero
ail right c dnfidentiaj 4 03 13 54 39 g if you do that the an and z are together it will beat you  if its 
sure one    03 13 54 45 imp if its 210ths over youll have them off lets  lets say 3loths on my time youll have them off within 310tbs and we  we wont overburn more than 310ths

and  somebody  does it look like the hycons wied out
left left and 
that son of a hitch 
okay were getting ready to start the zerophase observations on target 1 im now running  det was started at  tstart at 1115943 and im wating to try again
first target at 807
 5
okay starting at 905
 yet if not   pag1e90 confident l
and approaching 4 minutes 04 15 25 02 cml okay there are nytargets targets a b c
okay standing by to start the time thats 5 minutes
mark intervalometer going okay s i have tar gets a b and c c will be the firs intc the zerophase picked them up withcut any difficulty at all  anyway intervalometer  again 04 15 26 14 cm2 an a b  okay looks like c is just abcu in zerophase now and i really have losz c az zero phase thats a pretty good picture there as it moved into zerophase it was essentially wipe out
now its coming back out again 04 15 26 h6 cpe okays b you just almost lose b going tc zero phase i can tell where it is by the oher craters  pointing at it but if you didnt have that help itd be tough 04 15 27 12 cmip and now were going into  as goin in toward zeroyhase in fact im quite surprisea how washed out they do become i had anticipaae i would be able to stay with them a little more than that
well were going  its 7 minutes so a will e moving towards zerophase amd its pretty much the same story zerophase is that  is thav con dition  it  it really  kind of surprisinf how it  how it wipes it out i think you can tell the general area on b in particular that with zhe leadin you could  you could find it with  with b its pretty much totally wiped ouz a  at zerophase and a had a little better lnjnarks around it
okay im switching to second target now am a shows up extremely well b is  you cn see b here now its just starting to go into  int zero phase as it moves on up but b is a  bs a mighty rough target even without zerophase confideniial c it  age191
and you can  you can hang onto a pretty well b  b just  i just didnt find long enough to give a good  a good impression on that one  on that one i guess overall id rate it  at 
but a in  in target 2 you can almost hang onto  b in target 1 
now of course target 2b is hard to find even under good conditions so  but itd be impossible at the  at the zerophase point and im going to quit now and ill give you a little summary here ill rate these as i  by the criteria that we set up 0kay on target 1 id rate c 
okay im going to turn off the intervalometer no let it rn for another 20 seconds but i  im so far out i  i really cant  it says you got to let the dac run until 122 okay ail right id raise  id rate c in area 1  id rate c as low b as medium and a is  is low 2a medium and b very low
i think what would really help you is  is relief around like c was out pretty flat and then when it got zerophase it pretty well wiped it out but  okay and on my mark the dac will be going off stand by
mark i let it slip one
mark there that was the last picture on tar gets 1 and 2
and just a little more on the debriefing i think if theres some relief around it helps you quite a bit like c was out flat and youd lose it b i had the good chain of craters going into it so you could pick that up and  and a also it was the landmarks that really  really had you pick it up but when its out flat it just washed it out completely
okay houston kitty hawk
3447 3409  klrlrlklti a i age confidentt4 04 15 3 17 cmp hello houston this is kitty hawk
kitty hawk how do you read
well  i never saw b a all and a  pick up  zerophase b was just completely wiped out  clue is  some relief by you even iazero phase  best of the three  pretty well hng  and a was about  04 15 38 31 c well  04 15 38 38 cl okay  on the tape  this other  04 15 40 50 c  loud and clear   oh 15 41 09 cmp okay youve always been loud and clear  04 15 41 30 cm2 okay ron are you going to let the tape ru far the  next sighting 04 15 46 55 c  and houston kitty hawk do you wanl me z terminate the charge on b and start one on able
okay
okay thank you 04 16 00 36 cm okay ill do that 04 16 00 56 cmf and stand by 04 16 00 59 cm mark cameras running five minutes okay d now i can pick up to ptolemaeu to ptolemaeus a and i can pick up bright crater yes even at this low elevation targets a and b show up real well the trouble of it is it doesnt look to me like the cameras on target but  theyre a little too far to the left but anyway i cnt see targets  both targets a and b by themselves i guess i used that little bright crater up by b maybe as a goue but it showed up pretty well theres no problem on acquisition houston appear to just be gettin better as i  as i come up in elevavion of course i guess it wouldnt surprise me to come up ere and see that i picked up the wrong target con fidenti t
i really dont think this cameras pointed right ron its boresightea right down  looks like the junction between ptolemaeus and alphonsus but anyway my  both targets a and b  had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them even a is the  the hardest its not quite as straight now b had a  had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the  of the obser vation a is  is a little more subdued but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to and thats  thats really a nosweat on  on this one much  much easier than the  those on the back side in fact i rated some of those with zero and id have to give them up on  on both these targets  cone crater
and the hard part is over once you acquire them at that low elevation in fact the elevation is as difficult as  any sort of sun problem that wculd be here as we go  go towards the zero phase i guess its probably still about 08h0 and id guess about 40 minutes to go its still hanging in there right now no  no problem at all particularly b its  it hasnt the  the bright surface on the center across the crater  tkat makes it that much easier lets see i can see the zerophase and i guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer and i es see zerophase now approaching target a so tkis should be a  a good test been no problem to acquire up to now 04 16 04 39 cml theres zerophase just about on a and the camera took the picture okay we went through zero pkase on a with  with no problem  hanging on to tile landmark itself
zerophase is passing b  at this time and it again is definitely no problem
and now as we come cut of the  out of the zero phase it gets constantly better of course and ill be switching targets at 0958 its 0924 now both targets at ptolemaeus are ready to pick up of course its no problem now picking those ut  jl ipl ll l i  04 16 05 59 c okay were going to switch now and take a loek at  at parry and  actually this one here is again extremely easy you can pick up both  both targets a and b as soon as you see it nc sweat i think youd use the  of course youd use the  parry and parry m to guide you itcthe area but once you got into the area why a and b just stand out so good that here again is  primarily  its  the elevation angle helys because were up a little higher and  and also the bright crater stages show  extremely well its like you got the crater with a bright rim it real helps with low elevation
in fact zerophase is approaching  approaching the area now and both targets are  are hangin in there 0 16 07 22 c camera went just right at zerophase nd here again it was extremely easy to recognize the targets  this would be  really again a no sweat proposition to pick the targets up zero phase  really doesnt have that big an effect on  on these two targets
okay and now ill stop and rate them here seems like a good time i guess target a was exremely good all the way along target b also was uite easy to recognize but here again prim  primarily because of the  of the sun shining on the  on the crater rim an older more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up but with those  with those bright  bright rims  bright sie o  both targets a and b it was really no problem okay and my last picture i will give you a mark when it goes off itll be a little past 1232 04 16 09 21 c and  0k 16 09 22 cmp mark last picture on target 4 camera is off 04 16 11 11 c okay ill get to moving here and then ill pick me up at  oh maybe between 50 mhd 58 first frame number should be eight  onfidential
okay just a couple of more comments while theyre fresh in my mind i think there was a big differ ence between the frontside and the backside passes and thats primarily because on the  on the front side were picking out craters that were out in a flat area and they had the rim up behind them to  to guide you in on it i think youd  youd use the  the large gross features to get you pointed in the right area of the  of the mare or the flat surface and  and then the  the rim of thc crater would  would  would show up and you could guide in on it both those craters at parry were quite fresh they had a bright rim the tar get a in the ptolemaeus was fairly subdued  but still yet it did show up and you could hold on to it right through zerophase so let me see id rate 
id rate both  both targets 3 and 4  high

configure camera  the right one 
okay on the zodiacal light the  after the first 20second frame i got out of shut  sync on the shutter and i fired off two more frames before i got down to  to 10 seconds and then i went to 10 seconds and then 5 seconds in order

roger i copied  copied all of that
roger serial number 1002 and 305
kay give me a call when you get there and i11 tart the timing
starting the clock
go ahead ed
kay i got all  all readings ed
roger high scale time skip
kay were getting ready to start the zerophase observations on targets 5 and 6 were a minute d a half past the tstart time waiting for 5 minutes  to put on the camera
passed over target 1
sure is a lot of difference with this low sun than here was yesterday kind of amazing about c low in particular how it  you really lose it  zerophase
well tell you what at this low  sun angle you can see a b on target 2 but its still  still almost unidentifiable thats just really a tough target a shows up real well at this low sun angle youd be hard put to call which crater was b  at any sun angle 05 19 06 02 cml okay at 0420 turning on the dac here shortly camera 
and i lost them all  so on that one at the switch point i could not pick up target a at all et was just too subdued b was easy to pick up and c also c  c was  was very easy to pick up going through zerophase b was completely wiped out a i never did have to start with so it was wiped out and c  c held through zerophase and reason ably well but as it got further on up it too got pretty well wiped out i think its the same bit of being on the  being on the backside you just  the terrain is  you dont have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that  that you need to pick out  to pick out the targets its  what  very little contrast in albedo and  you  you just dont have the  the ability o see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday and i guess in summary now for targets 3  very easy to pick up at the time i picked them up of course the sun was low an them and im going to turn off this  test lever under panel 18 okay ill leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape a  a b nd ccn target 3 picked up very easily saw them into zerophase surpri  b is a fairly shallow crater but it even held up as good as c id out b u c both completely wiped out at zerophase a held to zerophase but then as it went on up you surely couldnt have picked it up  by itself if you didnt know the relation to some other terrain all three of those were  once youre well past zerophase itd be a rather marginal target and on target 6 i never got a at all  it was already wiped out b went real fast in zerophase approach c you could still identify after zerophase but just because you knew it was there knd then i got pretty well wiped out as it  as it went orup
and im turning off the camera it just maie is last mark ill let it hit one more let iu cycle one more time
mark the end of the strip okay houston how do you read kitty hawk 05 19 15 11 cml whistling

fred recommend that when your window comes around facing the earth again that you catch another one of those pictures and at the same time you should probably start ptc again we might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you the disable two quads only applies to an early step in the procedure we didnt mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement enable all jets over
okay
houston apollo 13
apollo 13 houston go ahead
vance fred said that you had some more informa tion about ptc and a different way of establishing it or something huh
roger referring to the procedure on g82 if you have that open ill tell you what we had to give you
okay stand by and ill get it out 0008 08 lb cc okay  pac 37
okay olcad van
okay on checklist g82 under step 5 tberts a statement disable all jets on two adjacent quads and thats what we were referring to when we called up saying disable quads a and b so thats all fine however going down now to step 7 where it says enable all jets we hoped that you didnt think we meant leave a and b disabled there in that case its as written ail jets should be enabled over
okay our checklist has all jets scratched out and it says enable couples on all axes so what well do is  well reestablish this thing and come down to that step 7 and well enable all jets that means enable quads a and b is that right 
thats affirm youll have a b c and d en abled for step 7
okay real fine ill start on it now
okay understand youre going to reestablish it 00 08 10 46  and vance on that picture i was all set to shoot it just a little before you called and the earth hasnt showed up in the window yet i dont know if we got too far off the bellyband or what

roger youre coming in a little weak have a recommended roll rate for this ptc if you could copy pae 38
alright go uhead
okay recommend that you put in ri the following 03750 and that should give you exactly a rate of 03 degrees per second over
okay enter 03750 is plus or minus our choice
roger the same direction you rolled the last time which i believe is plus
okay
hey vance would you monitor our rates and kind of give an idea of when you think theyre stable enough to start ptc
roger jack well take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough
okay ive got quads a and b disabled here
roger

jim houston here two items first of all your ptc is looking very good and it should carry you through the night second point have a procedure to give you if youre ready to copy wed like to set three bits in the computer and ill explain why 00 09 24 43  go ahead vance were ready to copy
okay the procedure is as follows verb 25 noun 07 enter 1331 enter 7 enter and enter explanation as follows during the p23s there was one time when verb 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the optics zero switch was flicked to zero this is a very uncommon anomaly in that if you do this during  04second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics some optmode bits are reset and this would mean that if you had a ocdu fail it wouldnt be indicated so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be
okay vance and i guess ill try to be slower on that verb 37
yes actually slower or faster either one i guess well s yes slower its a very unusual thing to have that happen
okay and s houston stand by for a mark on another picture

hey maybe the fact that you verified that the earth really turns we can call this haises theory huh lap c 8 page 4
very good vance very good
no seriously very interestingly we can see on the map now that youre between guam and hawaii and a little bit north and youre almost out 60 000 miles
yes i just did a p21 and we had 55 900
okay thats pretty good
ill let you look at it again here

okay
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
okay looking at our computations back here we show you about 55 450 and going out rapidly now
well hal might be a little bit off

good lord
houston 13
13 houston youre very weak please repeat
vance to my calculations we have taken about 10 earth window photography pictures i see nothing coming up here except to elose the waste stowage vent here in a little while i was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon
okay that sounds good jim fao here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down if you dont mind
okay well come through with one more picture
okay
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
a couple of items jim the first is the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 1224 if you turn in before that time why its okay as far as were concerned down here to close it before that time just before you go to bed the second point we have some results on the p23s and if jacks interested we could give him the corrected altitudes were getting and so forth
yes i sure am vance
okay this is preliminary results but it will give you some indication corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers and the fact that its plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that youre being very consistent in judging the altitude the effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers comments are that as i said before youre being consistent on the horizon selection the sub stellar point error is averaging 15 arcminutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum you might shoot for 5 arcminutes thats the only comment there over
okay well try doing it better next time
but theyre real satisfactory rlp ll fu 1 o0 11 32 43 cmp okay jhank vance o0 ll 32 46 cc roger

correction to 28
13 houston understand though the number showing that you read on the camera was 28 is that affirm

okay well thats to be expected i guess
yes
and were starting to charge battery a houston
roger on battery a fred eecomm says battery b looks real good
okay
houston 13
go ahead
okay for information fred was on comm last night and he was over in the lefthand seat and if you want our radiation readings we just goofed we left them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away we are going to get out jacks suit in an hour or so anyway and well get ais dosimeter out if you wanted to get the reading on that one
okay that will be satisfactory
okay
and in exchange for that the surgeon would like to have a rough number of hours each of you slept and a qualitative verb to describe whether it was good fair or poor
okay stand by
okay houston we had an average of around 5 or 
jim houston your comm got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk
okay houston apollo 13
okay 13 youre loud and clear again
we averaged about 512 hours sleep apiece and we are estimating that the sleep was good
okay copy that lets see what else we have for you jim mideourse2 looks like about 23 feet per second approximately retrograde and on time and its holding real firm now for your information and you dont need to copy this down because its still pretty soft but we have an sivb impact of about 857 south and about 339 west which is a little west and a little south of the flight plan value we have it at a get of about 77 plus 51 which is just before aos and the loi pads are a little bit late and as i say its still pretty soft and well be updating you with firm numbers
thats fine joe just as long as it doesnt hit cone crater
okay and ill have a consumables update for you in a little while and i have a small flight plan update for you sometime a little later on when youre ready to copy theres no big deals in it
roger
and 13 houston wetd like to verify that you cycled the 02 cryo fans we saw the h2 but we didnt see the 02 get stirred up
yes joe we did and it kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on we had a cryo press light
okay eecomm told me that might happen and he was right apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription 00 23 21 51 c j okay joe were ready tocopy a fikht pan update and your consumables
okay jack the flight plan update has a couple of items in it and the first one wed like to do is to update the tephem values in the gc check list on page g92 these are fairly small changes but in case you need them wed like you to have the exact numbers over
okay just a minute ill get it out
joe was that the gc checklist page 92
thats affirmative gc page g92
okay go ahead
kay on that page in line 04 column b change the number from 03366 to 05253 over
 53
okay and in line 05 column b change from 11000 to 33661 over
33661
okay thats right the only other thing ive got for you jack is three additional questions for the booster systems debriefing which is to take place at about 25 hours and we thought wed pass these questions up to you early so you can consider them over
okay were ready to copy
okay the first extra is and let me get the original question because this question says qmore specifically on item 2 and item 2 says fwere there any significant changes in the noise ihration level during the single stage of powered flight specifically describe your observations during the early sii center engine outoff and approximately 90 seconds prior to tli cutoff you reported a high vibration in the sivb wed like you to describe the buildup of this vibration and its behavior through cut off over
okay essentially what youd like us to talk about is vibration sequence during the early sii cutoff of the center engine and also describe the vibrations that we encountered during the sivb tli burn is that correct
 thats it okay the second extra question is for you jim and it says comparing this flight with your ride on apollo 8 were there any sig nificant differences in the powered flight environment
okay well describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes
roger and the last additional question is what did the ordeal ball look like during tli as you know we passed you an update to that setting and wed like to know whether it was riding right on zero or what during the burn over
okay will do well describe the ordeal ball
kay thats it and thats the whole flight plan update i have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that
kayjoe were ready to copy
kay at 23 hours the total rcs is 1121 quad a s 274 quad bravo is 286 quad charlie is 274 quad delta is 287 and the cryos are as follows h2 tank 1 83 percent h2 tank 2 86 percent 02 tank 1 87 percent 02 tank 2 87 percent over

and houston jacks going to try donning his suit now for practice himself and when he gets it out well give you a dosimeter reading
kay real good
houston apollo 13
3 houston go
okay weve retrieved jacks dosimeter and its reading 02022
okay we copy 02022 on the dosimeter jim
thats affirm
13 houston at your convenience wed like the lmcm deltap reading
that reading is 065 psi
copy 065 thank you apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription
apollo 13 houston
houston apol  roger were thinking together and were here waiting for your call
okay you were a little broken up there jim but i think its getting better we are ready for the launchvehiclesystems debriefing whenever you are
okay houston apollo 13 you were cut out again say again please
roger jim we are ready for the launchvehicle systems debriefing whenever you are over
okay stand by 1
okay houston 13 in answer to question l the changes in noise level occurred mainly between the first stage and the other stages  the other stages were about the same in noise level very quiet with the first stage of course making quite a bit of noise in the beginning but  which built up during the high q and then  went quiet just after high q
okay copy that jim
i might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all
roger and i assume comm was okay
thats affirm comm was very good all during  throughout the entire flight much better than i expected
okay
now in answer to question 2 there was of course a vibration transient in the second stage that  due to the number 5 engine going out  which occurred shortly before the engine went out and slightly after that then the sii stage was very smooth
okay jim i guess the significant point there is that you didnt notice the vibration before you saw the engine light
thats right we  we noticed the vibration but it wasnt such that we thought something cata strophic was going to happen it just started vibration and then the en light came on and then the vibration went away and the stage itself was smooth
okay copy that
yes and that  it was all pretty  pretty short in span  just a second or so before and like a second afterwards joe
oh roger
and on the sivb the vibration of the vehicle it self wasnt what  second  powered flight  a veryhighfrequency vibration
that was  was that during  just during tli or did you notice that at insertion
well it was a highfrequency viola  vibration but more noticeable during the tli burn than it was during the  flight
okay i  understand
i guess the sivb vibration during tli was there all the time although it seemed to  to grow to us as the burn progressed although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease
okay you called this about 312 minutes but i guess the thing was slowly building up throughout the whole burn right
thats right
okay was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that
no it  it was not uncomfortable at all but i was recalling the ride on 8 and the sivb was more  much more smooth than even it was on 13 
copy that
okay now in answer to number 3 we did not ex perience any unexpected transients except that all of us noticed the pu shift we thought it was more pronounced than we had expected it to be
okay understand
joe on that i guess most of every time that pu shift occurred we all  almost all of us glanced at the engine light we could feel definite acceleration change
roger understand jack
and during the highq portion of the flight the alfa meter to my knowledge nearly went above 25 percent
okay
in answer to number 4 we got a pretty good look at the thermal shroud and the iu after taking the lm away and from our viewpoint the shroud was completely intact i saw no loose particles or parts of it floating at all
okay jim understand
and i guess we answered number 5 i dont think at any time did we have any communication problem during powered flight
roger
in answer to number 6 the answer is essentially no we saw no venting or suspected leak on the lm or the csm 
okay jim i guess you described to us the non propulsive venting on the sivb after the aps maneuver and we copied that at the time
okay fred saw the sivb venting
yes we had already talked about that joe and that was also visible when it  of course when it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking at it right close up
roger
okay joe the last time we saw the sivb posi tively was when fred saw it venting at about  at about 5 hours we think we might have picked it up later on we saw a particle or something out there that was tumbling which might have been the booster or one of the sla panels
and when was that jim
were  were debating it was somewhere between  say 730 and 9 hours
okay
but joe assuming the sivb is still stable the object i was looking at was definitely tumbling
okay fred as i recall it was stable then although its tumbling now
okay it probably was the sla panel i picked up
right incidentally i guess the guys in build ing 6  
oh and i think we 
go ahead jim
i  i think we answer to number 9 we  at around 532 i think was when we think the number 5 light came on in the sii and a definite vibration which was more than just a highfrequency vibration we got with the normal siv burn and then the light came on i called eco thinking from the training that it was 742 and looked up at the time and realized it was early and then soon after the light came on the vibration stopped and the engine or the booster smoothed down it was very smooth from there on
okay this may be a stupid question but do you have any idea what the frequency of it was
only to say that it was much higher  i couldnt really guesslinow it was rather a rapid longi tudinal vibration
okay jim stand by now for a minute were going to switch omni
houston 13 
13 houston i read you we still have quite a bit of noise on the loop
ill stand by roger
okay jim it should be pretty good now we copied you answering question number 9
do you want any more comments on the sivb vibrations
i dont think so when you get all done ill  ill make a quick check to see if the booster people have any  any additional questions you skipped number 8 jim could you go back to that for a second
okay stand by
our only comment there joe was that the burn on tli to our knowledge was about 334 second longer than had been predicted and that was the only thing that we really noticed otherwise looked like pi  was nominal at cutoff
okay understand
okay on comparing the flight of 13 to apollo 8 liftoff was about the same amount of vibration as i noticed on 8 but at the beginning of the flight there was less of the sideways motion than we experienced on apollo 8 the sic separa tion felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8 maybe thats because i was in a different seat i dont know but there was about three sharp transients of the cutoff and a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally on our straps before the sii went off and the sii was of course just as smooth on 13 as 8 except for the number 5 engine and we did not experience the vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the sii burn and the sivb was  had more vibration than we had on 8
okay jim got all that
the up  the update on the ordeal ball was a good one at the burn we were about  just about 8 degrees we had to pitch down the yaw was right on all the way through the entire burn and just towards the end of the burn the ball started going black in pitch a little bit
okay sounds good well give mike wash a gold star on that one okay jim stand by 1 while i see if we have any extra questions
jim while were waiting to see if they have any more questions id like to read you the booster peoples preliminary analysis on the  the sii cutoff over
that would be very interesting go ahead
okay preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center sii engine vibrated at a some what higher amplitude than weve seen on previous flights and it started at about 160 seconds into the sii burn as a result of these vibrations the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two lowlevel thrust sensors the thrust okay sensors initiated center engine cutoff early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine and the cause of the in creased vibration amplitude is still under inves tigation over
i thought it was the center engine
yes right
joe do you have any word on what marks we had for tli
at the time of tli as i recall you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the bsigma iow burn and you were also go for a secondopportunity tli if we had re quired one
okay we were just wondering because it appeared to us that we had a longer tli burn than had been predicted o1 01 28 bo cc yes you did we confirmed that  that  that cutoff time just about as you saw it and i dont have an explanation for it but it was within the bsigma margin
13 houston
go ahead
roger we have no further questions all the answers were clear and satisfactory and we thank you very much you can press on with the rest of your busy day o o 30 02 cdr righto 01 229 08 lmp and houston 13
13 houston go ahead
okay joe out window 5 i just picked up the tumbling object again so for sure it must have been a sla panel i dont think we could still be in the proximity of the siv at this time
i dont think so fred its several hundred miles aft of you 700 miles is  is the number im told and since the sla panel didnt make the midcourse correction that might be it apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription psge 72
yes its i cant really tell for sure even through the nocular that it is but it looks the same relative position to the stars and the best i can tell about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us
can you see it tumbling does it have a shape or is it a point
no i can tell its tumbling i guess the flat side not only is facing me its not only much brighter it also grows larger
okay very interesting well see if we can figure out where thats relative to you they keep updating the siv impact on us a little bit the last guess we had was that it will impact about the sue longitude we gave you but close to zero latitude and a little bit later you still wont be able to see it and theyre say ing it might make a  
roger
  theyre saying it might make a 100 to 120 foot crater too
itll still be past the terminator for us for awhile
right it will be at about the rev 20 terminator so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities before you will be able to photograph it and fao is looking at whether we can work that in or not
okay
houston 13
lb houston 01 02 4b 33 cmp hey joe is fao ready to  do you  or are you ready to give me those items that we made optional and deleted in the solo book
jack we are not quite ready with that yet but we will be before too long can you wait awhile
sure can got lots of time o1 02 43 5 cc okay
hello houston apollo 13
13 houston go ahead
just a passing comment joe were having lunch right now and i just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days
thats correct lb as i recall the flight plan youre supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not catsup but i guess well overlook that
we blew it
right hows everything going
its going pretty good we have about four dif ferent methods of spreading catsup right now
okay jack well have your update to you before too long
okay fine joe we did a pit check on the hycon camera and everything works okay
okay beautiful we dont have anything else for you at the moment apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription
houston 13
13 houston go ahead
okay wed like to get the fm up now to look at some inside pictures there
okay stand by and ill get a go on this
13 houston
go ahead
thats acceptable fred and meanwhile when you guys are ready to copy weve got an mcc2 pad for you
okay stand by 1
roger that and also if you can go to p00 and accept conveniently wed like to uplink
okay youve got it
okay
okay joe you can go ahead with the p30 pad
okay here we go mcc2 spsgn 63634 plus 096 minus 023 030404900 minus 00217 minus 00017 minus 00080 080 164 326 na na 00232 0035  well give you half a second on the burn time because its so short  00185 44 1359 281 and the rest is na comments set stars 31 and 23 roll aline 288 pitch 205 yaw 034 no ullage lm weight 33499 and over

roger readback correct i have two more short comments on them but i want to wait just a second and make sure i understand them before i pass them to you 01 04 52 25 ij okay
okay fred houston
go ahead
the two additional comments were just that first of all they biased deltav c by minus 034 feet per second based on your ems null bias cheeks thats just for information and the second one also for information is that your targeted pericynthion is 60 miles after this correction
okay understand for jacks information the ems deltav bias is 34 and our targeted pericynthion after this meueuver is 60 miles
thats correct on the pericynthion the ems bias is 034 very small
okay 034 on the ems deltav bias
roger and  
hey joe well give  
go ahead jack  
well give you  well give you the read  well give you the results of another null bias test for comparative purposes right before the  oh at the proper time
okay real fine and the computer is yours
okay thank you going block
okay houston 13 are you copying the torquing angles on the p527
okay jack give us a second
and 13 houston we have them you can torque them
okay joe time of torquing 29 hours 0 minute 30 seconds
roger that 0i 05 29 35 cc apollo 13 houston
go ahead joe
hey youve got a new oapcom on now with the black crew and we have about three items to give you jack
okay stand by 1 are these updates or what
im going to give you some high gain antenna angles for tv and the rest is just information general words
go ahead 
okay burn attitude for tv your pitch and yaw angles are as follows pitch minus i  minus 69 yaw 180 high gain
okay
okay second point is that youre go for mcc2 everythings looking good here
okay real fine
and the last items for jack jack the pre liminary indications are that you can get a 60day extension on your  filing your income tax if youre out of the country
thats good news i guess i qualify
yes we were just looking at the map and youre south of florida so youre not in the country now but we wondered how about your car tags have you taken care of those
yes i did as a matter of fact i think i did
known as plan ahead
okay good
and apollo 13 houston recommend omni alfa until you get to the burn attitude
okay omni alfa apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay houston apollo 13
13 go ahead
okay vance the ems deltav pass passive the results of the nobias pass in 100 seconds have been from 100 to 1015
roger copy plus 100 to plus 1015 and that agrees fairly closely with the last one as i recall
okay fine
okay houston were at p40 burn attitude jim is on the sextant star check and we do have a star in the sextant
roger jack copy very good
but we oouldt tell you whether its 44 or not
whoops
okay houston 13 were a little bit ahead of ourselves do we have a go to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump
jack thats affirm you have a go for those
okay were on our way
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
jim battery a is charged now whenever you want to unhook it will be fine with us
okay
houston 13 are you still planning to have tv at the scheduled time
okay 13 houston thats affirm at the flight planscheduled time
okay all right weve got a beautiful sight we want to show you
right
13 houston you can go ahead with the tv now were standing by
okay here it comes
okay
okay jack its coming in and its right in the center of our screen
okay vance
can you  think you could guess what that might be vance better than charlie
i dont want to start flipping coins at this point
okay vance were pointed just a little ways off from looking directly at the moon jim is holding the camera through window 3 the sun is coming at about 40 degrees off our left side and what we are going to show you in just a minute is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just show you just what it looks like its really fantastic
okay wed like to see that
okay we saw some droplets speeding out for a little while jack now we dont see anything
actually vance what youre looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time it lights up the whole sky around the moon its just far too fine for you to see now i think theyre coming out a little thicker
okay yes we see those
jacks complaining about seeing stars
fido says he can understand why that would perturbate a trajectory now
its amazing watching these little frozen droplets maneuver they seem to go in all directions but finally after they get out a certain ways settle down and they all seem to be traveling in the same direction 0 06 16 42 cc right thats coming in real well
the objects in the foreground are parts of the lm that youre looking at
the camera is now going to 
we can just barely see those parts of the lm they must be in a shadow
okay now you are looking at a thruster quad at the lower part of your screen
ive got the fstop all the way open now vance thats quad  quad i youre looking at with the lm should  the moon should be in view just over the top of the quad
right we see the nozzle of the quad but its dark and its not easy to see
13 houston inco suggests you try average if youre in peak to see if that gives us a better picture
okay were in average now
i think that helps out we can see it better
okay now 13 request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to peak over
okay vance i cranked the focus down a little bit is the quad coming in any better now
its coming in about the same fred and youre a little weak now on the comm
we could see when you went back to peak
and im now  all the way out
okay we could see you zoom in on the moon and its near the center of our screen just a little to the left very clear
yes i show it just about at 38
we cant tell if its gray or light brown though
do you have your grid down there vance
thats negative fred
okay
i dont know if you can make out the features there vance on the moon but it looks like the terminators are at central plains area somewhere around descartes maybe 01 06 22 h5 cc okay were we see it just as a bright portion of the lunar disk and it looks a lot like you see it from earth very bright we are unable to see any features at all
its pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here and it looks a little bigger now but the only way i could see it very good at all was with the monocular a little while ago
okay fred very good wed be interested to seeing the cabin when you get ready for that too 01 06 23 39  okay ill set up now
and vance were counting down to midcourse2 were up to in our checklist to minus 6 minutes to go
roger minus 6 minutes understand youre about ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that sort of thing okay we see the computer now in the upper middle part of the  the panel i think we see somebodys checklist in the center couch it must be jim holding the checklist 01 06 2 39 lmp right and what jims holding now hes got a pen in his hand weve rigged on a string as sort of a simpleminded accelerometer this burns pretty short and im not sure even thats going to show very much but well see if itll stretch out at the end of its string
yes we see the pencil at the top of the picture floating around and jacks coming into view now
and ive gone back  okay ive gone back to average now and  pitch up
roger
now in a few minutes vance i guess well see how about the only system we havent used yet works everything else sure has worked mighty fine
right the spacecrafts really working nicely okay were picking up panel 2 now still a little bit of the checklist
wondering if you can pick up the caution array there
right we just saw your  your testing of the caution and warning system at the lefthand side of the panel on our tv see the lights all flash on youre doing it again
you mission timers showing up as a  a brilliant green in the upper lefthand part of the picture g1 06 30 12 lmp roger i got the camera kind of canted on you here vance
vance jims going to go to vox now
vance how do you  
roger read you loud and clear jim
okay well  what well do  well be on vox for the remainder of the burn and preburn count down 01 06 30 38 sc
 and what were waiting for is 5 minutes on our counter or 20 which would be minus  
jim we hear clipping on your vox could you adjust it so that youre coming in continuously all the time
okay stand by 1
l 2 3 4 5 hows that vance
okay thats better
vance how do you read the cmp on vox
jack read you loud and clear
okay fine
we show minus 812 minutes
roger houston copies 01 06 32 h sc close 
is that too close vance or can you make out the sps engine panel now
we can see your fuel and oxidizer gages and hydrogenoxygen gages at the top of the picture and the pugs but it isnt coming in in focus too well its a little dim
yes i think the problem is im about 2 feet and it doesnt go down but to 4
right we understand thats the panel right in front of your face
okay vance stand by for the main 
okay were minus 7 minutes
roger
fred the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big sps engine

okay houston copied your residuals very iow
okay fuel is 10 oxidizer 025 the ox un balance is reading on the decrease which doesnt mean very much and i guess that wasnt too much for a push there vance i didnt see the accel erometer do a whole lot and it was a little sur prising how slowly the injector valves opened at least on the indicators
roger that was a very short burn request you give us a sweep across the panel when you get a chance fred let us see jack and jim again over
okay
okay vance i was going to show you on  wonder if the folks might  down there might be inter ested in how we find out how far were away from the moon going to do that right now in pro gram 21 here
okay
im asking the computer how far away we are and the computer is telling me were 121 490 miles out
okay that agrees fairly closely with our map on the wall
im glad that means youre tracking us too
and if you didnt see our residuals it was 01 x 02 on y and 01 z and deltav c was minus 38
jack houston we show you down here 121 thou sand miles 520 out so i guess we all agree
okay real good vance what im going to do is give you a shot of fred
if we can get all the wiring out of the way
the big problem here is when you move the tv around this wire follows you like a snake here
yes we have fred now looks like he has a lariat there getting ready to rope the checklist
thats only half of it we have most of it hidden away its been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the tv here hopefully for when we get on the ground at fra mauro the monitor does make it pretty easy though
right thats a real advantage in the cockpit youre just a little bit dark it looks like it might help to have the fstop run down about one increment see how it comes out  
cant do it were wide open
are you
i think were wide open  
yes were wide open vance
okay does that help any vance
okay its reasonablly good we can make out fred fairly well looks like hes in a shadow hey that helps you just turned up the lights huh
yes we went fixed on the  
okay youre on candid camera
we did notice one thing vance you know that new fad with long hair it wont work too well up here in space
what was that one again
i say you know the new  the new fad with long hair
right
it doesnt work too well up in space you cant comb your hair up here
well i guess you have to give up something
well at least it  it helps to try we can see you trying to comb your hair there jim it looks like your  your beards havent come along to the point where youve had to use the razor though
well weve been debating that we thought wed take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines
i take it that was a subtle hint vance
no no were not commenting on your appearance fred i mean nothing derogatory understand
nd vance thought wed get a picture of jack just so that all the girls know that hes still here
laughter
yes we  we appreciate that there he is big jack
jack youre in the shadow right now we have a little bit of interference from your window which is very bright so we cant  i think youre smiling but its a little hard to tell
 fae 90 01 06 47 1 cc hey there we go incidentally weve been getting ali kinds of tits of information to pass up to you weve had baseball scores coming in basketball somebody said theres 220 days shopping days left until christmas o1 06 47 46 cml yes who won the masters vance
it was a tie in the masters and stand by it was a tie between littler and casper after 72 holes and there is going to be a playoff monday we understand
oh sounds good
one thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back we  we heard you go through the checklist but i guess right now basically you probably have all the switches back in position and youre in the mode to con tinue on with  okay what does the flight plans say youre going to be doing cislunar naviga tion so jack youre going to be down in the leb is that correct
thats right vance be going down there shortly
okay the tv now is all but black looks like it must be pointing into a shadow
what hes doing hes trying to give you one more shot of the moon and right now im setting to maneuver pad and the optics calibration attitude
roger
and what i wanted to point out i dont know if its apparent but  to show the advantage of doing all the dumps just before the burn were looking again at the same scene over quad i at the moon and now you dont see all the sparkly frozen particles outside there any more weve sort of run off and left them
roger we  we dont see anything out there any more in the way of particles leaving the space craft wed suggest maybe you zoom the moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better
okay that brings the moon in we can see the terminator at the top ofthe melonshaped disk
okay now you can see a few of the spark  sparkling particles going across the screen those are being emitted from the thrusters jacks maneuvering the spacecraft now
okay we can see those very poorly well actually they are coming in better now it looks like little specks going from the upper left part of the screen across to the right and understand those are from the thrusters
thats affirm
okay 13 houston just as an item of interest advise your speed with respect to the earth is now 4667 feet per second
okay thanks vance
okay apollo 13 houston the moon has been in and out of the  the  our screen here right now its off at the bottom side but we can still see the particles coming off of the spacecraft
okay i am going to have to pull it out the window now vance the suns coming up on the right side
roger understand you  
do you want to see any shots down in the leb vance o1 06 55 b1 cc say again
do you want to see any of the photographs or do you want the tv down in the leb
thats right jim it would be good to see what you are doing down in the leb or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sighting
okay vance first we are going to give you a shot of the sleep station
okay the cameras bounced around a little but we can see the green computer come in every once in a while
while jack is getting the sleep station rolled up i thought i would show you one interesting corner weve got a temporary stowage bag here and thats where all our wastepaper and all that goes while were  after every meal its in the righthand corner down by our dump system
roger understand were looking at the wastebasket
and the ageold question that is always asked us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that you see i think you can see it now it goes right outside where we open up the over board drain dump and all of our waste products liquid waste products go out through that line and get dumped overboard
roger understand and we can see somebodys foot as well
okay fred is now going down there and he is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side where we have a sleep restraint and the whole object of that is to  to position the body between the  between the bottom of the spacecraft and  so it doesnt float up between that and the bottom of the couch
roger the sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch its the white object
you perhaps can see the zipper of the hmock right now its the black lines in that white object
right we can see it
these hammocks by the way are very comfortable when we first heard about them in the design of apollo we thought they werent necessary but they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep in
im trying now to get down there with fred to show you how it works i keep floating up though but maybe we can get a little shot here
okay we have somebody upside dow in the photograph now realizing of course in  in space there is no really rightside up or upside down it still looks that way to us
okay thats  thats fred now im trying to put him rightside up for you folks back there in the sleep station fred would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you
okay thats coming in real clear jim we see fred in the sleep restaint  restraint
as a matter of fact vance i find my  i find fred down there all the time g1 07 o0 44 cc yes i can see he appreciates that looks fairly comfortable
looks like there is a lot of room down there considering all the boxes on the floor and under neath the couch
its surprising there still is quite a bit of room down there even with the hycon camera box down and now im going to bring the camera back up
okay vance if there is no more that you would lke to see right now well terminate our little tv for you today
okay thank you very much jim appreciated seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look at the moon that youre rapidly approaching
roger this is odyssey saying goodby
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
okay at your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied its information on how to photograph comet bennett at time 32 hours get over
okay stand by i minute
okay
okay vance go ahead
okay time 32 hours 00 minutes get instructions at completion of p23 maneuver to following atti tude roll 010 pitch 0900 yaw 0000 high gain antenna angles will be pitch minus 23 yaw 93 use normal ptc procedures to dampen rates after vehicles stable and before spinup take photographs of comet bennett use the dac on the sextant with magazine g that is very highspeed blackandwhite film right thats the dimlight film take three photos one each at 5 20 and 60seconds time exposure use auto optics noun 88 values are r1 plus 34717 r2 minus 08028 r3 plus 35075 take three photos one each at 5 20 and 60second time exposure using manual optics shaft will be 0008 degrees trunnion 125 degrees comment strip off about 50 frames that is 2 seconds of  at 24 feet per second be fore the first frame and after the last frame of the photos that is 2 second  2 seconds at 24 frames per second  before the first frame and after the last frame of photos
is that it vance
and thats all
okay the time is  the event will be at 3200 and were to maneuver to the following attitude roll 1010 pitch 0900 yaw all zips high gain angles will be pitch minus 23 yaw 93 and were to use normal ptc procedures to damp the rates and after damping the rates and before spinup were to put the dac on the sextant with the magazine g very highspeed black and white film then were to take three photos one each at 5 20 and 60seconds time exposure using audio  auto optics our noun 88 values ri plus 34717 r2 minus 08028 r3 plus 35075 thence three more photos one each at 5 20 60seconds time exposure using manual optics shaft 08 de grees trunnion 125 degrees and were to take 2  second bursts at 24 frames per second before and after these pictures
your readback is correct fred end 0f tape apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcrifion
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
jim for ptc tonight request that you disable quads c and d thats the opposite of last night over
okay for ptc tonight disable quads c and d
roger and advise in approximately an hour well have some readups whenever youre ready to take them regarding solo book changes
okay well be standing by for it
roger
houston 13
go ahead 13
have you all got a chance to look at the data on the sps yet
stand by 1 fred
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
fred it looks good but they havent had a chance to evaluate everything theyll probably be finished with looking at strip charts in about 15 minutes and after that well try to get back with you
okay thank you
roger
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
on the p33 just like to verify that you changed the noun 88 values for this last star it looks like they havent been changed over
okay vance
thats better lets read you what we  what we have we have what they had in the flight plan and if its been changed from the flight plan we dont have it
stand by 1
we think youre right vance it looks like they used the same set of noun 88 for both stars by mistake
okay very good o1 07 4404 cmp okay vance that ought to complete the p23s right
okay very good jack
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
we have some results on your  your first star if youd like to hear them the rest of the stars well  well have to give you in a couple of hours over
go ahead
okay the first star the corrected altitude 15 kilometers plus or minus 4 effective altitude 12 kilometers plus or minus 7 as far as the substellar point the value is arcminutes  2 arcminutes and thats very good and like i said well get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
go ahead
okay we have several items here first is a reminder on the ptc that ri should be 375  0375 degrees as last night to get 03degree rotation rate the second one  
okay copy that
okay the second one at 32 hours looking at bennetts comet  we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as its going to be before starting ptc the stability requirement is very high we werent sure if you understood that from what we passed up in addition the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet why sketching it is in order and is encouraged over
okay vance what well do is when we get to attitude well disable the quads and do like we did last night well let guido and you people down there tell us when you think we are stable enough then well do all this work with the dac on the sextant first and then when we get that done well go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually
okay that sounds good also while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually okay next item your sps burn had no anomalies whatsoever it was a very good burn
okay very good
next item request hydrogen tank i heater off for balancing purposes
and apollo 13 another item something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight tce fluctuation on fuel cell 3 this fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37second period it has been seen on other flights in the past no one is worried about it but the usual fluctuation is about ll2 degrees instead of 7 seconds so i thought you should be aware of it
okay vance and one other slight distinction weve noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either
okay we copy and the last item wed like to send you an irig update so at your convenience request po0 and accept
okay we are in po0 and accept vance
okay
quad c and d are disabled vance
roger disabled and down here we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched so we suspect its purely a spacecraft readout problem
okay
okay vance let us know when youre through with the dsky so we can load noun 88
roger well let you know jack
apollo lb houston the computers yours again
okay youre go for the pictures
okay vance we tried our auto optics and couldnt pick it up there were pointing pretty much right into the sun and things are pretty well washed out and ive gone to manual optics and im trying to get 08 125 on the shaft and trunnion and i still cant pick it up so  its very light in the sextant so i kind of think maybe were too near the sun to see it
thats right vance the sextant is all  its  its all milky and it  any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background
okay we copy that we got some discussion stand by
okay vance it isnt  were not looking into the sun  what we are getting is a large reflection from the sun behind us off the lm and it is  it is coming on that quad i there and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant
okay jack understand just a question if you look through the telescope can you see the comet at all over
no i cant vance its  its still too light tape 25
stand by
say vance
roger go ahead
are the flowers blooming yet
gee i sure havent seen any
okay
hey weve  weve got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet and this reflection is not unexpected and give us another minute and well be back with you on something on that
okay i doubt very seriously though if we take any photographs with highspeed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that youre going to get anything out of it
okay unanimous opinion is that youre right and well scratch all of this bennett comet stuff on the way out with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after tei over
sounds good without the lm we may have a better chance
roger
and apollo 13 youre go for ptc tour rates are very low according to what we can read
roger vance
okay are you going to give a call on omni b vance
do you read vance
roger go ahead request 0mni b fred and secure the highgain antenna
okay you got it
okay
apollo 13 houston tape 26
go ahead houston
just something to think about in about 30 minutes we can generate the pads that we have yet to send up before the sleep period so we could sup port an earlier sleep period if you so desired and  but it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff the other thing is any time youre ready to copy i can read up the solo book changes over  and also two pages in the flight plan
okay vance were about ready to copy the solo book changes and the flight plan changes and whenever your pads are ready well take those and as far as moving up the sleep period thats fine but well  if we dont go to sleep right away well use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them
okay and well get busy getting those pads for you as soon as possible then and ill stand by on the copying bit
okay vance im ready to copy the solo book changes there apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay first turn to page 12 on the righthand side of the page starting from the middle of the page down everything under cycle 5 frames replace dark side or dark slide should be deleted until you get to the very bottom of the page where you have acquisition msfn omni d and that should remain in also leave in remove window shades  which is about the third line down from where you start
okay okay then from cycle 5 frames replace dark slide from there on down delete
thats everything from there on down with the exception of remove window shades and at the bottom acquisition msfn 0mni d
okay copy
and that includes in the margin to the left the dap load thats at the ery start there and the 00507 and plus 0500 farther down
okay got it
okay going to page 13
okay
okay in the left margin just below 105 hours get cross out the 0507 and the plus 0500 and below that add in dap load as follows 10111 and lllll
okay got it
okay now next at about 10505 theres a verb 48 that should be moved up to 105 and below that the verb 49 maneuver should be moved up too
okay that verb 48 should be moved up to 10505 and also the verb 49
that should be moved up to 10500 im sorry both
okay
and what that does is give you more time to maneuver
okay next
all right
page 14 righthand side near the bottom under orbital science scratch out verify dse on and also delete visual target 3 on track 180 plus 19 and cross out the pennedin d5
okay got it
next page 15 lefthand column or lefthand side rather near the bottom where it says configure cameras and tape and goes down through replace dark slide just make the comment there solar corona is optional over
okay got it
okay next page 16 this is a continuation of the same solarcorona thing on the righthand side of the page starting just above 10740 with verb 49 maneuver to solarcorona attitude from there on down to 10755 just beneath replace dark slide all of this is in an optional cate gory so you just might line off  
all right got it
  that and put optional solar corona okay next page 17  
okay
  starting at 10800 on the lefthand side line out stop orb rate at orb science attitude at  line out in the lefthand collumn the dap load of 10101 and lllll going down to 108lo add in the following stop orb rate at track attitude and in parentheses 0 353 0 in the lefthand

okay
okay looking to the right the lm attitude or rather the csm attitude will be incorrect so you can cross that off and beneath the picture of the moon cross out the  in parentheses 10819 and the 0 230018 0
all right
on the righthand half of the page cross out the orbital science block and under that visual target i south of track tr and under that the pennedin d234
all right got it
and beneath that cross out verb 49 maneuver to track attitude by the c 0 353 0 and the hu scf
all right
okay the information beneath that starting with configure camera earthshine photos down through replace dark slides is optional so just put in earthshine optional as a comment there and in the camera settings in the block that has f28 125 infinity cross out the 125 and put in oneeighth i slash 8 in other words
okay that last part was cross out the 125 and put in 18 is that right
thats affirm okay next page no change go to page 19 ape224
okay
okay on the righthand side from the verb 49 maneuver to earthshine attitude down through everything up to msfn uplink this is optional this is earthshine optional
all right got it
and once again a camerasetting correction up near the top of that section that we called optional where you have bracket mir f09 125  cross out the 125 and put in l slash 60 in other words onesixtieth over
okay cross out the 125 and put in 1 slash 60
thats correct and further down at 10950 where you have visual target 17 et cetera cross out that line and cross out the pennedin d17
okay
now move to page 25
okay go ahead vance
okay at about ll410 everything under altitude set equals 60 miles should have the comment solar corona optional and on that first line of that optional where it says verb 49 maneuver to solar corona and limb brightening attitude cross out and limb brightening attitude
okay
going further down to 11416 cross out the 14 dac 18 vhbw limb brightening line and the line under that which is brkt mir et cetera
all right
in the block where it says solar corona and limb brightening photos cross out and limb brighten ing photos and just put solar corona optional
okay got it
going a few lines below that where you see dac on for 4 seconds at about 50 frame rate cover lens cross that out
hey vance we lost you there or did you 
yes i think we lost lock well stand by a minute
okay i got you back
okay going on down cross out 1142916 dac on sr dash 40 seconds
okay

okay
on the righthand side of page 25 where you have the title solar corona and limb brighten ing photography cross out limb brightening photography
okay
and in the figure where you have the dac los line which is parallel to the xaxis on the horizon cross out dac los parallel to xaxis on horizon
all right
and cross out the bottom block on that half of the page which is dac magazine percent required 12 magazines g et cetera

and next page 35 on the righthand side everything from spacecraft control cmc auto verify on down should be given the comment zodiacal light photos optional
all right
and well where you have the block in the middle of the page that says  the small block that says zodiacal light photos just put optional in that title too
okay
and next page 36 on the lefthand side
okay go ahead
okay first a comment in the middle of the page is where the zodiacal light stuff ends just under verb 48 and then if youll go down to the bottom of the page cross out the line photo target 12 on track et cetera and cross out the e5 that is below that line
okay vance can i break in a minute
sure
we have the cry0 pressure light on now le it2 has hit its lower bound so do you want us to go back to auto on the h2 heater 17
stand by
13 houston
all right go ahead
they request that you leave that switch in the auto position until you go to bed tonight stand by i mean in the on position ill repeat that again in the off position until you go to bed tonight for reasons that you have a 3percent imbalance and theyd like to get that more even so just before turning in well change the switch to auto
okay
okay vance continue
okay  
before we get away would you ask fao  something i didnt get briefed on  what tee pennedin e5 and those letters and numbers mean
okay just 1 minute
okay well have comments on that for you in just a second
okay
apollo 13 houston
okay vance im ready to continue im ready go ahead
okay new subject like to break in to say that request you reinitialize the ptt  ptc for some reason its gone up to 18 degrees in pitch and yaw both we dont quite understand this all we can think of is  start it again over
okay well go back tapo 220
okay we are at the  the end of the changes in the solo book and i have two pages of changes in the flight plan those are pages 3122 and 3125 while youre looking that up well put ken on to answer your question
okay ill start back  let me start back reinitializing ptc here
okay
okay vance im on 3122 of the flight plan
okay okay about  at time 15650 on the right  well on the righthand half of the page theres a line which states visual target 16 south 180 plus lll gassendi fls request you cross out that line
okay well cross them out
thats all on 3122 next change is 3125
okay im looking at 125
okay starting from the top of the page cross out the first five lines which are set up camera for contamination and photography betelgeuse cm4el80 et cetera mag t et cetera install window shades
ive got them crossed
okay then jump down to just about 15928 cross out maneuver to contamination field photography attitude and all other lines below that through enable thrusters a3 c4 b3 et cetera
okay so we start with maneuver to contamina tion field photography and we cross out every thing down to and including enable thrusters a3 c4 b3 and d4
thats correct and those are all of the flight changes  flight plan changes we have and ken is coming on now and later sometime when we get ptc squared away and its convenient i suppose you should read all these things back to make sure that wetre squared away on them
okay go ahead tk
yes sir understand you have a question
yes i guess i didnt understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets
okay  
does that refer to the pages
yes sir thats the map each fold is lettered in the lower  or upper righthand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled d e and f and the solo stuff will all be the d and e and they change with the plane change 1 thats the time they change the two maps
okay i got it thank you
yes sir youre doing good work hey
well i had a good prime crewman that taught me all i know
dont run out
hey when fido gets a good hack on our trajectory will you let us know
how long you willing to wait
hes looking at his calendar if that means any thing
laughter all right
okay im back at the attitude here and ill wait for rates to damps and you let me know when were stable again
okay will do
13 houston
go ahead vance
roger just a reminder you have to disable charlie and delta here as youve done in the past over
okay i was kind of holding off on this were dumping a little waste water now
okay fido says he knew it all along hes  he says hes been very concerned that youve been doing a lot of water dumping
okay vance weve got quad c and b disabled
okay copy jack
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
it may be awhile before your rates are settled down were still observing fairly high rates and deadbanding over
okay thank you 01 o9 44 54 music
apollo 13 houston
go ahead vance
okay weve got about three items first one is all of your p23 batch  two marks have been evaluated and  hey congratulations looks real good theyre very happy with it youre down to 4 arcminutes on the substellarpoint aspect of it and thats the first thing to mention the second is unless you see a need i dont see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth do you concur
roger i think i got it i remembered a lot of it and so i think with what you gave me and what i remember im pretty sure we got it right
okay and the third item i was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the ptc but it looks like theyre jiggling around again from a dump so well stand by some more
okay 01 09 52 23 imp no secrets around here
say again hey thats right 01 09 52 33 imp i said theres no secrets around here
yes big brother is watching
lb  
i can just see eecom telling fido
yes you really have to watch that pair all right by the way we have a maneuver pad for you a flyby pad whenever youre ready to copy
okay stand by
go ahead vance
okay maneuver pad purpose flyby spsgn 63385 plus 097 minus 023 072243308 plus 02127 minus 01417 minus 02548 148 316 050 na plus 00225 03609 053 03563 33 3527 150 na na na starting with latitude minus 2326 minus 16500 11477 36172 1665402 comments gdc aline stars are 31 arcturus and 23 denebola r aline 288 pitch aline 205 yaw aline 034 ullage none other burn is sps docked lm weight 33499 over

roger thats correct want to verify under noun 81 that deltav x is plus 02127 you cut out right there
roger deltav x is 02127 ape22 l3 age113
roger and your ratea are low looks like you can start the ptc
okay in work
okay and when the computer is available request po0 and accept and well ship you your state vector
wait until i get ptc going first vance then wetll give it to you
okay
okay vance were po0 and accept the computer s yours
roger here it comes
you know somehow everytime i do a set of p23s you guys uplink me a state vector i dont think i do too well
no  
i could get a complex
no you know  you know how the fidos are they like to load in their own data no matter what
but our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps
yes thats 
apollo 13 houston its your computer again
okay going to block
and as a matter of interest understand that the downrange comparison between the mcc and the computer is within 35000 feet and thats on the last sighting which people think is pretty good
okay maybe that gives us a little more confi dence that if we had to do p23s on the way home wed make it
no doubt about it apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
just info on your ptc jim its looking very good just  excursions in pitch and yaw are very low
okay thank you and were going to change another lithium hydroxide canister now
okay
and vance has fido come up with any obser vations on the trajectory
well a minute ago he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth and he hadnt seen any waste water dumps or anything and hes pretty happy
okay i just wondered if were going to need any more mideourse
he says seriously its looking probably like you wont have any more g1 l0 59 45 cmp hey thats real fine
fidos never guarantee anything however
yes thats right
houston 13 i have the onboard readout if youre ready to copy
roger go ahead
okay bat c 37 pyro bat a 37 pyro bat b 37 rcs a 97 percent b 97 percent c 96 percent d 97 percent
roger we copy that thank you
apollo 13 houston
go ahead vance 01 1i 27 07 cc jim just an item for you md fred to be thinking about in case you havent been briefed on this something thats now being talked about a little bit these conservative people would like to have you read the she tank pressure when you go into the lm for the lm familiarization at 58 hours if theres no midcourse3 and it looks like theres a good chance that there will not be why they might want to move the lm familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours over
okay if we dont have a midcourse3 then well probably move lm fam up to 55 hours in which case well go in there and read she tank pressure
roger along with the other fam stuff and its not certain that we want to do this its just being talked about so this is just the informa tion for you
okay this is beginning to sound like the sim that we ran not too long ago
i dont think it will be a very big deal
okay houston 13
this is houston go ahead
okay vance our lmcm deltap is 09
roger 09
roger apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
apollo 13 houston
go ahead vance
are you guys hacking into your presleep checklist yet 
oh we just finished eating and cleaning up a bit afterwards jims going around collecting debris off of all the inlet hoses and i guess you might say were kind of thinking about getting ready to go to sleep
well i hope you had a good meal
it wasnt too bad
music
sounds like you guys are really living it up up there all that music food i didnt say drink
yes it is pretty nice not bad at all youre right you didnt say it this ptc were in is a pretty  pretty nice merrygoround vance every l0 minutes alternately i get to look at the earth and the moon
you couldnt ask for anything more than that just so it isnt so fast you  
no its a lot  a lot better i remember from 8 when they didnt hardly ever get to look at either one
thats right they were tumbling about another axis werent they
yes
its pretty cloudy down there tonight about the only land i can see again is a portion of australia and korea and looks like a part of china just about clouds covering everything else
can you still see that clearly with the naked eye or do you have to look through a glass
i can see australia with the naked eye and the china landmass but i  it took the monocular to pull out the korean peninsula
how about the moon is it looking very big yet 01 12 45 21  no not really bigger but weve got a ways to go
i understand that theyre estimating your pericynthion  lunar pericynthion is now 62 miles
well thats not bad
thats supposed to be just right
yes
okay houston 13
go ahead jack
okay were into the presleep checklist now as far as the crew status report as far as medication goes weve had no medication and were all feeling really good ive given you the onboard readouts jim is chlorinating the potable water now im ready for an ememory dump whenever youre ready
stand by 1 on the ememory dump jack i think well be ready in about a minute
okay
and eecomm says that as soon as you stir your cryos request you go back to auto on that one tank
okay well do that
hello 13 houston were ready to take your ememory dump 01 12 48 21 cml okay coming down
apollo 13 houston were you trying to call
go ahead houston
houston 13
apollo 13 houston we thought you were trying to call were you
i dont believe so unless we inadvertently hit the microphone button
must have been some other guy trying to call jack
just trying to get some words in eh jack
roger we saw the downvoice subperiod come on we thought maybe you were trying to call sorry i hope we havent disturbed you and from where i sit it looks like youre running a rest home up there good night
were all going to bed now just after we play the last rendition of with our eyes on the stars
music
okay jim and wed like you to check your sband normal voice switch off
sband norm3kl off
houston 13 well he off comm so if you need us send a crew alert please
okay jim if we need you well send a crew alert and wed like to know whos got the duty tonight on the biomed is that you
yes ill he on the biomed
okay we copy and youre spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything
just want to keep you busy jack
youre waking me up apollo 13 aiitoioundvoice tansciiiiion tapes 25291 rest period  no communications apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcrition
houston houston apollo 13 over
good morning 13 youre early
ah so i just thought id be waking up and we are awake and getting the spacecraft shipshape eee
roger spacecraft is in real good shape as far as were concerned jim were bored to tears down here we do have a few little items for you like a p37 update and a couple of flight plan updates but theres no rush about them over
okay gig us again in a few minutes were breaking out some food and well copy them then
okay and the surgeon will be ready for your sleep report whenever you get that together
righto if hes listening lmp had a solid 9 hours of sleep i couldnt wake him up this morning the cmp had 6 hours and the commander about 5 intermittent
okay  
jacks dosimeter  jacks dosimeter is reading 02026
okay we got it
it might be interesting that just after we went to sleep last night we had a master alarm and it really scared us and we were all over the cockpit like a wet noodle
laughter sorry it wasnt something more signif icant ive also got a procedure for you on that h2 tank simple thing after you get done stirring up the cryos
okay
music  with their eyes on the stars
that was beautiful what was it
a little of with their eyes on the stars to wake up to g1 22 47 24 cc sounds like all the comforts of home have you guys got a flower on your breakfast table
yes jack apoilo 13 ajitofjhouip vol cltranjfjiion tape hi 1 o 23 2 10 dr iloust on apollo 13 over o1  jl13 c i  ihmt cm h ahad
3 this is houston go ol 3 o cdr roger 0oe wore standing by for that p37 block data iiyou have it for us
okay got it right here jim and it follows this is the p37 pad for liftoff plus 60 the reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mpl at 119 hours its the same one we passed you yesterday and its the same weather but we still dont expect a problem at the end of the mission geti is 06000 deltav t 6079 longitude minus 153 get 400k 11804 over
geti of 06000 6079 minus 153 11804
roger thats correct ive got a consumables update for you jim if youre ready for that
ready to copy
okay as of 47 hours rcs total 1096 quad alfa 270 bravo 278 charie 270 delta 278 and the h2   they gave me the h2s in percent 76 per cent and on the 02 we have 81 percent however we show the 02 tank 2 reading offscale high now were quite sure its a sensor failture wed like you to verify it with your onboard reading
okay stand by
joe we confirm our gage reading is  on the number 2 02 tank is reading offscale high now but jack just tells me that it was okay when we first looked at it this morning
we verify that at 46115we had 82 percent and · apparently when he stirred the the cryos the sensor broke
okay
so its no problem youre above nominal on all your consumables on the h2 tank problem we have a procedure that wed like you to carry out which is simply turning the h2 tank 2 heaters to off at this time s and we want to see whether that wont solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning we want te look at it that way for a few hours
okay you want both h2 tank 2 heaters to off is that correct
thats negative just tank 2 we want tank  to stay in auto
okay tank 2 heaters off at this time
okay good deal thats been the high tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to close to start the heater cycle the tank i pressure has been dropping even a little bit lower and just setting off caution and warning so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle we wont get into the cation and warning range
roger
oke jim at your convenience wed like po0 and accept were ready for  to uplnk your state vector now since we will not do midcourse 3 over
roger youre in po0 and accept no midcourse 3 and were all set for a state vector update and im giving you the lmcm deltap here shortly
okay good deal and i have flight plan updates for you later at your convenience
houston apollo 13 the lmcm deltap is 10 psi
copy 10 jim
houston apollo 13 im about ready for any flight plan updates that you have
okay 13 to start off with got a minor pro cedural change for jack on his next p52 if hes ready to listen to th age 124 o1 2 h4 5 cdr okay jacks still off comm well hold off on thd ct iittle bit and thou well pick it up when 1 gcts on comm
okay 1nc ive got two updates foryou im one is a procedure for looking for comet bennett at about 4945 and ill wait till jack gets up before passing you the details on that the other update is concerned with going into the lm 3 hours early and i think vance mentioned to you last night that this was a possibility that wed like to look at the she tank pressure early and since were not going to do midcourse 3 wed like lm entry at 55 hours is that okay with you
okay right thats fine with us well move up lm entry to 55 hours
okay ive got some details on the flight plan for you as follows of course since theres no mcc3 youll be deleting all the midcourse 3 stuff including the  the p52 which is called out at about 5412 and well be slipping that until later which ill  which ill tell  which ill tell  which ill tell you in a minute okay then you  we want to move the battery charge up 3 hours to about 5230 and we want to move the  moving the lm tunnel vent valve to lmcm deltap up b hours to 5245 and at that point you can simply go to the 57hour point in the flight plan and change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that in the remarks section at about 5750 it says 0 fuel cell purge and waste water dnp here 2 if not performed earlier we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes the tv pass then will be at 55 hours to 5530 youll go right through the lm activation checklist stuff im losing you lets wait a minute
13 houston how do you read me
13 houston you back with us
apollo 13 houston are you back with us
were back with you
okay ive gone through the battery charge the lm vent valve the fuel cell purge and then stop ptc at 55 hours and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees which is per the flight plan the high gain antenna angles are slightly different pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees the tv pass till 5530 the standard lm acti vation except for some special steps well give you to take a look at she tank pressure which i dont have yet restart ptc at about 5630 or whenever youre through with the 4 activ ities and after that at your convenience wed like you to  to do the p52 option 3 that we cancelled at 5412 hours over
okay that last comment was that well do the p52 after we start ptc at about 5630
thats right any time after that its not time critical
okay lets see if i have some of this joe around 5230 were to do the battery charge on bat  battery b
thats correct
and then about 5240 were going to do the lm tunnel vent valve and the lmcm deltap which has been written up at 5540
thats correct
were deleting midcourse3 and weve moved up the lm entry to 55 hours so well merely follow all the  well follow all the procedures that leads up to lm entry that was originally scheduled for 58
thats correct you can start at 57 in the flight plan call it 54 hours and press right on 01 23 5 48 cdr okay then whenever were finished with the lm which we anticipate around 5630 well commence ptc and sometime after that well do a p52
thats affirmative and did you copy the new high gain angles for 55 hours the ones we had  
okay were going to stop the ptc for lm entry at roll 285 and high gain angles are pitch 23 and yaw 267
thats correct jm and 13 houston the computer is yours
the computer is ours were in block and exactly when do you want the tv to be cranked up
you can crank it up sometime prior to 55 hours at your convenience just to set it up well be expecting transmission at 55 hours
okay
and houston apollo 13 one thing i missed about the 02 fuel cell purge and waste and water dump
roger wed like the the 02 fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 5450
roger well pick up those items at 5450
apollo 13 houston
go ahead joe
ail right jack one thing wed like to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans in 02 tank 2 one more time wed like to see if we can get that sensor back o1 23 54 50 cml okay 02 tank 2 fan on now
roger
houston 13
go 13
we  we have just one question the lm tunnel vent valve were questioning why were venting until the deltav is greater than 17 if we are going to open up the tunnel then pressurize the lm usually
right stand by on that
13 houston
go ahead tape 36 age 27
roger the word on that jim is that they want to insure the proper 02 concentration in the lm when you get to the surface and this is a method of doing that by bleeding out additional nitrogen
okay thank you
and 13 houston if jack is up id like to talk to him about the p52 briefly
okay hes here
go ahead joe
okay jack what theyd like you to do on this p52 at 49 hours theyve been observing a slight jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 02 of a degree plus or minus before you come out of the optics zero position at the start of this p52 theyd like you to just observe the shaft readout and see if the jitter occurs on your direct readout there and also theyd like you to briefly call up a verb 16 noun 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles
okay lets see if i got it right on the p52 at 49 hours before coming out of zero on the optics observe the shaft and also call up 16 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter see whether it occurs in the zero position as well as out of zero
roger jack thats correct and if you have time now ive got a flight plan update for you on looking for the comet bennett
okay stand by 1 joe and the commanders going off the air briefly
roger that
 okay joe im ready to copy the  now
okay jack im going to read it to you and then add some comments and well talk about it a little this should occur sometime after 4930 after the p52 realine at 49 hours if time permits we would like the crew to investi gate while in ptc if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos if there is record the optimum roll angle for possible photography prior to reinitiating ptc at 5630 or so whenever the guys are done in the lm use p52 planet option and the following halfunit vectors for tracking comet bennett at about 4946 are you ready to copy halfunit vectors over
okay go ahead joe
okay ri plus 034202 r2 minus 007374 r3 plus 035719 read back
okay copy ri plus 034202 r2 minus 007374 r3 plus 035719
okay thats correct and the last sentence on the update is that you can expect aos of the comet at a roll of 45 degrees and los at a roll of 155 degrees now the deal here jack according to the plots they showed me is the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the sun and due to the geometry of the lm there shadowing the sun it would appear that you will be able to see the comet through the sextant without getting sun shafting between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees it appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees although the comet is still in the field of view the sun is also in the field of view and you probably will not have any success between 75 and 155 if you havent got it from 45 to 75 if you do find that you can see the comet some where between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees just note that roll angle and then if its feasible wed like you to photograph it after the lm entry part of the checklist over
okay joe let me give it back to you and see if ive got it here after the p52 during our ptc you want us to use p52 and observe bennetts comet through the sextant note a roll angle if we can find it visible it would be visible somewhere between  ideally between 45 and 75 degrees and we should lose it about 155 roll and if we do see it make an observation of whether it is photographable note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of ptc at 5630 tape318
thats exactly right jack
okay real fine
apollo 13 houston
go ahead joe
were ready to have to 02 tank 2 fan off and thank you
okay doesnt look like we got it back huh
no it doesnt jack apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
houston apollo 13
houston apollo 13
hey 13 houston go ahead
okay joe ive started into p52 here ive proceeded on option 3 and on the dis  1520  1525 display ive called up 1691 im going to let you observe and see while the  he shaft angle while the optics are still in zero
okay roger that jack were looking at it and ill give you a mark as soon as gc is happy
okay real fine
13 tiouston jack could you give us a readout on your counter now
okay im showing a shaft of 02 and a trunnion of 35992
roger copy that is there any jumping around on the shaft
you mean on the tpac readout
yes
as a matter of fact it went from 02 to 021
okay copy that stand by 1
okay now it went down  it went down as low as 015
okay
jack houston let us watch that for another minute or so
okay im in no hurry it looked like it burned between 014 and 08 with an occasional spike up to 02
roger i
apollo 13 houston
apollo 13 houston you can press on with p52 now over
okay joe
hey houston are we clear to torque are you reading the torquing angles
13 houston go ahead and torque
okay time of torquing will be 49 hours 8 minutes 35 seconds
roger that
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
roger for jack we missed the star angle differ ence on the p52 would you read us that
roger houston it was all balls
okay thank you
hey houston 13
13 houston go ahead
okay joe i got into p52 about 4934 we loaded the planet  or bennett comet vectors into the planet option and p52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the lm and were in a roll angle of 155 now
roger were copying your roll angles at what roll angle were you able to start tracking it jack
okay at the time we entered it there we were about 66 degrees roll so either we started too late or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation on the roll angle
okay let me have gc comment on that i sus pect that the roll angles we gave you were calcu lated for exactly 90 degrees pitch and youre probably wobbling enough that theyre not exactly correct pafe13 02 o 44 02 cl yo  thirjk yol  you prbaby mo th rvht
13 houston over
go ahead
okay jack notice youve secured from that and that was going to be our recommendation anyway were going to have the guys in the back room look at it and see if they can come up with some  with some better numbers based on the cone angle that  that youre traveling through whether there are any roll angles that  that are available to you and if there are and we have time we might give it another try if not we just will forget it
okay
apollo 13 houston over
go ahead joe
okay jack id like to pass you a switch con figuration on the cryo 02 tanks and give you the reason right now wetd like you to go to heaters tank 1 off tank 2 auto which is the opposite of the way youve got them now over
okay is this 02 or h27
this is 02 and stand by for a minute azldwell have a  excuse me this is h2 jack its h2
 is auto  2 off
okay joe do we have you back again
okay jack were getting you back and i hope you copied my  my correction of my mistake im talking about the h2 cryo tanks wed like the tank 1 heater to off tank 2 to auto over 02 o1 50 09 cr okay we lost you again heres our heater configuration now h2 heaters 1 off 2 auto both 02 heaters are in auto
okay thats the configuration we want you in and heres what were thinking about when we went to tank 1 auto tank 2 off we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi which is well above the caution and warning limit and if we go to that configuration for sleep well keep from getting caution and warning lights dltring the sleep cycle okay in order to do that comfortably we want to spend the rest of the day using more h2 out of tank number 2 so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1 so at the end of the sleep cycle itll all come out even and thats why we have you in tk 1 off tank 2 auto now we expect to get about a 3percent unbalance over the next 10 hours and prior to sleep well call you to reverse the configuration again now the only disadwmtage here is that during tile day you will probably get a few caution and warnings and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out over
ill buy that 100 percent
okay good deal one other detail for you jack gc tells us that the optics jitter is very similar to what we had on apollo 12 its no problem but when youre not using the optics we recommend that you turn the optics power switch to off to guard against a possible degradation as the flight progresses over
okay will do
okay apollo 13 houston i have one more little update for you and its another update to the erasable memory onboard crew charts on page g92 over
houston 13 were ready to copy
okay jim these are gyro compensation terms theyve already been uplinked and were just updating your onboard charts now in column a number 11 change from 77646 to 00114 number 12 change from 77332 to 77546 number 13 change from 76617 to 77201 over
the changes are as follows and all in column a number 12 the new change is 77546 number 11 the new change is 00114 and 13 the new change is 77201 over
roger readback correct
and joe do you know  are you going to try and let us spot the bennett comet on this next revo lution there or do you want me to turn the optics power off now
stand by 1 jack okay jack we dont have confidence n those roll angles yet so why dont you turn the optics off and well update you later
okay going off now
roger apollo lb aiitogioundvoicitianzcripion tafe 33i  u lj
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
go ahead houston
roger jim if youve got a couple of minutes now id like to read up to you the change to the lm entry procedure that wed like you to observe at 55 hours and the rationale for it over
okay stand by
roger
go ahead joe
okay before you start copying this procedure is  is basically simply to activate the super critical helium pressure gaging so that you can ead it and the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours at which point wed be within a pos sibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the dps now based on the pressure at launch and based on a nominal rise time of about 612 psi per hour between then and now the pres sure should read about 710 psi stand by 13 until we get better comm
houston you were cut out would you say again about the helium pressure
roger based on the prelaunch pressure in the she tank and the nominal rise time of about 612 psi per hour the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours are you reading over
jim houston did you read that last
okay joe i m on omni c now how do you read
13 houston youre loud and clear now inco tells me hes having a little problem at goldstone and wants me to stand by for a minute
okay how do you read now joe im going from omni c to d now age 156
youre still loud and clear on  on d fred stand by 1 02 02 31 ill ip okay ill put her back to omni b if you all want to take command again
and the last thing we heard joe was that tile supercrit should be reading about 710 psi
okay thats the last thing i passed up and while were waiting for inco to decide here let me continue the deadband that is considered acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi in other words any rise time thatll give you one  a pressure between those two will keep you below the critical pressure at 103 hours or so so we expect it to read in that  in that band and if it does there will be no problem if it reads between 770 and 800 psi we will want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours and ill get the detailed procedures in a minute if the pressure is equal to or greater than 800 psi were going to have to go into some more detailed procedures were going to try to  to get pcm data on it for one thing we may have to have you sit there and stare at the gage for a while to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate rise time on it and then in extreme case we are even thinking about a dps burn but we dont really think that will happen now if you are ready to copy what i have for you is a change or an addition to the lm activation check list between pages tlc1 and tlc2 which consists of seven steps and if you can find a blank side to write it down on i would like to pass it up over
okay how do you read on omni c now
okay youre loud and clesx on 0mni c stand by 1 while we get inco synced up 02 02 34 o0 lamp okay the rest of your update was that its okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi if its above 770 you are going to ask us to con sider going back in at 59 hours and either get pcm going or sit there and give you gage reading changes on the basis of that and you said some thing about an extreme measure we may have to consider some sort of dps maneuver
thats correct pred we dont have procedures for that yet and we dont have any real expecta tion of getting into it the procedure id like to read up to you now is simply the tps reqird to get the supereritical helium pressure reading at 55 hours over
okay
okay were calling this tlcla step 6 transfer to lm power 02 02 35 23 lamp all right stand by 1 joe
okay 02 02 35 3 cmp okay joe hes ready to copy
okay step 6 transfer to lm power floodlights blank caution warning power caution light on report get to mcc panel 11 circuit breaker eps traeslunar bus tie closed circuit breaker panel 16 eps traeslunar bus tie closed cir cuit breaker panel 11 lighting utility closed and activate utility lights over and 13 houston select omni bravo please 02 02 37 08 lamp okay joe iye created a new page here called tlcla item 6 transfer to lm power and the usual check that the floodlights blank and that i ye got the caution warning power light on i get a get from jack and i will pass that on down to you item 7 circuit breaker eps translunar bus tie panels ll and 16 closed step 8 circuit breaker lighting and utility on panel 1 closed and turn on the utility lights however the lighting is such that i dont really need those they are in stowage right now i guess in the isa and ill probably just leave them there
okay thats optional the way we had page tlcla written that was all part of step 6 you havent even gotten to step 7 yet step 7 is as follows
fred houston are you with me
apollo 13 houston are you reading me now
okay houston 13 how do you read
13 houston loud and clear what omni you ot now
im going to stay omni b if you all want to take command back and you can let inco jockey them around between b and d and how many steps we got so i know whether to write big or small here joe
okay we got steps 6 through 12 but step 7 is the same size as 6 and 8 through 12 are short theyre only one line each
okay
okay step 7 follows circuit breaker panel ll ac bus b helium pqgs propellant display closed circuit breaker ll ac bus b numeric lightiig closed circuit breaker ll ac bus b bus tie inverter l closed circuit breaker panel ll eps inverter l closed circuit breaker panel 16 instrumentation sig sensor closed inverter l  
hold on a minute joe
okay
my shorthand is rather poor today
okay im now up to circuit breaker panel ll inverter 1 closed
okay next was circuit breaker panel 16 instrumentation sig sensor closed then in verter l select then helium monitor to super crit press report supercrit press to mcc over
houston 13 how do you read
13 houston youre coming through we still have some background noise do you want to read back step 7 02 02 44 53 i24p hello houston 13
13 houston go ahead
okay joe the last thing i got was helium monitor to supercrit pressure
okay the last part of step 7 is report supercrit pressure to mcc and read back step 7
okay step 7 circuit breaker panel 11 ac bus b helium pqgs display closed main  circuit breaker panel 11 ac bus b numeric light ing closed cd panel 11 ac bus  is that ac bus b bus tie inverter 1 closed
thats affirmative
and cb  cb eps inverter 1 panel 11 closed cb panel 16 instrument signal sensor closed inverter l select helium monitor to supercrit pressure report pressure to msfn
okay thats correct now step 8 is on mcc request perform step 9 in other words you wait for us to decide what to do and thats according to the gouge weve already given you and step 9 ill give you now is helium monitor to off inverter to off over
okay step 8 says set in an mcc hold step 9 says on mcc s words helium monitor off in verter off
roger thats correct step l0 is configure circuit breaker panels per activation 3 and 4
okay configure  step 10 configure circuit breakers per activation pages 3 and 4
roger thats correct step 11 is deactivate the utility lights if you activated them and step 12 which is the last one is transfer to csm power usual observations and report time to mcc
okay step ll deactivate utility lights 12 transfer to csm power and note the usual observations and report the get
okay thats it and of course houston will be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure is less than 770 if the pressure is between 770 and 800 we will be asking you to do the following if youre ready to copy
stand by ive got to find some more blank paper 02 02 49 0 cc yz this igoing to b page tlcis jut its very short
okay go ahead with tlc3 02 02 9 31 cc okay stand by 10 seconds fred
fred houston
ail right go ahead
roger well hold off on that iiwas a short threestep procedure which said repeat activa tion pages 1 la and 2 but there was another step in it that nobody understands so essen tially what wed recommend in that ease would be that you would repeat the procedure that we just passed up for reading the supercrit pressure if we need to well clarify it later on and thats all weve got
okay
houston 13
13 houston go ahead
okay one thing joe i just want to doubleeheck again all the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours which the first item was pres surize csm to 57 psia were going to move that up to 64 now so we have our lm entry which was nominally at 58 at 55 is that correct
thats correct jim
okay
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
roger 13 because of the 02 tank 2 quantity sensor drop out eecom wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities and hes going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned and the first time is now and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours ex cept during sleep period and high activity periods wed like you to do it now over  02 03 07 hh cdr okay well start it  now 02 03 07 6 cc thank you
and lb houston for your information a normal 1minute or so stir will be fine apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription

jim just an advisory expect a caution and warning on h2 tank 1 pretty quick no problems just warning you about it
okay a zero pressure light on h2 tank 1 coming on shortly huh
right
okay well youre pretty close it just came on
any other predictions youd like
well theres  i guess theres all sorts could you go to the horse races with me
im sorry you were garbled say again
i said id like to invite you to the horse races with me
right well  well send eecomm 02 04 16 55 i34p well its time for a little grits again here vance
understand some grits huh chow bon apetit
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
roger just expect that same caution and warning to come on again and you want us to keep warn ing you of that thing
go ahead houston
roger jim just expect a caution and warning to come on the same as it did about an hour ago
go ahead houston weve lost 
roger how are you reading me now jim  tape 32
houston apollo 13 
13 houston how do you read now 
okay read you good now seems like weve had a little trouble with the comm today
yes i guess its partly because you are further  out we just wanted to tell you that you were  going to get that caution warning that you just  got
right we just got
and i wont bother you with those calls anymore unless you especially want them
thats okay vance you dont have to call us about that unless its something serious
okay
we just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience
roger copy
its really kind of like eating on the sly chasing it around

right were not doing anything right now vmce were just getting curious we could start the lm entry procedures and get everything squared away and then when the tv comes up at 55 hours we can just use it for the tv and we wouldnt be worrying about checking out the she tank pressures and everything like that
okay let us mull that one a minute here and ill get right back with you
okay
also houston apollo 13 wed like to move up the waste water dump and maybe the 02 fuel cell purge a little bit early if we could
okay stand by
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
jim youre clear to go on into the lm and just advise though that the tv time is still fixed at 55 hours and  so well be standing by to support your entry and well get back with you on a minute  in a minute on the 02 fuel cell purge and the waste water dump
okay sounds good
and also request your lmcm deltap which was on the flight plan for 53 hours what did you vent it down to over
we have 17 now we vented it down to that figure
okay you vented down to 17 and what did it start at
it was about 11 vance tape 35 
roger copy
houston 13
go ahead 13
what do you read for suit pressure down there
were reading 43 fred
okay
houston 13
go ahead apollo 13
wed like another confirmation when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to lmcm deltap we were reading about 17  175 and it slowly went up now to about  oh id say a little less than 22 seems to be holding there  is there a lag in the gaging system
okay well  well ask that question stand by
apollo 13 houston
apollo 13 houston
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
okay to answer your question jim that increase in pressure is normal because it was just track ing an increase in cabin pressure
okay okay
were not thinking today
and 13 from houston its okay with us if you want to move the 02 fuel cell purge and the water dump up to this time over
okay well work it in shortly thank you
right
apollo 13 houston ijlii 4 02 05 h5 16 cdr go ahead
jim recommend you stay in the ptc until we stop it for the tv at 55 hours in case you were thinking of  
go ahead houston
roger recommend you continue ptc until 55 hours over
you were calling houston
thats affirmed jim how do you read now
okay we read you loud and clear
okay the only comment that we just made was that in case you were thinking of stopping ptc theres no need to stop it until 55 get when tv starts
right well stop it when were setting up our tv
roger
okay houston the waste water dump and 02 fuel cell purge are complete
houston roger
okay houston the lmcm deltap is constant were going to go ahead with hatch removal
houston roger
is that you jack
no this is jacks replacement
okay houston 13
houston go ahead
go ahead 13
houston apollo 13
this is houston go ahead 13 age147
okay houston apollo 13
roger go ahead 13
okay the lmp has entered the lm
roger
is that big john
it sure is howre you doing
fine
yes youre doing great man
thank you i had a good cdr
youre doing it on your own now
yes it feels like im back at home again john down in here
i hope you did a good job john
roger
okay houston we want to take the fm and bring up tv here for our own use then well go to transmit i  at 55 hours
roger 13 mollo lb aiiiogholini voicm ianciiption lag j4l
okay houston weve transferred to lm power the time was 54 hours 46 minutes 15 seconds
roger jack transfer to lm power thank you 02 06 46 47  and the dockingtunnel index jack was minus 2 degrees
say again fred youre coming in with a lot of background noise
okay the dockingtunnel index mark was minus 2 degrees
roger minus 2 degrees
okay jack how do you read
fred houston is reading you loud and clear
okay ive got up through step 7 now and im not getting much of a light in the helium indi cator here why dont i review for you how weve proceeded and you look at the procedure you gave me and see if weve missed anything
roger go ahead 02 06 49 57 i4p okay we transferred to lm power and that looked okay im staring at a caution and warning fotwer light and all the red flags and we got both x lunar bus tie breakers in the utility lighting breaker is in then ac bus b helium pqs display the ac bus b numeric lighting and ac bus b inverter i is  bus tie is closed then i closed the inverter i breaker and ive selected on panel 16 and the signal consensor sic breaker is in ive selected inverter i and put the helium monitor switch to supercrit and i have no lights
okay fred let us take a look at it
i was wondering do we need an a  do we need possibly in the  one of the anundock component breakers in
stand by 1
okay jack hold the phone i forgot the rheo stat was cranked all the way down on the anun num and its showing 720 which looks like a pretty good  pretty good number
roger we copy 720 thank you fred   02 06 51 49  flashed to 7  okay and it just flickered down to 710 its kind of flickering between 710 and 720
roger 710 to 720
okay fred those are good numbers and were not going to have to crank up the tm thats the number we were looking for 02 06 52 26 imp very good okay do you want me to back out of this in reverse at least as far as getting this part of it powered down
stand by 1
fred this is houston go ahead and back out of this little test and proceed
roger
okay were back on csm power the time was 54 hours 58 minutes 50 seconds
roger jack 545850 thank you
okay houston well try to pick you up on the high gain
roger
and 13 were ready on the tv when you are
this is 13 say again houston
13 were ready on the tv when you are any time
okay sounds good with you in a minute were just cranking up high gain now
okay houston how do you read us in the high gain
were hearing you 5 square jim how me
okay youre coming through okay
as you were on that jim we dont have you on high gain yet were still looking at you
13 houston in this attitude wed suggest pitch 5 yaw 237 on the high gain over
pitch 5 yaw 237 roger
okay jack can you  can you read the high gain now
affirmative jack weve got you on a high gain and it appears to us that were in wide beam  wide beam width
yes we cant get it to come down to narrow we tried to switch to auto track or reacq and it  yaw drives around from 270 to 0 and pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90 im trying  were fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us and ill try and get you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it up manually here
roger jack meanwhile well look at the situation you describe there
okay and it does it on both sets of servo electronic power
jack what it looks like is that when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off
roger jack thank you
okay im trying you in wide or medium beam width now 02 07 07 54 cp can you pick up the tv in this condition here at all
negative jack well have to have the narrow beam width
okay can you give us maybe a slight maneuver
jack wed like you to check two high gain circuit breakers down in panel 25 check your high gain group 2 and your high gain in the flight bus over
okay okay jack theyre both in
roger
lb weve got an attitude suggestion for you we suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90 and yaw 0 over
okay
0kay houston apollo 13 i think weve got high gain locked up now do you confirm
we confirm that jim weve got you locked up on the high gain and narrow beam
okay sounds good well get the tv started right away
roger
13 houston wed like to disable quads c and d use alfa and bravo over
okay 
  disable quads c and d roger 02 07 1 56 cc okay 13 weve got fredo on tv
roger houston what we plan to do for you today is start out in the space shipper sic odyssey and take you on through from odyssey in through the tunnel into aquarius and show you a little bit of the landing vehicle and your tv operator is now resting on the center couch looking at fred haise whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel and his back is against the lowerequipmentbay optical area and fred will now transport him self into the tunnel and into the spaceship aquarius tap 36 g 152
you know one thing i noted jack when i first came across here that starting upright in the command module and heading down in aquarius theres a little bit of an orientation change that even though id been through it once in the water tank it still pretty unusual i find myself now standing with my head on the floor when i get down inside the lm
thats a great picture jim you got the light just right 02 07 16 40  and one of the nice things jack particularly for a novice like myself is the  the ease of moving around in here its of course as you know from working in the command module simulator its really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid because you get  pretty confining really at one g to move around very much in there and its quite easy in this environment the lm as you can see it looked pretty clean i found a couple of loose washers about it and the  a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and i found it lodged over by the ed panel okay right under jim now hes actually standing on a  what looks to be a can here and for the sake of all the people back there housed inside this can is the  the lm ascent engine where hopefully you can see my hand resting on top of right now  the engine that we use to get off of the moon immediately adjacent to the engine cover here i have my hand on a white box now which has been shown before this happens to be jims plss or the backpack whichll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface this device we hope to make use of for  a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours right  right behind the plss a couple of little square pack ages i now have my hand on here one here and one right below are our opss which are in essence the emergency oxygen supplies which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes these are  when we get ready to mount up and head outside will be placed up on top of the plss
the second backpack is mounted down on the lm floor i hope positioned right between the two of us i have my hand on it at this time tape 36i pace 153
roger fred we see it the pictures coming through real good and your description is good we see jims got the camera oriented the way wa like to look at it so keep talking 02 07 20 05 i24p okay i guess everybody has pretty much envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic electronics and certainly a lot of it is but i thought id bring out a couple of items here in conjunction with the plss after the first eva you get a very accurate measure ment of the amount of water thats left in the plsss were going to make use of this bag im showing now to collect the remaining water out of the plss and see just how much we really did have left and hopefully on future missions to be able to extend safely the allowable time on these units even a little further and my other hand i have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water we really have in this bag and i guess this  an apt description for this device would be a fish scale and you can see im weighing myself right now and it says i weigh actually less than zero right now guess its calibration isnt too good
thatll be the day
i think even youd weigh zero here jack
touche
houston this is jim since freds been in the lunar module and since hes the lunar module pilot this is the first time that hes felt that hes been rightside up
roger jim
i might tell you that were looking at right now that round bag thats just behind fred holds our vacuum hose and when we get back inside the lm well hook the vacuum off our suits and its resting or its attached to the hatch which will  we will open to go on to the lunar sur face and of course to come back in the hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch which is our docking hatch between the  between odyssey and aquarius
roger and we see fred looking in the wicuum cleaner there now 02 07 2b 22  okay what i have out now jack is lea w has also been shown before its a head garment for wearing out on the surface and i  im bringing jims out here to show a couple of mod one problem before is that the cast of characters down on the surface havent been able to be dis tinguished apart very well so not only jims suit has some red stripes on it but as you can see his levva also has a  a red stripe and now you can see one other mod here too jack which i hadnt really seen myself before i guess on 12 pete and a1 had commented about the  commented about having trouble with sun light in the eyes so on our lewas they put on a new center section which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap
okay jack who fixed up our levvas
hows the detail on this one jack
say again fred
can you see any detail in this picture now or am i blocking out too much of the sunlight
thats affirmative weve got a good picture of the lewa there and its coming through loud and clear
okay
okay jack while fred is putting away my helmet you are looking over into freds station now hows this picture is it okay before  or do i have to adjust it
we have a hunch that the setting might be in peak but we recommend average on the alc if you havent got it there already
were in average jack
okay and were getting a good picture of the
side with the deda over there tap 
hey jack one question on the command module here do i  i have the dap right now wide dead band do you want me to begin setting up nar deadband and nulling the rates to start ptc a
stand by jack 02 07 27 31 i24p what im fishing out now jack is another new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as a result of some comments made on the apollo 12 flight
what fred is opening up  is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lullar sur face they  pete and a1  did not have that on apollo 12 and they consequently got very thirsty but we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which with very little effort we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work 02 07 28 33 imp so if you hear any funny noises it is just probably the drink bag
fred the bags empty
fred is now looking through our optical device its an instrument in which to aline our plat form and fred is now looking into it just to see what kind of an outside picture he might be able to get we might be able to use a tv camera to look through our optical instrumen to the outside of the command module a few minutes ago while we first came in we did manage to look to the outside of the side hatch of the command module through our optical instru ment stand by well try to see what we can do here
roger jim break jack wed like you to stay in the deadband you are now in and well make a change when the tv is over another thing we would like you to do is check your pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can compare it with what were seeing down here
okay its showing about  say 28 degrees and 267 pae  il
20 and 267
28  28 and 267
okay jack laveyou got that pieturo now
fred about onequarter of our screen is lightd and its impossible to determine what you are looking at right now maybe you could give us a little verbal description
okay its looking through the aot in position 4 right rear and were looking back toward the  over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module
okay is  is it too dark a picture jack you think the fstop open may help
no fred its got to be centered up a little bit thats primarily what you have to do
jack we cant center it up any more because the side hatch is only one part of the aot the rest of that blackness you see is really space
okay well try another one and its a little better centered in fact the only other one we have that shows the whole picture were in the forward d10 of the aot now position 2 and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna
okay we see you moving the camera up to the a lens and we got a real good picture now
and 
okay jack im looking out the right window now and not too far off in the distance now you can see the objective and ill zoom in on it here a little and see if it brings it in better
and its actually beginning to look a little bigger now you can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye and so far i guess i have to even agree with jim that its still looking pretty gray with white spots
okay fred were getting a good picture of your destination there
jack youve been looking at the  at fred workshop now and you can see the abort guidance computer and over there on the  tucked away in his armrest is our activation checklist which well be using very shortly up on the top of the window we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the descent and now freds engaged in his favorite pastime i fotmd out on this flight so far
hes not in the food locker is he
thats his second favorite pastime hes rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out  to see what its going to be like
roger sleeping and then eating
its kind of difficult here jack getting into a hwock in zero g im not sure if i keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me
if you notice a few things floating around we found just about one or two washers occasionally
and for the benefit of those that may wonder where jim sleeps be a little difficult to rig his hmmock in here right now with the hatch open but his runs laterally in this direction fore aft so he has the upper berth and i get the lower berth
and now while freds taking his hammock down arid restowing it i might give you some idea of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no up or down and im situated on top of the ascent engine just at the entrance to the tunnel ill reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from fred look through the tunnel again back at odyssey and we might pick up part of jack
there he is we see him
okay houston for the benefit of the television viewers weve just about completed our little inspection of aquarius and now were proceeding through the hatchygap into the tunnel and going back toward the odyssey
okay jim its been a great show so far
and finqly jack  m hak iut i idykv a we sl id on through th tmmci hc
houston 13 are you still on tv
yes we sure are weve got a good picture of the skipper there
okay what we can show you now a little added benefit weve got the drogue on freds couch in the command module right now we stowed it temporarily while were checking out the  out aquarius and underneath his couch weve got the probes stowed quite a big cumbersome device and well get a shot of it for you
youre looking now at our probe the place on the nose of odyssey its a very heavy thing but i suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing and its much easier to move around as a matter of fact both fred and jack commented as many people in the past have of how much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have such ease in moving compared to our simulator which make training rather difficult
okay were seeing a good picture of the probe there jim and looks like the characters shaved before the show this time
well fred said he had to keep up his tv image
yes that may be my first and last time though jack
it took fred i hour to shave
we might give you a quick  a quick shot of our entertainment on board the spacecraft which has been keeping us company for some time 02 07 43 57 music  willow weep for me
this little tape recorder has been a big benefit  has been a big benefit to us in pass ing some of our time away on our transit to the moon and its rather odd to see it floating like this in odyssey while its playing the theme from 2001 and of course the tapes wouldnt be complete without aquarius
okay jim were seeing the tape recordr now and just  by the way how long do you lxpect to keep the tv on this evening
well when we  stand by 1
yes i got them with the cabin repress valve again there jack
every time he does that our hearts  our hearts jump in our mouth and jack any time you want to terminate tv were all set to go
okay jim its been a real good tv show we think we ought to conclude it from here now what do you think
roger sounds good and this is the crew of apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening and were just about ready to close out our in spection of aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in odyssey good night
thank you 13
apollo 13 houston the next thing wed like you to do is to 
go ahead
  wed like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the comet bennett to do that we would like you to enable quads c and d for the maneuver use all your quads and in precisely i minute wed like you to ter minate the battery charge on battery b one other request wed like to have you verify  
okay will do
one other request wed like you to verify your high gain configuration wed like to know what track mode what serv0 and what beam width
okay jack during the tv we were auto track narrow beam width and the primary electronics and we had a good loekup just after we started the maneuver i was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90 tap 6if
roger we copy and the tv show was great
okay real fine okay im going to maneuver to 060 090 and 0  02 07 50 31 cc and 13 wed like you to check c4 thruster   02 07 51 33 cmp okay jack the battery charge has been ter
roger we see it jack and we got a reading  of minus 2 degrees on the docking index wed 21 or 19  like to know it thats 20 precise or if its   minated on the battery b
no its a minus 20 precisely   02 07 51 56 cc thank you get a chance wed like you to stir up your q 02 07 52 58 cc 13 weve got one more item for you when you cryo tanks in addition i have shaft and i   trunnion  
  for looking at the comet bennett if you need it  02 07 53 12 cmp okay stand by  02 07 55 19 lmp okay houston     02 07 55 20 cdr i believe weve had a problem here
this is houston say again please
houston weve had a problem weve had a  main b bus undervolt
roger main b undervolt
okay stand by 13 were looking at it
okay right now houston the voltage is  is looking good and we had a pretty large bang associated with the caution and warning there and as i recall main b was the one that had had au amp spike on it once before
roger fred
in the interim here were starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again
roger
yes that jolt must have rocked the sensor on  see now  02 quantity 2 it  was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent now its full scale high again
roger
and houston we had a restart on our computer and we had a pgncs light and the restart resf
roger restart and a pgncs light res on a pgncs reset  
okay and were looking at our s  service module rcs helium 1 we have  b is barber poled and d is barber poled helium 2 d is barber pole and secondary propellants i have a and c barber pole bmag temperatures
okay ac 2 is showing zip im going to try to reconfigure on that jack
roger
yes we got a main bus a undervolt now too showing
main a undervolt
its reading about 2512 main b is reading zip right now
and houston odyssey
stand by l jim
13 houston wed like you to attempt to recon nect fuel cell i to main a and fuel cell 3 to main b verify that quad delta is open
okay houston im showing  i tried to reset and fuel cell i and 3 are both showing gray flags but they are both showing zip on the flows
we copy
okay houston are you still reading 137 pago 69
thats affirmatiw were readin you were trying to como up with  gol idom hrpc it you
okay let me give you some reading  i n t interim to help main a voltage jack ive go bus tie ac on
say again fred
in the interim to help out main a voltage ive got main bus tie bat ac on or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on main a
okay bus tie ac on
13 houston we need omni charlie please
you got it
13 houston wed like you to verify couple of readings for us we would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1 we need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2
okay nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2 is that correct 
negative oxygen on 3
okay
okay the systems test 1a says zip
and 2 baker which is 3 oxygen says 06
2 baker says 06 and say again the other one
fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero
roger zero
13 houston wed like you to open circuit fuel cell l leave 2 and 3 as is
okay ill get to work on that
and jack our 02 quantity number 2 tank is reading zero did you get that
02 quantity number 2 is zero 
thats ac okay yes thats good ac and it looks to me looking out the hatch that we are venting something we are venting something out into the  into space
roger we copy your venting
its a gas of some sort
okay fuel cell 1 you just wanted it off the line now jack is that right
we just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1
okay shes off the line
13 houston we see you getting close to gimbal lock there wed like you to bring up all quad cs on main a quad cl c2 c3 c4 on main a and also bring b3 and b4 up on main a
13 houston do you read
yes we got it
affirm
okay can you tell us anything about the venting where it is coming from what window you see it at
its coming out of window l right now jack and could you give me the thrusters again
okay the thrusters  
what buses
wed like  on main a wed like charlie 1 2 3 and 4 also bravo 3 and 4 on main a
okay got it
13 we need omni bravo
omni bravo apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay 13 this is houston wed like you to go to your gc checklist the pink pages 15 do powerdown until we get a delta of 10 nps ovr
all right roger
okay jack say again that   for the power down its not in the pink pages the 15
okay wed like you to go down that powerdown procedure until you get a delta of l0 amps over
roger 
13 houston did you copy our powerdown request
roger jack were  yes were doing it right now
where did you say that was located jack 02 08 18 0b cc thats in your systems checklist page 15
and 13 you might also check for those pages in your launch checklist theyre emergency pages pink pages 15 and wed like you to power down until you get  
okay that was in the launch checklist jack
roger power down until you get an amperage of 10 amps less than what you got now over
okay
okay jack are you happy with the amps we have now
stand by l fred
okay jack and on this page 15 we proceeded right down the list all the way down were right now at bmag number 2 is in warm up
roger we copy bmag 2 in warm up well follow you through tape y2
okay and something is giving us a reach jack both in pitch and roll so im suspecting that maybe its whatever it is thats venting back there ive had to use direct in order to stabilize this and as soon as i do were starting to pick up rates again can you pick up any jets firing
stand by what direction are your rates in jack
its negative pitch and negative roll
roger
13 houston we need to get some more instrumen tation up wed like you to put inverter 1 on both ac buses over
okay okay you got inverter 1 on both ac buses now and jack one of the items that we turned off was the  all the fuel cell pumps okay and you might let us know when fuel cell 2 needs its pump back we ought to take care of that guy
roger okay fred we want fuel cell 2 pumps to ac1 please
fuel cell 2 to ac1 roger
okay its on ac1
omni charlie please 13
0mni charlie
okay 13 weve got lots and lots of people working on this well give you some dope as soon as we have it and youll be the first one to know
oh thank you
okay jack and the weird configuration were sitting in now is we have the hatch installed we still have the probe and drogue inside the command module and were going to stay in this situation until you  kind of give us an okay to reinstall the probe and drogue
roger well give you an answer
or if necessary to use the lm consmnabes
roger
13 wed like to have you put thruster alfa 3 on main a please
alfa 3 on main a
okay jack are you monitoring the quad temps in quad a  package temps
affirmative
13 this is houston wed like to power down just a little bit more so lets get bmag 2 off and make sure your lights are down over
okay the lights are down and bmag 2s going from standby to off
13 houston   02 08 3 28 cml okay jack now ive got a rate 
  wed like you to open circuit fuel cell 3
open circuit fuel cell 3
go ahead jack
okay fuel cell 3 is off the line now
and 13 houston wed like you to turn all your bravo thrusters off and put all your delta thrusters on main a please
all delta thrusters on main a and all bravo thrusters off roger
13 houston turn battery a off  
okay jack 
thats right we were pulling current all the time pte l
battery a off roger
now youre  up
im transmitting i dont have any current now
hey its off  its off they  they killed the bus completely now
13 houston wed like you to isolate your 02 surge tank over
surge tank off now jack okay jack are you copying  02 tank 1 cryo pressure
thats affirmative and were trying to get power to that tank stand by were workinm on it
okay
okay we had a  service module rcs b light jack due to package temperature
service module rcs b we copy no problem
lets read you the lights we got on now cryo press fuel cell 1 fuel cell 3 main bus b undervolt suit compressor
roger we copy them and wed like to build up the pressure in 02 tank 1 so turn the heaters on manually well watch the pressure for you
okay do you want to see  
go ahead
  were going to get a main bus a undervolt probably
roger we realize that we feel we can stand 5 more amps on it
okay
okay heater on tank ls on
lb houston wed like you to additionally bring on the fans in 02 tank l and we can stand the additional amperage on that
okay  bring up the fans on 02 tank 1 apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
13 houston wed like you to check some circuit breakers on panel 226 cryo 02 heater number 1 main a and check the three cryo fan motors tank 1 three phases
okay jack 226 is configured just like it should be i got three reacs breakers and three rad breakers open all the rest are closed
okay fred thank you
jack looking outside the number of particles has diminished greatly almost ceased now which indicates maybe what was venting has almost stopped
roger jack thank you we copy
im still getting some rates in negative pitch though
roger
and 13 wed like to verify that both bmags are off please
negative we just have one bmag bmag number 1 is still on
okay jack lets take bmag i off
okay bmag number 1 off now
13 this is houston wed like you to give us a survey of your displays on mdcs i and 2 give us gage readings and talkbacks over
okay well start with display number 1
okay jack on mdc l theres nothing abnormal all the rate indicators are zero ball number 2 is frozen of course we lost main b ive got  ball number i appears to be working normally right now im sitting at roll 0 pitch 180 and yaw about 13 degrees im going to try and hold 0 180 and 0
okay houston the center panel  im looking ac the rcs indicator a we have a package temperature of about 180 our heliu pressure is 3900 im looking at fuel pressure of about 180 and per centage of about id say 85 percent b is about the same except that that package pressure is 190 on quad c were looking about the same except that the package temperature is 100 on quad d were looking at package temperature of 160 all other indications are about the same cm pressure  rcs pressure is looking nominal helium pressures up around 4000 and package temperature is about  a little less than 80 on ring 1 and about the same on ring 2
and the  talkbacks on the sm rcs ive ot helium 1 now are all gray helium 2 are ali gray primary propellant all gray secondary propellant ive got two barber pole and a s barber pole b gray c barber pole and d gray okay on the ecs radiators barber pole is ray on the  on the ecs primary indicator
okay jack starting at the top okay the cryo tanks h2 i is reading 230 and the same for 2 our 02 cryo tank i is  looks like its barely holding its own at 300 and cry0 tank 2 is reading zip our quantities h2 i is reading 73 2 74 on the 02 side were reading 02 i at quantity 76 02 2 pegged to full scale high itad temps primary inlet were reading about 55 rad out is reading about 30 and the secondary outlet is reading  reading 52 degrees and the evap out temp is 45 steam pressure 017 and glycol discharge 48 suit compressor is reading zip the accum is reading 30 h20 waste is reading about 34 potables reading about 98 secondary rad inlet is reading about 71 and the rad out is about 30 glycol evap temp is reading 65 steam pressure pegged full scale high discharge pressure 9 psi

okay jack it looks like 02 tank 1 pressure is just a hair over 200
we confirm that here and the temperature also confirms it
okay does it look like its still going down
its slowly going to zero and were starting to think about the lm lifeboat
yes thats what were thinking about too you want me to do a quick p527 it kind of looks like  weve been talking it over and it kind of looks like wed probably aline our plats  lm platform with our platform and then power down the cm and keep the lm powered up doing a dps  whatever dps burns you give us
13 were not going to concern ourselves at the moment with a dps burn its going to be some time before wed get to that but were working on other procedures to give you which will allow us to use the lm systems over
okay real fine
apollo 13 houston wed like to charge battery a now
charge battery a roger
and jack in regard to your question about the p52 and lm platform its  theres no need to worry about that now we wouldnt be using the lm platform for  until about 79 hours so lets go as is on the platform for now over
okay we understand
okay jack
and jack weve turned off the waste dump heater if youre going to consider dumping any more waste water we probably ought to do it while the duct is warm there
roger stand by jack
okay
okay jack lets keep the water no need for a dump right now

thats affirmative jim
activation 11 omit step 1 do the rest is that correct
thats affirmative
do activation 1 and activation 13 step 1
thats all correct
okay jack pressure in tank 1 is approaching 100 psi whats going to be the symptoms of this fuel cell starting to drop off
okay
and 13 this is houston ive got another procedure for the lm a short one
okay ready to copy jack
okay on panel ll wed like you to close the lgc dsky circuit breaker then we want you to go to activation 25 do steps l 2 and 3 then go to activation 30 and that will give us a docked imu coarse aline over
roger panel ll close lgc circuit breaker activation 25 do steps l 2 3 and then do complete activation 30 is that correct
thats affirmative on panel ll lgc dsky circuit breaker closed
and in the lm lets go to panel ll and close the suit fan circuit breaker and get suit fan 1 cranked up

thats affirmative and odyssey weve got another configuration for you ail 16 rcs auto select off all rcs heaters off over
okay i can verify all heaters off jack ive got to keep a fairly minimum deadband until i get through this coarse aline
roger
okay verb 41 noun 20 okay you want plus plus or minus plus 30243 is that right tape 3o1 pafe 8 02 0 03 12 lj okay it ira enter it okly what tl uxl one plus 34778 34778 kay 0813 i that right enter okay
odyssey houston  
 
  your battery a on
battery a on now
go ahead aquarius
houston okay i want you to doublecheck my arithmetic to make sure we got a good coarse aline the roll cal angle was minus 2 degrees the command module angles were 35557 16778 35187
okay jim we copy the roll cal at minus 20 the command module is 35557 16778 35187
okay verb 41 weve done that okay
aquarius houston request high bit rate please
you want high bit rate
thats affirmative fred wont cost us anything
odyssey houston wed like you to on your comm configuration go to primary power amp off low bit rate and downvoice backup over
and aquarius we need your suit gas diverter to cabin
all right you got it
houston ive gone to primary power amplifier off low bit rate downvoice backup
okay jack thank you and aquarius your arithmetic looks good on the coarse aline there
okay okay stand by for an enter
three  tape 32
get the get we need the get wat is it ats that 58 5807
58 what
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
here are the gimbal angles command module 35669 16342 34667 aquarius is 30226 34592 01179 over
okay jim i got command module 35665 16342 34667 aquarius 30226 34592 01178

houston  flashing
odyssey houston we need a command reset on your  on your comm and then wed like you to power down to cmc power down the imu heaters off on the imu but leave the battery a on
yes
odyssey houston
ask him if hes 
yes
are you 
yes
houston this is odyssey go ahead
okay jim  
copy it down tap 301 iagit
okay jim i think im reading jack now ut what we want him to do is to give us a command reset and then power down the cmc power down the imu turn the imu heater off leave battery a on over
thats just about 80  in fact 82 hours out of the two primary cartridges thats two guys 4 is what lc8 got that would be 88 hours we got a seccldary youre right were listening
odyssey houston
they can stand it  go ahead

yes jack i read it back twice to you command reset which ive done im about to power down the imu power down the cmc turn the imu heaters off leave bat a on
thats affirm thank you
okay i just got a master alarm and main bus a undervolt and im starting to power down now  
weve lost  the only advantage to doing it early if we can power back  the lm back down the only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the lm down otherwise we got to keep the lm powered up clear until we get around the moon plus it would be inside on the burn i just hope the gn hangs up on  hangs in on this one  id sure hate to do that one manual
oh boy
odyssey houston couple circuit breakers for you on panel 276 on our instrumentation power control open cb number 3 and number 4

and jack let me know if you get close to gimbal lock would you
jim we dont want you to power down the ball in the lm we wanted you to power down the ball in the csm
jack thcy havent powered down  
jack we dont have the balls powered up in the lm
i have the cmc and imu in the command module is powered down the heaters are out
and the evap flow valve thats open now and ive undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit flow valves so we got air flowing in the lm now
okay jack will you say again the scs items you wanted me to power down
okay houston do you read odyssey
hello houston how do you read
his gimbal lock and ours are different jim
apollo 13 houston say again please you were cut out

roger and fredo get the tca breakers in last please
roger jim im holding open those until you give me a further word anyway im just going to pressurize right now
jack are you reading lm gimbal angles
   power off come down here and  the audio 
okay aquarius i have some gyro torquing angles and the odyssey is powered down attitudecontrol wise so lms got attitude control now
aquarius houston
go ahead jack
okay we want you to know that we got some gyro torquing angles for you and we want you to tell us when you got attitude control in the lm
okay were still working on the pressurization im getting jim on the horn here so he can help out there
roger
wonder why
we got to get this pressurized
houston aquarius
stand by l aquarius odyssey wed like you to go direct rcs and hold your present attitude out the window until the lm gets rcs powered up go ahead jim
well thats my question were not  our 16 20 doesnt match our eightball here we went to fdais on and we dont have our balls completely powered up there may be a  and our angles dont look the same and we dont want to go into gimbal lock tap 3l pag 18c
roger how far are you from rcs power u  cs pressurization
okay jack im right up to where its ister arm on rcs fire  
  both logic powers out  goes into normal circuitbresker  do you want a in and then ill fire them
okay 13 youre both talking at once one at a time please
okay whos first
close logic power a and b fred and pressurize rcs
okay
go ahead odyssey
okay im going to try to do the best i can ive got a oneattitude reference im going to fly according to the lunar terminator
roger jack just maintain attitude
what am i doing i cant do that anyway lets see cross feed nope now and

okay jack im 
i want to go up this way to get away from that  the radios are powered huh
yes
check your antenna
okay jack odyssey is ready to copy
okay jack what we want you to do is close the reactants valve on fuel cell 2 power down your inverters power down your battery relay bus battery ties off and pull your entry circuit breakers entry battery circuit breakers a b and c tape 390
check the control and make sure we dont go to gimbal lock fred
okay jack understand close reac valve circuit breakers in fuel cell 2 power down inverters power down bat relay bus bat ties off power entry and both running circuit breakers a b and c all off
thats affirmative jack and close the reactant valve on fuel cell 2 there apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay ill do that and jackll do that other
okay jack on fuel cell 2 open circuit it
okay fuel cell 2 is open circuited do you want me to go through the standard shutdown pro cedure for the reac valves and 
odyssey houston all you have to do is close the reacs valve on fuel cell 2
okay cb reacs and vent reac valves all closed
yes
yes
 an hour and a half
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay odyssey is completely powered down ac cording to the procedure that you read to jack
roger we copy thats where we want to be jim
and jack have you all got good lm data down there now
thats affirmative fred were getting good lm data
okay in that case i think i 11 pull out some display breakers and just let you all keep sa eye on things

hes turning his lights off now too
stand by 1 on that fred
okay
what about these lights up here 02 i0 41 30 lmp ive got it
okay
where would you like 
oh
we dont want to lose comm with him
im watching it
aquarius houston stand by on opening your circuit breakers for displays were going to let you know what they are and i have some gyro torquing angles for you
okay what page is that there gyro torquing
okay what page is the do we write the gyro torquing angles on there jack
stand by
okay were there now jim jims got it go ahead with the gyro torquing angles
okay wed like you to proceed with the fine aline and your gyro torquing angles are x plus 00330 y plus 02480 z minus 01510 over
okay i read your gyro torquing angles as plus 00330 y is plus 023 i only have four numbers for y youll have to give that one to me again and z is minus 01510 read y again pleas e
okay jim x and z are correct and y is plus 02480
okay we read y as plus 02480 well proceed on activation 40 to fine aline the platform
roger okay aquarius proceed as on page 40 with imu fine aline
aquarius houston can you see any stars out the lm window 02 0 47 53 lmp well have to wipe them off jack theyre coated with water right now

theyre talking about powering down and doing a p51 here
no they were just thinking about p52  
aquarius houston negative on the p51 we want to stay just like we are but wed like to be able to correlate what youre doing with some simulator work were going to crank up and so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window we can make that correlation
would you say one more time give me the top two the top two
jim what we want you to do is go with your cur rent fine aline and disregard the p51 what were attempting to do is to crank up some lms simula tions to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the lmb window to see if that will help us any so when you can see some stars if you can you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations please let us know
okay well check stand by
okay watch the  
im just glad  02 i0 51 25 cdr okay stand by
okay here unplug this
aquarius liouston we notice that the 02 pres sure in the ascent tank 02 is a little high so we want to use some of it so close descent o and open ascent 02 tank 2 over
okay jack switch now on ascent number 2 02 tank descent 02 is closed
roger fred
 that
okay houston aquarius how do you read
reading you 5 square jim go ahead
okay im looking out of freds window i see a lot of particles out there but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity and i dcat recognize any constellations right now in this particular attitude
okay jim if that status changes please let us know
roger were continuing to drift okay get your ttcas to roll
ttca 
and aquarius houston ive got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays in addition i have a p30 maneuver pad over
roger stand by houston get the cs  get the pad book
get the lm data  get the lm book
and say  were getting the pad book now jack  and say the boost on powered up
okay i have omccircuit breakers that you can opn up in order to power dn displays
okay stand by 1 jack im going to get my comm carrier on
all right ill tell you what get all the lm stuff give me the lm stuff right now jack give me all the lm stuff
why
all right jack hey what do you need out of here 
 status
here
now is there any way they can control this thing with the lm on fredo
whats that
looks like im crosscoupling here i might as well 
yes you are ttca will give you the best con trolling warning
yes and i want to get out of this roll what if i go to  
it doesnt matter where the hell you are  gimbal lock  my flashlight or any flashlight
 down and power down 
well im not doing any good here
okay how do you read now jack
0mni
yes were on
hello houston aquarius
back on yes
aquarius houston youre watching the middle gimbal there arent you go ahead aquarius
okay go ahead with the breakers first jack
okay you watching your middle gimbal there
tell them we are
your attitude is just straight pitch down jim okay you re moving away
okay fred ive got six circuit breakers for you
okay go ahead
okay theyre all on panel 11 row 1 under ac bus b open helium pqgs for propellant display
its open
on row 2 flight displays open thrust open mission timer open rangerange rate altitude altitude rate and open the ac bus a range rate altitudealtitude rate
theyre open
okay theyre all open
okay on row 4 pgns signal strength display
its open
its open
okay that concludes the powerdown of displays and i have a ps0 pad for you
okay go ahead
okay the purpose is a pericynthion plus 2 hours dps abort noun 33 079252648 plus 16330 minus 00145 minus 07515 apogee not applicable perigee is plus 00205 17977 8b5 268 264 plus 16410 minus 00145 minus 07338 coas is na and i have two gimbal trim angles for you which will be updated right now however we want you to go with pitch 586 roll 675 over
what was that for
pitch and yaw maybe huh
okay what was the last two things you gave me a pitch and roll angle for what
thats for your dps trim
those were gimbal angles for  pitch and yaw
oh roger gdas
yes thats what i mean sorry 02 11 03 58  pericynthion plus 2  okay dps pericynthion plus 2 at 0792502648 plus 16330 minus 00145 minus 07515 ha n slash a hp plus 00205 17977 835 268 264 plus 16410 minus 00145 minus 07338  
did we lose the water in the  
  n slash a in the coas and you gave me gda angles of pitch 586 and you want roll 675
good readback fred
yes lose  get all the little bags you can with water
aquarius houston say again please
okay we didnt answer back there jack check to see if youre on vox
no
neither am i okay why the hell are we maneuver ing at all now are we still venting
well were at att hold for one thing  i mean were at minimum impulse
no i mean why cant you null them out somewhere
every time i try to  i cant take that doggone roll out i got to wait until they get around to the bellyband
wait a minute do you  you fight roll by using the ttca left right thats what you need to play with
okay well try that let me get around though lets roll let it roll all the way tap 08 pagl 200
yes you cant let it roll all the way
i know i know but i mean 
okay then until its upside down at least huh
yes
okay well should i ask him what the return time on that one is or are you interested
lets get the first things first
oh you dont want to hear let me figure some times out here thats at 79 and what are we at now about  do we  do we  do we even know any better computer time do we
no
hey jack do you still have a mission timer you dont okay
ill tell you what lets ask  lets ask houston to give us a mission timer computer time they can up link it to us okay hold it
go ahead
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
you know we dont have a  i dont think we have a computer clock going and why dont you up link that stuff to us
roger
and fredo i got some fast circuit breakers on panel 16 for you
okay go ahead
okay on row i under flight displays systens engineer s crosspointer open under rcs b  
its open
open the temppress displayflags and pqgsdisplays tape 109 02 11 08 10 j okay lhyrboth open
okay fred on row 3 under comm open displays and under ecs open displays
okay comm displays ecs displays both open
okay and two more in row 4 under heaters open displays and under eps open displays
okay heaters display eps display open and ive long since had all the lights off floods et cetera
where are those bags where are those bags for weighing water in the plss
why
were going to fill up command module water well 
hell do you need a qd  jim no way to get ours in there i dont think
hey jim
i wonder if one of our water  jet is okay lets control  what else can we fill up there
aquarius houston
were not  were not going to  
were not going to be able to up link your time because of the iu and we have a frequency problem there but what id like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the dsky from there over
okay stand by
wait a minute why do we need a mission timer right now anyway i mean that bad theyd tell us
well id rather have a timer going so that we  what are we going to put in the dsky should we shut down the mission timer 02 11 10 37 i2p is that what you want to do
yes hey omni 02 11 10 43  great
switch them okay lets fire on the mission timer
aquarius we need forward 0mni
forward omni
say again jack
forward omni
i am okay houston if that call was an omni switch i m in forward now
okay fredo how do i get the mission timer up i got the mission timer cranked in
you got it on
i got the mission timer circuit breaker in
okay were going to probably need numerics lighting there you go you got it
aquarius houston i think weve got a better way of getting your mission time up
go ahead with it
okay we can do a verb 55 enter and then put an r1 minus 00088 in r2 minus 00059 r3 minus 03274
watch the crapping attitude
were okay
god damn i wish youd get to something i know
well as soon as we get over here well stop it with the ttca
okay
and aquarius houston weve got you both on vox pat 203
likc to go whal
you want us on vox jack
we have you on vox were reading you loud and clear and the clock took good
okay looks like were on the fda route there jack
okay jack how do you read me on normal voice now
reading you 5 square fred
okay
and aquarius were ready for a verb 74 when you can give it to us
you got it
okay and one other thing we noticed when you pressurized the rcs we got an increase in pres sure in the ascent tanks and so we want to have you veri that the ascent feeds are closed in order to do that on panel ll close the ascent feed i and 2 circuit breakers on  and cycle the parker valves and then open the ascent feed circuit breakers on panel ll
completed houston
okay jim thank you
and jack aquarius what kind of return time is this maneuver given
that puts you back in the water at 133 hours
133 hey
affirm
and thats an atlantic landing site
atlantic landing
affirmative thats the pad that weve given you but we may change our mind later on we want you to have this info for now and thats a minimum  
okay
  minimn time returr
aquarius hourton weve got to change the refsmmat to the one to which youre alined so wed like to have po0 and data and well ship that up to you
roger
okay you got it jack
roger coming up
aquarius could you give us data please
okay jack you got it
  the updata link the dua breaker may not be in jack
okay fred and close the dua breaker
its in now jack
okay jim and its coming up now thank you
aquarius houston were finished with the uplink the computer ts yours wed like to power down the dua so pull the dua circuit breaker please
okay updata link breaker ts coming open
aquarius houston wed like to have apt omni and were going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking and our latest data shows that your closest approach to the moon is going to be 60 miles perigee over
okay closest approach 60 miles and im sitting on a omni now
roger well probably be going off the air here in about a minute
houston aquarius over
go ahead aquarius 02 il 41 19 cdr okay were thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch were thinking about rigging up the urino dap to the side hatch and say urin hoater powor what do you think
stand by 1
better still so we wont freeze up our urine dump
roger that sounds like a good plan jim why dont you go ahead with that one
okay aquarius and down here were getting re grouped trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for ptc and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan and so forth and as soon as we get all that in formation well pass it up to you we also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window so if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alinement out the window why let us know
okay jack right now were not able to the sunlights reflecting off the thrusters and what ever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us such that the stars are hard to find and why  what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window  just to check the lms run is that correct
thats affirmative wed like to correlate the information we get with yours so that if we can use it to update the platform we can what were really trying to do jim is see if we can do a coas aline so we can power down the platform
that is aquarius were getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now and were not reading you at all
i have good signal strength and im on aft omni
how do you read now aquarius
hey jim do you suppose that you could orient the lm so that the service module would be be tween you and the sun i believe you could see  recognize constellations out your front windows then
aquarius houston radio check
okay jack how do you read now
okay hearing you 5 square now jim and the question we have is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the service module is be tween the lm and the sun so you can recognize constellations out the window and secondly can you see anything out the aot
aquarius houston how do you read
aquarius how do you read me now
aquarius houston how do you read
aquarius request forward omni please
aquarius houston request forward omni how do you read
okay houston aquarius how do you read
hello there aquarius loud and clear how do you read me
theres an awful lot of background  
we get a lot of background static jack youre down in the mud you having a ground problem
what we tried to do was to get the iu frequency shifted off a little bit so that wed have less interference i think itll come up  what we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen over and re quest forward omni
youre unreadable jack weve got our signal strength meter  right now it keeps wavering up and down and the best im getting is about 24 agc
roger request forward omni
i am on forward omni ive been on forward omni
okay how do you read jack
im hearing you 5 square fred how me
aquarium loui on how do you ready
okay were up to about 26 agc now
aqawius houston radio check
okay every time you transmit jack the agc starts to drop off and the static level turns up
okay fred youre loud and clear
i wish you were
fred go to descent 02 
descent 02  roger
hello houston aquarius
hello there aquarius how do you read me now
hello houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
okay thats the first clear word we heard from you jack do you think it could be my pitch attitude thats breaking up your incoming i guess youve been hearing us
we have been hearing you and the problem is on the ground i hope we have it corrected now
okay that sounds good
were considering powering down the pgns but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine aline we read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good how about out the aot
hes looking now
okay and the other thing we thought you might try is to put the service module between you and the sun and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude 02 12 05 4b cc the reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on apollo 10 it made the constellations all recognizable when we put the the service module  in our case a lm between us and the sun pagra208
af omni fred
youre down in the mud again jack it appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you
roger af 0mni
aquarius aft omni
okay youre down in the mud again jack lots of background static
aft omni aquarius
aquarius houston
okay houston aquarius how do you read apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription tape 41
aquarius houston how do you read
hello houston aquarius how do you read
hello there aquarius loud and clear how me now
okay were reading you loud and clear jack i hope it stays this time
okay wed like to brief you on what our plan is were at this time water critical in the lm so wed like to use as little as possible to do this were going to plan to make a free return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours which is 37 minutes from now then were going to power down the pgns and then well  at 79 hours well go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got but wed like to get that pgns powered down as soon as possible that would be after the midcourse and  so how do you feel about making a 16footpersecond burn in 37 minutes
well well give it a try jack if thats all weve got thats a 16footpersecond dps burn in 37 minutes
roger were working up a pad for it but wed want to know what you think about doing it at that time
well well do it could you give us a little bit more time
okay jim wed like to get a suggested time from you we can figure out a freereturn maneuver for any time you want to give us so if youll give us the time youd like to shoot for well figure out a pad
okay that sounds good i think if we have a little bit more time we want to do it right stand by 1
lets shoot for an hour if we can jack hows that
okay jim iwaboul 1 hmr and 0minute thats an hour and 5 from now
okay well do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn off right
affirm
okay in the interim jack i looked around again and i saw that we have a radar and a landing radar heater breaker in can i pull those out
affirmative pull them both out
and now we want to ask you a question about alinements and so forth we wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the aot we also wanted to know if you could use the service module to cast a shadow on the lm windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a ps1 coas alinement
okay in this attitude jack that were pitching around i cannot use the aot to see stars we  were just not able to see them at all now we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or  andor roll and see stars right now we havent been able to the aot is useless the command module structure is just radiating too much light into the  into the telescope
okay and how about using the service module to east a shadow on the commanders window if you do that can you see stars for a coas alinement
we could give that a try jack although i dont know how successful it will be we tried to do it  the light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars we do have the earth and the moon if that can be of assistance 02 12 27 18 iap another problem  right now jack im looking out the right window and its pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from  left over from some of the debris its hard to discern whats real and not real p413
okay thats good information and during the time that we see youre continuing to pitch if you ever get in a position where you think the aot might be of some use wetd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a p52
okay will do and also let me ask you a ques tion in this configuration docked we have to use the ttca to control pitch and roll and just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory we only have 60 miles to play with
roger well put that to them 02 12 28 45  okay jack are you ready to go to work with me on the 2hour dps activation and contingency hook page 17
roger were ready to go
okay item one we can  one through five we can scratch off as done is that correct
stand by l fred
okay fred lets go ahead step l page 1 everybodys listening 02 12 30 28 imp okay ive looked around and ive essentially done steps i through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights and i think well just do without those
roger your choice 02 12 30 47 imp okay on eps activation were through step  were through that  bottom of that page thats all done
we concur page 2
okay in essence weve circumvented step 4 and were not sitting with all 4 aps  descent bats on highvoltage taps so ill scratch off step 4
roger and in step 5 we want to leave inverter 1 circuit breaker open
roger in step 5 well leave inverter 1 cb open
omit step 6 02 12 31 53  okay for the time being our mission timer is the computer so mission timer activation scratch off
roger 02 12 32 09 i24p okay weve done the primary glycol loop activation
we verify it
aquarius we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3 02 12 32 37 hmp okay i was going to say that next page 3 well just scratch item 1 and item 2 ive already got the rcs heaters on and i dontt know if i gave you the time or you got the time on the primary evap flow number 1 open
we got the time 02 12 33 t0 lmp okay lets go to the cb pages now
fredo did you close the engine control breaker in panel 117
what control is that jack
did you close the s and c engine control breaker on panel 117 as we got step 1 there on page 3
okay okay yes the eps descent eca control breaker is closed on ll
roger and how about the  on panel ll s and c engine control closed aft omni fred
okay were aft omni and we have the s and c engine control breaker closed
roger lets go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout 02 12 34 34 mp okay ill just give you  i think itll be easier to give you what i got in okay in the top row on 11 we have the four ac bus tie breakers in and the ac bus volts breaker in and thats it second row we have the four tca breakers in we have the gasta under flight displays and commanders fdai and likewise under ac bus a we have a gasta and a commander fdai breaker in thats it on row 3 we have a signal conditioner 1 we have the atca pgns we have the engine control breaker attitude direct control breaker and the  under lighting anundockcomponent breaker in and one other ed logic power a  ed logic power a is also in
copy
okay under the fourth  fourth row we got all the quad heater breakers in suit fan 1 under ecs glycol i and 2 and under comm we have commander audio in and pgnss lgcdsky imu standby imu operate and thats it okay in the bottom row eps we have the bat feed tie both in and we have the cross tie balance loads in the x lunar bus tie descent eca control descent eca and the dc bus volts breaker
roger we copy  
that completes it for panel ll okay stand by okay 02 12 36 54  as i see it some of the short ones are  we need the deca gimbal in sooner or later
thats affirmed close the deca gimbal
and probably  okay deca gimbal and sooner or later were going to need deca power i guess also
all right deca power will come up later in the procedure fredo
okay
aquarius houston on your circuit breaker checklist on panel 11 and 16 we want you to configure the panels as outlined in the checklist pae 214 02 12 38 57  okay you want us to configure as per checklist okay well do that
thats right close the black ones and open the white ones 02 12 39 12  yes i think we can manage that
with the activation power up were starting right now
houston we might as well leave our rcs tcas in right
affirmative jim leave your rcs tcas in   02 12 40 26 imp check that  
  on panel 11 02 12 40 30    yes i used my pentel pen and made those white ones black ones
roger same on 16 fred
roger
and you might look there houston to see what circuit breakers arent required like the tape recorder
were looking
okay jim on panel 11 over there you can also leave open the rendezvous heater breaker and the landing radar heater breaker in addition to the tape recorder
theyre out 02 12 42 04  im leaving a few in jack too like the suit fan 1 is still in rcs syst is still in the tcas attitude direct control is in
roger
how about if i leave the vhf a and b off
switch to forward omni ap417
okay we can leave the vhf powered down too
and do you want the secondary sband
negative on secondary sband leave them open
up data link is in do you want that in or out
leave the up data link open well call for it when we want you to put it in
okay jack on panel 11 on the top row do you really want the propulsion pqgs and ascent helium regs in 02 12 44 54 imp and also the syst4 engineer x pointer breaker
roger negative on the pqgs negative on the ascent helium reg and negative on the cross pointer
okay on the second row im going to leave the floodlight breaker open
concur 02 12 45 31 i24p and were again up to  do you want the cwea enabled
negative on the cwea
okay
okay since were  are we going to power up the ags or should i concern myself with the atca breaker
negative on the ags however fred we need the atca breaker in 02 12 46 28 imp okay atca breakers in yes i guess for the backup power supply hey how about atca ags
negative on atca ags
and im leaving the suit flow control breaker open
lets close the suit flow control breaker   rape418
and now 
  so it doesnt take any current
okay without suits it doesnt do us much good either though 02 12 47 52 i24p okay and are we going to continue to be able to operate off the omnis jack so can i leave the sband antenna powered down
okay fredo we dont plan to use the steerable antenna although we want to leave the heaters on so it looks you ought to open up comm sband antenna but leave sband antenna heaters closed 02 12 48 33  roger comm sband is open sband heater breaker is still closed
and on the bottom row jack im going to leave the heater display breaker out which we had pulled before and eps display but i question do we want the ascent eca breaker in as pres cribed
stand by thats a negative on the ascent eca breaker leave it open
ld aquarius we need po0 and data  
and thats a  
  and well give you state vector and target load
okay we need the up link breaker in then now
thats affirmative
okay and jack will you give us that  how about the ordeal breaker can i pull that we dont need that do we 02 12 50 32 cc negative on the ordeal leave it open 02 12 50 48  and how about the ascent eca breaker on panel 117 jim has it in over there
and panel ll ascent eca can be open
its open
okay aquarius were go on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now
roger
and aquarius tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the pgns dap hold your attitude for you it will
okay very well
and jack because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude i think we ought to think about going there very shortly
roger i have a pad for you i have a p30 maneuver pad
roger stand by
 
go right ahead jack
okay we want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the load we havent completed it yet are you ready to copy p30 maneuver pad
thats affirm
okay here we go the purpose is mideourse correction for free return noun 33 061294284 minus 00213 plus 00041 minus 00312 ha and hp are na deltav 00380 031 120 298 minus 00213 plus 00041 minus 00312 coas na and i have your lm gda angles pitch 586 roll 675 your dps throttling 5 seconds at 10 percent burn the rest at 40 percent your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds
okay jack we have a p30 maneuver pad a mid course for free return noun 33 061294284 minus 00213 plus 0041 minus 00312 ha and hp na deltav r 00380 031 120 298 minus 00213 plus 00041 minus 00312 coas na gda angles pitch 586 roll 675 dps throttle 5 seconds at 10 percent burn the rest at 40 per cent and we need a twojet 10second ullage
thats a good readback fred id like to verify however in noun 81 in vy its plus three balls 41 02 12 56 14 imp okay noun 81 vy is plus 00041
good readback lets press on with the checklist
okay and jack find out about using ttca to maneuver with
okay were finished with the computer its yours and we recommend using the ttca to maneuver with
roger 02 12 56 43  okay im back on the checklist page 6 jack under pgns turnon and selftest weve done everything except the self test here on this page do you want to do that at this time
okay aquarius negative on the pgns self test 02 12 57 37 imp okay ill scratch page 6 and on page 7 were not going to activate the  or rather we had the sband activated ecs activation i have all done and at the bottom of the page the docked imu coarse aline is done
roger 02 12 58 14 iip wetve  okay weve also completed i guess in essence all of page 8
thats affirmative and page 9 to boot scratch vhf weve done the t ephems 
okay youve updated it thats right we cranked in the time
and houston lets go to activation  or get into page 10 and see what we did there
okay the only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear
okay well do that now
okay the landing gear are down and locked jack and looking ahead now at page 11 weve done all of that
we verify that page 12
okay and i assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up we got a refsmmat and state vector is that correct
thats affirmative youve got that so you can delete page 12
hey on 13 youve read us up the fine aline angles and weve cranked those in
affirmative
okay so now were up to  weve got to do dap set the gimbalthrottle test
thats  okay aquarius we recommend omitting the dap set gimbalthrottle test  just make sure the gim  deca power and deca gimbal cir cuit breakers are closed 02 13 01 33 imp okay were going to proceed now with the dap set gimbalthrottle test is that correct or did you say delete it
aquarius delete the dap set gimbalthrottle test just ensure that the deca power and the deca gimbal are closed
okay houston deca power is open at this time do you want me to close it
affirmative jim close the deca power
its closed we deleted that
okay also out of that list jack we need the commanders throttle set to throttle and min 02 13 02 58  houston if i recall the launch set of the gimbals the gdas are not correct here and where are we going to get those set for the burn
stand by 1
okay heres the word on the dap set gimbal throttle test lets do step 1 and step 2 and thatll get our gimbal set
roger 02 13 04 20 mp okay jack were going to have to back up on this if were going to follow the procedure here which has us go mode control pgns auto were going to have to pull the tca breakers to keep from firing jets
stand by fred
stand by on step l fred were getting the word for you how do you like this sim
its a beauty
okay aquarius we recommend you do the dap set and gimbalthrottle test as per the checklist go pgns auto and proceed
well were going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to auto because weve got those thrusters in  the thruster circuit breakers do you want us to do that and stop
okay aquarius were recommending you go to auto let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed with the test
were in pgns auto
roger your dap is set youre in wide deadband that ought to do the trick
roger
okay were looking at it aquarius were ready to proceed with the test 02 13 07 26 imp okay were proceeding 02 13 07 52  okay and houston you  youre looking at the weights now those are still good right
youre go on the weights
aquarius houston wed like you to recycle on the dap load and change your dap to 52021 over
okay aquarius were looking at your gimbal and we notice that we got a fourjet ullage loaded in the dap and we gave you two jets on the pad but lets go with what weve got loaded itll be a fourjet ullage
okay
okay houston how does the gdas look now
the gdas are go as they are press on
okay houston were going to do the dps pressurization and checkout
stand by 1
okay your gimbals are within 03 and were ready for the dps pressurization and checkout
okay houston do you want to follow up on page 15 with rcs checkout in essence weve kind of already done that
youre right aquarius lets delete the rcs checkout and a dps looks go
houston were going to do a pgns auto maneuver to the attitude
stand by on that aquarius we recommend driving it around there manually with a ttca
okay well have to use the ttca roger
were going to auto now houston to try to damp the rates were at the attitude
roger jim we verify the attitude
roger
and houston wed like to confirm do you want the verb 65 enter in there
affirmative on the verb 65 02 13 23 49 p okay
okay jack i got another question on page 18 at 1 minute i concur with master arm on but i wonder why i have to have the abort stage breaker in we sure dont want any staging now
aquarius delete the abort stage circuit breaker close leave it open 02 13 24 46  roger will delete 02 13 24 55  okay also jack since we have fourjet ullage versus two do you want  still want l0 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now
okay aquarius well use automatic ullage
okay well just let the 712second auto ullage do it
roger and wed like tc do this in manual throttle so on page 17 about twothirds of the way down throttle control manual vice auto 02 13 25 35  okay were set to manual
whats the 203  
enter on the 203 jim
weve got 203 in the dsky now and it looks as though it requires work can we pass it
aquarius enter on the 203
wait a minute
aquarius wed like to verify that your throttle is in the min position
thats affirm
and in the event that you have to do a manual takeover turn the engine gimbal off mode control to attitude hold and use the hand  use the ttca
roger
okay 1 plus 30 to burn 02 lj 28 20 cc roger 02 13 28 45 ia okay master arms on 1 minute
roger aquarius youre go for the burn
40 percent
okay aquarius youre looking good
auto shutdown 02 13 30 40 imp okay youre looking at 1685 now jack
okay youre go in the residuals proceed
okay when you say go on the residuals you mean dont trim them is that right
thats affirmative no trim required
roger 02 13 31 08  okay
aquarius check your master arm off please
okay houston burns complete now we have to talk about powerdown and what do you want us to do with the pgns
roger were looking at that right now and youll be the first one to get the word
and houston its doubtful right now whether well be able to see the stars in this configura tion the only way we could possibly get aline ment is with the earth and the terminator or the moon and its terminator and id sure like to have you look at a powerdown  keeping the pgns if at all possible
roger jim well get the word for you
and houston were in an att hold mode can we turn off the buses
stand by on that one jim tape lll
okay aquarius were working on whats going to happen next in the meantime wed like to take some highpower items off the line so on panel ll open deca power and open deca gimbal on 16 open the atca breaker
okay on 11 we got deca power deca gimbal open on 16 we got the atca breaker open
and houston while youre thinking see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the command module optics with manual drive to perhaps look for stars
roger
and jack aquarius while youre thinking  before we had our comm problems we were wanting to know what to  whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system so we wouldnt freeze up the normal urine dump system
roger we gave you a go on that earlier sorry you must have missed it use the side hatch for urine dump
okay
and how are the stars out the window now
well ill look again jack but at this attitude the sun is reflecting off of  off of quad 4 so bright that its ruining any night vision and we still got particles floating around us ill have to take a long look and see if i can see any star patterns
roger and aquarius were going to have to hand you over to a different site now and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the sband transmitterreceiver and bring it back up in 5 minutes you copy
okay stand by 1
okay i understand you want us to turn off the sband transmitterreceiver and bring it up in 5 minutes is that correct
thats affirmative
tell us when
and you want us to maintain attitude control
affirmative on the attitude control
thats auto attitude control okay you main tain auto attitude control
okay jack im back on the line now on the sband you want me to turn off the transmitter receiver and the power amps are off for 5 mnutes is that  when you give me the word  is that what you want
aquarius leave the power amplifier the way it is turn the transmitterreceiver off for 5 minutes now 02 13 44 19  okay you tell me  you tell me when
okay turn it off now see you in 5 minutes 02 13 44 26  okay its gone off its gone off for 5 minutes apoiii  3 atrtp rouii voice transcripton
aquarius houston how do you read
okay youre loud and clear there jack
roger same here were  were still discussing the next move
i figured it lets just make it a good one
were looking real close at water usage profiles and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the imu powered up and powering down the lgc but well have more word for you shortly and we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch we recommend you dont make any urine dumps if you can help it because itll make the debris problem worse than it is now and we have some items that you might want to transfer to the lm some towels some penlights fecal bags uts and do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the mcxnent
okay stand by on your latter list there jack i understand no urine dumps i guess well work through the ucd and all the bags we got and real quick there can you give a dap load that we want in here now to conserve the rcs
okay for attitude control coordinates were recommending manual control verb 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle your dap load that you have now looks good
okay its att hold verb 76 for the guy on watch and the dap load we got right now is okay
aquarius our decision for the time is to leave the imu powered up power down the lgc and power down other nonessential items well be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it over
okay the decision is to keep the platform power down the computer and well be standing by for further word on the powerdown jack
roger iap 4 pa6 227
and aquarius for your information we now have 136mile perigee confirmed by doppler
okay 136mile perigee now thats very nice
oh wait a minute jack did you say pericynthion or perigee
i meant pericynthion
ah thats better
and houston we pulled out your updata link circuit breaker so if you want to update it for anything let us know and well put it back in
roger jim we will
aquarius aft omni please
aft omni
houston do you read apollo 137
this is houston go ahead reading you weakly
okay jack we dont want to bug you but you ought to be thinking  or what your thoughts are concerning what the next burn will be i got to figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule and just how we can meet the next maneuver
roger were getting you a flight plan update were still computing on your next burn and were getting ready to give you a procedure for powerdown
aquarius one idea on managing the omni antennas it might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the uplink squelch and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise over
roger will do
okay aquarius heres what were going to do wed like you to point the lm xaxis either north or south thats the positive xaxis it appears to us that it would be closer to orient the lm plus xaxis toward the south do that with the lgc powered up using the ttca after that we propose to power down the lgc to save some power however this means that we lose the use of the ttca and well have to control the spacecraft with the hand controller in the direct mode request your  your position on these two items
aquarius houston how do you read
okay jack understand you want us to point the lm x  plus xaxis to the south using the ttcas with the lgc powered up then by powering down the lgc well lose a ttca i wasnt too successful in controlling the spacecraft in at titude only but i might be able to keep it out of gimbal lock
thats affirmative jim wed keep your ball powered up and go to direct on the hand controller and maintain attitude in a direct position
okay understand and do you want some sort of a ptc mode jack
affirmative well take whatever ptc mode you can set up jim
okay and since you know our approximate attitude how about just getting me something to find you on the dsky for a southerly plus xdirection
roger stand by 1
and one other question houston when you say power down the dsky or the lgc do you mean going into 06 or multiple circuit breaker
stand by on powering down the dsky jim well give you the procedure for that the procedure that we   02 1130 57 cdr okay
  the procedure that we have is listed in several places its in the contingency checklist under power down on page 1 second paragraph
and well give you that word when we want you to do that thats lgc only not to power down the imu but wed like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word over lac 424 fage 229
understand
and aquarius while were working on this we have a proposed flight plan update for your work ing and resting cycles and  you ready to copy
okay do you want me to write this in the flight plan per se jack
you can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper this is pretty easy
okay go ahead we got a lot of scratch paper
okay were suggesting that the lmp rest while the cmp and cdr are awake lmp ought to hit the sack at about 63 hours coming up in 25 minutes and you get to rest for 6 hours you get up at 69 hours at 70 hours the commander and the command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until 76 hours around 70  7612 to 77 hours well do a ps1 and a 52 at 7830 well load p30 and aline ags to pgns our ignition time for a second burn will be presently 7925265 and well have a pad for you shortly we suggest that all of you eat after the burn thatll be 81 to 82 hours let the cmp and cdr eat while you are sleeping and that you grab a bite as soon as you can over
okay jack as i read that the lmp is to go to sleep at 6300 for about 6 hours during that period the cdr and cmp should try to get a bite to eat im to awake at 69 hours cdr and cmp sleep at 70 hours and they are to awake at 76 hours and we should plan on doing our ps1 p52 at 76 hours or 7630 at 7830 were going to load a p30 and aline ags to pgns second maneuver is to take place at 7925265 for ignition time then were all to eat at 81 to 82 hours
okay with a minor modification your p51 p52 will be about 77 hours and thats the period of darkness and the commander and the cmp ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours and you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up we have left an hour in there where everybody is awake together to talk things over go ahead 02 14 38 4 lmp okay ill eat after i wake up between 69 and 70 02 14 f5 cc ali rikht we have additional   02 14 38 55    and ive got the correction to p  
go ahead fred
yes we got the word the p51 p52 is going to be done around 77 hours while were in darkness
thats affirmative and we have a workrest cycle laid out for further on which we can relay to you later 02 14 39 22  okay
okay and houston you have advice on what attitude you want me to go to
okay thatll be the next bit of information ill get that for you jim
okay
and aquarius just to get you thinking in that direction weve run a fairly thorough analysis and weve found out that its going to be cheaper to keep the lgc and the dsky up and turn the inverter and the ball off its going to save us 1 amp and also some water so it looks like what were going to do and well have to monitor the middle gimbal angle and well get the procedure on that and itll also be an easier control mode where well be able to use the ttca through the  through the dap
that sounds great jack
aquarius houston weve got a procedure for you ready to copy
ready to copy
okay its pretty easy we see youve already got verb 16 noun 20 called up there and so we want you to in maneuver and pgns attitude hold use the ttca we want you to on the commanders ball pitch to 2675 and yaw to minus 45 and when you do this in verb 16 noun 20 on the dsky you ought to read plus 00120 plus 26750 and plus 00450 go ahead
okay were to drive the commanders ball to a pitch of 2675 yaw minus 45 and we should have in 16 20 at that time plus 00120 plus 26750 plus 00450
thats a good readback well watch the maneuver
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
roger you didnt mention roll on the ball do you want roll zero
the roll ought to be plus 12 jim
roger
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
okay were just about there in pitch and in  middle gimbal angle but that other gimbal angle didnt look like it pulled the right way i tried both methods
yes i been looking at that too and were ask ing why and well get an answer for you
yes houston i wonder if youre accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here and ive gone through gasta
and fredo i know youre supposed to start sleeping here pretty soon but we got a new pc plus 2 pad p30 maneuver pad for you
stand by 02 15 05 32 lp okay go ahead jack
okay fred p30 maneuver purpose is pc plus 2 dps to this time were going to the mil and noun 33 079 27 4013 plus 08144 minus 00443 minus 02226 apogee is na perigee is plus 00205 08455 420 268 261 plus 08155 minus 00443 minus 02187 coas is na your gda ought to be okay as it is from the last burn but pitch ought to he at 585 in roll its 674 your ullage will be two jets for t0 seconds your dps throttle wibe 10 percent for 5 seconds 40 per cent or2 mconds and th remainder at full 1hroilland for your inlormationchiw put you in lhewater at 142 plus 47 over 02 15 07 46  okay dps pericynthion plus 2 into the mpl 079 27 4013 plus 08144 minus 00443 minus 00226 na plus 00205 08455 4 plus 20 268 261 plus 08155 minus 00443 minus 021 2187 na gda should be okay as is which hopefully is pitch 585 yaw 674 twojet ullage for 10 seconds the dps throttle 10 percent for 5 seconds 40 percent for 21 seconds 100 per cent for the rest of the burn and this should put us into the water at 142 plus 47
okay fred i have a correction in noun 81 deltav z is minus 02226 read back
okay deltav z in noun 81 is minus 02226
okay good readback 02 15 09 41 imp somehow that didnt add up with the deltav x to give a deltav r of that magnitude it seems like itd been bigger
okay well take another look at it fred
okay houston im not having too much luck hold ing this particular attitude
okay jim stand by 1
okay aquarius when you get her pretty much in attitude there and it looks like youre as close as we need to be wed like to try a control mode and see if it will work sort of a semiptc well leave the ball powered up for this and if this doesnt work why well have to revert to attitude hold mode but  stand by l please
wed like you to think about this control mode jim and see if you think it might work from what you know right now were a little skepti cal but wed like to put it to you so once you get in a pretty good attitude monitor in verb 16 noun 20 go to pgns minimum impulse verb 76 as we have and set up a yaw rate  yaw rate to the right monitor the middle gimbal on tape 42 pmge 233 r3 on the dsky and see if shell kind of stabilize out if not the only other suggestion weve got is to go to pgns attitude hold well keep the ball up until you make this evaluation
okay houston you cut out say again
okay whered you lose me jim
i lost you when you said try the control mode youre a little skeptical
okay from what you say we have to be a little skeptical of this proeedure but wed like to have you try it and have you evaluate it you can monitor the middle gimbal on r3 before we power down the ball we want you evaluation the next best choice is pgns attitude hold over
okay ill try it
okay go ahead with the control mode procedure
hello houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay im not  you i can monitor register 3 i can probably keep it out of   going into gimbal lock
roger how are pitch and roll
okay i think i can control the gimbal angles in 16 20 with the compressors the way they are but ill have to try miiimum impulse  just a minute
okay jack ive a question  one more question about odyssey
go ahead apoiio 3 airtoground voice trischiption
okay i still have the pyro a sequence a and pyro b sequence b circuit breakers in do you want those out
stand by 1
odyssey houston the two circuit breers you referred to leave them in
okay copy leave them in
okay houston i can control yaw in minimum impulse but stand by on pitch
and fredo the deltav r resultant computes with the components
freds off the comm now jack
roger your pad is good
and jack we didnt get that whole sentence there
okay i said that the deltav r that fred questioned computes well with the component  its rms
okay copy
okay now jack lets go over this once more you wanted me to try out control of the space craft in the pulse mode is that correct
thats affirmative set up a yaw rate and moni tor the middle gimbal angle
okay i can do that im not too sure whether i can control roll or pitch in pulse but i can control yaw in pulse  yaw in pulse on the ball
roger and remember were not going to have a ball there so that were going to be monitoring cdus on the dsky and if we get it off it will be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back to and well in addition have to control the omnis while were doing this
roger
without the ball i still have use of the ttca for control of the  angles
affirmative youll have the ttca for pitch and roll
okay i think i can do that without the ball and if you just give me the ttcas i think i can control the spacecraft using 16 20
im going to yaw right
okay jack i am now  the register 1 is in the decrease mode
and houston do you see anything wrong with this spacecraft motion
we have a data drop on right now jim well look at it as soon as it comes up
okay aquarius were going to dispense with this control mode wed like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had and well go pgns attitude hold and then weve got to get that ball off the line to save some power and then in order to keep even heating every 15 or 30 minutes well give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll  of yaw
okay you want me to go back to original attitude ill be going back to it now
okay houston aquarius im flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257 ill get near the bellyband in roll and yaw then ill go to pgns att hold
thats affirmative jim and then were going to have you go through a powerdown procedure
okay
and youll need verb 77 with att hold when you get there
will do
okay jack have i gotten your 360 on yaw and roll im going to go to att hold
roger and then we want to get the hall part down
okay stand by
okay im now in pgns att hold and are you reading my dsky angles
roger we see them
now you want me to power down the ball and if youll give me the procedure for that ill do it right away
okay well buy what youve got on the dsky there and wed just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure and in so doing well catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes so are you ready to start on panel 117
roger jack will copy and ill do the work
okay panel 11 top row open all the circuit breakers
all circuit breakers on top row coming open
theyre all open top row
okay second row close the first six on the left through the isol valve and open all to the right of that
okay first six on the left are closed  thats through the isol valve but i opened up every one from there on
okay third row open up the next five  correction  open up the first five on the left close aot heater close sig conditioner 1 close attitude direct and open the rest on row three
do you want atca pgns open 1215 34 53 cc leave atca pgns closed four breakers on the third row must be closed aot heater sig con ditioner 1 and atca pgns attitude direct control our mistake good going
okay im opening up engine start override right now and that rows taken care of
okay on the fourth row open  from the left open the first five  correction  close the first five and open cabin fan 1 close the three glycol pump circuit breakers open all the comm breakers except for commanders audio close it ail the pgns breakers open  correc tion  open the first three pgns breakers close lgcdsky imu standby imu operate
thats complete jack
okay and eps close bat feed ties crosstie bal load and open the cross tie bus close the next three open ascent eca control ascent eca and inverter 1 close dc bus volt go ahead
thats complete jack panel 11 is configured
okay lets go over to panel 16 top row and starting from the left  open the first four
stand by jack
okay starting from the left open the first four
okay and close the isol valve keep your tca breakers closed close the crossfeed open the next two displays close the main sov and the propulsion breakers should all three be open
roger the main valves are closed and the display engine override logics coming open and the pqgs and asc he reg are open
thats affirmative the second row they should all be open except for three breakers under in strumentation close sig sensor pcmte and sig conditioner 2 over
roger do you want suit flow control open
engine arm coming open and asa i guess will be open is that correct h iill
we just got a change on that lets keep the asa closed
how about suit flow control and engine arm
okay jim suit flow control can be open and engine arm  engine arm open
okay t lets go to row 3
okay row 3 under comm open displays close se audio open vhf a transmitter and b receiver close the primary sband circuit breakers both of them open the sband antenna pmp closed tv open and all the rest of them open under ecs except c02 sensor closed
roger
okay under row 4 under heaters your rcs quad heaters should  four of them  be closed open displays open sband antenna open sequence camera under eps open displays close dc bus volt open inverter 2 open ascent eca control and ascent eca close descent eca descent eca control translunar bus tie close cross tie bal loads open cross tie bus close bat feed ties over
thats been completed jack
okay jim and weve already got a change to what we just told you under ecs close the cabin repress and insure that the asa breafr is closed under s and c
the asa breaker is closed but i closed the cabin repress
okay jim looks like what we have to do is  in order to maintain even heating we just have to yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments so well give you a call when its time to yaw 90 degrees
okay we have to yaw the machine as i understand it houston and youll give it to me in incre ments of 90 degrees
thats affirm
okay jim your present configuration has the following features we got the electrical buses cross tied through the bal idad circuit breakers and we have ao cabin repress one thing wed ke to do right now is to giw you an uplink so immediately we have to on pe2 11 close the updata link circuit breer go to po0 and data over
okay were going to po0 and data the circuit breaker is closed
houston aquarius did you say that you had a new pad for us to copy
jim i passed that newest pad that we have to fred about 30 minutes ago thats our latest its pc plus 2 and it begins with noun 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and 4013 seconds you got that one
okay weve got that one what kind of a att hold mode do you want us to do do you want us to do wide deadband i didnt  on the dap
jim the deadband is good the way it is its 5 degrees if you want to stay in it and stay in the pgns att hold mode
okay
two things jim we want you to know that theres some pretty big attitude errors in so if you go to auto the computer is going to try to crank you around and the other thing is dont drink water out of the lm
okay you might think about this you know we lost our oxygen pressure in the command module
aquarius were finished with the uplink the computer is yours and you can open the updata link circuit breaker
okay weve opened up the updata link and weve gone off of data and ive get 16 20 in the computer
roger jim i guess were going to just kind of perk away here now page 240
okay jack one more question about odyssey here
go ahead jack 02 5 52 50 cmp okay how about the service module 02 supply valve do you want that off
affirmative service module 02 supply off jack
okay on the way
and jim we see a program alarm in there we think its just got to do with pulling the updata link circuit breaker  uplink too fast
roger i dont see it should i reset
go ahead and reset jim
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
one thought that might occur here is that if we have low descent water pressure we might con sider taking the plss water and fill it in re verse if that works you might look at a procedure for that
thats a good thought let us bounce that around a little
okay jim thats a good thought and weve looked at that and it looks like thats feasible so if and when we need to do that we will
and something else jack when its time for me to make my 90degree yaw what i planned on doing was going to noun 76 hold and just pulse and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope that pitch and roll stay within the limit
roger it sounds like a good plan and you can use your ttca in min impulse to take care of pitch and roll
okay
aquarius houston we see ascent 02 tank num ber 2 building up again so wed like to use something out of it so turn on ascent 02 tank number 2 and turn off descent 02  02 16 o0 39 cih ilofr oper in up temt op ttmk rimnber  arid turnirl oft jnl
and aquarius houston were starting to thira about c02 buildup up in the command module there so weve got a recommendation and what were recommending is that you take the commanders hoses in the lm and put a cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to fasten those hoses so they blow up into the csm by extending them up through the tunnel as far as possible and well get some flow out the blue side circulate up and around the command module and to keep the co2 level down
roger were thinking of that too and one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the hose so weve got to get the commcable off somehow to get that  so well still have comm down here in the lm and you have the hose up there
houston were trying to extend that commanders hose by use of the vacuum hose
sounds like a good plan if you can work that out jim
aquarius if you can shake jack loose there ive got a  some procedures for him to write down
okay stand by 02 16 07 33 cml okay jack is this a long one
oh its about 12  15 lines its a matter of verifying some valves and so forth
okay go ahead
okay we want you to go in when you can and verify the following valves and leave them as we outline here repress package valve off emergency cabin pressure off direct 02 off demand reg off both water accumulators off main reg a and b open water glycol  correc tion  water and then glycol tank inlet and outlet both now if you want to get some water we recommend that you momentarily turn the surge tank on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and take out water as required over lae43
thats it jack and tmother note on taking water rifyou dont drain enough water so that  
say again aquarius
that wasnt us jack
okay one more note on the water jack if you dont bleed the pressure off when you  dont take enough water to bleed the pressure off completely the pressure thats left on there is going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours so its a small amount of oxygen but we might as well save it so if you want to eliminate that problem you could completely drain the pres sure off by putting the water in a water bag and saving it that way 02 16 10 36 cml okay thats a good idea
so thats the end of y  
what ill do  let me repeat  okay let me repeat it all back to you repress package valve off emergency cabin pressure off direct 02 off both the demand regs off both h20 accumu lators water glycol accumulators off main reg a and b open water and glycol tank inlet and outlet open for water momentarily pres surize the surge tank take out water as re quired youre recommending drain out all the water until i cant get any more water out of it in order to conserve the oxygen
okay we just want you to turn off the water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator over
okay these are the water accumulators on 382 right
thats affirm the accumulators on 382
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
roger jack were asking whether p51 and a p52 are required in the back side of the moon 02 16 36 cc i think so jim but stand by while i veriy it 07 6 38 23 cc aquarius llouston
go ahead
we think we know where the platform is jim the tracking looks real good from the last burn we feel just a p52 will be required
okay
joe has your continued tracking changed our pericynthion altitude any
stand by well get the latest on that jack
aquarius houston
go ahead
roger jack were still looking at 137 miles and dopplers confirming it we will have a good update after 67 hours
thats good i want to say you guys are doing real good work
so are you guys jack
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
okay jim weve come up with a comm recommen dation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier if it works and id like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver over
okay you can read up the steps
okay step 1 biomed off step 2 go to low bit rate step 3 go to downvoice backup step 4 power amp to prime step 5 panel 16 power amp circuit breaker open step 6 range function switch off read those back to me and then ill have a remark
okay biomed off low bit rate downvoie backup power amp to prime circuit breakers panel 16 power amp circuit breaker open range function switch off
okay and the note says that you should be able to hear us if we cant hear you in a couple of minutes you should close the power amp circuit breaker on panel 16 and we expect to save an amp or more on this it should work in the pres ent attitude when we go to the new yaw attitude were thinking about powering up the steerable leaving the power amp off and if we can get good comm in that mode well still save some power so if you concur why dont you go ahead
okay in this mode you should hear us  or we should hear you but if you cant hear us then we ought to close power amp circuit breaker again is that right
thats affirm well just run a little comm check after you get done and see how were doing
okay fine and if that all fails well go back to our original configuration
thats affirm
ail amps primary
power amps in primary
okay circuit breakers 16 power amp circuit breaker open comm power amp circuit breaker open
theres only one ready
range  switch off
it is off 
yes i think so yes thats off
 okay houston aquarius how do you read me
aquarius this is houston we read you with a lot  static how do you read us over o 152 03 cdr we read you with a lot of noise the noise seen to indicate  read you better
i didnt copy your last remark jim i heard that you had a lot of noise in the background also
okay houston aquarius how do you read us now
just the same jim youre readable but its very noisy aioiio i alltociouni voici iiatiiciitioii
okay we can still read you do you want us to remain in this configuration
stay there for the next miaute or two auyway jim while we evaluate it
okay ill tell you what we need jack try to get this squared away again we  see if you cant report the right procedures here  the procedures the whole works before we get all balled up here
yes okay you guessed it
ive come up with nothing here 02 16 54 47 imp  we can use
stand by for  give me   over on my side there my  
find anything back in there
no wait a minute
better get a  there a paper towel 
lets just check in here 
yes
 well we should have some around here somewhere
yes they are 
oh here they are 
why dont you put that right up there just like that is that all youve got on it there you go 02 16 58 01 i4p 
it sure stays on ill tell you that its built like a regular 
hey look out that lefthand window  i cant see a thing fage 247
well is there anything  done earlier
okay what we do here is 
 the command module
find the flight plan too while up there
okay why dont you recopy this procedure on page 442
we going to keep a log of all the procedures
we ought to copy down the ones that get water too  keep them all in one spot 02 17 ob 23 cc aquarius houston over 02 17 0b 29 cdr go ahead houston
okay speak slow because theres a lot of noise in the background have you completed your first 90degree yaw maneuver and if you havent we recommend it over
okay we have not we have not completed it we will start we want you to monitor the maneuver over
okay jim and i want to pass you up a short procedure for activating the sband steerable antenna which wed like you to do after you complete the 90degree yaw are you ready to copy over
ready to copy
okay first on panel 11 close the sband antenna circuit breaker then go to activation page 28 steerable antenna activation  
roger copy
  and complete steps 2 3 and 4 of activa tion 28 youll have to do a verb 64 to get the pitch and yaw angles and the last step is on panel 16 sband antenna heater circuit breaker to close over 02 17 05 0 cdr joe we didnt get all of that we just have complete steps 2 3 and 4 of activation and then 68 or 28
jim thats  
then do a verb 64 to get 
aquarius houston that procedure i just passed you please disregard it over
disregard it okay do you want me to start my yaw maneuver now and ill be yawing to my right oneway maneuver
roger right yaw is acceptable but wait 1 before you start the maneuver
roger
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay you are go to conaence the yaw maneuver if we dont have comm after you complete the yaw maneuver bring the power amplifier back on over
roger understand well start the yaw
okay
 277
theyre almost getting bigger and bigger jack its over here now
hey you got a list  off over here
ail that stuff 
 to do is put water in it
what do i turn that to
 yes  down to 270  age249
its jumping now
why dont you go raterate now before we 
were on the ascent tank too
houston aquarius did you call
negative houston we did not call how you reading us
get up front and turn that antenna 
and houston could you give us an approximate time to turn off the ascent 02 in case were losing point with you
roger jim and copying about half your words
roger houston wed like a time to go back to descent 02 in case we lose communications with you
jim houston thats affirmative you may go back to descent 02 over
roger going back now
copy that
were  upside down
yes
think well have any trouble getting that  with that  in there
probably not if everything holds together because we already made one burn
and the temperatures look good when you make a burn does that do something 
well jack this is going to be difficult
ill tell you well have to start thinking about  tape45
how about 
how about 
yes we got 
 once every hour
how about that  tank 
how much of that oxygen are you going to use for  02 17 30 30 lp we got  water glycol  off  need any more water  again
 out there
yes why dont we 
 out can you get that
 down there 
houston aquarius are you 
aquarius houston say again please 
roger we have a radio check at a new attitude
okay jim we copy the angles how are you receiving the voice now over
your voice is excellent
okay real good you aeclear we still have a lot of noise but if you talk slow i think we can manage
aquarius houston
this is aquarius go ahead
roger jim were trying to improve our comm down here wed like to try going function switch from down voice backup to voice over
 down voice backup  switch going from down voice backup to voice
roger that
how do you read now jim
aquarius houston request a short count over
aquarius houston were not reading you at all request you go back to down voice backup over
all right houston aquarius in down voice backup how do you read over
okay jim we read you now and youd better stay in this configuration
well  try 
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim since were in low bit rate now we cannot monitor the dsky for program alarms et cetera and we recommend that in order for you to do so on board you push in the following circuit breakers on panel 11 and panel 16 the anunciatordockcomponent circuit breakers that will allow you to monitor your dsky warning lights over
okay 
 off
roger houston would you say one more time  please
okay jim the circuit breakers are the anunciatordockcomponent circuit breakers on panel 11 third row far right under lighting and on panel 16 also under lighting second row third from the left over
roger houston we have those two circuit breakers  engaged
okay real good
houston aquarius
aquarius this is houston go ahead 02 17 1 2 cdr joe it appears that the best detent possibly to put the stars in the aot would be either number 2 or 4 the rendezvous radar antenna is now in the way you might think of a pro cedure to get rid of it with minimum power and then we maybe well be able to see stars in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent
okay jim i think i understood that the rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you would like a procedure to get it out of the way is that right
thats affirm at the proper time and with minimum power
roger understand well work that
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay jim we have a handover coming up on the hour thats in a minute and a half  the hour we would like you to turn the sband transmitterreceiver switch to off and 5 min utes later turn it back to primary over
okay houston shortly you want us to turn the sband transmitterreceiver to off 5 min utes later turn it back to primary
thats affirmative jim after the handover apparently they want to make sure that they lockup with you and not the iu
roger and let me know when you want me to turn it off
roger you can turn it off now
and houston when do you want me to turn that sband transmitterreceiver off
aquarius houston turn it off now
turning it off now
okay aquarius houston we have data back and i assume we have comm over 02 18 08 5 hh liouston ihis is aquarius le co is very very very noisy over
aquarius houston copy that its noisy on our end too stand by while we think about it
houston aquarius i am unable to  now 
jim houston i think you just called but i didnt copy you
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim recommend you push the power amplifier circuit breaker on panel 16 in over
roger power amplifier circuit breaker panel 16 going in 02 18 11 t6 cdr power amplifier circuit breaker is in
okay jim how is the comm now over
a lot of background noise let me turn off the squelch
okay youre quite a bit better
whenever i enable squelch i lose you over
roger stand by you are much better down link
look at noun 65
okay
okay jim this is houston we recommend that you set the function switch from downvoice backup to voice over
roger function switch going from downvoice backup to voice
okay jim hows the comm now
function switch  theres still a lot of background noise joe
okay well look at it some more your comm down to us is excellent now
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
the noise were experiencing is similar to what we had sometime before when you switched sta tions
roger jim inco is checking into what we can do about the noise it may be a problem with the new site
roger
aquarius houston is the noise any better now over
this is aquarius negative
roger apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription fage 255 02 18 33 34 cdh houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
roger will you let us know when you want us to yaw another 90 degrees right
will do jim stand by 1
okay jim were ready now to yaw another 90 degrees to the right
roger
aquarius houston
go ahead
we are going to try to improve the comm and telemetry by temporarily breaking lock and re acquiring you may hear some noise in your heads et
okay couldnt be any more noise than were getting now
right
hello houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay now that theres no noise you can give 
jim i didnt copy that your c04 is pretty good though how is it with us
good okay 02 18 k0 07 cdr houston do you want to reconfigure the down voice backup again
aquarius houston i dont think so at this time our voice is good now hows yours
ours is very good
okay why dont we stay where we are for a few minutes
okay houston aquarius were deadbanding in the new attitude
aquarius houston roger that and your comm is good
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim in order to save on an amp or 2 of power here wed like you to go to the down voice backup comm configuration which is pulling the power amd circuit breaker and going to down voice backup if we get into a comm problem all you have to do is reverse that configuration and it should be good again over
okay well go to down voice backiip and pull the power ampl circuit breaker and if we get into trouble well com back again
okay real fine and we estimate the next yaw maneuver should start at about 6802 over
okay could you give me that in minutes
i sure can thats going to be in 29 minutes from now jim
okay thank you
okay
okay houston were in down voice backup and the power amplifier is pulled
jim houston roger that you are readable through the noise how are we over
you are loud and clear
very good
yes i guess  at this time  out  con figuration  and we have to get 
okay what else do we have to 
okay
i guess theytre going to take 
well theres another good one 
 going off
no  we had battery power for a while we could 
its locked
i dont think that was 
 powered up 
 got one
 all powered down
 have to get 
 get our  are off
yes
 all three 
seems like  the burn 
 were going to have to do something to get all this water out of here
ill set up  before i turn the thing on
okay wll glthis thing 
yes
there you go
 this one
okay
thats right
thank you
ill wake you up
all right
coughing
about four 
okay
go ahead o2 19 59 19 cor 
 
yes
 over on the  apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
well im afraid this is going to be the last lunar mission for a long time 02 20 03 40 kmp  copy
are we in down voice backup  02 20 04 39 i24p yes
maybe it should reverse itself i think  02 20 08 31  
yes
 radio check
aquarius this is houston go ahead
maneuver complete
roger jim we show you on telemetry looks solid at the new attitude just by the way of information the latest tracking data shows the pericynthion to be holding somewhere above 136 miles and the pad you have is still good over
roger understand
okay and jm we wonder whether youve attempted to get drinking water out of the command module poti sic tank yet its  is that going all right or do you have any questions on it over
 do it at 169 hours
were all  do it at 169 hours  or 69 hours 02 20 32 32  i need a command module activation

okay jim we copied that first of all you want to go through the circuit by circuit breaker careful poweredup procedure for the next dps burn and were working on that secondly you want a procedure for powering the command module up again when you have to reenter it and power it up and were talking about that and working one up and well get both those for you 
roger
joe can you also get us an idea about how far out we can expect to make it on the command module batteries
okay jack it sounds as though we probably dont want to power up the command module before ei minus 2 hours that doesnt mean we cant start our procedure a good deal before that but we dont want to power it up much before ei minus 2 over
okay i was just thinking in case something  we had the sort of problem here about how we would go about getting in the command module  we need to power up  and  in order to make it back into earth
right jack its quite clear that were going to have to very carefully make up a full check list for you on that well do it
what theyre going to do is  power aquarius up 
oh well weve got to have something to  besides we can get rid of the i4  decide then what theyll do
my guess is what theyll do  well i guess aline the gdc  and get ems  02 20 1221 cm and  whavent even figured out yet thc  batteries have we
oh im sure we have
  hundred amperehours we had it figured out that we had 550 amperehours left 
 bigger than 133 hours  oh yes i guess  yes hes  the descent thursday afternoon he had it figured out that  for a splashdown at  number of hours  74 hours and weve figured out that we  i dont know how we arrived at this  but he added up all the 
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
roger jim we just thought of something namely that we probably should get the lithium hydroxide canisters out of the command module reasonably soon just to make certain that they dont stay in there and possibly swell up until theyd be hard to get out i wouldnt wake up fred for that but its something you should do possibly before you go to sleep
roger will do
okay
 fredo were 68 hours about and 46 min utes did you sleep good
 lithium hydroxide 
yes i think ill do that right now fredo get on the 
okay jack take the lithium hydroxide canisters out tie them down or something like that  command module and then get us some food 
how much time did you say these batteries had
 800 ampere 
aaah think ill get an aspirin  a couple of aspirin again  02 20 51 43 lp id like a couple of aspirin too 02 20 51 49 iamp well would you like some pictures
be sure you get all the water out you can 02 20 55 49 lp youre holding your attitude right now what time have you got to 
probably another 5 minutes
how much water in the 
what time was it when we powered up the lm do you recall 58 hours
how did the water come out
okay  thats another big  man if we have to start drinking water out of the  drink dmn near a gallon a day
im also figuring that when weve got to go back in there well  take the drogue and the food · back here  take these  put these back in there  02 21 12 53  hello houston how do you read 02 21 13 27 imp hello houston aquarius
aquarius houston did you  02 21 13 43 imp okay you hear me joe
oh not very good jack suggest that for com munication here we go to power amplifier circuit breaker in and function switch to voice 02 21 14 03 imp okay i didnt want to get through or anything i just wanted to check and see if we had you at all in this mode
oh yes we do have comm youtre extremely noisy but if you read loud and slow we can easily copy it d5114 25 41 okay joe i rad you loud  clear on this mode
roger we understand that it is strictly a downlink problem and you can stay in the down voice backup mode if you want if we get involved in conversation i think well want to go back to normal voice
how you doing jack
do you have an hour on your clock for 
joe this is aquarius wonder if you can give me the get time of initial powerup
fred houston understand youd like to know the get of your initial powerup is that correct
yes the second time in here
okay stand by
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay we dont have a percise time for the starting of that procedure yet we are working on it real hard it wont be for several hours and well pass it up to you just as soon as we get it over
okay and joe you want us to start a ptc maneu ver at this time
stand by and ill check
aquarius houston
go ahead
roger jim we would like the next yaw maneuver in about 6 minutes over
roger
okay
oh yes yes keep opening  open the jets slowly  keep working at it
is there some way that we could  water in the plss
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay our estimate is that we will start power ing up for the dps burn at about 76 hours elapsed which is about 634 hours from now
roger joe understand
okay joe about 76 hours or so and i guess you misunderstood my question was what was the get way back when when i first came across to the i21 and transferred to lampower how long have we been living on the lm now
oh roger stand by ill give you that yes i just didnt understand
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay the time of transfer to impower was 57 hours 11 minutes for your information we seem to be reasonably fat on power in fact we are looking at a procedure that we might recommend to you later on after the burn and so forth of powering up one of the command module main buses via the lm umbilical this would enable us possibly to charge up the command module batteries over
okay joe that sounds great i just thought that to pass the time id do a little backseat quarterbacking here
roger
hows the water doing apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
roger we request aft omni at this time over
aft 0mni
thats affirm
yes  is going to be 123 02 21 48 40  you mean youtre  12247
yes 02 21 49 06 i24p im trying to  this heater over here
yes ill  that
jim that spacecrafts looking pretty close a about 86 or 
well 
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay fred i have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours and  in order to get good comm for that and also in · order to give fido a few minutes of ranging i want to have you put the power amplifier circuit breaker in panel 16 in the voice function switch to voice and ranging jnction switch to ranging over
now im in normal voice and ranging is up
okay fred and youre loud and clear down hero now okay what were getting a procedure ready for you is to do an aot sun check at approximate ly 74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours that will be a detent 2 well have a detail pro cedure up shortly and it will include a rendezvous radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a p52 maneuver to the attitude its our feeling that if that checks out within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn without a subsequent p52 if its not within 1 degree we are working up an earthsun alinement procedure to aline the platform and well have that up to you later okay assuming that the sun check is okay we will then give you a star for a con fidence check on the back side when youre in the darkness well be updating a burn pad to you prior to los going around the moon well have another look at you after aos and well update the pad if required right now that update should be very small over 02 22 54 48  okay stand by 1
okay joe as i read that at 74 hours were going to do an a0t sun check at detent 2 which is going to require the rendezvous radar out of the way and we use p52 auto maneuver to get there or at least the angles out of that and if this passes within 1 degree youre saying the platform is okay for the maneuver and we wont need a subsequent p52 but even if it is okay youll give us a star which we can use for our check when were in darkness if this check flunks youll pass us on up then an earthmon aline procedure
okay fred thats correct except the aline procedure that wetre working on is an earthsun aline and other than that thats correct incidentally this tc plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900footpersecond maneuver and that it will get you back to the midpacific line at 142 hours 02 22 57 15 mp okay that was an earthsun check john were getting a little close to the moon now and the tc plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at midpac at about 142 hours
thats right
aquarius houston 02 23 05 19  go ahead joe
okv fred we got a good batch of ranging and now wed like you to reverse the configuration ranging to off voice function to down voice backup power amplifier circuit breaker out well be talking to you
down voice backup with the power amp breaker open now how do you read
we read you satisfactorily fred 02 23 05 53 ip okay 02 23 06 17 imp jim and jack are in the upstairs bedroom taking a nap now
i didnt know that was upstairs 02 23 06 34 imp rehave the first space station
laughter 02 23 09 04 iafp and houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
one other thing you might have somebody look at  i dont want to bother the guys upstairs  the drain hose that weve got in the command module i wonder if we can find out if it will plug into the plss and in which case we can keep transfer ring  later on at least  the command module water into the iavia the plss
okay fred youre almost up with us we are looking real hard at getting water from the command module waste tank into the plss using that hose and then dumping it from the plss into the lm ascent tank and we think it is feasible were checking it out to make sure 02 23 10 08 imp okay 02 23 10 29  okay i have time to do another maneuver here joe
okay fred let me verify that
fred houston that is verified you can go ahead with the yaw mneuver
roger apoli0 13 airtoground voice transcrifi
okay just made another maneuver we allowed for a little too much roll there i wonder if thats too much or should i try to take it out now that i got it stopped
fred this is houston  
twenty degrees roll left  yes all right go ahead
okay fred i didnt copy the beginning of your message
okay i  i was talking to jim there
sorry
aquarius houston over
go ahead joe
roger listen charlie duke wants to talk to you  to you about the a0t star check and so that we can have good comm id like to recon figure with the power amplifier circuit breaker in and the voice function switch to voice and while were at it wed like the ranging function switch to ranging over
okay
aquarius houston over 03 00 28 49 iap houston aquarius
roger fredo reading you  
okay houston aquarius go ahead
okay fredo reading you 5by the procedure im going to read up to you is a sun check for the  to see if were going to need an alinement or not if youll get out your gn dictionary and open it to p52 page 34 well start at the bottom over
okay stand by 1 03 00 29 32 iap sounds like you broke out charlie le 48
yes finally fredo ive no longer got the red spots
okay stand by aquarius well be back with you momentarily
okay
aquarius houston you ready with your gn dictionary over
okay im on page 34 now looking at p52
okay fredo at the bottom of the page we want step 1 on the flashing 0406 we want an option 3 and thatll pull us over to 6 and on the 5025 we want you to do the enter on the 5025 and thatll bring up flashing 0170 and load in ri 200 over
okay let me see if im with you we call up p52 and on the flashing 0406 we pr0 on a 3 refsmmat which leads us to a flashing 5025 we enter on that on the flashing 0170 we want to enter a 200
thats affirmative and after that you pro on that and you come up with a flashing 0688 and well have to load noun 88 and if youre ready to copy i have the sun halfunit vectors at 74 hours get over
okay go ahead
okay at sun halfunit vectors x ri is plus 045498 y plus 19024 z plus 08250 over
okay we pro on  after entering the 200 well get a flashing 0688 we then load the sun unit vectors for 74 hours which are ri plus 5  correction plus 45498 r2 plus 19024 r3 plus 08250
roger thats good fredo and thatll bring you to step 8 and you get a flashing 5018 when you pro on the noun 88 okay at 5018 we want to do an auto maneuver to  to the attitude so just do the  the pro with the guidance control pngs mode control pngs auto and we 11 take this attitude now thats going to put us at  at attitude for the sun check now were being a 14degree deadband in this program in a docked configuration so to help you out you could call verb 62 to get your needles  and it  when the needles go through zero or null out and  in that deadband  then you take a look in the aot and see how close the sun is and we want within plus or minus 1 degree over
okay so we pro on the noun 88 and we end up with a flashing 5018 and you want an auto maneuver here rather than using the ttca so we pro with guidance pngs mode control auto weve got a 14degree deadband with a verb 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and at that time i look through the aot and if its like apollo 11 sun check all weve got to have is the sun somewhere in the  out there somewhere on the sun as it passes is that correct
i think thats a little tight thats about a quarter degree we can go a little bit out of that stand by 1 fred well get you an answer on that one and also if youll stand by well give you a dap load for this maneuver over
okay well  youll give us a dap load
roger stand by
aquarius houston fredo on that  to pass that check the sun is at  will septend an arc of onehalf degree in the aot so you can be two diameters off and still pass the check over
okay its a half a degree and so we can be two sun diameters off and still pass
thats affirmative and we want you to maneuver with a dap of 02 of a degree a second over
okay you want us to use a dap of 02
okay that dap load fredo is 31120 over
okay 31120
roger now if we pass that check you can just terminate p52 right there and well give you an attitude to go to a burn attitude and from this we can get a star check if you dont pass wed like you to do an alinement at 75 hours and if youre ready to copy we have some sun halfunit vectors and some earth halfunit vectors at 75 hours over
stand by 1 charlie
okay go ahead for 75 hours  sun and earth halfunit vectors
roger first with the sun for x plus 45483 for y plus 19053 for zebra plus 08262 earth halfunit vector at 75 hours plus 32120 minus 34155 minus 17370 over
okay sun halfunit vectors ri plus 45483 r2 plus 19053 r3 plus 08262 earth halfunit vectors ri plus 32120 r2 minus 34155 r3 minus 17370
roger fredo good readback now on the earth we estimate it  if you have to do this alinement that the earth will be about a 2degree earth and itll be approximately threequarters lighted now to mark on the earth wed like you to take an imaginary line between the horns of the crescent and mark midway between the horns over
okay we got a 2degree earth thats three quarter lighted and were to imagine a line between the horns of the earth and mark right in the center of that line
thats affirmative now on  on this star check  correction the sun check fred at  on the 5018 i got some fdai angles for you if youre ready to copy over
okay youre talking about the check at 74 hours get right
roger okay at 74 hours when you start this meuver the 5018 should look like ri of 2703 degrees pitch r2 is 0903 and r3 of 2908 over
okay how about making those all five digit readouts read them again charlie
okay pardon me its 27030 09030 29080
okay the 5018 should look like ri plus 27030 r2 plus 09030 r3 plus 29080
roger thats good readback now we got one more procedure for you and right now we got the rendezvous radar stowed and we wont be able to see anything out of detent 2 so wed like you to position the radar to 0283 and we have a procedure for that and wed like you to do that right before you get the attitude over
okay stand by
okay go ahead
stand by apollo 13 airtoground voice traiscription
aquarius houston on those 5018 angles we had at 74 hours fred that was based on a verb 49 to this attitude and they will be incorrect for for the two axis maneuvers so you can just scratch them over
okay youre saying the angles you gave me for the 5018 that was for a verb 49 so they wont be good for the 5018 and we should scratch them
thatts affirmative okay if youre ready to copy ive got this rendezvous radar procedure over
okay go ahead
okay its about a 10stepper but real easy okay on cb 16 eps inverter 2 close cb 11 ac bus a bus tie inverter 2 close panel 14 verify inverter switch 2 cb 11 rendezvous radar 2 close rendezvous radar release rendezvous radar to lgc on panel 3 are you with me over

roger step 9 is a verb 44 step 10 cb 16 eps inverter 2 open over 03 00 48 53 i24p okay i got it
okay 03 00 48 57 imp do you want me to read it back now
i got one more for you youtll copy this and give me it all on the readback okay once you get the attitude and you want to use the  you want to get the a0t lamp we got to go cb 16 eps inverter 2 close cb 11 ac bus a a0t la close after the p52 you can open cb 16 eps inverter 2 and open cb 11 ac bus a aot lamp and ac bus a bus tie inverter 2 over 03 o0 50 01 imp okay stand by 1 03 00 51 10  okay lets see if i got it all for rendezvous radar parking first of all we want cb 16 eps inverter 2 closed cb 11 ac bus a bus tie inverter 2 closed then on panel 14 verify inverter 2 selected and cb 11 rendezvous radar 2 closed both breakers then we are to pull the rendezvous radar release handle on panel 3 we then want rendezvous radar to lgc a verb 41 noun 72 enter with plus all zips plus 28300 in registers 1 and 2 go on that then we monitor movement with the 16 72 after it gets parked cb 11 rendezvous radar 2 open followed by verb 44 enter and cb 16 eps inverter 2 open now when it comes time for the alinement to get an aot lamp cb 16 eps inverter 2 closed cb ll ac bus a aot lamp closed and after the alinement is completed at cb 16 eps inverter 2 open cb 11 ac bus a a0t lamp open cb 11 ac bus a bus tie inverter 2 open
good readbaek aquarius well  to get those needles on the verb 62 we got to power up the commanders fdai well have that procedure for you shortly over
okay
charlie jim here
roger go ahead
have you run a earth set alinement in the simula tor with a docked configuration
is the question have we run a  an alinement in the docked configuration that is affirmative
okay did you have any trouble controlling the vehicle and what techniques did you use
briefly to control pitch and roll use the ttca as weve practiced for yaw you can use the aca over
okay you have no special techniques going back and forth between the yaw and the x and y lines over
not right now jim dave scotts been running these things and well get them up to you shortly 0yer
okay
we think the alinements going to be okay so we dont have to do this p52 fullup alinement we think the check is going to be okay like to remind you since you are in att if check does not pass since you are in attitude for the sun that wed  we want the sun halfunit vectors first over
roger understand
0kay houston its been over an hour since we did our last ptc you want us to do another one now
stand by 1 over
aquarius houston wed like you to go ahead and yaw 90 for the ptc keep a close eye out on your middle gimbal angle youre about 30 degrees from gimhal lock and well call you an omni switch halfway through the maneuver over
roger
okay and houston aquarius you might know when youve had enough ranging so we can get the power amp back off again
roger fredo we got one more procedure and we can shut it down and thats to get the needles and the fdai for this maneuver that 5018 could take you to gimbal lock and we think its tape 4914 a good idea to power up the commanders ball weve got a fourstepper if youre ready to copy over 03 01 00 15 irp okay go ahead
okay verify that you got ac power in other words the inverter 2 selected and the bus tie inverter 2 ac bus a closed well be under flight displays gasta closed commander fdai closed on the ac bus a cbs gasta closed conbiander fdai closed over
okay its verify we have ac which is panel 16 inverter 2 closed cb inverter 2 closed then on panel ll under flight displays we want the gasta and the commanders fdai breakers closed also under panel ll ac bus a gasta and commanders fdai breakers closed
thats affirmative over
aquarius houston after the omni switch we would like you to get the ranging off the voice switch to down voice backup and the power amp cb on 16 open over 03 01 02 31 imp okay after the omni switch well get the power amp off and go back to down voice backup fta and the ranging off its your call
roger stand by
fredo we got about 2 minutes to the omni switch you can go ahead and power the ranging down and and the down voice backup and well give you a call on omni switch over 03 01 03 09 imp okay 03 01 03 19  how do you read aquarius now on down voice backup
roger aquarius we are reading you about the same about 2by 03 01 03 34 imp okay
aquarius houston select forward 0mni over 03 01 04 26 imp 
roger
do you read down there houston
apollo 13 houston we read you weakly go ahead
okay vance if buzz or neil are around you might ask them if they had to use the aot lamps to shoot the sun like they did on ll
well wheres the  03 01 09 34  right down below me here
fred breaking in youre very weak understand if buzz or nell are down here youd like to ask them if they used the aot lamp to what over
to see the sun vance it might be possible to see the reticle without even having the light on
oh i see see if its possible to see the reticle without the light on okay well make a check and one other thing you might move that rendezvous radar antenna to park any time now you can start any time you want
okay
 its out of the way
apollo 13 houston
go ahead vance
jim neil is here he advises that you will not need the lamp on for the sun check but that you will need it on for the earth check over
understand
okay lets park the radar are you ready
okay let me  first of all let me see how were doing here that s going down that s better that s coming up that s right let s  okay lets park the radar how  how long is it going to take 03 01 11 48 imp not too long okay inverter 2  here hold the light for me jim right here on the  panel hold it still  ac bus a bus tie
okay
ac bus a
okay 03 01 12 17 imp bus tie inverter 2
bus tie inverter 2 pro
okay panel 16 verify and select inverter 2
okay
okay on cb 11 give me the rendezvous radar breakers with 30second spread
okay  at 15 i 
okay  30 seconds
okay go ahead
right
okay thirty seconds ac breaker
okay got a big dip
okay reach up here and give me the  panel i
okay shes pulled
okay panel 3 check the lgc
lgc
okay give me a verb 41 noun 72
still going good right
okay and theyre all zips 28300
00 03 o1 13 56 imp go 03 01 13 57 imp  16 72 
its going now  signal light 03 01 14 15 imp right
 is running away docking light 03 01 14 26 imp what
command module docking light okay you got them theyre in
okay two rendezvous radar breakers pull them i 
cb 16 inverter 2 open
okay
you know that light on the command module 
apollo 13 houston over
 get that thing 
roger one correction we think that the cheapest way for you to maneuver to change attitude is with minimum pulse aca thats to do the star mark
we had  okay as soon as possible well get that star data  we can get to maneuver attitude by using ttca
roger
and just out of curiosity we got rid of the radar very nicely its hanging right in the middle of the  the forward digit is the docking light on the command module can you believe that i dont think it will hurt our sun check but itll sure make p52 
sorry jim but we are only reading you about lby 1 03 01 16 56 irp look at that big  out there
 out there
it looks like a piece of wrapping for  line
youre watching that right
its going to get smaller before it gets larger
okay i guess they can close it
okay did you read your figures  03 o1 22 06  yes
okay
okay  p22 whats our next time line 03 o1 22 50 irp about 7330 
did you get that or did he give it to you 03 01 23 58  he gave it to me
okay because i thought he said 2 degrees per second like to check on that 03 01 24 09 irp okay houston aquarius
go ahead fred
okay jim thinks he heard snething different than i copied on the dap load is register 1 supposed to be 311207
thats correct fred that was to be 31120
okay
okay
and houston how do you want us to 
 3 2 c and d 2 2 0  okay were at high bit rate
okay  give  a call
well they probably dcmt know what to do there
okay and houston vance
go ahead jim
just want to get a time check with you when do you want us to start powering up the ball we just got to out ptc attitude
understand youd like to know when to power up the 
we think to take about 15  
yes the ball inside the maneuver we think it will take us about 15 minutes to get there wed like you to confirm that
stand by 1
 god damn 
what would that take to use  use the command module or what to load the plss 
 lets see about l0 or ll 
when is that sun check time supposed to take place 03 01 31 32 i24p 74 hours 29 minutes 
okay houston aquarius id just like to do the little sun check do you want me to do it now
jim roger we just came up with a maneuver time of approximately 15 minutes so if you start any time between now and about the next 2 minutes it would get you into attitude by 7315 over
roger well start the maneuver at this time okay lets go
okay sps   
if we dont keep working well never develop it
 now power up your fdi
all right
okay give me 16  apparently  panel ll 
yes
 gasta
okay
and commander fdi
okay
and on your ha yaw right side lift main line  
okay
now  30 second  okay now lets get ready to run this back 
okay
okay deadband option
okay 
okay on this  vector okay r1 plus 45498  okay plus 190  plus 08256 okay now we show zips  okay verb 62 enter okay  and the main  in auto 
houston are you monitoring our p52 technique
  apollo 13  
roi1 yaw roll pitch and yaw
jim thats negative we dont have any data on you low bit rate
we dont have high bit rate
houston do you read aquarius
roger reading you fred go ahead
go ahead houston is reading you
houston aquarius
reading you loud and clear go ahead 0b 01 37 14 cdr are you monitoring our p52 technique
thats negative jim we do not have high bit rate data on you now over 0b 01 37 28 cdr okay thank you 03 01 37 b0 cc roger
and be advised vance that we are getting several echos in our comm downlink here
roger well check into it
 and  alinement 0b 01 38 04 cc apollo lb houston
go ahead houston 0b 01 38 12 cc jim request you give us high bit rate now we might be able to fix you up on the 120 antenna 0b 01 38 21 cdr okay high bit rate
roger
and zero zero zero
yes 0b 01 39 20 cc apollo 13 houston
go ahead
fred we cant lock up on your high bit rate request you go back low bit rate
hey we lost you there vance
roger advise we are not locking up on your high bit rate so you can go back low bit rate over
low bit rate
right here jim there it is looks like it 
i dont have all the confidence in the world in this earthsun p52
you know how many times i screwed up on my arithmetic
yes dont count your chickens before they hatch
listen im not
were  going to be two diameters out huh
yes
okay tell me what that technique is to get the lamp on in case i dont see it
theyll have to give you ac again and you punch in your breaker well lets see  ive still got hp on for the fdis so youre in business now all you need is the lamp breaker the ac bus a aot lamp breaker that is
let me know when these start going theres the sun give me the  give me the aot
okay
never mind i dont need it go ahead i got it never mind 03 o1 44 16  reticle brightness want it up got the reticle
i got the reticle 
 call it jack you can see it better
okay
 we got it a great big one
yes i show it about maybe a third of a diameter to the left
okay take a look
check your needles youre off in roll jim
pitch and yaw are in but wetre off in your roll needle better get that 
okay it brings it in say when
okay we got it i think we got it what diameter was it
yes its coming back in just a second
yes yawts coming back in
just about it
okay yaw is in 
what have you got
 upper right corner of the sun
weve got it
youre hot 
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius 0b 01 47 05 cdr okay it looks like the sun check passes
we understand it checks out were kind of glad to hear that 0b 01 47 17 cdr its not quite centered but its about a diameter a little bit less than a diameter just to one side
sounds good
now lets get the aot lamp on
oki jim
which  to get the aot lamp on
okay pull the  your aot lamp breaker
got it
okay and houston can we proceed with our powerdown now getting the ball back off and aot lamp et cetera ac secured
stand by on that one for a minute fred
  the ball  get back to  okay what wed like now i guess is the next attitude to go to vance and we will work on getting there while we still have the ball 0b 01 48 21 cc roger we copy
okay seventyfour hours 0b 01 49 14 lmp yes were not there yet really ive got ll minutes to check  out
yes bring your  down
get set keep  its better in here slow now 
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
jim in a moment we will have an attitude for you to go to and recommend that you keep your fdi up while maneuvering to that attitude after you get there then we will have you widen the dead band and eventually go into a ptc about the burn attitude
you were cut off slightly vance
roger we will have an attitude for you to maneuver to in a moment and you should leave your fdi up for that the attitude is as follows if you are ready to copy over
got the book
go ahead vance
okay this is fdai attitudes for the maneuver yaw 060 degrees pitch 083 degrees roll 272 de grees
lets not read that in the r1 r2 i dont want verb 69 twice i want verb 49 58gs so i can fly the needle
jim those are not verb 49 angles those are strictly fdai attitudes over
okay i understand vance its much easier if the ball is up to fly the needles that gives me a drift of verb 49 58g maneuver we could fly that manually
stand by well try to get you a verb 49 angle
flying on maneuvers
on that last check what did it look like
this is the first threeman lm weve had
apollo 13 houston
and vance which  what hack you got now on get
okay stand by on that fred first let me read up your verb 49 attitude if you are reazly to copy
go ahead
okay yaw 27100 pitch 35500 roll 33000 over
ask him if you keep it in auto maneuver there
okay verb 49 yaw plus 27100 pitch plus 35500 roll plus 33000 and do you think its cheaper to manually make that maneuver or take the 02 degree range and go in auto maneuver
fred were recommending auto maneuver over
okay auto maneuver and could you give me a get right now
okay i understand you want get of the burn stand by 1
thats negative vance what is you clock read ing right now 03 oi 58 14 cc okay when i give you a hack it will be 7359 and thats about 40 seconds away
okay i think we will make one last check there with the halfunit vectors for 74 hours before we leave this attitude
okay and i m going to calculate in the 2 sec onds in giving you the time hack coming up on 735900 when i give the mark okay stand by
mark
looked good
okay i understand you got it
you want me to proceed one more time on that jack
roger yes go ahead
oh its on its a center
thats it shes right on still okay i have too thats better than i expected
okay lets do a verb 74 and get out of here
if we can go to po0 okay im going to go to 
737100 roger 35500 plus 33000 
okay thats  
yaw pitch and roll
let me see no thats yaw pitch and  okay everythings  thats roll pitch and yaw 03 02 01 29  roll pitch and yaw
everything  yaw
the rolls going to be down here but the yaw will be off the bellyband  procedure or dont you have a procedure
roll pitch and yaw but drifts the one that would be gimbal lock if it wasnt for being off 
and houston i see that this maneuver gives us a roll of 27172 a pitch of 08301 is that what they gave us
this is houston please repeat
houston did you give us verb 49 in yaw pitch and roll or register 1 2 and 3
we gave it as yaw pitch and roll
okay we wrote it as roll pitch and yaw
okay jim we read it to you as yaw pitch and roll and we should have given it to you registers l 2 and 3 but we did not so register i is 33000 register 2 is 35500 and register 3 is 27100
okay vance register 1 will be 33000 register 2 35500 register 3 27100
hey fred stand by on that
okay plus 27100 okay stand by right now you can enter 
okay apollo 13 houston
go ahead
okay jim we sorted it out and it is correct the way we gave you the first time so r1 27100 and in the lm thats yaw r2 35500 and thats pitch r3 33000 and thats roll in the lm over
i agree with you okay 5018 its there and 5018 and thats what it will be okay
thats right thats verb 49
there are 25 25 enter
okay plus 27100 plus 35500 plus 33000
okay
so far were  what can we do about it
apollo 13 houston you better watch that middle gimbal over
roger were watching that middle gimbal we have as a roll 27172 our yaw is  thats register 3  3300 how did we get this
and apollo 13 we have a procedure for you describing how to widen the deadbaud to 5 de grees later on but stand by for that
apollo 13 youre heading for gimbal lock you better stop everything
yes were back in att hold now were trying to stop it
roger
im going to roll it
can you give it a roll up now jim
yes
i dont understand why we got that
apollo lb houston it looks like verb 49 maneuver will just take you right through there youre going to have to go around it over
okay thats what were in the process of doing
si si
were manually working our way around it vance
okay
pitch is 083
how do i work my way around it im 58gs and i want yaw 231 right i think they screwed up o our  our numbers again
zero out the needles were heading that way and then well stop and talk about it
no pitch is 83 pitch should be up here  whats the number 552
pitch should be 83 degrees 
roll 232 thats a long way to roll  yaw is 62 
 yaw
 roll
okay whats that read theres 180
roger
 is over here houston 13
go ahead 13
theres something screwed up on our burn attitude were not getting the proper readings on the ball and the needles are centered im not too sure whats wrong lets go through this procedure again
okay stand by 1 let us look at it
  angles you gave us vance arent correlating the verb 49 numbers
okay well check into it
we know the ball is good why dont we just get a 40
you better watch out its heading that way
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
okay jim to answer your last question do you have pgns checklist page 57 handy
right we do ill check it
as soon as you open up to that ill explain it
okay go ahead vance
okay under verb 49 crewdefined maneuver the flashing 0622 are the aagles that we gave you that were loaded the flashing 5018 actually represents fdai angles and so what you read on 5018 should   tae 1920 tage 294
hight i understand 0b 02 17 06 cc   should not correspond with noun 22
yes we appreciate that vance its just that right now were trying to follow center needles that appear to be possibly taking us away from the place we know we want to be in the ball ob 02 17 bh cc okay youre tending toward the gimbal lock area again heads up 0b 02 17 42 lmp roger
theres our 83   0b 02 18 36 cc apollo 13 houston ob 02 18 41 cdrlmp go ahead 0b 02 18 lb cc lb request you put in the power ampl circuit breakers so that we eau take a look at your angles ob 02 18 54 lmp you got it
thank you and now high bit rate apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay 13 wetre getting your high bit rate now and taking a look at your angles
apollo 13 houston
go ahead
okay jim we just took a look at your angles and youre looking good here your pgns is looking good we cant yet explain the attitude error needle thing but i suggest you continue on in your maneuver
roger okay weve just about got roll
lb houston we see you now in the auto maneuver how are your error needles looking now
okay they look like they are working their way in vance
okay you think maybe they are working right now
yes because we got a 270degree roll our pitch and yaw needles are reversed
okay 03 02 27 22 imp say how do you read vance 
fred you are starting to fade out request aft omni omni aft 03 02 27 37 imp okay youve got aft omni
thank you
13 houston
okay houston aquarius we appear to be there  at the burn attitude and now do you want us to change the dap
roger jim we have a procedure to give you for widening the deadbud to 5 degrees for the ptc in the next 3 or 4 hours if youtre ready to copy
okay stand by
go ahead
okay verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter 44 enter now thats the procedure for widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the dap later on prior to the burn you would return the deadband to 14 degrees and if youre ready to copy ill read you that
stand by
okay
go ahead
okay to return the deadband later to 14 degrees verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter 200 enter over 03 02 31 03 lamp okay vance to widen the deadband well enter a verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter 44 enter before the burn to go back to narrow deadband its verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter 200 enter
roger readback correct
and houston ill guess well do this ptc in yaw and do you want them all powered down
stand by
okay apollo 13 over
go ahead
okay thats affirm youll be doing the ptc in yaw and well give you a call at each time you change yaw  yaw attitude aside from that request low bit rate off then down voice backup off then power ampl off and then fda off
okay vance on the power down we go low bit rate down voice backu well pull the power ampl breaker and well power down the 1i and the ac
thats affirm and the aot too
okay arc you all set for old a  03 02 35 02 ip okay houston aquarius how do you read down voice backup
reading you loud  loud and clear now fred
okay
oh vance do you want to stay in this attitude for a certain length of time before we start maneuvering
roger jim well keep you there for about an hour and then well have our first 90degree rotation
okay how wide do i make the deadband
say again
 the other omnis ina 03 02 37 27 imp yes my forward omni is in
apollo 13 houston forward omni should be best
were there
i dontt see why the hell he 
i know i dont know i dont know where that 5 degrees 
cut it
ohh  that thing against the 
im just going to try and close my eyes for a little
go ahead
aquarius houston
go ahead
fred one  one point on the ptc requests that about an hour or less from now when you make your 90degree change that you do it in pgns auto as opposed to att hold reason is that if youre in att hold it establishes a new null point each time you stop the  the maneuver over 03 02 51 10  okay you want us to make the maneuver with pgns auto rather than the pgns att hold is that right
yes thats correct
and fred advise that it  it is a manual maneuver
13 houston youd be using xaxis override it will be a manual maneuver but with the pgns auto mode 03 02 52 07 ip okay
and if youre ready to copy charlie is going to be on in a minute with some recommended check list changes for your upcoming burn over
okay stand by 1
im going to erase this
hello aquarius houston do you read over
yes stand by 1 
okay which book are you going to give me some words in charlie 03 02 54 04 imp houston aquarius which book do you want us to have out contingency 
houston this is houston aquarius say again over
houston aquarius which book do you want me to update here charlie the contingency qr dps

good readback turning over to page 14 step 2 we want you to change the dap noun 46 to 31021 then after the noun 47 insert verb 34 enter over 03 03 08 15 imp okay on page 14 a vfaqb 48 dap load noun 46 changed to 31021 i assume you will give us any updated weights if we need any and after the noun 47 a verb 34 enter so i  youre saying our gimbals look all right
thats affirmative on the gimbals fred nothing else on page 14 proceed to page 15 and under rcs checkout wed like to scratch that wording and just say verify the following switches guidance control pgns step 3  correction its line 3 change attitude control 3 to mode control mode control both to auto verify aca prop lmp enable aca4 jet lmp enable ttcatranslation impenable that is all on page 15 over 03 03 09 45 imp okay on page 15 well change the heading rcs checkout to verify following switches  and those switches are guidance control pgns third line attitude control 3 to mode control now and then mode control both to auto and aca prop lmp enable aca4 jet lmp enable and ttcatranslation lmp enable
roger now stand by 1
okay hand me the eyepiece i got scorpio
you have
yes and antares
wheres the other one ii put t baok n here
hello aquarius houston on activation page 16 if you are ready over 03 03 10 41 iafp okay stand by just 1 charlie jims going to fish around and see if hes got  he thinks hes got scorpio im the aot now okay charlie go ahead im on 16 now
okay fred on page 16 perform the docked dps burn pgns that entire sequence down  down through the end of the page except cross out that csm maneuver to burn attitude then cmc  free over q3 03 11 27 iap yes i kind of deduced that one charlie forget the csm maneuver
okay and you can forget the aps followup too okay on page 17 perform all of the ags entries and at 4 minutes we got a change first line cb16 inverter 3 close line 2 scratch out select inverter 1 at proceeding on down the page after attitude monitor wed like you to place the ttescale to 25 degrees a second okay proceeding on down four more lines to balance couple wed like to turn balance coupleoff thats to keep the upfiring jets off of the csm in case we have to damp any rates in ags though we dont think we will then perform the rest of that page as written over
okay on page 17 do the ags load at minus 4 minutes its cbii inverter 2 close and scratch select inverter 1 rate scale changed to 25 degrees a second balance couple well turn off and incidentally on the ags dampen rates point it brings up the discussion wed had before charlie on takeovers you might discuss what its going to cost us deltav wise if we get a control problem to just shut her off and it take 30 ninutes to regroup for a good manual burn
fred we already got that story for you pretty well in hand were reviewing it right now and id like to defer that question until later on basically were just going to shut down and take what we got and we got a midcourse of about  the maximum of 5 foot per second anywhere in the burn to get back to free return that  thatts basically the story well give you the mission rules for this burn momentarily id like to proceed on to page 18 at minus 1 minute scratch master arm  on stand by 03 03 14 07 i24p okay on page 18 and ive already done that at 1 minute master arm  on ill scratch  
  slipped that  and i wont have anything to do   0b 03 14 15 izmp   ive already scratched cb16 abort stage  close for the previous burn
okay we want you to close the cb16 abort stage over
okay you got some special reason for that
yes sir we like  in case we dont get a manual on  i mean an auto on were going to back up using the abort stage in the descent engine command override at ignition plus 1 second backing up to page 17 at minus 4 minutes you read cbii inverter 2 it should be cb16 inverter 2 over
okay i got you charlie 17 cb16 inverter 2 close
okay back to page 18 well continue on as is at 30 seconds l0 seconds 7 seconds minus 5 seconds at ignition no ignition and well add here no ignition start pushbutton  push still no ignition descent engine command override on over
i got it out there but i cant get to see it closer
okay on channel  on rage 18 right on down the line everything holds until after ignition if no ignition start puskbutton push still no ignition descent en3ine command override switch on
okay good readback fredo at plus 15 seconds scratch master arm  off and at  proceeding on down to at engine cutoff its  after the mode control pgns to att hold wed like a verb 76 and the damp excessive rates via the lm y z translation over 03 03 16 48  okay scratch master arm  off at plus 15 and at engine cutoff after mode control pgns  att hold we want a verb 76 enter and damp excessive rates via lm y z translation and a question on the  propellant quantity we expect it to get down below 37 percent on this burn does that compare with that burn time when you get down to it
thats negative at this  this burn were looking at  not reaching 37 percent so i dont think wetll have to perform that step we will verify that for you okay one other statement at engine cutoff if manual start then at 30 feet per second to go throttle to 40 percent at deltav equals zero stop push button push over 03 03 18 1t lmp okay charlie if a manual start that was throttle to 40 percent at  was that 30 foot per second to go
thats affirmative at 30 foot per second to go 03 03 18 30 ip okay then its stop pushbutton at vgo equals zero
thatts affirmative what we want to do if we got a manual start were going to have to shut down manually and to get a better guided cut off at 30 foot per second to go we want you to throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason there and we feel like we can get a good manual cutoff 0ver 03 03 18 56 mp okay
okay now fred that was good in the checklist thats all well have the powerdown checklist for you momentarily and wed like to ask you if you plan to use the dps burn card if you do we have some changes to that over
okay let me get ahold of this  right now
let me know when you are ready to copy over
im ready
okay the first two lines are okay cb  third line cbii and 16 stabcontrol all closed except cbil aea open abort stage open aeld open cb16 aeld open over
okay on the dps burn card third line should read cbii and 16 stabcontrol cbs all closed except cbii aea open abort stage open aeld open cb16  aeld open
okay good readback proceeding on down the page balance couple switch balance couple off okay down to the ttca  its the last line before minus 2 minutes  ttca commander thiottle minimum lmp ttca to jets at minus 2 minutes scratch 400 plus 1 at minus 1 minute scratch master arm on at minus 10 seconds add manual ullage at plus 5 seconds scratch descent engine command override on add ttca 40 percent okay the same comments apply about the manual start at the ignition time if no start manual start pushbutton push if still no start descent engine command override on and the same comments apply to shutting down at manual start over 03 ob 21 54 lmp okay the same comments ill start at the top again here okay balance couple should be changed to off under ttca it should be lmp ttca to jet scratch 400 plus t at minus 2 scratch master arm on at minus 1 add at minus 10 seconds manual ullage add ignition  can add the comment about if no start start pushbutton push still no start descent engine command override on at the plus 5second point scratch descent engine command override on and add ttca to 40 percent and the same comment applies at engine stop to perform
we really dont use this card at that tlme rape 5013 rage 307
roger freedc now we armt  also al minus 30 seconds we arent lookirjg at an ags burn so you can scratch abort pushbutton push and at deltav equal to zero scratch abort pushbutton reset 0ver
okay minus 30 for ags burn abort pushbutton push is scratched and at deltav equals zero abort pushbutton reset is scratched
okay you got it babe well have some mission rules for you momentarily and the powerdown checklist and also a ptc setup over 03 03 23 24 ip okay
houston aquarius
go ahead jim over
roger be advised im now seeing antares and nunki in the aot and i just wanted to know whether you want me to try to do a p52
roger stand by we copy the stars you are seeing stand by on a p52
not very far apart put the card back up jim   03 03 24 ot cdr its better than antares and shaula 03 03 24 05 iap yes sure is thats right
we got pretty good  ill do an auto p52 to antares thats the way ill get it up there
hey houston  correction aquarius houston were satisfied with our present alinement we dont want you to waste any more rcs gas trying to do this p52 and be advised you guys are hot mike if you havent heard over
okay understand
hows your memory there charlie
okay were putting vance back on stand by
what was that  
okay okay letts go back to that p52  now the attitude 03 03 25 26 irp the burn attitude
yes i want to make sure i got it 03 03 25 30 ip oh you strayed off
yes 03 03 25 34 imp okay  okay you want these numbers or do you want the numbers from these
what 03 03 25 48  pads you got the gn dictionary
i got 13 20 going now 03 03 25 57 imp wait a minute
 just a  these are those 13 20 angles here up here right here
hey great 03 03 27 20 i4p one on and houston aquarius

  off there
aquarius houston 03 03 28 11  no youve got it right here
go ahead
okay about all we have to do is to send up your state vectors and target loads and that will have to wait a couple of minutes until we get ready to do so and if youre ready to copy i can give you the p30 maneuver pad for pc plus 2 and after that probably you should eat and then well regroup again to send up other things over
okay im ready to copy a p30 a pc plus 2
okay okay this is a preliminary p30 lm maneuver pc plus 2 starting noun 33 079274007 plus 08192 minus 00200 minus 02189 na plus 00209 08482 420 274 082 plus 08203 minus 00200 minus 02150 comments ullage is two jets for 10 seconds csm weight 62480 lmweight 33576 and the following is the dps throttle profile 5 seconds at minimum followed by 21 seconds at 40 percent and the remainder at max over 03 03 31 21 iamp okay pc plus 2 079274007 plus 08192 minus 00200 minus 02189 na plus 00209 08482 420 274 082 plus 08203 minus 00200 minus 02150 the rest na under remarks ullage two jets 10 seconds csm weight 62480 lm weight 33576 dps throttle profile 5 seconds at idle 21 seconds at 40 percent remainder at max
roger thats correct fred if youll take out a maneuver pad ill give you some landing information over
okay youre talking in the csm update book
yes thats affirm
you got it right here make sure and scratch the   
   03 03 33 20 imp   though
okay which  which one we want p377
what kind of a maneuver pad do you want vance
this is a csm maneuver pad for  to monitor pc plus 2 and its going to be mainly blank except i want to give you your noun 61 latitude and longitude range to go for the ms and that sort of thing 03 03 34 15 ip okay go ahead
okay at the top purpose is monitor pc plus 2 everything is blank until you get down to noun 61 latitude as follows minus 2147 minus 16500 11660 36291 1423920 over 03 03 35 07  okay monitor pc plus 2 pad noun 81 minus 2147 minus 16500 11660 36291 1423920
roger thats correct fredo and we  now would like to get you in a configuration to uplink your state vector and target load so if youre ready to copy i have some circuit breaker changes for you over 03 03 35 47  okay go ahead
okay circuit breaker panel 11 updata link close primary power ampl panel 16 close voice function to voice range  hanging function to ranging tm bit rate hi and then p00 and data 03 03 36 28  okay were now in po0 and data and switches and breakers are configured you got it
okay thank you youre coming in loud and clear
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
hey jim i have about three things first thing the computer is yours again the second thing no ptc maneuvering will be required from now until burn so you can lustsit in the bzrn attitude and the third thing is wed like to back out of this procedure we just put you into to updata link which would mean going from qtm bit rate hi back to lo ranging to off voice to down voice primary power ampl to close
hold up vance
okay
we have a program alarm vance 1106
stand by  03 03 44 39 izfp   that high bit rate
okay that apparently was just my putting the updata link switch off that set that bit
roger we concur on that and ill read this back to you a little more slowly fred
okay are you ready to copy
okay go ahead
okay tm bit rate to lo ranging to off voice to down voice primary power ampl to off  thats on panel 16  and  or open  and circuit breaker ll updata link to close  or to open over
okay vance how do you read on down voice backup now
okay fred reading you loud and clear now 03 03 46 26  okay ive got the power ampl off down voice backup pcm to lo bit rate and the updata link breaker on ll is pulled
okay copy thank you 0b 03 47 16 cc apollo 13 houston
go ahead
okay on this last readback wed just like to verify that the primary power ampl was pulled opened over 03 0b 47 b7 imp thats affirm i used the breaker on 16 primary sband power ampl breaker is open
okay thank you 03 0b 49 00 cdr boy we must be getting pretty close to the moon 03 03 49 03 imp whats that
itts in a att hold 03 03 49 21 imp five degrees 03 03 50 24 imp hey jack bring me down one of the  03 03 50 37 imp and 
 need two of them i guess  03 03 50 49 imp 
yes ive been meaning to tell you about that yes
you know where this  water
whats that
you know where this  water
where
the lgc 03 03 51 18 1amp 
 there she is  apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
pretty close hows the hoses coming
that screen goes  goes on  freds hose up there
yes here take that one  another few minutes 
lets not forget to haul these out of here
thank you
get the hose screens
yes
ill 
houston aquarius how do you read
hello houston aquarius how do you read
aquarius houston loud and clear
okay vance i guess i understood you all were amassing a couple of  list of things that you were thinking about later on  wed be taking back from the lm across into the csm a couple of items to add to that list weve pilfered the  the intake hose screens out of the csm and we have them mounted on the lm hoses now to catch the debris in here we probably ought to take those back
okay we got that intake hose screens
i guess that item isnt going to change your cg too much fredo
lets hope not
 command module water
yes no  03 03 58 59 iaip yes
 get out one of those big  bags
much debris in there
trying to put debris in
yes
 jim ready to go
hows that for  laughter
 didnt see any 
yes oh what id like to do is find out how many  yes  what happened to the two little midcourses thats got to be with this vehicle
yes 
now we just take the csm and strip it down start putting the  stuff in here
why are you worrying about that why are you worried about stripping down the vehicle
well you dont want  you dont want the drogue and the probe in
oh yes
and you do want room for the plsss so well grab this  suit valve and  them in there
well the suit  oxygen  the cabin
clears throat were not planning to reenter with suits
 a suit would help you out is for protection
yes 
they work on the repress valve
yes 
you know  suit 
breathe through the canister
yes breathe through the canister
my job is to maintain 
you got all those things 
roger
yes i think they forgot that
sun must be coming back
yes 
yes i got two stars circling back nunki and antares  back up again
actually you can see 
what huh 03 04 12 bo cmp thats the one you put up there  i would like to 
 to trade it in o3 o4 12 4o mp 
doesnt that also fit this big container back here ob 04 12 46 cmp 
thats a little 
i wouldnt mind  
okay
 seems to me
guaranteed to work
okay 
hey cant you pilfer more there yes 
 what you do  what you do you put your  0b 04 14 36 cmp not bad 
now lets see this burns  to our back i suppose lets hope it works
now lets see what should we be doing here now
okay the next thing is power for the burn did they give you a time to start powerup
no 
yes we ought to get a  you know we ought to get   
they will
  
hello houston aquarius
go aquarius
lets just recap the situation now were not going to do any more ptc well maintain this attitude you have already updated us on p30 load we would like from you an los time and a powerup start time for the pc plus 2 and an aos time
okay we copy that
were going to also get back with you shortly jim for  with some burn guidelines for pc plus 2
all right very well
have they powered up the mission timer  the event timer
oh i see are they going to patu i7 050i 22 13 cc apollo 13 jfouston
go ahead ilouston 0 oil 22 cc jim we wore justdiscussing burn star moniiorint and we were curious to know if you can see nunki in detent 2 at this time over 03 04 22 h5 cdr thats affirmative i can see nunki in detent 2
okay thank you roughly in what part of the field of view
nunki is in the upper righthand corner
okay thank you
and scorp  and antares is barely visible in the bottom of the field of view
okay
hey i bet i know how i could get an alinement give them a cursor spiral angle instead of maneuvering the spacecraft ill give them cursor spiral
do that for ags and 
 hows the 
houston for what its worth we can probably give you a cursor spiral angle on nunki and possibly antares or moethan likely shaula 03 oh 27 34 cc roger jim according to our calculations nunki should be at burn time pretty close to the center of the aot weve been talking that possibility over
roger
also as a matter of general interest the sun should be in  at the bottom part of the cdrs window at the bottom of the lpd vertical line
be at t which is at   lg
thats affirm
it must b that  youre right because its behind us now
wait a minute ding insertion attitude 03 04 28 38 lu yes were not at the t attitude lg 03 04 28 40 cml oh 03 04 29 44 c apollo 13 houston
go ahead
jim whenever youre through eating and ready to copy the info i can send you the burn rules
do you want this
write them right on  
why dont you write them right in here
okay
okay ill start on that
okay vance
go ahead
were all set to go
okay okay first of all general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to loi mode i abort with the tight limits now ill go through them one by one for you to copy okay you should shut down if any of the following happen thrust monitor readout 77 percent or below dps propellant tank pressure  thats the inlet pressure  onboard readout 160 or below fuel to ox deltap greater than 25 psi  and that would have to be a ground call to you  attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees with the exception of the start transient attituderate limits plus or minus 10 degrees a second and you should shut down if you get any of the following al engine gimbal iss plus program alarm lgc ces dc and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters are you with me 03 04 32 52  ier tape517
okay  
affirmative
and proceeding on if during the burn the engine stops if you have a flashing noun 97 you should proceed then ullage engine start to push and descent engine override on okay now just general information if you didnt burn pc plus 2 probably p  p plus 4 would be the earliest mcc ags is going to backup in a ratefail mode only which you know were talking over the star check will have to get back with you on that if for some reason there is no pc2 you have a freereturn tra jectory with the landing at 1520200 and that would be after a small midcourse5 which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours and you have recovery forces in the indian ocean youre in good shape there and the indian ocean is where this landing would be okay you still with me
roger
okay after  
yes im with you
okay after pc plus 2 there are no trim re quirements and if you have a shutdown during pc plus 2 subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with  well the earliest one would be pc plus 4 if you dont do a pc plus 2 but we still want to do one  mcc later at pc plus 4 the increase in delt  in deltav or the penalty would be about 24 feet per second with a landing in the midpacific at 1424630 now you should ex pect new pads state vectors and targets for pc plus 2 at about get 78 over
tell them to stand by
stand by vance
okay
okay how do you read
loud and clear pwe320
okay burn rules we should shut down for the following if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or below number 2 if the dps pro pellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi 3 if the fuel oxidizer deltap is greater than 25 and thatll be a ground callout 4 if the attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees ex cept for starting transients okay rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees per second and were to shut down with the following alarms an engine gimbal light an iss with a program alarm an lgc a ces dc and an inverter light if its still on after weve tried switching inverters if during the burn the engine shuts down when the noun 97 flashes we should pro do manual ullage and start pushbutton push and descent engine command override open if we dont do a pc2 our next burn will it be at pc4 for an added 24 foot per second well land mid pac at 1424630 0kay well have the jigsup for backup rate command or rate damping i guess and the free return that were on if we dont  that were on now if we dont do pc2 or 4 lands us at 1520200 in the indian ocean and theres no trim requirements on this burn and we should expect a new uplink and a new final maneuver pad from you at 178 hours
78
okay im sorry 1  yes 78 hours it only seems like its been that long
i can understand
okay fred your readback was correct
okay
okay and vance did you ever have any losaos times and  and a startup time for us to jump into this activation checklist
okay let me  let me poll the house again on that one
what
okay one word is thai the  in an optimum fashion there going tirough that 2hour activa tion generally took sonewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour 20 03 011 40 56 cc okay i guess then we ought to alow yott a lttle more than that huh 03 04 41 06 lmi no i was thinking that wdont haw todo abjut four pages of it that we probably need just about that and that will make up for the difference of any added time we need maneuvering et cetera
okay
well need a  can i get a flashlight you got a flashlight we might need a spare flashlight  yes okay we might need a spare flashlight have you got one okay okay the sun has gone  down
man look at those stars houston
go ahead aquarius
roger we are in the shadow of the moon now the sun is just about set as far as i can see and the stars are all coming out
okay and if you are ready to copy we have losaos times for you
flashlight okay
go ahead vance
okay los 770835 a0s 773310 sunrise  first ill give you sunset which is past but that was supposed to be at 763245 and sunrise 771648
okay los at 770835 a0s at 773310 sunset at 763245 sunrise at 771648
roger well get back with you on the powerup time and if youre ready to copy have angles to load into noun 22 for your verb 49 maneuver to burn attitude over
okay go ahead with the verb 49 value
okay ri plus 27210 r2 plus 35570 r3 plus 33010 second item as you know due to maneuver with a proceed and a proceed and after your attitude a reminder that p40 will not set you back to a narrow deadband to get back to the lage322 140degree deadband you have to use the proce dure i gave you which is verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter and 200 enter
okay verb 49 register 1 plus 27218 regis ter 2 plus 35570 register 3 plus 33010 and to get the narrow deadband back we want a verb 21 noun 01 enter 3011 enter 200 enter
roger and a correction on your  on your first number for register 1 that should be plus 27210 and another eonnent after you get into the narrow deadband at that attitude why you might tell us where you see nunki
roger will do vance
thank you
okay and you corrected register 1 its plus 27210
roger
and would you like us to make that maneuver at this time
its down below us isnt it
stand by
cant see it
can we have some more light in here now
i have a light
what do you see out your upper window
stars
yes it looks like  looks like the light is coming from around those clouds
well you wont get aoslos until 77
yes
yes
lets see a0s is at 2 hours before the burn
just about
apollo 13 houston
go ahead houston
jim we recommend you go ahead and make your verb 49 maneuver but just stay there in verb 49 and dont go ahead to narrow the deadband just yet and when youre in that attitude why of course then you can make your star check and one other item is i dont think we got back with you but that hour 15 for powerup sounds fine with us
okay at this time ill start my verb 49 maneuver but will not narrow the deadhand and we will take a look at nunki okay vance
roger
almost huh
jim jim
no it shouldnt
it shouldnt
i was below that 
thats a good idea
 how many lights youre going to see you can coach jim on that
sure were there
nunki
yes i can just barely see it i see antares much better
why is the wide deadhand on stand by is  is scorpio moving down
whats that cloud i see over there
i dont know it looks like a milky way
just a
huh
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay we have completed our maneuver were in our wide deadband and nunki is close to the top of my display of the aot right now antares seems to be more closer towards the center however we are in our wide deadband
right understand well have to make a better check later i guess
i cant for the life of me figure out what that dark stuff is
yes did you look at it jack ob 04 57 46 cmp yes okay but i didnt recall what 
see it there like two black clouds ob 04 58 24 cdr well you know what this burn is buying us l0 hours ob 04 58 29 cmp yes ob 04 58 32 lmp and how
might be a good idea ob 04 59 41 cmp hey thats pretty extensive jim you can locate it and get it halfway through the  ob 05 o0 25 cmp strange ob 05 o0 53 cdr its on the aot well maybe not 05 oi 02 lmp i dont think so
i know what that is that might be the debris that was thrown out there
  into the cloud
its all dark now
from the explosion
 we made a maneuver
no from our explosion
take a look it covers a wide area god that dark cloud  like a pair of contrails only if you switch the detent they go on around how long to ids is that right
id sure like to try the detent 2 but i guess our damn platforms okay isnt it
yes
yes
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim we have a little over 2 minutes until los and everythings looking good here
roger yes i take it that we dont have to start our activations until we receive aos from you
roger thats correct
you  up our edibles  water  apollo 13airtoground voice transcription 03 05 33 50 cd good morning houston iowdo you read
aquarius houston ovar
stand by for aos
houston how do you read aquarius
aquarius houston reading you about 3 by 3
houston aquarius ho do you read
okay fred reading you fairly well now how do you read
okay i read you loud and clear 
roger 03 05 38 3 lmp jacks why dont you get the other 
well go this way

oh yes yes were no longer 139 miles were leaving
yes look at that curvature
that might be crisium ever there fred
oh yes way off on the horizon there yes
hey if you want to use the 250 theres a beautiful shot of tsiokovsky which we very seldom have
well at this stage of the game beggars cant be choosers i guess
yes and we cant affozd the amps to use the heaters
here you go
ail right youre in ero phase up here
are we  back to down voice backup
whats that
we down voice backup
yes
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
roger we still want an activation start time for a burn
understand you want a powerup time is that affirm
thats affirm
okay stand by
okay look it lets get the cameras squared away lets get all set to burn we got one chance now
okay
were not going to hack it at 152 hours
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim regarding the start time for the powerup you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes we think that is adequate this is crew preference de pending on how much time you think you need we would go along with an hour and 15 minutes  
okay  okay sounds good
okay fredo you been through most of that checklist for an hour lets get it out and 
78 hours and 
okay lets 
hey jack did you  camera back up 
okay page 1 03 05 48 9 cdr okay 03 05 48 22 ijzt page 2 im going to power up the 
aquarius itouston over
go ahead houston
okay jim we have about three items for you we have a maneuver pad p30 lm maneuver again and the maneuver pad for the cm for splashdown we also have a checklist change with contin gencies  lm contingencies checklist and ill stand by while youre gathering the books
okay im at  i got the contingency book so give me that one first
okay page 18 
okay im at page 18
okay about halfway down when propellant quantity equals 30 percent or rather 37 percent we would like to change that line to read  when time to go is equal to 10 seconds  of course the line under that remains the same then descent he reg 1 to close
okay when time to go equals 10 seconds descent helium reg 1 close
thats affirm before i start on the pads another comment the general indications that we gave you before about the sun being in the commanders window and about stars in the aot such as that might be used as general indication for your attitude for the burn thats all out the window we are just going on the sun check that we made earlier and we dont feel that we have information that is good enough to give you the star and the sun in the window information
okay youre very weak now when you are ready to take the p30 lm maneuver pad ill be reading it up
okay go ahead with th 
okay this is p30 in maneuver pad pc plus 2 hours starting ith ioun 33 79273830 plus 08330 minus 00509 minus 023 na plus 00205 08615 424 272 081 and the rest is na except for comments as follows ullage two jets 10 seconds csm weight 62480 lm weight 33452 and the dps throttle profile is the same as before 5 seconds at minimum 21 seconds at 40 percent and the remainder of the time at max over

okay aquarius houston youre coming in about 1 by 1 now advise that i heard everything ex cept the beginning noun 33 values and the com ments please repeat the readback on those
okay im going to up with the power amp here vance
houston how do you resd aquarius now
hey youre loud and clear now 03 05 59 23  okay i got the power amps now pc plus 2 hours 07927 38030 plus 08330 minus 00509 minus 02139 na plus 00205 08615 424 272 081 rest na ullage two jets 10 seconds csm weight 62480 lm weight 33452 dps throttle profile the same 5 seconds idle 40 percent at 21 seconds remainder at max
roger forty percent for 21 seconds i believe is what you read back and all the rest is correct now for the maneuver pad for the csm over 03 06 o0 29  okay stand by
okay go ahead
okay fredo this is maneuver pad monitor pc plus 2 hours all na until you get to noun 61 latitude minus 2165 minus 16500 11635 36292 1423922 over 03 06 o1 48 cml monitor plane change plus 2 noun 1minus 2165 minus 16500 11635 36292 1423922
roger that was starting with noun gl and thats correct
by the way aquarius we see the results now from 12s seismometer looks like your booster just hit the moon and its rocking it a little bit over
well at least something worked on this flight
and i just want to verify one thing we could  
yes im sure  
  go ahead
i say im sure glad we didnt have a lm impact too
right just wanted to verify  we had poor reception when i was talking to you before  i wanted to verify that you understand that the sun check you made earlier in the a0t was good and thats what were riding on anything that we told you in the past about looking at the sun in the front left window or looking at stars like nunki through the aot why we want to forget
roger understand vance i think nunki would be kind of hard to see anyway with the moon right here
right
and vance we plan to start powering up at 7812 is that a good time or do you think we ought to hold off a little longer
jim we think thats very good
right
apollo 13 houst  aquarius houston 03 06 08 31 limp go ahead
fred after the burn wei get the powerdown instructions or checklist changes to you at the same time wed like to get a consumables status to you ail ill say right now is that we think you look in reasonably good shape
okay very good
okay houston aquarius
go ahead
okay one caution and warning light here showing that you didnt call out  its the pre amps  i suppose because we dont have the atca breaker in yet
okay thats okay
houston are you planning to give us a state vector update
thats  thats affirm jim ail we need is updata link circuit breaker closed on panel 11 and po0 and accept and we can ship it up to you p00 and data
okay vance were in data and po0 and the circuit breakers in go ahead
okay well ship her up to you
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim request verify raging function switch is in ranging we need that if its not there now
you got it vance
thank you
aquarius houston the computer is yours
aquarius houston did you call
we didnt call houston
okay
aquarius liouston over
houston are you calling aquarius
roger fred i would like to confij that you are getting drinking water out of povable water out of the command module and if you can make any estimates of how much you use as time goes on and how much you have used we would appre ciate it for our consumables analysis
okay
okay jack tried the procedure and out of that pressure we got 10 drinks made thats roughly 80 ounces
okay fred we had a little static on that one but i think you said that 80 ounces of water has been used out of the cm is that right
yes jack worked the procedure and filled as many of the drinks as he could and he made up ten bags of approximately 8 ounces a bag
okay we copy that
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim just a bit of information if for any reason you had to slip tig  our people here feel it wouldnt do much harm if you slipped it up to 30 minutes the procedure of course as you know is not to pro on the flashing 99 and we thought you might like to be aware that t time isnt all that critical lg
roger understand
okay vance aquarius
go fred
okay i think its finally coming through to us here what you said just a little while ago were you suggesting that we move the t up 30 minutes lg i
no not at all were just giving you excess information just saying if you had any problem at all it could be slipped
oh okay slipped 30 minutes okay thats better
right
you guys are pretty fast though
yes it kind of surprised us
i guess thats what happens when you cut a lot out of a checklist
yes yes were taking about a thousand pictures in between steps there too 03 06 45 33 lmp okay houston aquarius radio check
loud and clear fred
okay i had a change in the background noises wondered if you were still there
right apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription pae 334 03 07 06 25 c apollo 13 houston
houston aquarius go ahead housto
okay aquarius we have some ne information regarding what you shot2d see out the commanders window at t  over kg
okay go ahead
according to calculaticns calculations you should see the moon itll be a full moon you should see most of the disk and it should be soma where on your vertical lpd line probably at about 14 on the lpd scale er roughly centered on 14
okay houston i concvr im looking at 14 on the lpd and the angle is jrst about centered its south of crisian but its  the line is just slightly to the north cf center
okay jim that sounds very good we see that you have a slight yaw angle so it should be north of center
i can even see mount marilyn from here
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim you are go for the burn go for the burn
roger i understand go for the burn
aquarius 2 minutes and 40 seconds to go on the mark
mark
or that was  stand by
what was that mark 03 07 2 26 cc stand by that was incorrect three minutes  counting down to 3 minutes and ill give you a mark and ill take int consideration 2 seconds
mark pae 335 0 07 4 41 l loger we got you
one minute
roger
were burning 40 percent
houston copies
one hundred percent
roger
aquarius houston youre looking good 03 07 2836 cdr roger
aquarius you were looking good at 2 minutes still looking good
two minutes roger
aquarius youre go at 3 minutes
aquarius roger
dont forget descent rfg 1 off 10 seconds to go
shutdown
roger shut down
are you reading our 1640 houston
roger were reading it
well proceed heres our residuals
roger very small
good burn aquarius
go ahead
i say that was a good burn
roger and now we want to power down as soon as possible
roger understand i
houston aquarius
go ahead
suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down as you did yesterday for us
okay we have a procedure ready to send up to you here in about 2 minutes let us know when youre all ready to take it
okay
okay is it going to be better to write this on a blank page vance or can we use some portion of the powerdown list there in the contingency book that already exists
stand by 1
aquarius houston over
go ahead
slight delay here jim it will be a couple of minutes before we read that up to you and were looking at the contingency checklist powerdown and thats on page 5 you might be getting that out while we get all rady to give it to you
could you give us that page number again page 5 doesnt make sense
okay make that power 5 in the contingency checklist fred and its the  
  thats better
  middle part of the page it starts emergency powerdown and well mrk that up
okay im to 5 emergency powerdown
okay but hold off on it because we might have to start ptc up again here and thats the point thats being resolved right at the moment so stand by
okay 03 07 42 9 cc aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay were ready to give you the pocedure which will power you down a good bit and after the ptc is goings maybe we can give you further information ire you ready to copy starting at the middle of the page power 
okay go ahead vance
okay after number 1 first line cross out and vhfa second line cross out simplex operation third line cross out prime that refers to prime power amp off that  that prime should actually be replaced by off and thats the second prime that line also in the third line the last word off should be crossed out and replaced by pcm fourth line is okay fifth line which is vhf voice on off off cross out lighting floods which is the next line should be uti but add the following or overheadforward prefer off okay step 2 remains the same no change for the moment stand by skip step 2 do not do it just go on to step 3 which is configure circuit breakers per the chart that takes us to page power 6 why dont you give me a readback on what you had on power 5 fredo
okay on power 5 emergency powerdown item 1 first line i scratch the and vitfa second line simplex operation third line i replace the second prime which is the power amp with an off and the last word in that line is off replaced it with pcm fourth line is okay fifth line i scratch the whole line lighting we havent needed floods yet so we will just leave them off exterior lighting off scratch line 2 and i am now on power 6 wait for your update on the cb panels
okay power 6 okay power 6 refers to panel 11 you should go per the chart with the exception of those breakers that i all out first line is okay or lets say irst row second row quad 4 tca closed qad 3 tca closed quad 2 tca closed and quad l tca closed fherest of that row is okay row 3 about halfway over j atca pgns closed okay the rest of that line is okay fourth line heater rand by okay that line is all okay with the exception of the last three circuit breakers fred under pgns which is lgc dsk imu standby imu operate those three should be closea at least for the time being and finally the fifth line its okay as is and would you give me a read back on that
okay i disagree on the fifth line it appears that we ought to have the ascent eca control open
okay well check into that one and while we are listening to the rest of your readout
okay and top row is correct as is second row we want the quad tcas 1 through 4 closed on the third row we want the atca pgns closed on the fourth row we want the pgns lgc dsky imu standby imu operate sll closed and youre saying the bottom row ss is
okay well go along with what you said on the ascent eca control that should be open
okay continue vance
okay next page power 7 panel 16 first row close the four quad tca circuit breakers that is quad 1 tca quad 2 quad 3 and quad 4 tca okay rows 2 3 and 4 are okay
okay panel 16 top row we want to close quad 1 through 4 tca breakers and youre saying the other three rows are as is again i have the exception the ascent eca control on 16 should also be open
okay we concur on that and we have a late ar rival in row 3 stand by
okay fred one addition third row the sband power amp request that you pull that circuit breaker and leave the switch in primary tage 339 03 07 50 0 lmp okay yes thats the way we were doing it before ill pull the power amp cb and then ill go back to the first stage and put the power amp to prime
thats correct that should be changed back to prime and thats  hats it
good work vance
thank you
reset off and low okay lighting bus off exterior lighting is off okay you want to get your breakers jim we ought to probably go back to that wide deadband
okay the bus tie inerters are coming off the line
yes go ahead sorry i put the switch off thatll kill caution snd warning
okay lets see so were going to lose the ball again
yes
ill get 16 noun 20 ut
do you have me move auto transfer this time
why do i still have a vhfa receiver off
you dont do you
yes
lets give them a call panel 11
okay vance im on  do you read me now hot mike
roger loud and clear fred
okay jim just noticed we got a vhy breaker in on panel 11 still i hink that probably should be opened
okay thats affirmative pull the vhfa receiver 03 07 53 54 ip okay pull it jim 03 07 53 55 cd i got it already okay now why are we putting the cabin fan on
oh oh oh oh yes okay
okay im going to pul1 inverter 1
okay not very long snce they had the switch off on you anyway
okay
roger  
  but my only question is i got the cross tie bus circuit breaker in could be  yes this one right here
good line its on because that line is open
ill look over at that caution in a minute
vance aquarius
roger go ahead fred
yes weve managed the first 30 hours or so here without the caution and warning we dont need to keep it up now do we
okay fred thats one that were leaving up until the ptc is established we have a procedure for ptc to try with you which were hopeful will work pretty well and ill read that up as soon as you get what youre doing now done
okay
why dont you go aheas and ill get this ptc procedure its by the photo log and ill just get that
and one other question houston you really want to pull the asa breakr you want to give up the ags probably for good now huh
houston im standing by to copy the ptc procedures
okay ill get back ith you on your cuestion in a minute fred new here comes thc ptc lb jtk procedure step 1 gutdance control to pgns two mode control att hozj verb 76 eer maneuver to ptc attitude and that ncidentally is roll 0 pitch 90 and present yaw we realize you cant monitor that on your fdai but you can on a verb with a verb 16 noun 20
with me
roger guidance control pgns mode control att hold verb 76 enter maneuver to ptc attitude which is roll 0 pitch 90 and yaw which is the present yaw is that correct
thats correct okay next mode  at  when youre established at the attitude mode control auto key in verb 16 noun 20 to monitor rates when less than 01 degree a second rate in all  in each axis then disable plusx thrusters okay next verb 25 noun 07 enter 1257 enter 252 entomb 1 elqe verb 77  n  m h  enter put in the dar 22110 and proceed verb 34 enter then verb 16 noun 20 and monitor rates on rates less than 001 degrees per second in all axis verb 76 enter mode control att hoid then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maeuver over
okay vance ptc procedure guidance control pgns mode control att hold verb 76 enter maneuver to ptc attitude roll 0 pitch 90 yaw 0 my ball now of course is inoperative so ill have to get that on the dsky the 5 is mode control auto 6 verb 16 noun 20 monitor rates rates less that 1 degree per secend in each axis disable anc i didnt hear that last part the next one was verb 25 noun 07 enter 1257 enter 252 entet 1 enter verb 77 enter verb 48 enter 22110 proceed verb 34 enter verb 16 noun 20 entef monitor rates rates less than 001 degrees per second in al axis vei 76 enter mode coiirol att hold therl 0 cljck o2 right yaw to stop  to start  marvr
roger ats correct fjrr to  to on wr yor questions and correct cae pojrt ywhojii your present yaw whatver it is antith9p with roll 0 pitch 90 present yaw the other thing is you said dsbie rj you dt hear the rest uv  caj     q finally rear h  lr pi r  d loading o o3 o5 i 1 roffer now lo maneuver i iic roll i pit ch o and yaw i mtd pibob iq ter roll  hre yaw  whlcvr yaw we have in okay vrtc in our inilal maneuver to pcattjmoe  uloing to have to use  to display 16 20 an ill have to use the ttca to get there
jim roger your use of the tc  ttca and just a reminder that in maneuvering that  that  that roll is in r3 and yaw is in ri
thats affirm and im going to take out roll first to get it zero and then im going to take care of pitch
okay
okay gijtdance control pgns mode control to att tlold verb 73 clears okay weve got to get that out  it stopped moving
here we go
 the battery 
do you know what the pusx thrusters are
yes okay i just wanted to make sure you d i got them over here
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay a couple of thins jim one is that you can use the ttcas to maaeuver but youre going to save a lot of fuel if youd try minijm impulse so that might be a better recommendation the other thing is wed like to give you a go before you dis able the plus s  x thrmsters and before you do a verb 76 and mode control to att hold over
okay understand you ant a go before i  im  of course i just did a 76 and the mode control is in att hold at this time but this is later on down
yes ail we wanted to io was take a look at things before you disabled the plusx thrusters and be fore you go to min impulse at the end there  that verb 76 enter mode control att hold
roger urlerstjnd and lrmaneuwrinfmy roll now ko zero
roger
yes those are the plusx right 03 08 11 03 lp houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
ah 
go ahead
in what fashion did you want us to disable those plusx thrusters jus pulling those appropriate tca breakers or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets
okay fred we didnt explain that te verb 25 noun 07 enter sequence does that
okay i didnt read the whole procedure jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plusx
i just did
okay
and vance are you still trying to get me au answer on that  pullilg that asa breaker
thats affirm fred this the word here is pull it
okay sure didnt get much work out of the ags this time
its going slightly
so is this one
yes you got a ways to go in pitch
yes
 80
you want to rest a little bit i 0 i 5 f41 wht iim il 1 jgjf  j  r i hu what t hirlk i h ntoldl ij ot ii189 cii were now in lhe hand o1rjcking
yes it looks diffcrert than before 03 08 19 09 4p hard to do p37s in the tm hard to do a p37 in the lm
well you can see where  
you almost can see  
  see ptolemaeus althonsus  theres nersdlel 03 08 20 13 imp yes you can barely see it in the corner there
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
okay just some info were working up a proce dure for you to use to  to use comnand module lioh canisters to connect to your hoses  the outlet hoses in the lm so that as time paes in the mission you car continue scrubbing t  lm atmosphere and this whole thing requir  modifying a kit so that you can attach the he c modifying a lioh canister so you can attach h hose to it so sometime in the future we wl be coming up to you wilh that procedure second point  second point iwere standing by to watch your maneuver fo the ptc procedure over
okay im in process row vance of maneuvering to zero yaw 90degree pitch using minmlm impulse
okay
and vance i assume it had also been brought up that we got two extra secondary cartridges  one in each plss
roger
we ought to start working on that mod right now
yes we wish we could send you a kit and it would be kind of like jutting a model airplane i together or something as it turn ftthis contraption will look like a mailbo hcyou get it al put together 03 08 22 28 im what do we make it out of vance
one canister with a  
  how about planning a rendezvous procedure
  with a plastic roo
just for information houston during  just prior to going around the moon we saw a lot of debris that was floating by us including some  one rather large piece looked like the wrapping off of a line of some sort that is  still is with us
roger copy jim
even after our freereturn midcourse yesterday
okay we copy that
no matter what i do i cant stop that roll either way wont do it
jim
well i dont see any way around it jim it sure doesnt seem to be doing much does it it wont go down
i dont know i wonder if they tried that in the simulator i cant seem to get roll to go up it goes down on me no matter how i hit the controllers
got pitch zero
you can really see a change in rate
 jar here see if itll couple in roll
no
there we go
that does it
im glad too lae 346
i dont know what causad it
here we still have 67percent fuel lovel i wonde  how come they didnt  deltav curve
aquarius houston
go ahead
jim we dont have any data on your movements right now how does it look like this procedurs going to work out so far as getting an attitude set up the first part of the procedure
well vance ive been trying to use minimum impulse only attitude control to get my roll and yaw  the roll and pitch rather but with the attitude control orzlyin this configuration i  i cant command these  the roll the way i want to so i had to go to ttca to get my roll to build up towards zeio it was goin  decreasing towards 270 i really dont know what the combina tion is in the attitude control that you can get the control to pitch ard roll the way you want it to youve got to use the ttca
roger copy
i now have both pitch md yaw  or pitch and roll going toward the designated amounts now passing through 23 degrees in pitch and im going up past 321 degrees in roll and i am letting go that direction and when i get there 90 in pitch and zero in roll ill go to auto and dmp the rates
get a little sleep tlats okay
weve got to rig up a rethoodf using those lithilm hydroxide canisters
okay houston we just got a master alarm and an ecs light i take it the partial pressure c02 is  yes  thats what tripped it apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription tape 5 tage 347
theres that mother
aquarius houston say again
ail right c02 our 02value is getting high we had a dps ecs light and a blinking component light
okay copy
stand by on that ptc 02 
say again houston
hello houston how do you read over
okay read you loud and clear now jim
okay did you hear what i just said about the ecs light aridthe blinking c02 component light
okay we got that and  stand by 1
okay
not much
jack we might have to have you rig up this co2 rig theyre talking about
go ahead houston over
0h we ye got a long ways to go
go ahead
okay jim were going to have to get back with you in a couple of minutes on whether or not we switch over at this time to your other canister second point it might help in setting up this ptc if you concentrate on roll first and get that going and then work on pitch when roll is established and sort of take whatever yaw you get
okay vance i tried that but when i start doing roll only i get pitch coupled in with it but both of them rolling u toward this desired amount though im u to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll
okay understand youve tried il
once i get roll zeroed i dont think itll be too bad
laughter 03 08 36 0 cdr so what did they put on my leva
oh boy
no he didnt want it there she goes gang the moon
aquarius houston
go ahead vance
okay jim since the first recommendation on nw  maneuver mc   work out we have another one and you might try this put yaw at zero then start the roll and the pitch after that 03 08 37 27 lmi vance  do you read
yes i do now go ahead
okay you guys just tell me what sort of material you had in mind to build this mailbox out of and jack and i will go to work on trying to construct that thing assume well use the spaceage baling wire or the gray tape
thats affirm we have a lengthy procedure here but in short you use plastic as a covering for the whole thing you put some kind of a stiffener at the top so the plastic doesnt suck against the l0i  lioh enter  entrance side youll  you need gray tape to stick the whole thing to gether and you need something like a sock to put in the  the bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up as it turns out the flow is rather ushaped througt the cartridge fred it if you plug up the bottom it comes in one side of the top and goes out the other 03 08 38 45 lamp okay sigh hold on a minute let  let us go get a cartridge and with it in hand ill speak to you some more 03 08 39 0i cc aquarius houston over
okay vance go ahead
okay really i think we should gve you a mor detailed procedure on that and in general those are the materials that are to be used but let us get back with a detailed procedure on how to make this cartridge arrangement work
okay
and to answer your question about ptc vance its rather difficult to use yaw in zero right away so what im doing yaw is working toward zero right now pitch is working toward 90 and roll is working toward  zero so we  were just going to tsiesome time to get there that s all
roger quite a bit of noise now i understand youre still having a problem getting there with the ptc
we are getting there slowly
okay
aquarius houston lets try forward omni
i dont know it looks 
i dont know it looks that way
okay houston how do you read now
houston how do you read
loud and clear now oahead
okay i switched to forward omni now
roger 
okay
theyre  off they cant stop pitch
that would only use fvel ag 350
 and stck it around that way
must have the wrong thing there
oh yes that was pretty
that didnt sound very good
yes hang on to that
theyre a hell of a long ways away
right
yes were not moving that fast to earth 03 08 9 40 lmp not yet
hey were already  this time huh
yes 03 08 50 05 ip  to the trajectory
huh
yes ive been trying to get roll out roll to zero just go ahead to zero im going to put it in att hold then it 11 take out yaw leaving pitch the way it is then were going to pitch down
we ye got to think about when we have to start changing that canister
fifteen even
huh
 to 15
what is it right now 03 08 51 02  nothing were not resding anything
well thats the one tey wanted you to leave in 03 08 5 lo yl 
its in thals how it triggers the  okay jack im going to push in on thim thing to stop it
yes
that just turned the master alarm back on now that its on steady ill leave it on i ca t understand why i got a power  oh i know thats right  that reading is correct
yaw im going the wrong way though arent i
laughter
okay what were going to do jack  over there 
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim it looks pretty good except that the pitch is going out in the wrcmg direction now over
i concur what im going to do is get roll to zero and im trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as i get those two pretty well matched up then im going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down
0keydoke
okay now ive got pitch going down ive got roll almost zero and yaw is almost zero
okay copy there jif
houston whats an acceptable pitch attitude that youll take
aquarius houston
aquarius houston over
roger whats the acceptable pitch attitude that we can have for pc i can go into auto any time now im looking at 118 degrees in pitch practically zero roll and about 40 de grees of yaw lafy 5 03 09 02 3 cc ninety cbrf pith
im looking at 118 degree of itch
stand by
im trying to talk to them
stand by a minute jim the pitch is tile important thing but  but stand by 1
okay its coming down whats that well i guess id better eat something hey this one has some of that candied jelly  you know weve gone a hell of a long time without any sleep i said weve gone a hell of a long time without any sleep
well have to start thinking about getting the  back to sleep again because  i know  i  i didnt get hardly any sleep last night at all
hey fred these jettison bags with the  are real airtight stuff if you want to use them for wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something like that
yes this stuff is really tight 03 09 07 h6 cdr yes
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim would you stable your  stabilize your rates here at the attitudes youre at now and go att hold over
okay will do i m now at 103 degrees  106 degrees pitch and 25 degrees roll
roger
no
 mine are  hey i got you a cleaa one
okay ape 547
last ones in the trash bag oh i thought  if you wanted a  youll have to use the lithium hydroxide 
okay houston are you monitoring my angles it appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second
stand by well check them jim
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim thats affirm were monitoring and youre almost there but wed like to let them stabilize a little hit longer over
okay well  well just hold
and if  if you can now go into your eat period or do something else while the rates are stabiliz ing why we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow
righto we 11 do that
aquarius houston owr
go ahead
okay jim looks like your rates are damped sufficient recommend that you go ahead with the verb 25 noun 07 enter bit on down through the verb 34 enter and then wish youd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that over
okay houston ill go through verb 25 noun 07 down through verb 34 enter and i11 stand by
righto
okay houston thats complete
roger houston copies and well  
you  monitor our rates
roger ij54
we
you want to monitor the rates were 1620
roger thats the way it should be done and were standing by for the rates to dmp out some more
okay
how you coming
oh were taking stock of how much we got there maybe sort of think about rationing some of it i mean just to make sure weve got enough to last us and that we get enough water out id hate to run out of water on the last day take a look and see how much we got and fill them up and just hold them there yes and ill tell you the stuff thats good to eat now will be the candies the sandwich spreads maybe the freeze  the dehydrated stuff if you have to rehydrate it itd be kind of difficult no wet packs are good
as a matter of fact we might use those little  well how about the plsss
yes i know but i mean the plsss are bombs too
were damping rates
well maybe we ought to use the ops first
you guys moving around
okay
apollo 13 houston over
go ahead vance
jim just a reminder any waste water dumped at this point would reall jiggle up the ptc prepa ration so request you save that until were spun up over 03 0249 cdr right i dorlt think wer doin ary ob 0a52 jo no no  ortthir obut  lutwanted to make suryou were aware of it  i thought you were
were saving all the water we can
 for a minute
with the new space  were  weve just about slowed down youre damping right
there she is 03 09 32 34 lm and houston aquarius
houston go ahead 03 09 32 4b cmp okay vance a couple of items we uncovered for that cartridge mod one is the special dust covering bag that we were oing to use on the tote bags that is pretty thick and nonporous and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and drained water a couple of more times and made up a whole bunch of drink bags again and from the pantry we retrieved a fairly large  enelose  enclosure made of plastic that those drink bags are in that i think we can scissor and also make do for a cover taping it on if thats appropriate 03 09 33 3h cc okay jack lousma here has a refined version of the procedure on how to make these the easy way and i thir before too long he ought to be read ing that up to you if  
okay 03 09 3b 53 cc its not time critical to get this up to you its just that before you get too far in assem bling these on your own wed kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here
okay who  who built them back there
tony did some of it anl jacks been woring on it too so weve had  big effort on it
great fag 356 to receivo that procedure but we can scld it up sooner if you insist over
no thats all right vance before we have to worry about that i guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through
thats rignt
you know sometimes those cartridges have  i guess they rejuvenate
aquarius houston over
man thats a wicked low pressure down there i wish i was on it laughter
aquarius houston
 up 
okay jim your rates are once again looking good so we can continue on with the rest of this procedure request you go ahead with the verb 76 enter and mode controi to att hold and then the last step 30 clicks yaw right
jets are firing again
okay ill do a verb 76 enter with the mode control att hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver
verb 76 enter
roger
theres your verb 76 enter mode control to att hold now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw
vance did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now 03 0g 37 04 cc no no need to hesitat you can start now
okay
after you get that going then wetii think about powering down the pgns
okay there were 30 clicks of right yaw
okay wed like to look at it for just a little while before we power dwn the pgns so stand by
understand youre planning to power down the fgns
right we want to get the amps down
okay
 finish 
thats bad news
take 26 pictures of you
wilynot u ujo  l you want vo orlng all ne llmback empty
id like to just  and shoot it
well that means ive got to 
hey let me see if i can get this started here
okay
hey jim
yes well probably get there 
aquarius houston request aft omni
you got it vance
roger that did it thank you
gad theres ptolemaeus and alphonsus
yes sure enough
see them right over the edge
here let me shoot a few pictures of the old moon here r3 av 43 15 cdr yes kcough  which ones  · did you put it back 
yes 03 09 43 2 cdr looks like we got  o do with earth ptolemaeus 
we need it to aline again
you dont think that burn was enough do you
was that a midcourse the rcs is worse
the rcs  attitude
 ought to come up the side then you got us in the right plane ti were in the right plane were pointed off and well swerve on again with the earth moon and sun 03 09 h4 52 cdr in another respect it might be easier to get a 
look in the rear detent now go to 
hows that
awful
oh thats right that blasted service  command module is back there scratch that one that one
its not much better okay lets go this one
keep the 
aqusrius houston over
go ahead
jim we have some status information for you if youre ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper
stand by vance
okay tpe 5412 fam 59 r 09 4frl d weircy ozyou
put that away and get some status paper here
go ahead vance
okay first midcourse correction will probably be at get 104 hours sd all we look for is a 4 to 6feetpersecond deltav okay thats the first item now i will give you a rmdown on consumables okay in the imyou lave 3408  that is 1 4 9 8 amphours remaining that means over 61 hours youd  elqatwould average out to 245 amps we expect that after powerdown that you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour and that would leave a reserve of 500 amphours at the end of the mission are you with me
roger were with you 0z 09 47 30 lmp i saved my  nberwae yesterday n3 09 47 33  okay in the lm you have
were with you
roger in the lm you have 215 that is 2 1 5 pounds of water usable that would average out over 61 hours to 35 pounds per hour available okay
okay and after you power down we expect that you will be using water at the rate of 32 to 27 pounds  thats at 14 amps per hour electrical usage rate one note this does not  when we speak here of water available this does not in clude csm water and plss water so thats added on okay next lioh using the csm cans you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per cam to give you 1 9 2 or 192 hours of lioh and in the lm using its cans you have 44 hours remaining
vance is that with the plss secondaries
thats affirm thats affirm that includes plss secondaries
okay oxygen you have remaining 44 pomds in the lm at a usage rate of 036 pounds per hour that leaves you 120 or 1 2 o hours of oxygen okay next rcs rcs a stands at 6 2 percent and b at 6 2 percent we only exu2 percent to be used for the ptc so your in good shape for rcs next dps deltav you hw  llq0 feet per second remaining and finay csm eps we estimate that you have 99 amphours thats an estimate and thats it over
okay i copy
okay and just a question it would be inter esting to hear from jack to see if he thinks vhat main b bus is good if he has any idea of how if whether its good or not this would influ ence our steps in the future for example we might want to try to test main b to see iiit is in fact good so that wed know how to set switches for entry
roger just a minute they want to know whether you thirfimain bus b is amygood for the eomnand module
v he  got on the loop let me pose the question of how were planning on doing this midcourse if we are going to power down the pgns
would you stand by on that jim wed like to give you a procedure for that later on
okay got a midcourse at 104 hours lies going to give us a procedure for that later on
in short jim we dont expect any problem but well explain further later on
okay
deke says get a nights sleep he says youve been working hard and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow
vance this is jack
go ahead jack
okay let me give you my observations on main bus b things happened pretty fast there and we first heard the impact or explosion or what ever caused it im not sure the next  about 1 second later there was a master alarm which was the main bus b undervolt i looked at the voltage tndthe voltage was good st hs time so im suspcting it was a spike maelcell 3 was also good with good flow ilowever fred at that point was coming into the command module and got over into his seat at that time we shortly had an ac bus 2 light about the time he got into his seat he looked at the min bus b and the min bus b was reading zero it however  and the fuel cell flows were zero im kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have a main  a current main bus b but thats merely a guess i never did try to reset it we were having other problems with the main bus  having an undervolt and a few other things like that id kind of like to hear what your feelings are down there
well jack we copy your information and wed like to hold off because were still working the problem so well have to give you information later
thank you
aquarius request aft omni 03 09 55 37 cml vance are you back with me
roger were with you
okay we lost lock there we switched omnis just for my own  kind of to get my thoughts in order id kind of hear what  id like to hear what kind of entry youre planning ems or pgns or what 
okay pgns entry is being planned and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort of thing
okay real fine
and  well  well give you the csm stuff to morrow but basically we expect that main bus b is good and were going to work up a procedure to test it
okay those are my thoughts too
but  
you think main bus b igood dont you 0309 56 39 cc thats alfirm wthrk it is but we want to check it out anyway we thirkyou glare in grcat sjap tlt theway around why dorlt you quit worryingand go to sluep
oh that  thats our boss deke 0 09 56 58 cdr well i thifixwe just might do that  or part of us will
i mixed up how many more of those  are we hob mike  
yes
yes im mixed up you had 157 i mixed up seven more so we got 22 by the way theres still some water thatts its not enough pressure to mix up another drink but there is some water out of there if you want to get some water out of the drink cup
thats good i could use some
we ought to use that oxygen up and not waste it cough
you monitoring right now
yes just stand by
whatll it take to 
yes
you only got two  there so 
i will
you wouldnt believe it but im now in command of the lm okay vance im probably the only
thats ever witnessed a dps burn sitting on the ascent engine head 03 09 59 33 iivlp did you get some is there any coming out still they didnt answer i think we made it hows this working out
okay no problem pace 363 03 09 59 55 cml they arhuh tow arlw going to get an alinrmont
well pul one out someways i gus weve gotta watch that one right there
its decreasing now itll  itll  its cold i noticed that n the command module itll wobble
houston aquarius
switch omnis to transmit
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
roger are you planned to set up here ery shortly  a powerdown procedure
thats affirmative if youll take out your contingency book and turn to page power 6 over
roger stand by contingency power 6 get the book over here contingency power 6
well i hope this 
and while youre doing that lets put afitude control three switches to mode control
ail three attitude control switches have been in mode control
okay and when you get to power 6 you ought to see a circuit breaker page panel 11
have a pencil lets see it  thank you
okay i have power 6 panel 11
okay on power 6 panel ll  the top three rows configure them as you see them
okay now jack  we have put the tcas in for the previous procedure do you want those out now
thats affirmative ji pull them out tcas open tape 441 itt 5011 first three rows and youre pull the atca pgns huh
thats affirmative pull atca pgns open
okay ive done that
okay are you ready for the fourth row
affirm
okay now when we get in the fourth row were going to open the imu operate circuit breaker and what that means is that were going to lose the capability to watch your cdus so were not going to be able to see your attitude there fore we will not be able to advise you on which antenna to select for communications the way we want you to hsmdle that is to turn the lm uplink squelch off and when you hear the nolse switch antennas well be able to see you switch mtemlas u zt going to    3 v 5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you switch after each time that you switch antennas we will initiate a voice check and basically when you see the earth out the window you can be on forward antenna and when the moons jn the window use the aft antenna you copy
okay were going to pull the imu operate cir cuit breaker so you wont be able to see om attitude therefore you wont tell us how to switch antennas and well enable the  i will turn the  up the squelch off so that when we start getting any static well switch antennas and as a thumb rule we could use  with the earth forward we use tile forward antenna and when we see the moon we use the aft antenna
thats affirmative jim in other words were leaving the antenna switching up to you and after you switch antennas its going to take 3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon again and well initiate a voice check and im ready to go on panel 11 row 4 apollo 13 airtogiound voce transcription tape 55 fr
okay
okay on row 14under heaters rcsystem abi open quad 1 through  under ecs the only change is  under glycol pump close auto transfer under comm the only change is open vhf a receiver open commander audio under pgns the only change is cose and leave closed imu standby circuit breaker so we can have heaters read back
okay on row 4 were going to open all four off the heaters  the rcs system a d b  the firt four circuit breakers were going to close the auto transfer were going to open the vhf a receiver and the commander audio and were going to close the imlstandby the lgc dsky and the imu operate wj 11 be open
thats affirmative jm all other bresders in that row are as you see them in the checklist and on row 5 the only change is no wu  you to under eps open ascent eca control over
roger i think we already have that opened  ascent eca control is probably already open
okay so let me confirm well have one comm system that will be the lmp system and well have to do our own antenna switching thereffore well have to wait about  okay why dont you switch aft antenna
well have to wait for you to get a lockon again is that correct
thats affirmative jim youll be working off of the lmps panel over there
okay what else do you have for me
okay panel 16 thats on page power7 top row the only change is under rcs system b open pqgsdisplays over
okay i may go over this with you jack be cause this checklist tas been written over two or three times now on our various procedures top row the first two are open the next three are closed and were going to open now the quad tcas 1 2 3 4 crossfeed will be closed and the temppress disflayflag will be opened and wcr 15oinks to open uf th lql 1ansov wijl b lzd and the  wi  end cjlo 09 26 cc thats affirmative jim and theres no ehane to the second row over
okay again et me ge through this wi hyou the first four are going to be closed the next sev  eight wilt be  the next nine will be open from logic power b through descent engine override iow about the cwea is that going to be closed
thats affirmative jim we want the next five closed
okay
okay in the third row under comm display open se audio closed vhf a transmitter open  thats a change  vhf b receiver open primary sband power amplifier open transmitterreceiver closed sband antenna open pmp closed tv open under ecs disrlays open glycol pump secondary open loc pump open cabin fan control open cabin repress closed and all the next four closed also read back 03 10 tl 12 cdr okay we have display open se audio closed vhf a transmitter open vhf b receiver open power amps going to be open transmitter receiver closed sband antenna open pmp closed tv open display is open next three are open cabin repress closed and all the rest closed
thats affirmative jffm and in row 4 under heaters we want them all  correction  we want all the quad heaters open correction  we want all the quad peaters closed
ail the  
we want display open sband antenna closed  to avoid a master alarm camera  sequence camera open and under eps we want displays open dc bus volt closed inverter 2 open ascent eca closed acent eca control open descent eca closed descent eca control closed translunar bus tie cose we want the cross tie bus open the bal loads closed bat feed ties closed how do you read jj   jj okay the four rc hfa2w ill b closed dtpiayr open sband aiitenfa c2ed camera equencl will be open display wi be open ic bus volt will be closed inverter 2 open ascent eca will he closed but the ascent eca control open descent eca closed descent eca control closed translunar bus tie closed and cross tie bus open and balance loads closed and the bat feed ties closed i have one question jack on panel  on the secod line there under lighting why are we keeping the floods and track closed or are they going to be open
negative we have thclighting breakers all closed control the lighting with the switches and rheostats over
okay we dont need the floodlights i dont think but we can do it that way i guess
and under row 4 under rcs systens ab2 quad heaters you notice that weve closed those circuit breakers but what we want you to do is to  on panel 3 turn the rcs ab2 quad switches 1 2 3 and 4 off over
and were going to watch your quad temps for you and when we need to warm them up a little bit well tell you to throw those four switches on  on panel 3
okay now are we sure that this ptc mode is good enough so we dont  get crossed up later and get out of configuration
stand by 1 on that jim okay jim as far as we can tell right now the ptc looks as good as any ptc weve ever seen in a csm so were going to go with what weve got
okay
okay and if you turn over the page on power 8 we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you weve got low bit rate tm however we dont have any vhf we have cwea we have glycol pumps we have suit fans we have cabin repress for you and stand by in attitude control here okay 5n attitude control well have hardovers for uses in emergency and for normal usage we want to have a 15minute delay to get th heaters on to warm them up be fore une how do you read 03 0 16 06 cdr okay ior emergency we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15minute request to get the heaters on 03 0 16 16 cc thats affirmative
okay jim that concludes our powerdown pro cedure and were waiting for you to get with it
okay jack well start i sure hate to lose e pgns i sure hope that procedure for the mid course is a good one
it is
you want me to help yea here 03 10 6 57 cdr yes you can  okay first we dower down panel 11 ail of them open
closed
yes
stand by for a master alarm  03 10 17 57 cm2 okay
here it comes
ltg you just did it
ill give you this when im finished after we go through this then you can go through it again and doublecheck it
right
now the flood lights are on right no i kind of dont think we need them though do you
dont pull those give me the  first of all well get back there 2hose four are close open open engine arm open 
say houston aquarius ljf3 cc go lead aquarius
it will take him a minute to 
youre familiar with our particular spacecraft that on panel 16 heaters rcs systems a and b quad 1 heater circuit breaker has been pushed in and sealed in and if its ever pushed out its doubtful if well ever be able to reset it
okay jim on the four quad heater breakers we want you to leave them closed and well operate the heaters with the switches on panel 3 over
okay 0r 10 23 27 cmp no
okay well do it right there 03 10 24 1i cdr okay and im closing the heaters on pane 4 quad 1 through 4 off
okay its time for you guys to get to bed and get fred up
laughter i still have one question jack i still think that  i still say that the  on the lighting in our panel 16 the flood lights and the track should be open were not using them
do you have any argument about 
no problem jim go head and open them track and flood thats all right
okay track and flood are open
now why dont you go through that jack and make sure those   03 0 25 10 cmp yes
 
okay ill take this
okay jack my only other concern now is the co2 rise in the spacecraft i guess youre keeping a handle on ttat    w that affiued jim w haw you ti to 106 now and were willing ogoa litte lighr on that we have another cartridge ami we have a procedure for making the command module cartridges up well pass that on later
oh yes im not worried about that i just wanted to make sure that you   03 10 25 46 cml are they going to  
  that  we just dont want to go to sleep here and forget about the rise in c02
are they going to use   
roger were watching it for you   03 10 25 5 cdr yes theyre getting it 
  we have it here its now 107 and we have a medical go to 5 millimeters
tats a new one
theres a new first for you
okay jim we estimate weve got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge and 6 or 7 hours on the  5     secondary
okay fine say its a spare primary cartridge back there too isnt it so thats good for another how long
yes yes thats yours though isnt it
and youre right jim weve got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover
right yes we know thank you
yes yes i just  03 10 27 51 cml okay i guess youve done everything right on that panel let me check the middle one yes you powered down and then you leave me tell me ive got it
okay jack we just thought its about time you got a lm checkout o 0 q  mt but h giving it to me inert f ourse tm fivtl him tiiv ncmhmutd mjlhj l wllih i iillrl iiirl iltl jhw i  03 10 32 cc well youvn ot to walbefore you run you know
aquarius houston
aquarius houston over
go ahead jack r g
roger for your information jack  
youre loud and clear
  all of our analysis is based on powerdown to 14 amps but were reading on you right now 123 and so were better off than we were in our analysis 03 10 3738 cmp that sounds good 
jack  i thought you were going to get the sleep shift where there wasn lt any excitement
well i tried but i didnt make it i thought you were supposed to he slepifig now
well fredo is getting something to eat and jim is starting to sack out so im taking the comm here until fred gets set 
okay
as i just  yes are you ready to take over well he just  he just asked  said he thought i was supposed to be sleeping and i told him that i was waiting for you to  okay you were off the net when they explained the  but dont they  cant we monitor our cdus any more to tell when to switch antennas so theyve just  when they can see it switch  it wl taae a couple of minutes for tem to get up and theyll always make a vice check with yu
it came out here i calffltjr okay now ar you getting quared aws 1 give you th conm here  l  4 ii1 i i nb  t  i  th  i i ill  ai   q i  i il itq r rll tilvwl w l 11if ii lw 4  ipi tm thr ir mrllvis  hasd on 14 so t ryre jn better  okay hadsets yours
okay jack how do you read
hearing you loud and clear fred 0mni
okay 03 10 h2 22 cc 0kay i heard the  
i see you luck out with all the good shifts
yes i got all the good deals i heard jack brief you on the comm mode so you got any questions about that 03 1 42 40 bm okay 03 10 24306 cc and how is your ptc going i heard jack tell you that we cant see your cdus hows it going
well lets see we may be offsetting slightly the sun looks like it may be a little higher now here comes the earth by and it looks about the same perspective ill have to wait to see the moon on the other side jack  03 0 43 37 cc okay fred i cant hear you any more on account of the background noise i assume that  i think i heard jack tell you what were going to do about comm uplink squelch off youll take care of the antennas because we cant see your attitude well give you a voice check when come up itl take us 3 to 5 minutes to come up and to mako it astronautproof when you see the earth ucc a forward antenna when you see the moon use thc alt one
yes thats pretty straightforward okay i see the earth so ive very wisely shifted to forward 03 10 4h 17 cc good boy
got another battery 03 l0 45 2 cm  really sck t 1 i0 45 4 im earth wi l be by over thrp jn a mnute 0 iq 47 24 imi and iaik yu tiil u
sti 1 hm it
okay when i was upstairs just a minute ago 1 noticed what appeared to be some new ventinxs from down the service module way i notced that out window 1 and also saw one chunk oi metal  loose metal about 4 inches square theft was tumbing around  silver in color d it looked like it had come from somewhere dow in the service module
okay you saw some venting out window l  
and i 
go ahead
yes thats where i happened to be looking the lighting was such that it showed up out there what reminded me of it was im looking out the lm window now and i sea a good part of the new star field its created for us there nrc about a thousand little sparmlies out here 03 jo 48 30 cc okay so youre seeing some venting out winaow l and you saw a 4inchsquare piece of loose mta which was silver and  are you still sein the venting or has it zeroed out now 1 ii448 lmp i dont know i left pstairs im dow in the lm now jack i guess when jack goes ua he can take a look and let me know okay ill think about switching aft here directy i see the moon and the moon looks pretty good jack so i guess our ptc still oing pretty good 03 0 49 09 cc okay and we wont have any comm delay if the ptc stays good 03 0 49 32 lmp yes sure enough the moon is getting smaller 03 0 49 37 cc good and we want to ask you another question about the venting is this  would you suppose  some new venting or is this venting that you just hadnt  thats been going on all the time but which you hadnt looked at recently tlp5510
i cant really say jack wew been so tied up down in the lm i guess we kind of forgot about the other half but ive been upstairs several times and hadnt particularly noticed any flow by the windows before so i  my first assump tion was that it was some new venting it real wasnt very heavy
okay copy thank you
and jacks going up to take a look now
okay and for your information all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps and were using only 123 so were a little fat on our analysis
very good way to be 03 0 50 52 cc and were in a  03 10 50 3 lmp ill tell you this aquarius has really been a winner
well thats one of several and we want to tell you something that i told jim earlier and that concerns control right now you have control in hardover if you need it but when we go to some normal control modes since we have the quad heaters off we want to have a 15minute notice for attitude control request over
okay jack offhand i cant imagine that since we got the platform powered down why wed need to worry about the instantaneous control but at any rate we need 15minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters 03 0 51 54 cc right and another thing weve done is to pull your ecs and epc display breakers and so  but we left your caution and warning powered up so if you get ecstype or eps caution and warning youll have to power up those meters with the display breakers and we are watching for you your pipa temperatures your asa temp your propellant temperatures except for the dps pro pellant and were watching your quad temps for you
okay thats very good jack youre watching them thats good enough tap 55ii 03 0 52 41 cc and everybodys fine at home e halo  5 50 m reat 03 o 52 51 cc and fred your co2 is building up its at 11 on our gage and weve got a medical buildup to 15 millimeters at which time well switch over to secondary looks like weve got plenty of lithium hydroxide about 192 hours including the csm cartridges and as you know weve got a way to use those and as soon as we get them written in some good words why well pass that along you might be able to make one 03 l0 54 3 lmp okay yes well sure give her a try and im shown g onboard about 1212 millimeters of mercury 00 54 24 cc roger and i have a flight plan update when you get a time to copy it sometime ill pass it alon theres no hurry on it
okay stand by 1 jacks back now 03 10 54 48 lmp okay jack just came hack and he said its still coming out its only coming out on the commanders side so he saw it out the saxnewindow i did window 1 and its between the minus y and minus z axis
okay and of course  
jack says its definitely the service module which was  which was my impression too
okay so youre sure its the service module and of course the thing were interested in knowing is it something that is residual from before or is it someting new and if you haw any ideas about that why we ure ke to hpj them
yes yes jack 1 onswrhim your utmr a minute but make lack firt jrrrin r is that its not nar th rtnity lnot il w right after our mishap and ii h l tir with that id say  he said it was a half and i said it was maybe down to a third and houston would like to know if you have any im pressions as to whether it is still a residual from that or maybe something new tape 552
i dont know why after i felt that yen i felt it was some new something  new ventin too 03 10 57 06 hi okay switch to forward omni 03 lo 57 1 cc fredo if you think its practical were ready to give you some  were working on some camera ettngs for pictures of the venting and if you have a camera out nd ready to go 1l us know which one it is so we can get the setlfls for that camera what do you think about thai 03 l0 57 30 im okay jacks got the one w th the 250millimetc lens on it thats the standard el and i hav a surface camera out that ive been shooting hundreds of earthmoon pictures with cnera 1 d we also have the reseau upstairs thats retty handy the command module dc camera o you can about    i 5o0 c okay i copy that   51 lmi   take your choice because   03 10 504 cc i copy the 250 millimeier the reseau is avail able but i didnt get what other one is 03 10 58 1 lmp okay i got my hasselblad surface camera down in the lm here handy oo camera 1
and jack if were going to do any picture ting out the command module windows i think wed better do that pretty quick or hold up until jim and jack get their rest done
we concur with that
okay fred were not going to bother the skipper up there we wont be taking any pictures out of the command module window until after rest period
okay
shifting to forward 0mni 03 i1 il 44 cc okay fred for your information your c02 read ing onboard is a little higher than what were reading here on the ground and so when it gets to 15 on your meter switch to secondary and wed like to get a status about every 30 minutes  well give you a call on that but just to let us know were still thinking about you wed like you to go biomed right please 13jl 2 14 i okay going biomed iliit ll11 13 57 im hoy how do you read me on this cop mode on b d
5 square fred how me 03 11 28 ob cc were still hero fred how il going
okay my co2 reading is now just below 13
say again what it is
its just  just below 13
okay just below 13 and just for your infor mation weve got people working on several subjects were working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select what we should do about the alinement weve got the lms and a cope of crews cranked up working on that aridwere also working on our entry how and when we ought to activate the csm and were working on the csm systems status to morrow sometime were going to have a main bus b checkout so weve got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and ive got some fstop settings for you for the lvanarsurface camera at 1250th wed like you to take targets of opportunity each picture use three fstops because we dont know exactly which one is going to work the best so use 4 56 and 8 and 1250th for the surface camera copy
okay use the surface camera at 1250th 4 56 and 8 and ive been doing quite a bit of shoot ing at covering two of those numbers in the range 56 and 8 ive also been shooting some at 11 so ill just drop it down a little more the moon is still so big and bright there that i got a feeling that the moon is probably up around the f8 to fll range
roger i didnt catch that last part maybe when the comm gets a little better you can say it again 03 11 30 h3 lmp okay how do you read now jack
thats a lot better fred 03 il 30 48 lmp okay i just said the moon is still so bright that i think probably the higher range of fstops will be better f8 maybe even fil 31 3 02 cc okay
i can just barely on the left corner of the moon now make out the foothills of fra mauro forma tion we never did get to see it when we were in close there
okay im reading on  monitor here fred that youre 16214 miles away from the moon moving at about 4500 feet per second
okay
from the sounds of all the work that is going on and is still going on this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here 03 li 32 41 cc yes youve been  youve been working it out a little bit
yes ive really got a tough job right now switching omnis
well everybody down here is 100percent optimistic looks like were on the up side of the whole thing now
yes i guess we had better be in good shape particularly ourselves rested for that entry day i think that is going to be a pretty busy one
right and were working on procedures for that kens been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry
very good apollo 13 airtoground voice traiscrzptio 6r tn  jij7 03 il 17157  ilowiluitffred 03 11 47 18 lm kay jut firle
okay were considering a midcourse correction at 104 hours  about 20 hours from now  18 hours from now and its only 7 feet per secon thu other option is to keep ptc up since we may 1lot be able to get back into it again and delay it so thats the type of thiniwere thinking about but  just wanted to let you know that youre pretty much right in the middle of lhe fairway there and our present tracking with no midcours  has you  with a gamma of 711 as opposed to 651 so youre already in the corridor youre just a half a degree between the center and the outer limits and were going to tweek that up
okay that sotmds good
and  we dontt  well we think there might have been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water dont worry about drinking water drink all you want theres plenty of it theres 38 pounds and the surgeon recommends that you use some of the fruit juices as well over
okay yes we went up and  and used the proee dure to pressurize surge tank and jack and i made up a total of 22 drinks of  drinking water
okay
and i assume that jack is up there sleeping now too right
yes thats affirm theyre both up there 03 1 49 40 lmp i hate to say it jack but i think our ptc is about to wobble off a little bit ive noticed that the earth is coming by somewhat lower in the window and the moon is going by somewhat higher
okay understand ptc earth is coming by lower and moon is coming by higher
yes o lj 1 5t cc and frd rm thi jerryrip ged ornmarldmodu lithun hydroxide carltwhrah wt rrjg to do is were going to have to me at least two up and use two at a time  one on each set of hoses what well do is well connect one of these jerryrigged boxes to the red fittings and air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out the blue fitting and were also going to when we do this remove the  lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loo either the primary or the secondary and were getting the words together to make it easy to build one of these things and it looks like it will probably take two guys so i think we probably ought to plan to do that later in addition we have to go up and get a couple of canisters out of the command module so it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on what do you think 03 11 53 17 imp y t agree jack yackswigert and  went upstairs earlier and both got a canister and we were scratching around for some material and thinking about using them and thats actually why  when we made up all the water to drink because we needed the plastic container that they were housed in in the pantry and we had that ready to use with some material plus some of the  the extra porous bags that were going to be used for the dump control that we may just cut up and use too
did you come up with a design or  
plus we got lots  
no we just thought wed see what we had in the way of material and stand by for your word of course we also have lots of stiffbacked card board flight data
yes we have decided to use a canister and you know that the liquidcooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use too or that we know we can use weve tried it so what you have is the  a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquidcooled garment the bag that is closest to the liquidcooled garment is the one we need and weve got two of them and then iage381 of course weve got to uc some tsp and as you say one of the backs to flight ttafile time line book or something like that aldjust using those materials we can make thi jerry rigged canister so the bag that wre lookil for is the one that is right next to the liquid cooled garment and if were very careful about where we cut it we cs make a pretty good rig
okay
it looks like well have to use that bag over again though because we only got two of them and i expect that well have to make more than two of these canisters up
roger
fred in about 4 minutes were going to hand you over to a different communications ste and its going to take us about a minute or so to reestab lish uplink so you can be prepared for that
okay jack
fredo weve handed over now how do you read
loud and clear jack
same here
in fact youre coming in a little louder
fred youll have to say again cant read you there theres too much background noise maybe we need a new antenna
okay im on the other omni now i just said that youre coming in even louder than previously
roger maybe its because im standing up youre coming in better now too
and for your information jack im just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other as sorted goodies
i presume that youre doing this with the full permission and  of the commander
and this  at this moment who do you think is the commander tp564 pag 3
if i was him id make you sign out everything you ate so id know
well im sneaking inside of the i2where he doesnt have  incidentally this ptc must have some  must have a wobble mode around our xaxis there because now the moon and earth are back in the right perspective
good lets see if it goes the other way 03 12 06 0 cc these guys down here are saying they knew it ail the time
well thats right they do good work whoever heard of doing a p52 in the lm
say fred sometime when youre not too busy chewing on that beef how about telling us what the co2 reads 03 12 09 ob lmp okay im reading 13 1 3
okay it looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours
yes it appears the wobble is going the other way jack because the earth is now rising and the moon is starting to get lower in the window
roger could you give us an lpd number periodically
lpd number yes okay
in fact if you could give it two or three revs in a row why then we could predict where its going and maybe help us set it up again if we have to
okay
okay the center of the earth has just gone by at an lpd number of 4
roger lpd 4 center of the earth
and the center of the moon is about lpd 21
okay lpd 21 is that the center of the moon you say
thats affirm
and fred were doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated our numbers were designed for 35 pounds per houri were using about 30 and expect to go a little bit less
beautiful
when this flights all over well really be able to figure out what a  can do
maybe itll make the 
if it had a heat shield id say bring it home
okay the earth went  just went by about  clear above the lpd index it was  it was if it were extended the number would he minus 6
okay way up there at minus 6
yes theres actually no such number i just extended the line beyond zero which for a nega tive rate is what it would be if there was one
right if minus 6 was there thats where it would be right
thats right
do you still have that superdense star field
its still there im looking at it right now i can look at  the sun is right behind me then all these sparklies show up yes it kind of looks like im right in the middle of the  of the milky way there are several thousand little sparklies at various ranges out as far as i can see 
theyre kind of interesting theyre all moving  and sparkling there and i can   at least i think i can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern particularly through 
okay so far we havent identified what the sparklies are and what is venting
yes i got a feeling that we pobab2y wont get any  until we pewer up
how you feeling fred
oh as soon as i chug down this grape drink and grapefruit  orange drink i think ill be in pretty good shape
how much sleep did you get between the burn  the time you got up for this exercise
oh id guesstimate about h hours jack wait a minute which burn you talking about
it was the burn we just made did you get any sleep between it and the time you got up for this watch 03 12 35 12 l oh no i didnt  i havent been to bed since all the action the night before and i went to go to bed for about 4 hours then 
yes
well were just trying to figure out whos likely to be the most tired up there you or jim
i think well get caught up pretty good in thc next couple of days
say again
we ought to get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days 03 12 38 56  okay jack the earth has started back down the hack on the lpd there was 1 degree
okay one degree on the center of the earth
that was a good tv show you put on the other night fred during lm entry
yes it would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later
yes things sure turned to worms there in a hurry after that show tpe 567 i i 4  i imi y your right 03 12 4 it ip okay the center of thc moon new ilbut minus 2 egrees deltav
minus 2 degrees center of the moon
charlie said to say hello
whos that 03 12 4153 cc charlie
is he still around there 03 19 h5 16 lmp unless my watch is wrong it says its almost 2 am hack there
no thats the bearded one 03 12 45 29 lm oh okay
iley tell charlie that ill be back down there personally to thank him for this baby
sure will i did
okay the earth went by there jack at ltd about 18 degrees
roger we copy 18 degrees for the center of the earth
okay the moon  id estimate it up around minus  somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees lpd
okay moons minus 17 to minus 20
how would you like to spend a week on an air craft carrier getting back
if i can get on an aircraft carrier i dont care how long it takes jack
theyre going to take you by helo to samoa youll spend the night in samoa get on a 141 and be at ellington shortly thereafter 03 12 56 46 i okay kind of sounds ike the original plans for the  03 12 57 211 cc had you worrying that youre going to spend the night on the ship helo to samoa ancjrclly to ellington
very good
boy these thrusters are sure 
fred im not reading you maybe wed bette wait until we change antennas or unless you ca speak up a little louder
how do you read now
better
okay the thrusters  and the  outside  and they hardly look like they 
gee im sorry fred were just not reading you right now maybe well have to wait a 2itte bit
okay
lets try it now if you can speak up thc back ground noise has gone down a little bit
okay how do you read now
a little better
i was just commenting  ive been looking here at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4 weve got a slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel the nozzles look like they hadnt ever been fired  like theyre brand new  of like those skinny things on the interior on the upper nozzle 
you say the coloration of the thrusters appears they havent been fired on quads 1 and 4
im saying all of them look clean again i guess theyve fired so clean that they dont seem to  at all  different color  copper bronze color of the oxygen cell theyve been fired be cause i watched them fre okay the earths going by at an lpd of 42
roger copy lpd 42 is that affirm tl 569 ijat387 03 13 01 03 4i thats affirm
and fred that may be why the com4is a little bit degraded more background noise because were getting out of attitude a little bit there 03 13 01 28 lm roger
how do you read on aft obfninow 
im reading you fred ive got a lot oibai ground noise looks like it might come and go with attitude 03 13 03 5h lmp yes i think thats probably  just looking through the command module at you now
how do you read now jack
about the sne fred 03 13 oh 52 lmp okay
okay and the moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees
okay the moon at minus 4 03 d3 05 2h lmp that  thats correct
okay your landing in  your weather in the landing area which is about 560 miles south of samoa is now predicted to be about 1500 scattered high broken waves are going to be 5 feet the winds are going to be 15 knots visibility 20 miles showers in less than 10 per cent of the area and you will be landing al 0800 local roughly
hey that all sounds pretty good
say fred did you get the dope on the saturn v impact  sivb impact
yes just as we came around the corner vance they told us that it hit  i dont recall the position now but it was a  impact  and recorded it on the  seismometer
yes it impacted 74 nautical miles from the alsep and the passive seismic detected major seismic activity on all long priod channels and this rape5610 wa  lh nl ivily win dlld l  1 hls niirwlrd wi iaibjjli a lfl  11j ld lj rrllnct lwn detctd by lhc litil ry chaunels  he highenergy chanl o1 the side
yes that ought to add  oll0 13 airtoground voice transcription 03 3 1 42 p okay re earth lpd number that time was 2
roger thirtytwo
how do you read now jack
im reading you fred ive got a lot of background noise though
jack i can definitely tell were moving away from the moon now i got it all in the monocular at one time were right over the top of fpa 8 right now
youre right over the top of what
on a point between it and censorinus  fpa 8 and  the point halfway between there and censorinus
fredo would say the checkpoint over which youre right now 03 13 15 56 mp okay and incidentally the deltav on the moon was zero so its coming back down the point looks like were just about straight over is around censorinus and the point between it and fpa 8
okay
okay and jack the earth lpd angle is 24 degrees
roger earth at 24 and it looks like youre getting up to about 15 on the c02 so we want you to select secondary and swap out the primary cartridge over
okay ill select sec0ary and swap out the primary cartridge
okay fred and when you select  when you swap out the primary cartridge dont reselect primary stay on sec0nary until we use the secondary up over
okay im changing out primary and  stay in secondary until we use t up lltt
and the change out is cnplete jack
okay copy the changeout complete and were reading 45 on the c02 here
okay im 
okay and the earth lpd was 8 degrees
did you  did you say 8 degrees fred 03 13 32 31  affirmative
okay
well i missed the moon on that one jack but i would guess  estimating back a little bit the lpd angle was somewhere around 42
fred im having a hard time reading you but i think youre giving me a lpd anglo
roger thats its jack the moon is about 42
you say the moon is at 22
four two 42
okay 4 2 thank you
how you doing there fred
okay fred i can just barely hear you saying something in the background and i cant make out what it is
hello houston aquarius
hello there aquarius oo ahead
roger and fred is being relieved now hes  went back to get some rest this is lovell here whos got the duty
gee whiz you got up kind of early didnt you
its cold back there in he command module j tpe c7 o pne 391 03 13 51 8 cc well what we were really thlnking about doin6 was letting you sleep a little bit 2onger because we figure youre pretty worn out
well ill go back and forth once in a while to get a 
is jack up there with you
no jacks still sacked out
okay jim were kind of watching this ptc a little bit freds been giving us a few lpd angles as we swang by the center of the earth  center of the moon we noticed that the comm has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up
roger understand
and we just went on to the secondary c02 canister fred swapped out the primary but we want to stay on the secondary until it is all used up
okay im going to use the tape  c02
were reading a partial pressure c02 of 42 milli meters were cleared to use the secondary until it reaches 15
okay thats good
aquarius in comparing ot initial estimates of water usage and electrical power usage it appears that were right on the money on water usage and were using a little less amperes than we had originally expected in our first analysis so were either right on the money or just a little bit ahead of the game in that regard
well that sounds encouraging jack
and there are a few temperatures that were watching for you you have the heaters powered down were looking at them and those include the pipas the asa the qad temps and your propellants except for the dps propellant tsye 574
okay ive got them here
we have as you probably know several groups working on procedures from here on out we have a group working on mdeourse corrections to determine a system the attitudes how to do it alinement techniques and so forth we have a group working on the entry including how and when were going to activate the csm we have a group working on the csm system status and in a few hours  later on tomorrow from where we see it were going to go to some base configuration on the csm and were going to conduct a main bus b check right now the comm is kind of degrading and i cant hear what youre about to say very well but i just want to keep you advised as to how things are going here and remember youve got duty on the antennas
aquarius are you reading houston
okay jim i can hear you talking but i cant tell what youre saying because youre way down in the background noise
okay can you hear aquarius now over
oh yes thats much better did you get my report on the various types of people and what theyre doing around here
roger sounds like you had things well organized you might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration  and what we can leave behind in aquarius
okay jim i didnt catch that suggestion on account of the background noise maybe we can pass it on when it gets more favorable 03 ll06 07 cdr im thinking in terms of stowage whether we would leave the suit  the hyeon camera in aquarius prior to 
okay i heard you say something about using the hycon camera in aquarius tane 7
negative jack im thinking of reentry towage attitude whether we should  what we hould leave behind in aquarius leave the suits behind leaving such big items as the hycon cneras in aquarius over
oh understand youre thinking about stowage whatll we leave behind in aquarius when we fall back into odyssey is that right
thats affirmative
okay weve people working on that too
and we presently are tracking you at 22 500 mles from the moon moving out at 4400 feet a second
aquarius roger
and jim earlier in the evening we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of pot water you can drink but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to theres 38 pounds in the potable tank and thats about all youll need the doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want too
roger jack
jim earlier in the evening fredo reported some venting out of window number 1 in the command module he also reported a piece of loose metal about 4 inches square silver floating by and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual venting of our original problem do you have any more words or conents and one thing he was doing was taking some photographs and we authorized photographs targets of opportunity using the lunarsurface camera number 1 and use the setting of 1250 of a second and not knowing precisely what fstop to use we suggested taking three of each using settings of f4 f56 and f8 over
roger jack the ventirg really seems to  i reported earlier i alsc spotted the large piece go by and prior to our  burn  the venting you see now is much greater  went into the dark mode you could easily distinguish stars paae 394 and idnt haw · tho brifgt rticrm lrd rght pjo toarapll  03 ih 16 09 cc okay jim once again i hear you taking hack there but i can only pick out a few words maybe well have a better time
aquarius were trying to improve our communica tions could you turn the biomed off and give us a voice check please
voice check follows 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 voice check out ob 14 17 18 cc okay jim that seemed to be better
how are you doing there aquarius 03 4 31 08 cdr were doing good jack
okay sometime when you get two guys available there and you could construct one of these lithium hydroxide rigs id like to have you get the materials together and well go through the steps together
okay sounds good and how do you read me now 03 ih 31 33 cc well there is a lot of background noise and sometimes it is worse than others and right now i hear you better than i have in the past
okay jack im kind of curious the amount of perturbations our ptc attitude is taking y notice that we are getting off attitude and im just kind of curious how far we can let this go
we were tracking the attitudes with fred earlier and it looked like what we were doing was oscil lating about some point but coming back are you detecting some kind 2f divergence now
not too much i notice that its different than when i went to sleep we are more at an angle now with the terminator of the earth so when we started out we were just about parallel with the terminator and now e are canted off somewhat i havent seen any trends though of going back and forth tape 57 ob 4 33 08 cc and jim our current plan is to not correct he ptc were going to take whatever we get and live with it and we can kind of keep track of whats going on a little better if when you swing past the earth and swing past the center of the moon if you could read off the lpd angles for the center of the earth and the center of the moon over
roger will do jack and im looking into the aot now to the right  no the number 4 detent and we are venting something back there i can see particles moving on past the command module what it is i dont knew
okay can you identify the quadrant
well im looking through the right rear reticle now of the aot and when i was back n the command me i could see it out of the cm i window the particles are rather small but they are coming out with some force thats probably what is disturbing our ptc attitude 03 lh 34 50 cc yes that sounds quite probable jim thats about the same report we got from fred tut we havent been able to identify what they might be and probably wont be able to until we crank up the csm if theres any change in that status why we just want to keep advised of it
roger understand
and aquarius we are setting a pretty good vector on you now and it looks like youre a little bit outside of the corrldor were looking at a 7footpersecond midcourse at 104 hours we are going to come up with an entry interface minus 8 pad to use in the event of a loss of comm situatior
roger understand and i hope you have that pro cedure for attitude
we are ginning up a procedure for attitude for you jim for the nocomm case it may be a little different than wiat the guys working on the procedures come up ith for the burn at 104 hours
roger papc 578 yagc 2496
what im saying jim is the guys who are working on this attitude situation for the burns havent made their final conclusions yet but in the interim period we want to come up with something you can use in the event that you lose comm
i concur
houston aquarius the earth is going through the 10degree line or angle of the lpd
okay we copied 10 degrees is that earth or moon jim
that is earth
okay earth 10 degrees thank you apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription 03 1 45 53 cdr and houston  as we  no  has mn smfe of about 24 degrees orthe lpd
okay we read 24 jim
thats affirm
jack  the lpd on the moon now is 22 degrees
okay im reading you better jim say again please
roger the lpd now on the moon is 22 degrees i missed the earth lattime ill get it this time
okay twentytwo degrees and looks like weve come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns probably the ones that well use from here on out
okay jack stand by 1
its going to be a few minutes before im ready to read it up to you
okay
jack on the first of the lpd angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line
okay just went by minus 2 degrees is that on the earth
thats the earth now i dont know whether were oscillating back and forth or not jack or whether its a continual motion well have to see here
roger
okay jack the moon now has an lpd angle of 10 degrees
roger the moon at 10 degrees tate 58i
okay jim just as kind of a leadin to this procedure that were oing to use for the mid course burn id like to say that were going to use ags and its going to be a manual burn the attitude will be controlled manually the startstop on the engine will be controlled man ually so we have a pretty good vector on you now and it turns out youre coming in a little bit too shallow so at that means is were going to make our burn to come in a little more steeply and were going to be coming in around the dark side of the earth therefore to come in more steep our thrust should be in the di rection of the sun does that all make sense to you
i think so were going to use ags for a burn monitor the burns e going to be manual md theyre going to be started manually and stopped manually
okay and your reentry is around the dark side of the earth and since were coming in shallow were going to have to burn toward the sun to make it steeper do you follow that
thats affirm especially these burns will be perpendicular to our flight path and to the sun giving a steeper entry angle
okay jim i heard you say perpendicular to your flight path which is affirmative and i didnt get the rest of your statement
i understand the technique jack were burning to give us time to steepen our entry angle and it will be perpendicular to our flight path for corridor control
okay thats affirmative so in general terms what were going to have to do is to power up the ags and bring up the ags eightball and then to set up your atitude put the coas in the front window and guidance control will be in ags of course but manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the earth directly out the zaxis then rotate about the zaxis to place the point of the crescent on the yaxis of the coas ld this will have your plus xaxis in the direction of the surl as we discussed before so the crescent will be up with the point down copy that
okay jack well have to o over hat again the coas will be out front wirdow well place the earth in the center of the coas and lets see the center of the earth right now is paral lel to the lpd which is about parallel to our xaxis and well have to rotate about 90 de grees to get our xaxis pointing toward the sun
okay jim so we want to get the yaxis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting the points of the crescent on the yaxis ob 15 09 35 cdr roger understand
seriously jack when i stop the spacecraft looking at  at the earth im going to have to roll  in lm terms roll the spacecraft 90 de grees to get the tip of the earth all on the yaxis
thats affirmative jim youre going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus xaxis at the sun and put the crescent  the points of the crescent on the yaxis the points of the crescent on the yaxis with the coas pointed at the center of the earth will take care of your yaw and your pitch
roger
okay jim after you get that orientation to come in a little more steeply we perform an ags bodyaxis aline which is at 400 plus 5 on the deda if the ags ball is up at this time the ags ball will go to 000 we can talk more about control modes later but wed recommend doing this of course in ags attitude hold  attitude hold put your yaw to mode control and leave pitch and roll in pulse therefore con trolling your attitude with the ttca we dont want to use the gimbal so have engine gimbal off well make these burns at 10percent thrust well use a aanual start and stop for ullage well use the plusx translational button and ullage will be for 10 seconds over
okay i understand what youre saying but youll have to repeat it here pa 400 o 25 13 j5 cc okay well pcrlorm lhh lufri i iulmci coi trol to ags and moit contiol to attude hold your attitude control switches will be roll to pulse pitch to pulse and yaw to mode control so the ags will control your yaw and you will use the ttca to control pitch and roll engine gimbal off 10percent thrust start and stop manual for ullage use the plusx translational button 10 seconds ullage over
okay for the burn there will be go to guidance control ags mode control att hold attitude control switches will be roll pulse pitch pulse yaw mode control well use ttca control for pitch and roll engiie gimbal will be off well be using 10percent thrust well start and stop manually the  control ullage will be a plusx translational button and also our thrust will still be but before that we are going to do an ags aline  ball 
thats affirmative jim after you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in do an ags aline which is  an ags bodyaxis aline which is 400 plus 5 when you get enter this will bring ball up to 000 and i want to confirm that you  that you said engine gimbal off 0ff over
roger confirm that engine gimbal will be off
and jack how long do you estimate the length of the burns will be
okay the length of the burns are going to be probably less than a minute and we want you to have cutoff based on time so we will give you a burn time and i have a p30 maneuver pad for midcourse7 in the event that we lose comm if you are ready to copy
okay jack ready to copy
okay jim p30 lm maneuver pad the purpose is midcourse7 noun 33 is 134594298 noun 81 is na ha is na b is plus 00205 deltav r is 00193 burn time 039 008 000 the rest is na thrust will b at 10 percent read back
ail right this is midcourse7 corridor control and its in case we lose comm 134594298 noun 81 is na 42 na plus 00205 00193 burn time 039 008 000 ail the rest is na thrust 10 percent
okay jim thats a good readbaek and in the event of lost comm use the procedures that i gave you it may be that between now and tomor row these procedures will change a little bit so well go with what weve got now and stand by for something better if it comes over f 03 15 19 28 cdr okay jack im looking at your burn pad and i see that the  total gimbal  193 feet per second
okay jim we verify 193 feet per second for 39 seconds
the old midcourse technique sounds like some thing that we came up with on apollo 8
yes everybody wondered if you would remember that by golly you did
hey jim i got a little bit more information  maneuver pad i got latlong range to go verb 10 and get if you got a place to copy that down ill give it to you for ems
okay stand by
go ahead tape 51 age 02
okay jim i just have the asr three blocks noun 61 latitude minus 02162 ongitude minus 26537 range to go 21629 verf 103621 get of 05g is 142h130 read back
i didnt get the latitude but the longitude is minus 16567 range te go 629 veocity 36291 1424130
okay jim the latitude is minus 02162 i iave a correction on the longitude  minus 16537 go ahead
roger jack the latitude is minus 2162 longitude is minus 1637 and this goes in conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave us
thats affirmative that means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7 and this is a horizontal inplane burn plus x toward the sun 193 feet per second
roger 
and jim on the  setting up the ags right after you do the 400 plus 5 you should do a 400 plus all balls and one other point we want to clarify is that we know that youtre sure that this burn will be made with the plus xaxis pointing at the sun to make the entry angle steeper you got it
thats right jack what im going to do is  well stop with the earth in the commanders window the coas down and then im going to maneuver the spacecraft so that i have the lighted portion of the earth at the top of the window that is the coas will be along the plusy of the spacecraft and the top of the window  of the rendezvous window i should be looking into the sun that means ill be burn ing towards the sun and steepening the angle
thats affirm jim i  you got the attitude right and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls after  you do the 400 plus 5 that is a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back to back tape 59
roger i have copied that
jack  this is aquarius im not to sure h long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory however you might kee a check on that it may have been going on fsr some time
roger jim weve been taking a look at it we havent been able to detect it on the doppler however
roger
but we think its pretty small
and houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
jack would you give me a time hack on an even get so i can start my watch
okay coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes we will be there in 30 seconds set it for 8735
just give me a hack at 88 hours
okay ill give you a hack at 88 hours thatll  be another 25 minutes
ail right thanks auilo l3 aiitoiulii voice taiictiption yaeiu4
louston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay jack lets just talk over how im oin to get to the attitude aad then do the burn what im talking about is the control techni4ues the way it looks now ill try to stop the ice craft in yaw with the earth out my window ien well be in guidance or well be ags control well be in  yaw will be in mode control then well be using the ttcas to control the pitch  d then control the roll i dont see another way we can control the combination that we have here without using the ttcas then we will also use the ttca during engine burn do you people con cur with that technique 03 5 43 05 cc jim that sounds like the one that is best to use to me let me talk jt over with the rest of the guys here and well advise you
okay
jim in that control mode that sounds lijethe best way to go the only thing youll have to do is to get attitude hold in the ags and so before you start to maneuver youll have t bring the ags up and get a 400 plus all zeron in there and then ags will respond in yaw when you go to mode control that is ags will con trol your yaw in mode control and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in pulse with a ttca after you get in attitude then youll have to redo an ags body axis aline which is 400 plus 5 then go back to 400 plus all zeros again
right jack that was my next question i dont want to aline the ags ball 000 until i am in po sition so we use that as a primary attitude burn monitor device
and jim you can do a 400 plus all zeros any time you want to that just tells the ags that you want it to control your attitude should you go to attitude hold in mode control 03 5 48 19 cdr roger i understand but after we tt to the attitude we12 do a 400 plus 5 to met the agf aline ball and then well do a h00 plus zero
affirmative
another thing jim is while youre maneuvering to that attitude using  to control  if you find out enroute to that attitude tltv you didnt quite have the yaw where you wanzed it to be you can use your aca and tweak up he yaw and your ags needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors
roger sounds good
jim youll be splashing down about 560 miles southeast of samoa at about 0800 local time the weather forecast for the area is good 500 scattered high broken 10mile visibility the seas will be 5foot waves 15 knots and youll  going to o by boat nnrarrft youll spend either the night on the boat or in a and return to ellington by 141 on saturday the following day
roger would you tell the people of the lrl to turn it off
oh no were going to do the whole bit
and dont forget my hack at 88 hours jack
say again please aquarius
i want to get my time hack at 88 hours
roger that will be in about 612 more minutes
roger

standing by for the 88hour time hack
okay we got a minute to go
okay coming up on the 88hour mark i1 iw you a 2second delay stand by to mark
mark
i got it
how are you doing jim
pretty good jack say you might have the peo ple look at our dps burn card to see what changes have to be made on it for the burn
heard you say look at the dps burn youll haye to say what about it again please
roger jack you might take a look at our dp burn card our checklist card that we have in the lm and see what changes might have to be put in that checklist
okay dps burn card
howre you doing there jim
okay jack it appears that were going  funny diversion here the ptc attitude in  in pitch im going to do a lpd check now but the last time the moon went around it was above  way away above the lpd angle and i see the earth coming around now which is going to be pretty low they oscillate back and forth but each time they seem to get a little farther away from the center line you might think of some pro cedure to reestablish ptc if itts necessary
okay
jim the only way we know of yettintthe as ood or a better ptc than youve got rtht nw is  crank up the g  n and we  we dont want to d that so our plan is to just take whatever  get out of this and later on it may turn out by the time you get to burn attitude youll ce right where you want to be
okay well just leave her go
houston aquarius
go ahead
whats our course of action to set up ptc after this midcourse at 1077
we thought youd ask that
the only thing we can try to do jim is toet the thing up manually and see what happens thcre must be a better answer than that
okay
  and one course of action is to omit the mid course and make a total midcourse say about 8 hours before entry we havent decided yet
right now were talking about a 7footpersecond midcourse at 104 hours and extrapolate that down to about 8 hours before entry we gave you a pad for that  thats about only 19 feet per second so if it doesnt change too much  and we can get all kinds of dps
understand sure like to keep this vehicle in the corridor though
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
can you think of any normal venting phenomena that might occur like maybe  a hydrogen tank thats overpressurized relieving in the window
yes we thought of that jim fage 408  16 5 u i that ion poibiiity ijjal wv ihouht of d ira tacau  wc hatd ilf 1hat thk jrld wf havent been usin any hydrofen and therefore it could be venting in the overboard release
right the only other thing i can vhink of when i look at it through the aot is  it did appear to be coming from one spot but thats the only difference although i cant see where it is com ing from because its beyond the curvature of the command module but it appears like it  irbt be coming from more than this one spot
okay thank you we hope that when we crlk  the command module tomorrow that well be able to  or later on today  that we will be able to identify more closely what its been coming from but the guidance guys say that they havent been able to see the results of any venting in their data and it would take a very very small rnount to perturb their data
well thatts a note of encouragement
music
you got a chinese band going up there
oh sorry i forgot all about hot mike
sounds pretty good
jim weve had you scheduled for an eat period about an hour ago i suppose youve taken care of that the other thing is were kind of in terested in knowing how long youre going to be at stick there or if youre going to go back to bed or what
okay jack were  were going to set up a regular watch and sleep period here fred was up for a long time so i got up a little bit early to relieve him jack and fred are now asleep so im going to let them sleep as long as they can and then well have an eat period and then ill go back to bed for a bit and well separate the schedule
okay were right at the point now where according to the flight plan that we had made up for you that you would have all linished eating and you and jack would have the duty while fred went to sleep so essmtially according to the plan weve got you got ud ab 3 or 4 hours early and  the next time that  have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours which is 7 hours from now and an hour before that say at 95 hours all three of you would eat and then you and jack would hit the sack again and fred would have the duty until 102 hours wed be glad to take care of this workrest cyel for you
okay thats good let me  let me wait until they get up or at least jack gets up he should be getting up before fred and well try to get back on the schedule i hate to wae everybody up right now though if theyre sleeping
okay your choice on that as soon as jack gets up id suggest we go ahead and break up these lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of them jack could work on that its going to take four sets of hands i think
okay well make that the project getting the lithium hydroxide canister squared away a ll0 13 airtogrohd voice traa ription apo611 age il0 17 58 2 cc aquarius ttouston over
go head itouston
hi jim weve got a flight handover in abeut 2 minutes and well have a temporary loss ef comm you dont need to switch antennas over 03 17 58 42 cdr okay fine
aquarius houston through madrid for a comm check how do you read
loud and clear joe how me
okay jim
 asleep 03 18 06 146 cmp i  maybe  hydroxide 
 on secondary well let it go to 15 why dont you get on a headset and ill be down  for 
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay· jacks up with me now and you all  procedure for making these lithium hydroxide devices and soon as he gets on his helmet hell be ready to copy and then hell get started making one
roger that jim understand  
on second thought 
go ahead
ill give jack the headset for a while and hell  copy down your instructions  03 18 08 30 cc okay jim i didnt c3py your second thought· over   1 o j   cii j jv nk thl hcltl t rind let him copy the instruct ion 03 8 08 43 cc okay jim the way i thought it might be best to do it would be to have you gather the eouir ment and let us talk you through your procedure while you do it now maybe you could give jack the headset and  and  get the equipment to gether and well talk you through the procedure i think itll be a little easier to do that way than if you tried to copy it all down  and then go do it
okay do you have any equipment listed i just get it and give it to him and i can just sit here where i am
okay i think the equipment youll need will be two command module lithllm hydroxide canisters a roll of the gray tape the two lcgs because were going to use the bags from the lcgs and one  one lm cue card  one of those cardboard cue cards which you will cut off about an inch and a half out from the ring now i think thats all well need over
okay  okay houston
hello houston
go ahead jim
okay thats two lithium hydroxide canisters one roll of that special gray tape two lcgs which were going to use the bags from one lm cue card and 
okay thats affirmative jim if youll just cut the cue card which is a handy piece of stiff paper the right size about an inch and a half from the rings just cut off the ring holes in other words and youll have a card about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide something like that
okay  ill have jack gather up the stuff
okay
 that roll of gray ape 03 15 11 34 cp  okay  and  plastic bs
yes bring il down hee one lm cue card i get that
okay i got the canisters
okay houston aquarius
yes aquarius houston go ahead
we have gathered the materials and i can put jack on the headset and he can copy the instruc tions  do you see any need for  or should i copy it to give them to him or do you thnk theyre too detailed
why dont you pul him on the headsets jim and ill read it out to him
okay
okay joe 
okay jack did anybody ever tell you that you got a 60day extension on your income tax over
yes i think  i think somebody said that when you are out of your country you get a 60day extension
okay right okay im ready to start into the procedure when you answer me back speak up  speak wp into the microphone because our downlink is pretty noisy the first thing we want you to do and well do this on one canis ter and then let you go ahead and repeat it on the second so take one of the lcgs and cut off the outer bag by cutting along one the heat seals do it carefully and close to the heat seal because we may hve to use the outer bag if we damage the inner bag so go ahead and do that and then well do the next step
okay take an lcg cuthe outer bag by the heat seal be careful not to damage the inner bag right   23 46 cc riht lust utalong one ide ji i 4 50 cs iiy llouston odyssey  or aquatiu wovo douc that
okay jack now  now remove the inner ba from the outer bag and cut the inner bag also along one of the heat seals down one side
okay remove the inner bag from the outer bag cut the inner bag along the heat seal along one side
okay thats correct do that and report
okay joe weve got that done
okay jack now you can put the lcg itself that is take it out of the inner bag put it in the outer bag and stow it some place we recommend ui but you can stow it wherever its convenient
 outer bag  ld stow it back in 
okay joe weve got that
okay now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide canisters and let me describe which end is which its approximately square on one  one of the vented flat ends has the strap and that end we call the top the end opposite we call the bottom is that clear over
right
okay ive got it joe
okay now then were  we want you to take the tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long or a good arms length and what youre  what we want you to do with them is to make two belts around the sides of the canister one belt near the top and one belt near the bottom with the sticky side out wrap it around sticky side out as tight as possible itll probably take both of you to get it nice and snug over
okay now 
okay now weve got to make the belt real taut here ape 615 03 18 30 2 cdr hows that 05 1 30 35 cp real tight and thn 
okay joe
okay jack did you have   03 8 33 19 c   hey houston are you reading
jack  
  weve got the two belts around the top and the one around the bottom all done
okay fine the next step now is to anchor that tape and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide and youll wrap those around the canister at right angles more or less to the tape that youve got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom and when it goes across the top and the bottom put it so that its outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens so that it wont block the flow is that clear over
yes joe very good
okay press on
okay ive got a cut length right here and well tear it lengthwise  and im going to go around right here at this ridge all the way around at right angles and anchor it 
yes
joe just to clarify that sticky end down right on the tape that i am putting on now
i didnt quite copy that jack say again
okay that will be the sticky end down on the container right
oh thats correct i forgot to say that thats right tap61d pag41 3135 33 cml  hold that one right here if i can st it
okay joe aquarius weve got that done
okay jack the next step is to get the eva cue card and use it to form an arch over the top of the canister just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it forms a rounded arch over the top of the canister you see jack what were going to do is slip the bag over this whole assembly and the cue card will serve to keep the bag from being sucked down against the screen over
okay i got the idea
okay and when youve done that to hold the arch in place just run a strip of tape across the side of the  that is across the top of the arch and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side u o no  ulv okay i got the idea okay let me just repeat it here take a cue card form an arch over the top bringing it under the side here when were through run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side
thats correct
okay it worked
the top  across the top
looks like youre going to have to cut the cue card slightly
doesnt have to be really  over that the only thing were  we can just take the scissors and cut off the edge here the only thing this does jim is prevent this from being sucked down into the container
still going to need some more tape cut off the end okay whack off the bottom 
okay joe weve got that arch built and its all taped in securely 03 ir 43 41 cc okay jack the next step is to stop up the bypass hole which is the hole in the center of the bottom of the canister we want to stop tat up because we dont want to bypass the flow and i forgot to tell you to get something to stick in that hole we recommend that you either use a wetwipe or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there or you could probably even crumble lipsome tape and use that over 03 18 4 13 cmp okay well start plugging up the bypass hole
okay
plug that hole we can either  we can put some either  lets cut a piece of your towel there
sounds good apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
okay houston aquarius we have the bypass hole all plugged up
okay aquarius the next step is take the inner lcg bag that you cut open and slip it over the top of the canister when you do that orient it so that the ears of the bag that is the corners should stick out on the closed end  are oriented along the open ends of the arch because were going to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in pull it down until it fits snugly over the arch over 03 18 47 56 cml okay joe slip the bag over the canister so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the ears are along oriented along lets see  i guess it would be  would be at the sides of the arch
depends on whe you mean by sides  over the  the open ends of the arch
right the open endz of the arch
okay 03 18 49 17 cml okay joe weve got that done i
okay now press the bag against the sticky belts that we put on the sides of the canister if there is any excess material just kind of pleat it so that it makes a fairly tight seal and then take another 3foot strip of sticky tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the bottom  the bottom sticky belt  to make a nice tight seal
okay ill do it okay now they want two strips around here to make a tight seal
okay joe weve got the canister inside the bag two strips around the sides of the bag real tight and both sealed
okay real fine now theres probably a couple of inches of excess bag sticking our around the bottom of the canister to prevent this from sucking in against the bottom screen wed like you to trim it off with the scissors and when youve done that wed like you to cut two more strips of tape about 12 inches long or so cut the  tear them lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and 12inch wide and then use those four strips to secure the bag by passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other side and when you do this just as you did on the top make them go outward of the hole and in between the screens over
okay you want me to trim the excess material thats sticking off here trim it at the edge of that canister or do you want any excess left  over
no you dont need to have any excess just trim it approximately level
okay lets do that first 0b 18 54 58 cmp okay now joe you want to cut four strips 12 inches long each 12inch in diameter tape that along the outsides of the bag across the ribs
okay
thats correct jack thats just for additional security on the bag when you get those done youll have  youll have two strips going one way and the other two will be perpendicular to them
okay houston aquarius weve got the four strips in place ob 18 58 ob cc okay were in business now with the bag and the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit hose either the commanders or the lmps because were  were going to want you to have both of these made up eventually into the top of the  of the bag and to do that you first of all have to assure that the  that the red hose is separated from the blue hose i dont know whether this has been done already but if it hasnt what you have to do is cut the outer betacloth sheath down the full length of the  of the hoses and then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses together and the hoses should come apart and the comm cable should  should come off over fagc iii l okjy tdeth  irn golg to want to separate th red hose from the ue hone by cutting this belnclchh qfath ok rfhat irwork 3 18 59 15 cc okay o 19 00 52 cmp okay houston aquarius i have the lmps red hose separated rren ihe ehers 03 9 o1 o0 cc kay rea fine now the next step s to cut s diagonal hole in erie ear of the  of the plastic bag near the arch you can pick either one and cut about a 112 or 2 inch diagonal hole big enough bo slip the red hose through and when youw dorl llml  youll jtst slip the red hose through so that it goes about to the center of the canister ils  its  its not critical except tltthe opening should be down and then ape the ml 1c the hose where it goes in so that 5 o nice trod nu1 over · 03 19 o 40 cmp okav copy that we want a 112 5nth hole right hero at this ear and put the hose in here end down and toward the canister and then we tape the seal around here 03 9 02 10 cmp lets try il we can always make it bigger ii we have lo fred get those  the center of the arch 03 19 02 52 cmi got to  got bo come in towards the center all the way to the enter no no 03 19 06 7 cmp yes i tant fietthose big knobs 03 19 08 39 cm  al we have to do is  tape around here  tight fi1 lb19 10 16 cdr there it s right there
okay iiouston aquarius 3 19 10 20 cc aquarius jjozston go ahead 03 9 10 26 cmi okay our doityowsef lithium hydroxide canister change is complete joe the only thing different js that our arch on this piece of card board is not big enough to position the red hose with the inlet down and the inlet  the inlet to  to the red hose is lying on its side but i think itll still work
okmy jack  concur i think itll work too theres oue step that i omitted which you can do now qult conveniently arid its this where you stuff tho towel in the bypass hole orithe bottom we rcconnmend that you cut a few short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesnt fall out over
okay will do jim ive got one more little thing to do and thats  seal that top
okay joe thats done 319 12 30 cc okay jack now the remaining steps are simply suitloop configuration steps to get this thing into full operation and our ecs people want to hod off on that until the canister youre work ing on gets to 76 millimeters of mercury which will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour  it  were reading 47 now so what wed like you to do in the interim is to set up the second command module canister the same way you just did the iirst one using the commanders hose and get that all set and probably about that time itll be time to  to switch over for your in formation when youve got that done and if youve had your breakfast and so on the next thing ive got for you is a switchconfiguration list for the cormmaridmodule which will represent the  the powerdown square1 starting configuration for all our  our preentry checks over 03 9 13 39 cmp okay well start setting up the commanders hose configuration the same as the lmps hose and ill get  instead of  i guess you want me to use my launch   launch checklist which id 
thats affirmative jack what we have done is marked up the liftoff configuration checklist and well run through it whenever you get around to it 03 19 14 ll cml and i assume that 
what id better do is before i put this thing back in operation theyre going to complete that other canister i dont know it should be in operation now  03 19 15 05 cfp kay iouston aquarius 0 19 15 07 cc aquarius houston go 03 19 5 12 cmp okay joe should this canister be in operation now because its already mounted on the hose suit loop to get full flow through there and its okay the way it is what i recommend you do with the commanders hose is get the bag all ready but not stick the hose in until we call you on it okay 03 1915 39 cmp okay will do ob 19 16 45 cmp it wont go around 03 19 j7 04 cm yes or else a strip of tape
okay jim weve got lo start setting up the commander s ob 19 18 22 cdr you can get one of the cards and ill start cutting the  bag
yes  show how about that  because ive got two in my  03 9 20 52 cml yes here well store them back where i got it 03 19 2 06 cc hello aquarius houston
go ahead
roger jack tom here just thought i would pass on to you and jim that got a little data priority going today and going to convene to cpcb and well have you all kinds of good procedures for later on over
okay thank you tom you guys are really work ing overtime
were getting a little coordination down here
aquarius houston you might pass on to jim he had such a long day yesterday we thought we were going to have to play him some guitan music to get him to sleep last night over 05 9 21 52 cmp hatsexactly what he did tom said you had such a loi6 day yesterday be thought he was goang to lw to play some guitar music to get you to s lcel 03 9 22 13 cmp okay lets getthis tape around the outside

okay you can get those configures when you can and the next order of business ive got for you is a procedure to verify that main bus b is good and a little after that well want to read up to you for your future information a procedure for transferring lm power to the command module over 03 20 39 33 cml okay that sounds good you want to get this plss configuration done first before you give those other procedures huh
yes i think so stand by 1 second and ill see if flight has any words for us before you start that
jack houston over
go ahead
okay we dont have lything for you our only concern is that youi wake up somebody is there anybody sleeping right now
no were all sitting here eating im just going to get a bite to eat then ill write down that switch configuration or ill copy the procedure now if you want
yes okay understand they are all up did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now over
i can iiyou want its your choice
id rather you went ahead with the switch con figuration jack
okay lets do that and then ill be back with you
okay see you later and tell jim that deke wants him to go to bed
okay ill tell him that right now
okay
ill tell you ill get my switch set done first before i eat so i wont disturb jim any
aquarius houston over
go ahead
stand by 1 minute jack before you go in there flight has got one other item for you
deke wants you to go to bed
right now
 like that  i got up about 1 hour 
you know what i thought  i think what we saw venting was the result of our deltavs stirring up things popping the relief valve yes we dont see anything venting now 
okay houston we are standing by 03 20 44 2 cc aquariu houston over
kay joe 03 20 44 jt cc okay jack you can go lead and set up that switch configuration what we are discussing is having you activate the main bus tie motor switches a little later on simply to verify that they will be okay because the batteries are probably getting a little bit cool but well be back to you with a procedure and discussion about that after you get the switch configura tion set up over
okay im going to go get the switch configura tion done now before jim goes to bed so i dont disturb him
okay real fine
jim thirks deke sounds like frank borman on apollo 8
laughter okay sorry about that
im going to give the comm to fredo now
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay before i hit the sack joe i just want to make sure  how are you still planning an
at 107 and whats the latest find
okay jim we are still gathering our thoughts on the mcc but some of the considerations go like this fido tells us that we can do that correction probably as late as 118 hours with no significant deltav penalty and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that weve done the right thing and to set you up for a late mcc if we need it which we probably wouldnt we are happy with the ptc mode that you are in now alld although we are working up a  an ags ptc mode to use after the mid course correction wed kind of like you to stay in this ptc for a while because it is doing good we are looking at the weather in the landing area we dont think well have a problem but we are checking it real close ami if hcrjs any hanging that we want to do wwnt ijgt it irttihjmjdcourse corretion ami forrraonsllkt3mlwo are consirbring possibly delaying the mideourse correction from 104 hours to some timc between there and llj wed like to know what you think about it over
we have no druthers as long as we do the mid course and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse thats my only concern
okay jim roger that and based on fidos input that hed like to do it not later than 24 hours before ei we will be doing it prior to 118 hours
okay
hello houston aquarius
aquarius houston go u3 u o o ivw question joe jim has been talking to me about how we are going to do this midcourse and awhile back when we went through this power up we had pulled the stabcontrol asa breaker i was wondering  we lost the heaters in the asa  i was wondering how it looked what kind of shape its going to be in 03 20 9 18 cc okay stand by on that one fred
okay
fred houston
go ahead
roger i am told that wed see 38 degrees for that package and itll be okay for the burn were massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time
okay very good
and i dont know if jack passed it on to you but jack and i just finished logging about 6 hours sleep each paso 1442 03 1050 5 jo roger fred copy that is it a ittie chilly up there
yes we made the mistake of putting up the window shades which we wont do again and with this powereddown mode were not generating much internally and it really did get chilly
yes i guess youll have to generate your own heat in there for a while
deke says unstow the fergenie
okay
aquarius houston over 03 20 57 52 tjvfp go ahead tfouston f20 57 54 cc fred just wanted to let you know in advance that were coming up on the redline c02 value for the secondary canister and we expect to get there in something like a half hour at which time well be asking you to switch over to the command module canisters i have the rest of that procedure ready and i just wanted to warn you a little bit in advance over
okay and ive got a question for you joe
go ahead
okay the  i need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface  is that con tainer also completely airtight okay to use it to put iluid in through here in zero g
fred i didnt copy what you wanted to use it for over
fred houston well have to stand by for 1 minute we are in a noisy state of comm
okay how do you read now joe
oh thats much better go ahead i20 59 6 im okay i ws just ldorigto j we havent had aroverboard waste water dump since clear back lrordthe olher side of the moon about this time were running out of the bags weve got on board here
okay im  im stupid this morning fred im not quite sure what you are getting at o 2 00 14 lmi okay joe we need some place to put the urine
okay il sounds to me as if the suggested re ceptacle is perfectly satisfactory do you think you can use it in its present configuration
oh yes we got all the innerconnects  hookups we need but i wasnt sure if that gadget was devised solely with the 16g environment in mind and whether it might leak somehow in zero g
ill have them verify that but off the top of my head im sure its going to be all right well check it fred
okay
okay how do you read joe 03 21 11 53 lmi houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay joe one thing ive noticed that a couple of circuits there now  the pulse   at least the number of them is markedly de creased and  rather bad and apparently that added venting we had out of the service module was some overboard relief valve maybe letting go because it appears to have stopped now
okay fred copy that thank you
houston aquarius 03 21 23 7 cc aquarius houston go ahead
what do you read down there for partial pres sure c027
oh lets see were reading 66 right now fred what do you read 32j 23 ij aboltt j25  gness weve got a  i l m   g ggf flrllm i did just get a master alapvi and no trmtinnigltwe kind of figured thats what it was with c09 approaching itslimit maybe it didnt quite come out here
okay ietme get a go and i think its time for us to go ahead and put these other canisters on sand by  03 21 24 08 lp okay we went to 15 on heprimary last night before 1 changed it and 03 21 2116 cc roger thjt fred we wanted to  
  i dont haye a steady  i dont have a steady ecs light on at this time joe so it must have just been a momentary
okay we know when you went to 15 last night on primnry we want to switch out today at 76 let me check and see iiwere ready 03 21 24 111 lmp okay
yes thats what it is joe ive got something going on this alarm  ecs light
fred houston the cohm isnt too sharp and i did t copy
okay aquarius houston  
ttouston aquarius how do you read
  why dont you try it now youre loud smd clear now fred 03 21 26 42 lhp okay i was just  im getting master alarms every few seconds and i am catching a glimmer now of the ecs light for the time being i have    open okay now we got the ecs light on steady
okay copy that you have the master alarm with the ecs light we are ready to go ahead and get you on the command module canisters and as the first step id like to know whether youve inserted the commanders red hose to the second canister bag over tbo 6314 03 21 27 29 i okay ys sure enough the commaders red hose is inserted into the canister bag
okay fied the next thing id like you to do is to tsdesome more gray tape and tape over half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles the coanders and the lmps the reason were doing this is were going to be running this loop through the secondary lioh canister hole with the canister removed and we dont have the flow restriction we need to keep the separator from overspeeding over
okay yes thats right so we want to tape over half of the  both the blue and the red commander hoses is that right
negative fred thats half of the cormnanders blue hose and half of the lmis blue hose  the outlet hoses 03 21 28 3 lmp oh okay ill tape over half of each of the outlets stand by
okay
okay im going to turn off one suit flow valve at a time while i am doing the taping joe
say again please fred
okay while im doing the taping i have that particular suit flow valve in the suit discon nect position momentarily
okay fine
okay how do you read now joe
okay fred reasonable comm are you ready for the next step over
okay one correction  the red hose thats con nected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the lmps  wait a minute
okay fred understand only the lmps red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag in that case we would like you to follow the pro cedure for inserting the other red hose in the other canister bag as follows you cut a diag onal hole in one corner ofthe bag look at the oher bag and see how it was done stick the hose in about 6 nches try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can or else sideways and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal over
okay jacks back in here i guess he can do that stand by
okay
how do you read joe
okay fred is that done over
no thats still in works i just wanted to comment you might pass on to steve grega we thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures they went to making up these little boxes
okay we appreciate your appreciating it were oust aving a ball down here working on all kinds of new procedures fred the cpcb is in session and we expect to have your entry procedures out here by saturday or sunday at the very latest
saturday or sunday
at the very latest
take your time jack
why dont you run that other hose back up in the tunnel so jim can get some air
yes i got it
and joe how you read now
satisfactory fred go ahead
okay back to the condensate container i guess the only question i really need answered is will it leak
is will it leak oh yes stand by 1
and weve checked all the fittings and i know i can hook everything up to our ucds so if it doesnt leak we can transfer
okay fred we still dont have a final answer on whether or not iti leak if you need it i8 go ahead and use it and standing by for your completion of the hoseinsertion procedure
okay the hoseinsertion procedure  the second cartridge is complete
okay thats complete the next step is to switch to the primary co2 canister and remove the secondary canister and stow it over
okay im going to have to get off comm here ill let jack get the headset
okay
hey joe im on the headset now
is that secondary  secondary
both cartridges are out
okay joe fred has the secondary cartridge out were back on primary now
okay jack the next step is to place the com mand module canisters with the hoses attached in a suitable location to permit the bottom of the canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape them in place ideally well it doesnt matter just  just pick out your own spot a0ll0 13 airtcorouid vtice tiallscripteli v   1 tatu 4ht
okay im ilcto toll you where they are theyre both situated as you say with the bottom o the canister exposed to free air and one is sitting right by the  the lmps is sit ting right by the eps panel and the cdrs is up in the llililioi
jack houston the c0 gob real noisy there and i didnt copy that stand by a moment
okay joe how do you read now
okay thats rea good jack go ahead
okay the canisters are situated as you  as you would like with the bottom of the eanister exposed lo re ar 0b 21 56 17 cc okay
the position of the lmps canister  the lmps canister is sitting on the eps panel now and the cdrs canister is positioned up in the tun nel
okay ileal fine jack the next step is to physically separate both blue hoses a good dis tance away from the canister so that we dont short circuit the flow and tape them in place and the ideal location for thm would be up in the turmel so as to get ome flow into the com mand modtd e over
both hoses in the  up into the command module
oh you can use your judgment on that jack wed like at leash one arid the reconnendation that i got was bo put them both up in the tun nel
okay we have the lmps blue hose up by the lmps window and the  of course the red hose is separated by some 4 feet and the  okay were going to  and the other hose  the  has the extension on it  the cdrs blue hose of course has the extension on it and its blow ing way up in the command module and the red hose is about  oh its right at the docking ring where the blue latches are so theres about 4 or 5 feet difference from there too is this satisfactory tripe 642 il 44
okay jack that sounds satisfactory the next steps are  are suitloop conliguration steps and the first one is to
okay suit div  
  is to place the suit diverter valve to the iullegress position
okay suit diverter valve to pull egress
thats affirmative  
thats done  
okay the next step is cabin gas return to egress over
kay jack did you copy cabin gas return to 03 2 59 32 cmp no i didnt get that joe cabin gas return to egreso
thats correct
okay thats done
okay next suit circuit relief to close over
suit circuit relief to close
roger
okay i got that done
okay and the last step is select secondary co2 canister well let it flow through the empty hole and lets see how we do
select secondary c02 canister
roger jack that completes that procedure and the next thing ive got for you is a procedure for going back into the connnand module and power ing up the main buses temporarily using the bus tie switches we want to do this for two reasons first of all we want it absolutely verified that tap 643 il i50 there arcno loads on the main buses that weve goteverythijtg ofland that the buses look good and the second thing we want to do is to power the bus  the main buses with the bus tie motor switches and then depower them by pulling the circuit breakers leaving the main bus tie switches in the on position just to assure that theyll be there when we need them whether the batteries get cold or not over
0kay joe how you read
better now jack satisfactory did you copy my rationale for the main bus powerup
yes i did you want to remove  you want to power up both buses with the bus tie motor switches first of all to see that there are no loads on tho buses and second and then depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers to insure that the motor switches dont  that the bus ties stay on so that theyre there when we need them
thats correct jack are you ready to copy the procedure
okay go ahead
okay as the first step i have one change to the basic configuration that we gave you and its two more circuit breakers that we want open on panel 225  are you ready to write that down over
yes im all ready joe go ahead
joe im all ready go ahead
okay on panel 225 we want the rendezvous transponder flight bus circuit breaker open and the sband n transmitterdse flight bus circuit breaker open over
okay tv re1tdezvous transp0hfder flight bus open tv sband transmitterdse flight bus open on panel 225
okay thats correct jack and now well go into the main bus powerup procedure and the first step there is on panel 5 we want the bat charger bat a charge circuit breaker closed and the bat charger bat b charge circuit breaker closed over
okay thats bat charger bat a ctarge bat charger bat b charge both closed on panel 5
thats affirmative we need them closed to power the switches next on panel 5 we want the eps sensor signal main a and main b circuit breakers closed over
okay panel 5 cb eps sensors signals main a and main b closed
okay thats affirmative we need them closed so that you can read out your volts and amps next step on panel 250 we want circuit breaker bat a power entry and postlanding and bat b power entry and postlanding closed over
okay on panel 250 cb bat a power entry and postlanding closed bat b power entry and post landing closed
thats affirmative and at that point wed like you to check the bat bus voltages on both bat buses to make sure we dont have any shorts over
okay read the bat bus voltages on bat bus a and bat bus b
thats affirmative the next step on panel 275 circuit breaker main a bat bus a closed and circuit breaker main b bat bus b closed over
okay on 275 circuit breakers main a bat bus a closed main b bat bus b closed
thats affirmative e next step on panel 5 we want the main bus tie ac switch to the bat ac position and verify proper voltage on main bus a and read the amps on bat a to make sure we dont have a short over
okay  pag452
okay dack houston were in had comm again lets wait a minute
okay how do you read 
thats better jack go ahead with your read back
okay place main bus tie ac on read main bus a current and voltage
okay thats affirmative the next step will be the main bus tie bc switch to the on position and read main b voltage and battery b amperage as above over
okay main bus tie bc on read main b voltage and current
okay that is correct then to reconfigure from this configuration jack we want you to leave the mai bus tie switches in the on posi tion and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you close them over and do you want me to read them up individually
no let me see if ive got it here i go down to panel 275 open cb main a bat bus a and cb main b bat bus b then i go down to 250 and pull cb bat a power entrypostlanding and bat b power entrypostlading and then up on panel 5 pull eps sensor signal main a sensor signal main b battery charger bat b charge battery charger bat a charge and then close  i dont know whether you want me to close the rendezvous radar transponder flight bus and sband transmitterdse flight bus
okay jack we dont want you to close those last two those are changes to your basic con figuration and we want to leave them open for now over
okay ill do that was the rest of the read back okay
thats correct readback was 100 percent and well wait to hear from you
okay joe and just for confirmation i went through the switch list you gave me we are in exactly that configuration with one exception and that is over on panel 382 i have not the a  h20 accumulator is in the off position so that if we need any more water we can get it
okay roger jack copy that on panel 382 youve left the h20 accumulator valves in the off position and we concur
okay and theres one other thing that i dont know whether youre aware of we have no lithium hydroxide canisters in panel two fif in  can isters now so when we get ready to power up youll have to remind us when you want us to add some
okay jack we copy that thats correct and ill add that to our basic checklist so that we wont forget it
okay real fine joe and im on my way back into the command module
good deal
thank you
how do you read joe
and joe how do you read aquarius
aquarius houston pretty good go ahead
okay im back on the line now but jack really  headed back to the upstairs bedroom
okay roger that fred
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay fred we recommend that you push your master alarm circuit breaker in so youll have audio and visual on that and also we medical types are getting to feel left out down here and wed like you to give us biomed  position if youre plugged in for it and well see whether it affects the voice or not over fage 454
okay
hey houston aquarius on down voice backup sband how do you read me
aquarius houston read you now satisfactory or 22 14 36 tmp okay amdthats rrs 
okay thank you very much fred
actually a good deal of that little power pack heats up and 
roger that
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go alead
okay jack just  himself back down and after he put on the 250 bat a bat b breakers he read bat bus volts as 323 on a 370 on b he then punched in the 275 breakers which tied the batteries to the buses and at that time he read the a bus volts 320 on a zero amps 370 on b zero amps
aquarius houston the comm got noisy there and i want to make sure we get these numbers right so id like to ask you to repeat them 
okay how do you read now joe
okay probably okay fred read it nice and slow so well be sure to get it over
okay jack pushed in the 250 bat a bat b entry breakers iferead battery bus volts as 323 on a 370 on b then he pushed in the 275 breakers tying the bats to the main buses in this con figuration main a is at 320 volts zero amps main b is at 370 volts zero amps so it looks like the buses are okay
okay fred copy those numbers and thank you very much i assume you got them off all right
thats affirm we got all the breakers pulled again
okay real fine
hey houston aquarius how do you read
aquarius houston go ahead
okay how did our  configurations appear to be working down there
im sorry frd but we got noisy again there
okay let me know when you want me to try it
okay that sounds better already go ahead
okay id just like to  hows  hows our litho cartridge setup  appear to be working down there
we are reading 02 on our c02 sets here and wefre all delighted it seems to be working fine
boy that is great
amd fred houston in a little while here im going to have a procedure that i want to read up to you and have you copy down for futture use its a procedure for powering the command module main bus off the lm and its something that we feel thats going to come in real handy later on for such things as popping off the command module entry batteries and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the command module before we get rid of the lm well have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes over
okay okay joe thats good sounds good
roger
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay fred our proceduregenerating mill has generated another very short one for you here its a procedure for getting an onboard readout  
stand by 1 joe
okay 0 22 37 02 lmp okay joe go ahead 0 22 37 05 cc okay fred this is a procedure for getting a readout of the descelt propellant tank temps its no big problem but our lm people say that the bottom of the descent stage is probably cool ing off and we just want to verify that the descent water tar will be okay right now it looks as though it wont freeze until several hours after its empty but we want to have you read these temperatures out to us so we can see how good our predictions are the procedure is on panel 16 close the propellant displaytengine override logic circuit breaker over
okay the propellant display override circuit breakers are closed  the propellant
right fred the next step is simply to turn the propellant temp press monitor switch to descent 1 read the fuel and ox temps turn it to descent 2 read the fuel and ox temps tell us what they are
okay on descent 1 i get a fuel temp of 665 degrees ox  on desce 2 i get 
okay fred were in noisy comm here i got descent 1 fuel 665 stand by a second
okay how do you read now 
thats better go ahead
okay you got 665 on descent 1 fuel temp oxidizer temp is 66 degrees
okay copy  
on descent tank 2 fuel is reading 60  okay descent 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees oxidizer 65 degrees
okay copy that fred thank you wed like you to pull the circuit breaker and well prob ably come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another check
okay the panel 16  engine  override is open 03 22 4019 cc roger
aquarius houston over
aquarius houston over 03 22 4 u p go ahead
okay were chasing a small glitch that we saw a while ago in the 02 flow rate which is now normal again but what wed like you to do is first of all to tell us whether during that canister procedure you moved 02 dand reg a to any position other than cabin and then wed like you to move it to off momentarily and back to cabin for us 03 22 47 39 lmf okay to answer your question joe its no i checked the cabin all the time qualitatively wertch to this configuration it didnt seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise  decreased  logged down a little bit but ill follow your procedure you want me to take reg a go to close and back to cabin is that correct
thats correct fred
okay were in close
okay
now im back to cabin
okay thank you very much fred ill get back to you if we see anything
music  the age of aquarius
 thank you
hey have you guys got a woman on board 03 22 50 57 hip no way i could handle that
and joe do you have the  out for the 
im not sure i copied that fred if you asked me whether i had that powerup procedure i dont have it for you yet over 03 22 5l 54 lm no the question was do you have a  from the moon burn
still didnt understand fred im sorry
okay well be able to get better comm
roger
okay
fred houston you want to try it now
how do you read houston
thats pretty good fred
okay two things first of all we noticed a o ns oo h n  l darn  zt  you started taking it got noisy again fred try it again
okay
try it now loud and slow
okay jack had a question on how far out from the moon are we now
on how far out what
from the moon we are now
oh our little plot shows you just touching the 180thousandmile line so youre about 40 k out from the moon
okay okay and the other thing is weve noticed some fresh new particles floating around outside so possibly the service module is start ing to vent a little bit again
okay copy that fred on the 02 flow thing we clearly saw the demand regulator go to off and back to cabin telmu  thinks that its no big thing that youve seen a little change in flow due to the different resistance weve got in the circuit
roger
aquarius houston
go ahead nuoov cv okay fred recommend you o to off on the biomed switch we never did get any biomed and it might clear up the comma little bit
okay owyou read now
okay fred that might be a little better
were on the 180  k line right now
were about 40 050
 its 550 over there
okay its  there
just split the difference
yes
okay i got a copy of the  k 
is that right
eecom
that midcourse should be interesting you know the mode were going to do it in
manual ags  dps burn were controlling  ttca attitude 
 down under 
fortunately
we cant help them too much actually it isnt bad  but  goddamned unfortunate in part i get a feeling  now when i get  just before  goes to zero in 1 second im going to pull them out 
another burn thats never been done
go to the  go to the technique for a lash and  its the burn technique
im sure they got something written out maybe 
a what
well hell jack ail you  you dont use a very good one  just if youll go  at your atti tude reference for  and the gmeter backup because really you can almost  the command modmle and your odds are 60 to 40 that youre going to hit earth bluntend first without any reference 03 2b 00 38 cmp  i didnt realize that that proves youve got a little bit above 50percent odds that youre going to enter blunt end and 
we made an entry like that in apollo 8 in a  with houston o1 buzz went and turned on the command module heaters and left them on the activators they went shooo both tanks we had no gas just had a real slow rate  we actually went out in the console and started debriefing but left it running and watched it and the son of a bitch did a hopskipout a hopout underneath  but not much and then we did a long hop  but  the second reentry also it did one  both times it lucked out twice and made a real peculiar  they went to zero g 
yes
yes we did jack  03 23 ob 36 cmp  but were in this wobble
 pass  then itll come back down
hey aquarius houston how do you read me
aquarius houston okay go ahead
okay joe it  our wobble in this ptc has picked up where the moon is running by pretty high in the window and the earth pretty low so i expect  on the side where the moons present wr havilg a little bit of trouble with the comm  breakout there in a couple of places
okay roger that fred 03 23 08 33 lm  pressure gage as far as the noise  get the thing from the aft 
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
okay joe im all set to copy that procedure for powering up the command module from the lm whenever you want to give it to me when did you i guess you want to put battery a out of the charge huh 0b 23 09 32 cc jack were not certail when the best time is to implement this procedue and what we want to do at this time is read it up to you so youll have it and ldrstaad it and well  well be able to do it quickly when the time comes and i dont have it for you quite yet over 03 23 09 56 cms laughter okay ail right ill be standing by to copy it whenever you get it
okay jack 03 23 1 34 cc aquarius houston over
joe i got to swtch antennas here okay joe i read you on the forward antenna
okay jack i have the procedure now to read up to you before i do i want to mention something that will be of interest to fred we are looking at the she tank pressure rise and we expect it to blow we dont know exactly what time it will go somewhere around 105 hours or perhaps later than that weve got plenty of blowdown capability we just thought you ought to be informed
okay stand by ill tell him now
okay
fred they said theyre looking at the she tank pressure rse and they expect it to blow some where around 105 hours  okay fred thought they did  03 23 2 48 cc okay real fine are you ready for the procedure now jack
yes joehow long is it is it a big long one or a short one or a medium sized  about how many pages
its about  id say 15 to 20 steps jack some of it is lm stuff and the rest of it is in csm
okay i got a fresh page here and im ready to copy
okay ill give you the lm steps first they have to be done first and the first step is on panels 11 and 16 circuit breakers ascent ca asc eca two to close
okay panels 1 and 16 cbs ascent eca to closed
okay next step panels 11 and 16 cb ascent eca control two to close over
okay on 11 and 16 cbs ascent eca controls to close 03 23 14 9 cc okay thats correct the next step is bat 5 and 6 normal feed to high those are switches 03 23 14 41 cmp okay bats 5 and 6 normal feed on
thats correct next step bats 1 and 3 to off slash reset over
bats 1 and 3 to off slash reset
tats correct next step wait 30 minutes for preconditioning
okay thats wait 30 minutes for preconditioning
thats correct and the last lm step for now is bats 2 and 4 to offreset
okay bats 2 and 4 to offreset
thats correct now well go to the csm and the first step there is connect lmcsm lmbilical over tate 6416 pae 1463 03 23 1 7 cc   iini  ts i1 3lilei  lj em fw iljjj md 1 powfi2 haiij b both closed over 0ii 23 16 43 cmp okay on panel 5 cb lm powert main b and 2 main b both closed

kay and ih be rafy5o implement this when ever yeti call it i1
roger ih 03 23 22 514 lmf and iow do 3ou read lee
pretty xood pred
okay wimc ack was on conm i was looking out the docklnt wirxtow eleand i could see another good shower off prtices coming out of the service module and thc position thls time appears to be on the onnor sin 3eore wed always seen them out of window 2  ndwhere im looking at it from here it ooks ike itd be down below window 6 somewhere in lac service module jacks going upslah s tnqee what it looks like up there
okay good deal we copy that fred and to show you how relaxed we are about the entry ken is looking at  giving you guys a chance to  prior to going into entry prep to snap a few pictures of the service module
ken is huh laughter
yes hes got all that film up there and he doesnt want to waste it
oh i thought maybe youd want me to do a plss eva to go shoot pictures or something
okay okay
youre right we got a lot of pictures
i guess i agree it surely would be nice to docu ment it someway f we can but it doesnt look like 
yes we think itd be a lot of help
joe how do you read me
aquarius houston go ahead
okay the condensate transfer worked great
stand by a mine fred were in a bad comm mode
okay hows that
thats better
okay the waste transfer into the condensate can works real well joe
okay good deal
so i guess we can keep fid0 happy with no over board dumps
roger that 03 23 27 14 l yes that brings up one more possibility joe
say again fred 03 23 27 23 lmi brings up another possibility now that weve got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can we could probably blow all of that through the plss  i wonder how the sublimator woald work on waste water
it might work if we had to do it fred end of tkpe apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription tape ro
that brings up one more possibility joe
say again fred
brings up another possibility now weve got all that stowed and the bags and the condensate can we can probably blow all of that through the plss setting i wonder how the sublimator would work on waste water
it might work if we had to do it fred right now were looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator we were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the plss to ascent tank watertransfer situation and we decided not to do it not to recommend it because we figure itd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks which you have to do in order to get plss water to it and wed rather use the descent water and we dont think weve gotten any sweat over
okay joe i dont think theres any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to
okay copy that
and how do you read joe
read you pretty good fred go ahead
i think our ptc wobble is growing worse the earth now is really up to the top of the window i have to get way down almost to the floorboards to view it conversely the moon is way down at the bottom of the window
okay
a lot more wobble
roger  
far more wobble than i noticed on my previous watch
okay copied that fred and our thermal people will be looking at it one of the things were talking about reative to the midcoulse correc tion is wed like not to do it before thc siietmk goes if its going to go just so it wont give us a problem reestablishing ptc and right now our people think that the burst disk will pop around 106 hours
okay 03 23 h4 27 lmp the lshaped bag is 
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay fred since you went ahead and used the plss condensate container we got the procedure in for using it im not going to read it up to you except that it cautions a little bit about shaking it too much or about filling it too full because they feel that if you do that the vent valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little bit over
okay we havent removed it from its stowage spot we just left it right in place and just  he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that
understand thats satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot that should help the situation
roger
we got a  we got another flow shower going on outside particles seeing them vented against the service module jack thinks it may be an h2 vent 
okay copy that what window are you looking at it out of fred
out the lm docking window
the docking window roger that somebody just handed me your latest consumables status report and youre using between 11 to 12 amps an hour real steady and it looks real good
roger
joe what are you showing for get now
i think you wanted the get jack and the present get is 96 hours 21 minutes over
okay thank you
okay
and jack houston for your information fido tells me that we are in the earths sphere of influence and were starting to accelerate
i thought it was about time we crossed thank you
roger
were on our way back home
theres something that puzzles me joe vance mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a cmcguided entry so im kind of curious as how are we going to get the alinement
did you say how were going to get guidance over
no how are we going to get a platform alinement
okay we got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one ive heard is to power up the lm platform and aline it and aline the cm platform to it
okay that sounds good
okay and were working out detailed procedures on that jack
okay
aquarius houston over
go ahead joe
okay we are taking our final look at the mid course procedures and we have a question as to the tape 65 present position of one of the switches the switch is the ags status switch on panel 6 wed just like to know where its at 04 00 37 27 cm okay stand by
okay joe the ags status switch is off
okay off thank you apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay vance i just heard a little thump sounded like down in the descent stage and i saw a new shower of snow flakes come up that looked like they were emitted from down that way weve already decided though  i wonder what the supercrit pressure looked like now
okay understand you saw a thump in the descent stage and a few snow flakes well take a look down here see if we see anything
aquarius houston
aquarius houston 04 01 16 l0  go ahead
fred we dont see anyhing wrong for example your she appears to be okay as far as we can see the thing we dont have data on is the  tank down there 04 o1 16 30  okay and i doubt if it would have been that anyway
okay while we have you on the horn  
were still getting 
roger still getting it
go ahead
while youre on the horn be advised our calcu lations show you might be running out of potable water in the csm pretty soon also that you might start to have hydrogen tank venting in the csm and a question next time jack looks through the sextant and telescope wed like him to see how it looks do you have anyhing on the optics any specks or anything
okay  04 01 20 05 i24p houston aquarius how do you read
aquarius we read you 4 by 4 go ahead
okay it looks like the ptc is deteriorated enough that  the docking window of the i and 
aquarius houston we got part of your trans mission understand the ptc has deteriorated quite a bit and youd like to know what to do about it is that affirm 04 01 21 10 imp negative how do you read now vance
okay a little better
okay the only comment was that it has deterio rated to where the moon is now coming through the overhead docking window now in a portion of each pass and about that time i just lose comm on either antenna so theres going to be a short period of time on each revolution where were not going to have comm
okay fred we understand that and one more item for clarification on the water we dont really know what your usage of potable is that was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage 04 o1 21 57  okay
hey houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay jack just took a look through the optics  through one rev and he said they look good loud and clear he doesnt have any current condensate on either the sextant or telescope
okay fred thanks for the info
how do you read vance
okay im reading you weakly fred go ahead tape 661 04 01 36 17  with all this other procedures youve been working o there i thought i was going to have a new one for you how to get four ginger bread cubes apart i think they were stuck together with epoxy
this is in the food bag 04 01 36 59 i24p yes
thats to stand loads of launch and boost 04 01 37 07 i4p roger tool b did the trick 04 o1 37 28 ilvgo yes
hey fred john says you can use the dikes on it to get them apart
yes that probably wouldnt have crumbled them as badly
i generally dont use the subtle approach you can tell wetre feeling pretty good vance when we start complaining about the food
yes thats good to hear
i think everybodys feeling better down here too
aquarius houston 04 01 41 20 i24p go ahead
fred we have you on the goldstone bie dish now and our comm is much better if youd like would you turn the biomed switch on to either crewman there 04 o1 41 36 i24p okay stand by ill have to plug in first
okay
okay vance how do you read on baseband
we read you just  stand by
okay fred were receiving your med data it was a little slow in coming in r 474 04 01 43 09 imp okay
houston aquarius are you calling
negative no call from here
okay
and vance this is aquarius 04 02 26 t9 cc go ahead fred 04 02 26 23 imp okay jims coming back on the line and ill be unhooking on the biomeds and you want us to go back to the spa down voice backup
stand by 04 02 26 48 imp okay jim doesnt have his biomed rigged on right now so  down voice 
okay fred youre too weak on that last i understand youtre disconnecting and your biomed will be off say again about jim please 04 02 27 24  okay how do you read now
okay
okay all i said was jim doesnt have his biomed rigged right now so ill go back to down voice backup spa and jims coming on the line
okay we copy youre in down voice backup
well im thinking about the last l0 hours weve lost our suit compressors
because we dont want to use the power
well thats what im saying we can use these fans right here and use the circulate air right through the use of those fans
are we on mike now
hello houston aquarius
roger jim good morning
good morning vance hows things going down there
oh quiet and smooth
oh its afternoon down there
right we thought maybe it was morning to you
well ive sort of lost track but i had a good sleep
glad to hear it doctor just said he wondered how many hours
oh lets say whenever i left jack and fred came up and we ate for about an hour and then i went to bed so whatever that time was it must be about 5 hours something like that 4 or 5 hours
good glad to see you catching up
aquarius houston
go ahead vance
jim the next time that its convenient could you get the readout of the repress package in the command module for us over apollo 13 airtoground voice tincription
will do
okay
when you go back there fred they want tile repress package readout
we dont want you to wake anyone up to get it
no no ones asleep now
it has  was it  you get forward to it and a pretty good view of the venting
and houston aquarius it looks like service module venting has ceased at least momentarily
roger understand service module venting has ceased momentarily how about the descent stage does fred report venting down there do you still see that
stand by
what is your report on descent stage venting  was it venting anytling else going on any more venting
no
no fred hasnt seen anything else from the descent stage and i understand that we can expect the  the she  tank pressure to build up to relief here about 105 hours
roger a little later than that  like 106  107
okay
did you get some interior photos
yes
okay id like to show them the arrangement of these hydroxide canisters do you have
aquarius houston
did they give jack any more procedurs oiconmiand module powerup
did they give jack any more procedures on com maad module powerup
well they think it might be up here
okay
the main thing we got to think about id when we have to get to them is the procedures for lm jettison the transfer of the lm to csm mode cough lm jettison
yes
 the lm mode
ail we have to do is turn the biomed  on and well be in there
houston aquarius
roger go ahead aquarius
we would like permission to turn the biomed on to get off the hot mike mode i dont think that we have to be on it now if you have the big dish on do you
yes yaws coming  or rolls coming up for it and we were going to burn
roger jim we concur go ahead and turn it on
okay fine thank you
one other point the philosophy of timing this midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just before the she tank is supposed to vent that way we hope that we would have   be powered up and you would have control when the venting occurs in case you were tossed around a little bit over
okay underztand philosophy on the midcourse i doinl il prior to venting oi the lie tank which mems well be doing this around 105 hours i suppose or 10530 md so ill have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some per turbation
roger then after that we would establish ptc again
roger
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
our repress package pressure is 820
okay repress pressure 820 thank you
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim could you switch your biomed switch to the position opposite to where it is now we are getting a subcarrier but no data over
now you know houston i dont have riomed on
okay and we have a small addition to the pro cedure that was read up to you earlier which involves power transfr from the lm to the csm
stand by 1
okay
okay houston go ahead
okay at the end of the procedure after the step bat 5 and 6 0ff add the following cir cuit breakers panels  panels 11 and 16 ascent eca control both open over
okay after the step bat 5 and 6 off step 3 will be circuit breakers panels 11 and 16 ascent eca control both oper
thats correct jim and this is to guard against a singlepoint failure that  a remote possibility that would preclude you from getting the batteries back on jap 674 04 02  04 cd roger
go ahead
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
okay we just had a battery warning  bat tery 2
stand by jim the comms no good here right now
houston aquarius how do you read now
go ahead loud and clear
okay we just had a battery warning master alarm and it looks like its battery 2
roger
roger houston  this is houston could you close the power amp circuit breaker and well get some high bit rate
roger
its closed
okay and we need high bit rate
are you picking it up houston
roger and we want t open the bal load cross tie on panel 16 over
say again
open the bal load cross tie breaker on panel 16 over
open balance load cross tie breaker on 16 roger
thats affirm
its open
if youre getting high bit data we could do an offreset and go back on on battery 2 were standing by for that
okay could you turn off battery 2 and leave it off and let us look at it
say again you want us to turn off battery 2 and leave it off until you look at it
thats affirmative
okay battery 2 coming off the line
okay aquarius so you want to stay in this configurazion for awhile and lets look at the battery
roger well stay in this configuration
want to close the bal loads circuit breaker back now
13 houston we want to close the bal loads circuit bremker on panel 16 now again
we have it closed the closed  balance loads circuit breaker is closed
roger
aquarius houston request range functions switch to range 
ail right range functions switch going to range
righto
aquarius houston
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim on the battery problem we have determined that it is not overcurrent or reverse current we suspect its overtemp but donrt know for sure so were going to watch it for awhile
okay 0 ok o0 20 cc aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim charlie has some procedures to read up for you here i think youll need your activiation checklist if its haldy
aquarius thats the contingency checklist
okay ill just  okay stand by charlie
okay charlie ive got the contingency check list and standing by
okay jim wed like you to turn to page  page 24 which is the 30minute activation and this is going to be a procedure for the mid course burn that we got coming up at 105 with the ags up over
roger on the midcourse at 105 and im on page 24
okay 30minute activation omit steps 1 2 and 3 perform step 4 rcs system ab2 over
roger omit steps l 2 and 3 perform step 4
roger and on the eps activation same page perform step l and i step 2 perform line num ber  line number 6 eps displayclose over
okay on eps activation perform step l and perform step 2 line 6 only is that correct
thats affirmative jim the rest of the stuff is already closed at this time so thatts all well have to do is close the eps display breaker
okay
all right turn to psge 25 on page 25 omit step 3 perform step h on step 4 last line scratch cb16 eps inverter 2 closed over
roger omit step 3 perform step 4 except for the last line circuit breaker 16 eps inverter 2 closed
roger thats correct on step 5 perform step 5 under primary glycol loop activation step 1 line 1 cb16 ecs display  close thats a crew option you can have it if you want to omit the rest of step 1 and step 2 perform step 3 over a ioi3 airt0grotrjvoice trhi liption
okay on primary glycol loop activation crew option on step 1 first line the rest of it well omit step 2 well omit and well do step 3
thats affirmative jim with the following deltas on step 3 and if youll turn to page 26 ti give ynl the deltaq on the activation cir cuit breaker list over
okay im there
roger on line 1 correction row 1 under ac bus a tape recorder should be open deca gimbal open all the other ones as shown on the page over
okay on row 1 ac bus a tape recorder and deca gimbal will be open ail the rest as shown 0h 04 05 20 cc roger and we dont know the status of your windows if you  during this burn were going to have to look out the forward window to get the alinement with the coas so you might need the commander window heater and you can of course use that breaker if needed since we do have the ac power on row 2  go ahead over
i dont think well need it charlie
okay fine jim on row 2 under rcs system a ascent feed 2 and ascent feed 1 should be open under flight displays mission timer should be open gasta open ordeal open under ac bus a gasta open the rest are as shown on the page over
okay on row 2 were going to open up ascent feed 2 and ascent feed 1 wider rcs system a were going to open up the mission timer and fligiit displays the gasta and the ordeal and the ac bus a the gasta
thats affirmative okay row 3 under pro pellant descent helium regvent should be open under heaters rendezvous radar standby open landing radar open under stabcontrol atca pgns open under ed and lighting all four open over 01604 07 35 cdr okay row 3 umder propellant  propulsion the descent helium regvent will be open the standby rendezvous tteater will be open and the landing radar heater circuit breaker will be open i just changed antennas and keeping on down the line atca pgns will be open and the last four circuit breakers two under ed and two under lighting will be open
thats affirmative okay under row 4 under ecs glycol pump auto transfer close under comm up data link open vhf b and vhf a should he open under pgns lgcdsky open imu operate open over
okay under row 4 the auto transfer will be close updata link open vhf a and b open dsky open and imj operate open
thats affirm on the last row the only delta is under the cross tie bus and it should be open orer
say that again charlie
okay under the last row under eps is the only delta and that is under the cross tie bus it should go open over
roger the cross tie bus should go open
thats affirm going on to page 27 activation panel 16 under rcs system bravo ascent feed 1 ascent feed 2 should be open under propulsion pqgs should be open ascent helium reg open over
okay line 1 on panel 16 ascent feeds 1 and 2 will be open and the pqgs will be open and the ascent helium reg will be open
thats affirmative on the next three rows we only get the nine deltas so ill go through the next three rows completely and then you can read those back under lighting  
okay
under lighting flood open track open under ed logic  correction under ed logic open under stabcontrol descent engine override open under ecs suit flow control open under open vhf b receiver open under ecs display thats crew option last row under eps in verter 2 open over
okay on the last three rows we have flood and track circuit breakers row 2 open logic power b open descent engine override open suit flow control open on the third row  row display open vifa and  vhf  vhf a transmiifer open vhf b receiver open and under ecs we have display open at crew option and the last one inverter 2 under eps will be open
roger thats a good readback under that ecs display it shows it closed if with it closed you can have some readout of  onboard readout of your ecs system  draws a lot less than a half amp so its up to you whether you want it or not okay on page 28
roger
on page 28 step  perform step 4 with the fol lowing changes in the warning light status under the warning lights you will probably  you will have ascent pressure and an lgc light scratch rcs a and rcs b reg under caution lights youll have a pre amps light over
roger under warning well have ascent pressure and lgc and under caution well have a pre amp
affirmative under vtfsband activation and checkout scratch step 1 under step 2 change down voice backup to voice scratch step 3 under pgns turn on scratch entire procedure under dap setgimbal drive scratch entire pro cedure over
okay under vhfsband activation and checkout scratch step 1 do step 2 with the following change down voice backup to voice scratch step 3 scratch the entire remaining events that page over
thats affirmative jim going on to page 29 weve got  at this point there ts a writein required its about a six or seven liner and ill try to go fairly slowly and let you write it down if youre ready to copy over
ready to copy
okay at thipojnt wd lik you to verify rcs heaters in afpofor 15 minutes
is that the first step charlie 04 0h 15 20 cc thats affirmative what were trying to do here is were getting you set up in an attitude so you can damp your rates and come out of ptc and this is the configuration im reading you now the next  in the next six lines the procedure for getting you into a configuration to damp the rates and stop ptc over
okay so the first thing will be to  go to auto on the rcs system a and b oh 04 15 50 cc its the verify that the heaters have been in alpo for 15 minutes back on the first page of this procedure you put the heaters in auto and you pushed the breakers in and wed like for them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before we start to  stop at  stopping ptc over
roger verify heaters rcs on for 15 minutes
okay step 2 balance couple off dead band minimum attitude control pitch and roll to pulse yaw to direct mode control ags att hold guidance control to acdamp rates pitch and roll with the ttca yaw with the aca with the earth in the front window over
okay lets see if i got it step 2 is balance couple s off dead band min attitude control pitch and yaw at pulse yaw direct mode con trol will be in ags att hold guidance control will be in ags well damp the rates pitch and roll with the ttca and yaw with the aca and well probably have to have some reference point so i have to try and stop on the earth over
roger jim we were hoping that in your ptc that you occasionally see the earth coming through the window and if thats true then wed like you to have to  just damp the rates with the earth in the forward window and then we 11 give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the earth momentarily over
roger 0104 18 46 cc okay batwas the entire procedure for dmmping the rates only  though i only gave you  said it was step 2 that was the entire procedure now continuing on to whats printed on page 29  correction you had one error in the readback under attitude control it was pitch and roll to pulse yaw to direct continuing on on page 29 with the printed procedure the irst four lines scratch step 3 scratch under ags activation one change add a step first step will be verify asa cb16 in for 10 minutes the rest of the ags activation is as printed over
okay verify asa circuit breaker 16 in for 10 minutes and i take it 10 minutes back in our procedures well have a note saying to put that in 0 0 20 14 cc its  the circuit breaker goes itlon the cir cuit breker activation page jim so by the time we get here and have the rates all damped we feel that  that the pipas will be mp to temperature by this time and we can go ahead and turn it  turn the ags on at this time over but we just want you to verify that
okay and one other question charlie id like to know if the note you gave me about damping the rates is before the other information on page 29
thats affirmative add that in to the top of the page the  what were really doing  lets  lets put it in to right before the ags acti vation the other  the other procedure on the top of the page belongs with the dap set gimbal trim and were just omitting all of that pro cedure so the addition that  on the damping the rates should really go in right before the ags activation over
understand
what were really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the earth come through the window you can damp her out and hold  hold the earth in the window proceeding on to the rest of page 29 under rcs press scratch the entire three steps as printed on page 30 scratch step 4 under the rcs press over
roger under ags activation well i included that step on the asa circuit breaker and well do step 1 ald2 lder ags activation but then wejl scratch steps 1 2 and 3 under rcs press and on page 30 well scratch step 4
affirm under dps press step 1 line 1 scratch line 4 descent helium reg 1 talkbaek barber pole under step 2 scratch step 3 scratch landtng gear deploy scratch over
okay under dps press well scratch the first line and well have the descent helium reg talkback to barber pole well scratch steps 2 and 3 and well scratch the landing gear deploy
roger now we got on the back of page 30 jim youve got a blank page in your checklist or should have and wed lke to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude over
okay a procedure to get the burn attitude
okay first statement is a statement verify ags in operate for 5 minutes then we go to ags address 400 plus 5 then 400 plus zero aitlrde control pitch and roll to pulse yaw mode control maneuver using ttca pitch and roll the computer is controlling yaw but you can over ride with aca you with me over
okay charlie im with you so far
okay jim when in attitude aca out of detent to zero error needle then set vent timer and well give you a countdown on that when you get to that step over
okay when in attitude aca out of detent to null needles and set det
roger now that  the burn attitude will be coming up on a pad but basically were looking for a local horizontal retrograde burn which means using a coas if you put the horizontal line on the coas on the horns of the earth and then roll to place the xaxis in the direction of the sun well  that will put us in both burn attitude and you can check that via the sun which will be in the aot detent 2 should lie right tape 68 along the cursor at the top well have some more words orlvna lu you mumuj   id ke to go on to page 31 if youre ready over oh 04 27 01 cdr okay i figure i have a handle on the attitude the way the earth should look in the coas and youre going to give me some words on what the sun would look like in the aot is that right 04 0h 27 14 cc thats affirmative jim we havent got a pic ture of it yet its going to be in the top part of the coas  correction top part of the aot at the top of the  the top of detent 2 and the top part of the aot and it should in atti tude if youre right on the sun should split the cursor though that roll angle is not too crftcal if were in about 10 degrees well be okay we  but i think  we think you should be able to get it better than that on page 31 under the ipsburn technique you can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there since the gimbal is locked over
understand scratch the bottom part underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked
thats affirmative and since the gimbal was trimmed out at the big burn yesterday we should be still through the cg and wed like to make sure that jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did yesterday that way well  you should have no trouble controlling attitude now im ready to go over to page 32 over
okay let me see if i have that right now you want jack to sit in the same attitude so that the gimbals are the same place so you dont have trouble controlling attitude i got it
okay now on page 32 top of the page first line scratch verb 76 third line mode control ags att hold at minus 6 minutes scratch lines 1 2 and at burn attitude scratch verb 40 noun 20 scratch lines 2 3 and 4 now at burn attitude we want you to do a 400 plus 5 and then a verb  a 400 plus zero and we have a caution note at this point over
go ahead 04 04 29 59 c okay thcautjor iaftr 400 plus zero do not go out of dtnotn aca again over
okay after the last 400 plus zero do not go out of detent with aca is that correct
thats a roger jim what happens is of course we set  when you go out of detent you reset the ags error needles and you  and you lose your attitude reference you establish a new attitude reference and it might not be the burn attitude since at this point wa re controlling attitude with the ttca now picking up with the verb 37 enter scratch scratch everything down to the 404 plus zero md we want you to perform those ags steps with 404 down through 470 over
okay we 11 scratch everything down to h04 plus zero and well perform those four steps
roger turning over to page 33 minus 4 minutes okay moving down the page its about line 7 to engine gimbal engine gimbal off down to mode control make that read mode comhol ags att hold and then scratch propellant quantity monitor descent 1 over 0 04 32 16 cdr okay at 4 minutes engine gimbal will be off mode control will be to ags att hold pro pellant quantity monitor descent 1 scratched
roger picking up at minus 1 minute scratch master arm on minus 35 seconds scratch first two lines at minus 10 seconds change that to minus 9 seconds so at minus 9 seconds it will be manual ullage at 2 seconds scratch cmc mode free and scratch aca out of detent at  after ignition at plus 1 second termi nate ullage are you with me over
okay at 1 minute master arm we scratch at 35 seconds scratch the first two lines manual ullage will start at 9 seconds were scratching the blocks at 02 seconds and the line beneath that at plus 1 second we terminate ullage
thats affirm picking up at plus 5 seconds scratch the rest of the page ttca attitude control and master arm off over 04 04 34 4 ci scratch ti lrmainderof the page
okay now jike to veri y that under the 5 sec onds minus 35 seconds the only thing you have remaining ts engine arm to descent over
thats affirm thats the only thing i have
okay turning to the next page and the last page jim 34 top of the page monitor deltav x via 470 scratch next two lines when propellant quantity equals 37 and the descent helium reg scratch ttca commander reduce to 10 percent now we want you to add a line shut  its a shutdown criteria shutdown on burn time minus 1 second over
okay the shutdown is on burn time minus i sec ond let me give you an example if we have a 30second burn were going to shut down at 29 seconds is that correct
tha affirmative well give you the pad be coming up here from fido in a couple of hours i guess when we stabilize out on our tracking the reason for  if youre ready to copy out a couple of more steps and then i 11 explain the reason we want to shut down on this burn time minus 1 second picking up on when deltav x  
okay
  when deltav x equal to the final deltavx scratch that line scratch aitude control yaw to pulse add  correction scratch damp excessive rates via lm y z translation and add at that point null error needles trim address 470 to 01 foot per second over
okay going through after the shutdown on burn time minus 1 second we scratch the next line and we scratch attitude control yaw to pulse we scratc damp excessive rates via lm y z translatio·n i we add the line null error needles trim  null the error needles and trim address 470 to  what was the value there charlie
01 foot per second the reason we are shutting down on the burn time is since the asa breaker has been out for so long were not real confi dent that our ags pipas are going to be supersharp so we waitto make sure that we just get a burn time  iooverburn so were shutting dowel on burn tsmtminus 1 second and then that will allow us a plusx translation to trim 70if it looks okay if we had an overburn wed be in  
okay
  if we had an overburn wed be impinging on our command module to try to trim it out so thats our reasoning there over
okay understand
okay picking up in the middle of the page that  a block cms resume attitude control scratch scratch the next line pro verb 96 scratch the third line propeltant quantity monitor off over
okay well scratch the blocks and well scratch the pro verb 96 then well scratch propellant quantity monitor off
roger now at the bottom of that page i have a procedure for you to reestablish ptc over
to reestablish ptc go ahead
okay first line attitude control three to pulse line 2 roll with the ttca until attitude is roll plus or minus 90 pitch 0 yaw 0 over
okay step 1 attitude control three to pulse 2 roll with the ttca  pitch is 0 and yaw is 0 and i thikk that will be on the ags ball
thats affirmative you broke up there for a minute jim well do that on the ags ball from the burn attitude we just want you to roll either way 90 degrees keep pitch 0 and yaw o now step 3 when at  when at attitude aca out of detent step 4 attitude control yaw to mode control when rates are less than 005 aftitude control yaw s to pulse
okay charlie can you hold up here a second i lost you
roger lp 081 oh 04 42 o0 cdr start wth step 3 again when attitude  when at attitud aca out of detent
thats roger next step step 4 afitude control to yaw  correction attitude control yaw to mode control over
okay step 4 is attitude control yaw to mode control
roger step 5 when rates are less than 005 degrees per second attitude control yaw to pulse
okay when rates are less than 005 degrees per second attitude control yaw to pulse
roger step 6 spin up to 03 degree per sec ond in yaw and that takes about 21 pulses step 7  yes 04 0h h3 49 cdr okay go ahead 0h 04 43 51 cc okay step 7 mode control ags off
okay step 6 was spin up to 03 degrees per second in yaw thats about 21 pulses step 7 was mode control ags to off 01404 44 19 cc thats affirm step 8 power down per power  correction power down per contingency checklist page power 5 over
okay and step 8 is power down per contingency checklist power 5 and i take it thats been revamped considering our situation okay
thats affirmative jim thats the one we gave you last night after the big burn and well use that one as modified by  by us this  we tried this ptc under ags in the simulator and of course no slosh or amything but it seemed to work pretty good by hulling the rates using the ttca in pitch aldroll and letting the acs do it in yaw you null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those and when they dont  when they stop moving then you got it within the limits of what we want over oh 04 45 40 cd okay ad i guesj charle you have no  do you have a att hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration were in or do we have to use the ttca
we feel like we have to use the ttca the ags gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this configuration itll hold it in yaw but it wont in pit ad roll over
okay
and youll have  during the burn of course youll be controlling pitch and roll via the error needles with the ttca also and its the little scheme that weve practiced in some of the sims over 04 o 45ot cdr right understand
and houston want to make sure that we allow enough timc to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and dont have to rush the burn 04 oh 46 51 cc roger jim we were looking right now tentatively at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is  not too bad on this burn we can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our deltav over
okay fine and do you have a handle on just how long the burn will be in time o 04 47 17 cc its looking like at about 78 seconds and about 15  correction 78 feet per second and about 15 seconds over
in about 18 seconds
negative 15 1 5
1 5 okay
and one other point is that wed like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both regs b closed but weve got plenty at the 10 percent
understand oh oh 1757 c and jim in the simulator with our configuration that whad herc the thlng i real stable at l0 percnt owc dont think youll have to tweak vcrymuch at all using tilettcas over
okay understand
and i11 give you back to vance thank you
and thank you
aquarius ttouston
go ahead houston oh 04 50 15 cc jim regarding your number 2 battery we think that its probably a sensor failure a temperature sensor failure thats caused this alarm rather than an actual overtemp of the battery the rea son being that we havent seen any higher temper atures in the glycol loop we expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours thatll be about 10 minutes and then well look at it some more there over
okay concerning number 2 battery you think it might be a sensor failure because you havent seen any changes and youre going to put the battery back on the line in about 10 minutes
thats affirm
okay
hozuston aquarius
go ahead jim
for information vance about a half hour ago i guess jack and i couldnt see constellations at certain spacecraft attitudes stars we could see the  scorpio and sagittarius and we could see altair or acrux and alpha centuri vega stars of that magnitude and our venting has stopped which allows us now to differentiate be tween the particles and the stars
roger copy understand you can see the stars pretty well were you at that time in an attitude facing away from the sun i presume this is very attitude critical
yes it is somewhat vmnce if we have the suni shlnng oflth quads it sort of ruins our vis ion and alo if the earth or the moon are n the genera field of view we cant see anything
okay thank you
aquarius houston
go ahead vance
jim were ready to put that battery back on the line request you open the cross tie bal load circuit breaker panel 16 and then put back  bat 2 back on the line
okay first of all well open the balance cross tie breaker on panel 16
thats affirm
okay the cross tie balance load circuit breakers is in now vance now you want us to put bat tery 2 back on is that affirm
did you say it was in or did you pull it out
no its in do you wsmt it out
thats affirm wed like it out and then bat 2 on the line
okay coming up bat 2 is on the line we have a master alarm and a battery light
copy and  and we think thats probably an in dication of the sensor problem but stand by
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim it looks to us like your battery is good that this is in fact a sensor problem therefore request you close the cross tie bal loads on  circuit breaker on panel 16 advise  
okay
  advise that you will not have anm malfunction indication on any of your batteries now but we can watch it from the ground over
okay well close the cross tie balance load circuit breaer at this time
roger copy
thats closed and we dont have any warning on any of the batteries but you can monitor from the ground
thats affirm
and jim we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the csm and turning on instrumentation so we can check the tm and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever youre ready to copy
this is to power up the csm ob 05 06 24 cc thats affirm
okay ill tell you what ill have jack get configured iiecan copy that down aldill have him  well get the stuff stand by
okay
okay vance how do you read the aquarius
okay read you loud and clear aquarius is it cool in there now
okay yes its pretty cool this is the third officer on this lm crew here ready to copy
oksy jack this is a lengthy procedure take probably two or three pages it assumes that you are in your nominal configuration which was sent up  or in your dayflying configuration which was sent up to you earlier today
okay i can verify that we are in that config uration with the exception of panel 382 the water accumulator which ive left off in case we wanted to get some more drinking water out of the command module and ill put those in the proper configuration before we do anything
okay ready to copy
okay go ahead oh 05 08 45 cc okay panel 4 telcomm group 1 to ac1 panel 5 close thc  ecs press group 1 main b ecs press group 2 main b ecs temp main b ecs secondary loop transducer main b ecs rad controlheaters main b bat relay bus bat b bat charger bat b charge  or to b charge inverter control 2 inverter control 1 eps sensor signal ac1 eps sensor signai main b eps sensor unit ac bus 1 wastepotable water main b instructs ess main b thats essential main b are you with me

okay thats all correct is that reading rate okay for you
yes thats fine
okay and leave a little space if you can to the right of these because when we talk about the backup procedure why then we can just use the same listing aad ill  ill tell you open in stead of close these circuit breakers or at least most of them over
okay

hey very good okay panel 225 circuit breaker flight bus main b to close circuit breaker cte main b to close panel 250 cb bat c bat chargereds 2 to close
hey vance just a minute slow down would you
okay
okay i got distracted here on panel 225 cb flight bus main b close and then i lost you after that
okay after that cb cte main b to close next panel 250 cb bat c bat chargeeds2 to close cb bat c power entrypostlanding to close next panel 275 cb main b bat bus b to close cb inverter power 2 main b to close okay incidentaljy ayhing thst ye given you up until now is not sequence critical but from now on it should be  you should be sure to do it in the sequence we give you why dont you read that back jack
okay let me give you all of panel 225 again cb flight bus main b close cb cte main b close on panel 250 cb bat  b bat charge that should be bat c char2ie isnt it bat chargefis2 closed
thats right thats  
cb bat b power entry 
okay that should be bat charlie
let me finish okay thats what i thought bat charlie bat chargeeds2 close bat baker power entrypostlandzng closed on panel 275 cb main b bat bus b closed cb inverter power 2 main b closed
okay thats correct except for the second cir cuit breaker on panel 250 which is cb bat charlie power entry slash postlanding close
okay fiatcbarl ie power entrypostlanding
okay now back opanel 250 cb bat bravo power entrypostlanding close next mdc 3 ac in verter 2 to main b ac inverter 2 ac bus 1 on up next pane 5 ac inverter ac bus 1 to re set and vhen center panel 3 up tlm to com mand reset then off then select best omni readback please 04 05 248 cmp okay vance the following steps are sequence critical panel 250 cb bat b power entry postinding closed thats bat baker mdc 3 ac inverter 2 to main b ac inverter 2 ac1 on 
how do you read now jack 04 05 21 31 imp okay vance did you  how far did you  did you copy any of my steps there
okay i heard you through ac inverter 2 ac bus 1 to on and you were cut out by noise go ahead
kay now comes to one i didnt understand you said go over to mdc 5 and a in  ac inverter ac bus 1 reset then center and then back to mdc 3 up telemetry command reset then off and then select best omni
roger the readbacks correct but let me recheck that stand by
jack we were incorrect on panel 5 that shoald have been panel 3 04 05 22 39 64p okay thats good i got it
okay now when youre in this configuation the following onboard readouts are required panel 3 bat c voltage pyro bat a voltsge pyro bat b voltage r helium pressure and the following readouts on panel 101 cm rcs injector temperatures those are positions 5 charlie 5 delta 6 alfa 6 bravo 6 charlie 6 delta and the battery manifold pressure which is 4 alfa and standing by for readback 04 05 2l40 074p kay you want me to read out on mdc 3 bat b voltage pyro a voltage pyro b voltage sps helium pressure on panel 101 command module rcs injector temperatures 5 charlie 5 dog 6 alfa 6 baker 6 charlie 6 dog the battery manifold pressure 4 alfa
okay now  that was correct but i want to re check the very first one that was bat charlie voltage is that what you read back
okay kay flatcharlie voltage seems like were having a difference  i cant understand bat charlie from bat dog
okay now that  that complete procedure for getting into it as far as getting into its concerned what i will give you now is how to back out of it after youre through with your readings are you ready to copy
okay
okay now youl back out fairly quickly after you go into this proeeffure ail well need is about 5 minutes of tm and so if youre ready to copy here it comes
go ahead
panel 3 powe ampl to o incidentally copy this down on a piece of scratch paper as i read it and then later ill refer back to your first list where you can write things in the right hand margin
okay
okay  
go ahead you want  repeat the one on panel 3 again vance
okay power ampl off oh 05 26 59 cmp okay go ahead
transponder off ac inverter 2 to off okay next panel 250 cb bat bravo pow entry postlanding to open stand by 1
okay jack what i just gave you now on the backout is the only thing thats order critical from here on you can go to the steps for ini tiating the procedure and backtrack in other words you should go to each of the panels that i read up and put the circuit breakers back to the baseline configuration  or the switches over lal6e820 04 05 2ti56 cmp okay now heres  to accent heres the sequencecritical sets power amfl o transponder· off ac inverter 2 off and the last one on panel 250 cb bat baker power entry postlanding open and then hit the steps in reverse order that you gave them to me and back out like then i would start on mdc 3 up telemetry off  to off and then ac inverter  ac1 bus 1 to off and then ac inverter 2 off ac inverter 2 main b to off is that the type of order that you want to back out of
thats affirm but  just for kicks lets go through these panels again and ill give you the  the position just to make sure here can be no doubt
okay c ahead 0h 05 30 20 cc okay and once again in the  in the area where t said order was not critical its still not critical when you back out but now ill go ahead okay panel h telcomm group 1 ac1 it will not be ac1 itll go to off panel 5 all circuit breakers on that panel which were positioned will now come to opened over
okay panel 4 telcomm group 1 will go off panel 5 all the circuit breakers that we closed will go back to open
okay panel 3 the first three lines have been taken care of already in my beginning in the backout procedure so starting with mode voice that should go back to voice power sce off pmp off sband antenna omni bravo panel 225 cb flight bus in b open cb cte main b open read back
okay vance im going to have to switch omnis im starting to get some static here
okay
okay how do you read on aft omni
loud and clear
okay on panel 3 the first three steps we took care of mode voice to voice power sce off power ppto off and sband omni would go back to braw panel 225 fiight bus main b will go open and cb cte main b wili go open
thats alfirm the two circuit breakers on panel 250 wll go open the two circuit breakers panel 275 will go open okay the circuit breakers on panel 250 we took care of already panel 3 ac inverter 2 we took care of ac inverter 2 ac bus 1 should now go off and the remainiug two switches on panel 3 we took care of and seect best 0mni remains the same okay read back 04 05 34 25 cmf kay the two switches  two circuit breakers on panel 250 will go back to open the two cir cuit breakers on panel 275 back to open the power entrypostlbnding circuit breaker we al ready took care of earlicr ac inverter 2 we took care of earlier ac inverter 2 to ac bus 1 will go to off and ac inverter ac bus 1 we took care of  no thatll go to off and up telt4etry comiandreset will go off
thats correct jack okay thats it and i thirk were about ready to go with this procedure whenever you are 04 05 b5 28 cmp okay first we got to go through that procedure to power the csm from the lm is that charlie
no no this is independent of power from the i his is a  this is purely a csm  
okay
this is purely a csm powerup so we can take a look at your telemetry and see how cold the ve hicle is amd that sort of thing
okay its going in work
okay now i wont  i wont have any voice with you so  is that right you dont want me to get connected up  you want me to just take these readings and come back and tell you what i have huh
thats affirm therell be no voice and  
okay okay in work
i  we plmthougl that therel be some bory tih that we can call if we have to gel wod lo you
oh yes jherelbe somebody to be standing by theyll run up into the bedroom and tell me to stop what im doing
okay and let us know when you start
okay imgoing to start right now vance

aquarius houston over
okay houston aquarius switching watches and jacks going up into the command module
okay jim we have four steps here to give you to request that you get back on down voice backup if youre ready to copy
ready to copy
okay bit rate to lo bit rate voice inction switch to down voice backifp power amps cb open range function switch in ranging thats verify
okay bit rate lo voice njnction down voice backup power amp sband open and range function to range and thats a verify and i still have the biomed on right here so we dont have hot mike
okay thank you
and you want that in work now
thats affirm
okay
okay houston aquarius how do you read
loud and clear jim
okay i have a question for you houston if you have time
sure go ahead
and im copying down the reestablishing  ptc maneuver that charlie gave me step 5 was when rates are less than 005 degrees per second attitude control yaw to pulse and just how am i to get my rates down to 005 de grees per second my  my rate indicator at the best is 01 of a degree
stand by
aquarius tlouston
go ahead
jim this has been tried in the simulator by charlie and others and what they recommend is that you null your rates on the error needles until you see no movement whatsoever and then wait another couple of minutes and that should do it thats the only way we can tell over
okay ill give it the old college try
okay and if you ean attain that why of course just the best you can do well have to give it a try maybe it wont be quite like the simulator
right
okay houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay vance ive gone all the way through your procedure  all the way down to select best omnis but im not getting any main bus b voltage and this i dont understand
roger
i can read  i can read bat  bat bus b voltage at 365 
okay jack do you read now
i am not sure vance
okay you faded out due to noise in the orien tation if you close the power amp circuit breaker we can hear you better over
thats panel 16
okay
okay you faded out at the very beginning so please go through that again we understand you dont get anything on main b lal 507
okay vance how are you reading now
okay were hearing you better stand by 1
okay jack please repeat back now your conversation you were cut out for  a while ago
i dont have any idea where we cut out vance i just said that we performed the procedure exactly as you say were down into the sep critical portion to where i said select best omni however were not getting any main bus b voltage reading i can read bat bus b baker at 365 bat charlie at 370 but i have negative main bus b readings
okay stand by 0405 53 24 cc okay jack there are two  theres a switch and a circuit breaker that were positioned this morning that wed ie to have you check  correction just the switch panel 5 check your bus tie main bus tie bat bc on
that is verified on i checked that
okay
okay jack this is houston over
go ahead vance
okay were getting data from you jack so that much looks good on panel 5 request verification that eps sensor signal circuit breaker is main b over
okay
or its  
  stand by  
  that main b is closed
okay
okay jack and we see your main bus b voltage at 2812 01405 56 17 cmp okay you can see it good okay then okay vance that circuit breaker is in oh 05 56 28 cc copy
well vance if youre getting data from them let me go back up there and finish the 
okay jack please repeat youre cutting out
okay vance okay we just changed omnis here i say if youre getting data from us thats the important thing let me go back up into the bedroom there and get the readings you wanted so we can get this stuff powered down is that okay
okay well get  
  by all means and  
  down there  
  select best omni  
  and then go back up
okay vance well go back up  weve got voltage now and well go back up and take the readings that you want
okay and select best omni
okay im going back up into the bedroom vance how do you read
loud and clear
okay im going back up to the bedroom well select best 0mni and continue on with the pro cedure
roger
okay vance jims up how do you read
reading you loud and clear jim
okay
and houston i noticed through the aot and lac 509 through the overhead docking window that we are venting again
okay jim understand the service module is venting
thats affirm
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
jim would you holler into the bedroom and tell jack that when he has his onboard readouts that we wish hed back  use the backout procedure and shut down again  per the procedure we gave him
roger as soon as he  as soon as he gets his onboard readouts to use the powerdown procedure and shut down is that right
thats affirm
okay jack just  jack just told me that hes through and hes going to go through the back out procedures again the first one hes got is the shutdown
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
jacks ready to give you the readings if you are ready to copy them
stand by
okay go ahead
okay vance the readings that you wanted are you ready
ready to copy jack 04 06 09 01 cml bat charlie 370 pyro a 370 pyro b 370 sp helium pressure 3450 and just for kicks nitrogen a 2300 nitrogen b 2400 cm rcs injector temperatures 5 charlie 45 5 dog 35 6 alla40 6 baker 46 6 charlie 40 6 dog b8 battery manifold pressure 4 alfa 14
okay jack we got it thank you very much
okay how does the telemetry look on our  on the old odyssey
it doesnt look too cold looks pretty good
okay thank you very much
you bet
were going to need him
row does it feel jack
ill tell you deke its cold up in there i dont know whether well be able to sleep up there tonight it must be about 35 or ho degrees
roger thats just what i was worrying about 04 06 10 59 cmio right now were getting two sets of cwgs on
its not uncomfortable at all in aquarius but it definitely is cold in odyssey
roger
okay vance jims back on
go ahead jim
we just had a change in watch thats all 04 06 i1 57 cc okay
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim two items in the command module we wish to verify that the pyro battery selector was left in the main position and were ready to have the power amp circuit breaker on panel 16 pulled whenever you are ready tat 697
okay vance fred just tells me that he put it there and were checking that again about the pyro battery selector in the main position
okay understand that you are checking it
and i will pull the power amp circuit breaker
roger
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
how does number 2 battery look to you now
stand by
aquarius houston
go ahead
jim it looks like it was probably a sensor problem the battery number 2 is loadsharing well and we see no indications of higher temperatures in the glycol loop or anything that would make us think that it is heating up
okay thank you
roger
houston aquarius
roger go ahead
i just want to talk over a little philosophy here fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that we were a little steep on the entry angle and now our burn is going to make us  give us a steeper angle i just want to make sure that were all talking about the same thing that in essence at this particular situation were shallow s are not steep and we are going to in crease the angle
jim the situation is that at the moment were a little bit shallow and retrograde midcourse is going to put us more in the center of the corridor over 04 06 5 27 cdh okay fire i just wanted to make mre fred had writ lrl dwrl rome time  that lhat our mgle now war about 71 and we were going to do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because ire appears that were going to shallow it out i think were all talking the same language now
roger and i guess it follows but your perigee is a little bit high right now too so that will be bringing it back  back down that is ii06 52 d7 cdr yes yes thats the important thing
one other question jim our readings down here say your lm cabins about as cold as the command module cabin is that right
well we really dont know theres usually two people in the lm cabin and its a lot  it seems to be a lot more compact and so we dont notice the coldness down here as we do in the command module
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead
some time ago i copied down a long comm midcourse7 corridor control burn at a get of 134594298 is that burn pad still valid
jim thats affirm that pad is still valid
and that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours
thats affirm
aquarius houston
go ahead
jim were setting up your burn for 10530 and well be working up a pad et cetera based on that time over
roger the time will 10530
and additional point i guess this ones for jack do we have any idea why we couldnt read the main bus b voltage a while back when firt he didnt get it and then later he did
yes i think we have a reason for that staid by
it appears vance that the battery charge circuit breaker which appeared to be in wasnt in fred pulled it and reset it and then he started get ting readings
roger which circuit breaker was that
it was  it was the battery charge circuit breaker that allows you to read volts but we havent  dont know the exact name for it yet
okay understand 04 06 59 8 cdr the name is battery charger bat b charge jack tells me
okay battery charger bat b charge
aquarius houston 04 07 go 25 cdr go ahead
have you opened your  just curiosity  have you opened your food locker just aft of the lm data file over
yes its been opened
okay just checking thanks
 meal had come through
good
it came at the right time
good
aquarius houston over
go ahead
jim we have some csm temperatures here for you that might be of interest if youre ready to copy le 514
roger go ahead
okay your quad package temperatures range from 85 degrees to 44 degrees your cm rcs injectors range from 44 degrees to 21 and your heat shield is well above its lower limits in all the various locations temperatures appear to be cycling based on sun angle and its no sweat aey all look very good
sounds good apollo 13 airtoground voice tiijscription panic 515
were you calling houston
negative jim
okay
and houston how do you read aquarius
read you loud and clear fred how do you read
okay 
roger we were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn are you ready to copy 01407 43 13 lmp stand by
okay
okay go ahead vance
okay fred first of all preparations for this starting with contingeacy checklist page 24 we would recommend should start at 10430 get and well be happy to receive any comments you have on that though second point when youre in the burn attitude you should see the sun at the very top of the aot itll be splitting the cursor when your cursors set at zero one thing to be aware of though that itll slip right out of the aot very easily since itll be very sensitive to roll and yaw understand thats in detent 2 by the way next point the burn is very insensi tive to burn time and attitude in other words if necessary we can slip it if theres any problem at all and attitude isnt too critical so that brings us to the point that we only have one real burn rule that is if  rate about any axis gets to 10 degrees a second thats the limit to stop the burn next point after you finish the burn and before you trim request that you leave deda in address 470 up a while so we can take a look at it and let us holler when weve seen it and then proceed on over
okay vance youre saying we should start into the prep in the contingency book at about 10430 and ill talk this over in a minute with jim and well get back with you on it when in the burn iw  attitude we should see the sun right at the top of the aot and i assume this is detent number 2 jim and id already been talking about that and just eyeballing the terminator in the earth we figured the sun at about something like a 70degree angle  65degree angle so thatll be right up there we get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second shut her down and after we trim you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you a2l can have a look at it and youll tell me when to get rid of it
thats right fred and if you have any ques tions at all regarding the alinement why please let us know wcll be happy to answer them like alining on the earth as was described before also you should know that the pitch is the most critical attitude so far as errors are concerned in this burn but as i said its still not very sensitive
yes the and unfortunately the way were looking out the window through the coas we can aline the yaw and roll pretty well but its the  sun that has to get us pitch
right and  and a correction on this deda 470 thing request that we let you  give you a go before you trim over
say  say again vance on that last
roger we would like to see address 470 and give you a go before you trim over
oh okay i  i see okay after burn well leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to do the trim
thats correct how was the sleep
okay and 
okay vance are you there oh 07 50 17 cc roger go ahead oh 07 50 21 lmp okay the picture that jim gave me on his view through the coas was within the  the partial earth the lit portion laying in the top half of the coas with the cusp laying right on the yy line and so the  the whole dark part of the earth would be at the bottom part of the earth except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line  line above the yy line
okay that is correct oh 07 51 00 lmp and that in essence  that in  yes that in essence would put our xaxis pointing toward the sun
thats correct the plus xaxis pointing toward the sun and perpendicular to the terminator of the earth
okay
two other points fred one is that we dont expect hardly any misalinement of your engine for the burn so we dont really expect any rates throughout the length of the burn especially since its at very ow thrust second point request you verify that your suit temperature rheostats in full cold that  if it  if it were in full cold that might help your cabin temperature situation it might bring the temperature up
okay
okay the latter was a good point we had it in full hot
very good
and roger on the  roger on the rates too
okay
okay vance is the t time going to be ig approximately  is it 105 or 105307
its 10530
okay your 10430 time to start in is  sounds pretty good thatll give us lots of time to get set up with the attitude business in case we have any trouble stopping ptc and getting there and  that will give us a little time to be sitting and waiting all set up
okay fred wood
aquarius houston over
are you calling vance
right fred we just noticed a 2pound drop in your water quantity have you guys had a drink recently or do you know any reason why it might have dropped over
negative
thank you
aquarius houston
all right go ahead vance
fred that may be a funny in the data the rates gone back to normal and well keep an eye on it but we dont think you should worry about it too much
lets hope not
and houston aquarius 04 08 9 07 cc go ahead aquarius ii08 19 12 lmp are we going to get any sort of a pad on this 1108 i120 cc thats affirm fred estimating well have it to you in about 15 minutes 04 08 j9 28 lmp okay
and houston you might just let us know if theres any chance its going to slp further down the road because were going to kind of hod to that 10430 start time and if youre going to delay any well delay accordingly il08 20 03 cc roger we wont have any trouhle making that fred im told 04 08 20 2 im okay
hello houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius pafe 519 it08 31 12 cdr roger we have about 104 dulrees now how does that 
okay fidos hustling here well try to get it right up to you stand by
aquarius houston over
we have 
aquarius houston over
vance we have the quad heaters on now
roger copy jim aldthe  jacks going to read you the pad right now so i recommend you go ahead and get started you shouldnt be delayed by the pad at all u uu 7  cc uarius uuuu i w uu juz uzpad
roger houston stand by are you ready  stand by to copy okay ready to copy
okay a p30 maneuver pad on the dps purpose is midcourse 5 noun 33 105300000 noun 81 is na ha is na perigee plus 00198 00078 015 the rest is na shut down the engine at 1 second prior to the end of burn time shut down at 14 seconds manually ullage is four jets for 10 seconds 10percent throttle go ahead
okay jack weve got a dps midcourse 5 noun 33 105300000 noun 81 na ha na plus 00198 00078 burn time 015 the rest of the pad na shut down manually at 14 seconds ullage four jets for lo seconds and the entire burn is at 10percent throttle
okay fred i want to verify that your deltav r is 00078 04 08 35 48 lnp okay i read you back 00078
okay good readback you got it pae 520
aquarius louston i haw some additional entry data that goes with the pad i just read up its five items let me know when youre rea r to copy its on a maneuver pad
okay ill try to squeeze them in there jack im rapidly running out of pads
go ahead
okay its na all the way down to noun 61 your latitude is minus 21  
hold on a minute hold on you need the  hold on jack i need the other pad book that csm pad
thats affirm
okay now im ready
okay noun 61 latitude minus 2167 minus 16537 11631 36292 1424102 read back
okay noun 61 minus 2167 minus 16537 11631 36292 1424102
good readback
and you should have high bit rate now jack
okay fred were getting it now apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
houston aquarius 04 08 46 4 cc go ahead aquarius
did you have readouts on our quad temps oknow when we can start were taking a time hack wed just like a verification with you
roger your quad temps look good from here
okay houston aquarius were going to stop ptc at this time
roger aquarius go tead
how about if you do  
say again jack
negits on my last fred 04 08 53 12  okay jack how do you read now
go ahead aquarius
okay i thought you called jack were maneuvering around here to fish for the earth
and houston aquarius hows the asa package temp look now
okay fred the asa package temp is looking good its around 98 degrees and wed like to see it go up about 15 to 20 degrees
okay why dont you give me the word before i proceed with the ags we really dont need it right this instant
roger well be watching it
aquarius houston the asa package temp is up now so you can activate the ags
okay very good
okay jack so we can make sure and get our timer set here i wondered when your  youve l2 got about 48 minutes to the burn which should be coming up pretty quick  youd give us a hack so we could set our event timer at 12
roger fred i understand you want a mack at 17 mmtes rior to the burn is that affirm
roger we think we got it set now we just wanted to check it if we dont then ill set it to 13 and you can ive me another hack at 47 to go
okay we got 33 to go
mark
my mistake it was 33  
right on
roger it was reading 33 on my mark right
okay you got about 10503 get now down there
thats affirmative fred going through 1050345
mark
okay
okay jack give me the next number you want me to set then and ill take another hack here
roger youre counting up right
roger
okay fred on my mazk be 35 minutes to the burn
standing by
we missed her fred lets get it on the next minute 04 09 05 17  okay
okay aquarius on my mark its going to be 34 minutes to the burn and youtll be reading 36 stand by
mark
okay we got it cranked up
okay houston we have our attitude set
roger jim
i hope the guys in the back room who thought this up right knew what they were saying
and im looking through the aot there jack and the suns right in the top and its about maybe 2 degrees to the right of the cursor so that looks real good
roger good going
okay aquarius the attitude looks good here and your choice when you want to start the burn
were counting down arentt we or do you want us to start any time
your choice
you guys are getting easy
itts not time critical jim
i understand 04 09 15 59  and houston we reset our clock and were making the burn in about  ill give you a hack here at 2 minutes to go
roger fred and let us know when youre going to ullage will you 04 09 16 16  okay 04 09 16 25  okay stand by 2 
mark it 04 09 16 29  three minutes to go correction 2 minutes to go jack
roger two minutes we got it lao714 ia 54
aquarius houston check engine gial off please
its verified to off and  04 09 17 28 imp mare it 04 09 17 29 iaip one minute
roger fred
engine arm to descent
ullage
okay youre looking at 470
roger we copy 74
roger 74 and i had about 02 showing i guess when we started
roger we verify that okay aquarius trim it to 76
okay you want plusx now to get 76 is that correct
thats affirmative
okay youre looking at it houston
okay looks good nice work
lets hope it was
okay aquarius wetre ready to follow you through on setting up tc and powerdown your choice
okay were pressing into getting ptc established right now
aquarius houston wetd like to change the num ber of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21 wed like to reduce that to 12 twelve pulses yaw right and thatll take you about 3 seconds to get them in if you dont want to count them
okay well make it 12 versus 21
okay houston im just about there now and as soon as i get 90 well start damping rates 01409 29 57 cc roger aquarius
okay houston im trying to damp rates now were at the proper roll attitude and pitch
roger aquarius
working a little bit better this time
are you copying any attitudes down there rates et cetera
okay aquarius were seeing some extremely low rates at this time really below our capability to measure them
roger
houston i think itve got pitch and roll just about squared away i let yaw just slightly drift its drifting in a clockwise direction and im about all set mow to put in my 12 clicks to the right
roger jim ready to look at it with you
twelve clicks right
okay jack are we clear now to proceed with the powerdown
thats affirmative fred were ready to press on with powerdown ive got two changes for you step 1 of the emergency powerdown on page power  5 over
go ahead
okay leave your powfjamplifier switch in primary vice off and put your ranging switch to range vice offreset
okay were in prim in the power amp and ranging on ranging
affirmative · 716
okay im going to pull well here lets just look at the checklist 04 09 39 14 lm okay configure cbs there you go
aquarius houston hold off 1 on poerdow please 04 09 39 23  okay well hold off and wetre looking at a she pressure incidentally of about 1830 now
roger we concur with that and it looks like you got a little pitch rate going on here do you copy the same
okay my pitch needle is just slightly up now i could try to take it out if you want me to 04 09 39 58  not  wait wait there you go
just hold off on it 1 jim wed like to take a look at it
okay
aquarius well need high bit rate please
flashlight jack jack flashlight over here a minut e
aquarius we need the power amplifier back in high bit rate please g4 09 40 37 imp you got it
you got a couple in the roll pretty soon
what is it 177
you have another set of them by the pgns
now we got to turn on the heaters you want to save 
whats that flitting out there in the breeze are we venting again take a look jack
well once we get squared away joe i think i am going to have to go to the space center and take a good healthy one and leave just about everything ive held up long enough 04 09 42 32 iaip thats coming from above another one just  is just coming down right over here well theres the old terminator at fra mauro wed been landing about 2 hours ago huh right on the  
houston aquarius
  to the right of the terminator
go ahead aquarius
just for information although i thought id never have to use it that technique looked like it was a pretty good one
roger jim and wed like you to give us your idea of how the ptc looks were not sre were seeing what we ought to here
okay  still have my ball powered up and im coming around past 270 right now ive got a slight roll and pitch offset in there my pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle is about 4 degrees over now
okay jim with that info well go on the ptc and lets proceed with the powerdown
okay well proceed with the ptc and proceed with the powerdown i guess if we have to we can reestablish ptc at a later date okay okay
first row ullage ags
your ags on
my what my what oh yes go ahead
okay the four inverters of this ac bus volt fred
okay go ahead
okay lets  give the last thing to jack and ill keep it all out okay rcs system a thats in tcas are going off why do they need the isol valves ia the ascent feed in
youtre not sucking any power unless you take these switches and move them lae l8 pau db
how come we pulled them out then in this burn
because you didnt want them to get moved inadvertently i guess it doesnt matter jim they can be out or in in terms of powerdown they just dont count
okay i got 1 2 3
isol valve should be in 2
yes okay third row attitude direct control i still have in 04 09 46 41 i24p jack how do you read now in baseband
reading you 5square fred how me 04 09 6 48 lmp okay ill stay this mode if its all right so we wont be hot miksd
roger
aquarius houston youre cleared to open the power amplifier circuit breaker and go to low bit rate leaving the power amp switch in primary 04 09 52 40 imp okay ill pull the prime sband power amp breaker and go low bit rate 04 10 04 25 limp houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius 04 10 04 34 i2vfp about how far out are we now jack
okay aquarius youtre 150 000 miles and youre coming in at 4500 feet a second thats from the earth 04 10 05 01 ijfp okay were at 100  yes 150 k 4500 feet a second
and aquarius how much ttca control did you have to do in the burn 04 10 05 34 i24p how much  what was that jack
how much control of the ttca did you have to do during the burn ij5
 wasnt noticing jim too much id say i put in maybe about six or seven inputs i dont think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths
roger fred thank you
i think its probably the same for jim i wasnt noticing his input but the  his needle was hanging in there pretty good
roger thank you fred pollo 13 airtoground voice transcriition ta  72 04 10 3 40 cc aquarius ttouston how do you read 04 10 33 245 cmp i read you loud and elear jack
okay jack whats your status whos sleeping and whos working
well right now were all three kind of working do you have any recommendations 04 10 3h 04 cc yes looks like to us from here that you and fred ought to get some leep and that you ought to eat in about 6 hours and that the skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours oh 0 34 23 cmp okay oh 0 3h p4 cc ive got some other information we shouldnt have some good dope on your trajectory for about 2 hours looked like to us that the burn was real good however and were taking a close look at it and well gctback with you on that in about 2 hours from now another thing that were expecting to have happen is that the she tank is going to reach its burst limit the earliest time we predict this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes and the latest probable time is at 110 hours and this is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent but you might hear it and you might see something
okay thats good news we were wondering about that and ill relay all the other information you gave me
okay and if the she tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info why that will delay our traectory info somewhat your consumables your rater is now good through 152 hours
jack wait a minute let me copy some of this down oh 10 35 34 cc okay
okay im ready now ae 531 04 0 35 54 cc okay were predicting that you still have more water than you need and one thing wed like for you to do is when youre going to sleep up there in the command module take a look through the optics and see if you can see any stars
okay jack i will do jim and i were able to spot constellations from the windows of the lm when theres no venting taking place could you give me some time on these consumables what youre predicting theyre good for i think you started to give them times didnt you or was i just hearing things 04 0 36 56 cc we started to give you some tmes we think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon but it looks like your water is good through 15 hours and youve got takusan 02 through o7o      and your amphours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours over
okay good copy that
we expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time delta will go up to 160  165 hours quite shortly another thing were interested in is whats your status on rest and medication
okay none of us i know of had any medications and right now as far as rest i suppose were no tireder than normally in this situation im going to relay the worksleep cycle
okay and dont forget to look through the optics when you go up in the command module
laughter okay ill do that oh 10 40 04 cmp jack as luck would have it we just now started to vent a little from the command module 
aquarius houston sorry about that but theres too much background noise to read you i think well have to wait until you come up on a new antenna over pae 532
okay aquarius go ahead now i think can hear you 0 10 41 ob cmp okay okay jack i was going to say as luck would have it the command module picked this time to start vting again o i probably wont be able to get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope
okay thank you and if you can think of it when the time comes up when youre not venting how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word
okay will do
houston aquarius
go ahead over
aquarius houston did you call
yes jack i just got  question how long are you predicting our command module canisters to last in here
okay jack weve got 14 cartridges thatll last 157 hours plus weve got the imprimary cartridge with 23 hours and weve got two plss cartridges with 7 hours apiece
okay i was just curious as to how much time weve got out of these two cartridges
stand by 1 ill get a prediction on that by the way i hope youre keeping track of the ones youve used and the ones youve not
yes right now we have numbers 7 and 8 in the imhere
roger
they were two brand new fresh ones
aquarius ttouston in regards to the c02 canisters by the way the pco2 is reading 16 down here now we expect that we can get 6 more hours out of the two canisters that we have there  6 hours at least however at 112 hours j pape 724 aie533 when weve got several people up were going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified procedure for doing this however in the meantime should we need to have a canister change we plan to switch to the lm primary canister over
okay copy that jack 0h 10 51 08 cc and aquarius hows your ptc holding up
well we got a little bit off jack the  it starts high in the lmps window and goes low in the cdr window oh 10 5 37 cmp so weve got a little bt of a wobble on it of course the command nodule venting doesnt help either
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
jack in reference to your question about the ptc on this last complete revolution the sun first appeared in the very top right corner of the lmp window passed over the cdr window and was visible through the overhead window and now the moon is  came pretty well through the center of both windows this last time
okay thank you jack copying that
aquarius houston wed like to get a little better idea of how ptc is going so what wed like for you to do is what we did last time that is to give us a reading on the center of the earth and the center of the moon on the  lpd oh 11 07 49 cmp on the lpd okay its shifted lets see the moons gone by and the earth didnt come into the lpd last time
okay but when it goes by the plane of the lpd tell us where it was okay
okay will do 04 11 13 3h cmp okay jack this pass the earth came into view at the top lefthand corner of the lmps window and was going down however when it passed it wasnt as high up as the last pass it did pass into view at the cdr window but too high up to get an lpd reading 01411 13 57 cc roger understand it went high in both windows then 014 14 04 cmp yes last time it wasnt even visible in the cdrs window this time it was visibe if you squatted down but too high up to et an lpd reading 04 1 ill i1 cc kay jack thats ood thank you  ii 1 51 mp kay houston aquarius 04 i 1 53 cc go ahead over oh 11 l q7 limp okay the moon came into view at the mlddie  thelmps window passed through the cds window at an lpd of 5 degrees 014il 1 cc roger understand 0l11 35 55 cmp houston aquarius 04 1 35 58 cc go ahead aquarius
okay jack on this pass the earth comte into the view at the top part of the inps window and we got an lpd angle on it as it passed through the cdrs window of a minus 4 degrees
okay a minus 4 thank you jack  
its  its above the  okay are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part huh
affirmed
okay houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay on this pass the moon came into view at the top part of the lmps window came across higher jim estimates the lpd angle at a minus 15 degrees iae726 0 11 45 09 cc okay a minus 15 on the moon and sounds like its set up pretty well
everybodys happy with it down there
aquarius its a little too early to tell exactly how the ptc is going wed like to get a few more points so keep reading them off and were still looking for that supercrit to go anytime
okay apollo 13 airtoground voice tn  i j
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius u4 11 59 17 cdr tho earth was just rairly iigh in the lfs window and across the 14derelepd line
okay skipper 14 degrees thank you
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
the hoon went by the ipd at 6 degrees plus 6 degrees
okay aplus 6 thank you 04 2 09 04 ic okay the moon thank you
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
the moon passed by at a minus s degrees on the lpd no thats the earth the earth passed by at a minus 8 degrees
okay the moon went by at a minus 8 degrees
okay jim we got it the earth went by at a minus 8 degrees on a basis of the data  
thats rght
on the basis of the data we have so far your entry angle is 599 the block data we gave you on the pad for a nocomm midcourse7 last night is no longer valid because we made this midcourse
okay understand the nocomm pad is no longer valid because of the mdcourse entry angle based on the last 2 hours tracking is 599 and i take it youre going to keep tracking for some time now to see whether we need another midcourse or not tab 7  ·
thats affirmative
are you planning any nocom2 midco rse at 13h and change anyway right now or are you going to wait like were going to wait on the tracking for the time being since youre in the corridor why theres no need to pa up blt wer going to keep looking at the tracking and well probably come up with one
ail right tm not too sure what tlleventing is going to do to us so  when ths stfe tank ruptures what its going to io for us oh 12 25 47 c0 roger we dont preselty expect the sh qfit to have any efek on zour trajectory ami the pressures up to 1921 now oh 12 25 59 cdr hey its going a lot better than we ever expected what a way to get a data point
and jack just think you thought you wee going to sleep through all your watches
say again jim
i said you thought you were going to sleep through all you watches
well you keep waking me up 0it 12 27 04 cdr sorry about that
aquarius houston ycu notice anything
yes jack z was just about ready to call you underneath quad 4 i noticed a lot of sparklies going out
can you hear or feel aaything
no i sure cant but i think it changed our  it changed out ptc let me check and see what the drift is
okay shes going down through 600 now pae 533
i think were probably going to have io rrestab lish ptc yus we got pretty fst yaw drftn jack
houston aquarius vnqtare your plans ozl12 56 oi uuwretnjlusbhbuuo thc  ii0 3 7 say it yawed some
yes i was in a right yaw and now im in a left yaw at a much faster rate than the one we put in ptc
okay jim were talking it over stand by
whats the she tank down to now jack
okay jim its goin through 125 pounds now and we tm3erstcoc a yon to say   n o v n rnp okay
  that it reversed your yaw is that affirma tive
sure did jack it reversed my yaw completely and put in a little pitch t think
but more than anything it reversed my yaw
roger laveyou effecthvely established ptc in the opposite direction then
well you could say that im not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll ive got coupled with the yaw i just saw the earth go by the lmrs window here not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction
perhaps you can tell ow fast im having to shift omnis
yes we can tell the comm cycling back and forth
is that what they call a nonproputsive vent
right id hate to see a propulsive one
you and me both 0ij2 59 04 cc its going through 50 pounds now foare you seeing fewer sparklies
yes much fewer not any at all now im not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll  left roll  thats  if thats what it gave me
you say you think it might have given you some left roll as opposed to opposite yaw
im sure it gave me the yaw jack but im not too sure 
okay wed kind of like to watch it sec what happens for a little while before we mete a recommendation howeer well need some inputs from you on that
well were in no trouble up here as far as  its faster than we hsd set up before we just wanted to get into proper thermal constraint and its going to taka me 15 minutes to get the thrusters up anyway
okay skipper we dont see any thermal problems as a result of this change if we see some communications problems we may have to do something different but so far so good and wed kind of like to hear from you on lpd num bers if you get anything going by the window
okay will do
okay jack the earth just went through at an lpd of 26 degrees
okay the earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time  left to right is that right
from left to right hats affirmative  04 13 02 32 cc of course the only other thing that wed be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what deltav it imparted and well have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it and if there is no significant change why we prefer just to leave it the way it is
okay jack wer going to get a time on a revolution here and maybe thatll help you out
right and for your information the tank went at 1937
thats two thousand  19377
right
okay jack the earth went through again at 18 degrees on the lpd
okay earth at 18 thank you 01413 04 23 cmp okay and we didnt see the moon that time
okay jack the moon ent through that time at 32 degrees on the ld
roger moon at 32 thanks
okay jack well we didnt get the earth that time the moon came back through at about 10 degrees and now were getting to the earth again stand by
okay the earth came through the lpd at 62 degrees that time and the total time for the two revolutions  i missed the earth revolution before but the total time for the earths two revolutions was 3 minutes and 50 seconds
say again the time and the  and also the lpd number youre in the background noise jack 0413 09 39 cmp okay ok jack lp9 that time was 62 degrees and that was for two revolutions being at that distance we missed the earth  the time before we didnt see it and the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds
okay three minutes and 50 seconds is that rate uncomfortable for you oh 13 10 34 cmp jack jim said it isnt uncomfortable its a little annoying as for the 0mni switching and also he said its kind of  he said this earthmoon relationships kind of  because he doesnt know when to 
roger
okay jack weve got a master ala and weve got a battery light flickering
okay copy a battery light what battery
aquarius how about cycling the power temp monitor to find out which battery it is please
yes thats in work joe
okay its that same old  04 1 14 54 c okay fred i can hear you now say again please
okay yts the same old  same old one the only light im getting is on bat 2 u 15 35 cc okay fred we copy your same old friend battery 2 could you giye us high bit rate for a while please
aquarius houston high bit rate please
how you getting it now jack
we got it
okay aquarius you can go low bit rate por amp off and d0 voice backup now voltages and currents look normal on battery 2 so ignore the battery light
okay jack power amp off back to low bit rate and ill go back to sleep
the battery light staying on 04 13 21 30 cml yes we got a steady on bat 2 bat fault light and the battery caution light
okay and the skipper in the sack now oh 13 21 56 cmp say again
is the skipper in the sack now
okay hold on a minute jack iafe542 04 13 21417 cc aquarius houston 04 324 22 cdr go ahead lolston 04 13 2l24 cc okay jim since the antenna switch is kind ol annoying weve talked them into bing only half of the data if it gets too troublesome for you to switch antennas why just leave ii on one antenna and well listen to you half of the time apollo 13 airtoground voice trancription pav 543
okay its not really much trouble thats ll were doing about it well try to keep up with it and youre satisfied with this attitude so far i guess youre going to watch the thermal and find out whether perhaps were going to some other ptc attitude
roger thermal appears to be no problem were looking at what deltav might have been impated due to this and it looks like were not going to change the ptc attitude
okay then deltav was a part of it i hope it raised that angle a little bit 04 13 25 h4 cc yes well he looking at the data here and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or so
okay meanwhile back to the drawing board about nonpropulsive vents
and with your kind of luck it probably lowered the angle sne more
thanks for the confidence
and jim were going to have a handover here pretty soon about 3 minutes we may lose uplink for 30 seconds or a minute
okay
aquarius houston were handed over how do you read
read you loud and clear jack
okay im hearing you now and the noise has come up again but it will go down
how do you read now
okay thats a lot better and we figure your battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered a mal  a caution and warning just cycled once and triggered a master alarm again well watch the batteries for you since you dont have any caution and warning on now tap e 74 014 13 31 13 cdi okay apprcciat tha
okay jim your luck is holding tracking shows that your entry angle has gone up to minus 624 this is on the basis f all the data wee col lected between the midcourse up to the time the she tank went owcl continue to laok at it md see if slletank did mylhng to it al ail so its  thc data ha ion lom o o t minus 624
that sounds pretty good were eally gettintl in there 04 1l0353 cc how are you doing ji oh 14 00 59 cdr not bad not bad at all
is jack in the sack or is he with you 04 ih oi    l t of humorous freds aieeping place now is in the tunnel upside down wth his head resting on the ascent engine jack is on the floor of the lm with a restraint  rrapped around his arm to keep him down there
you say yack is on th floor and fred is with his head on the ascen3 engine
thats right withhis feet up into the tunnel
okay skipper your uckis really hanging in there your waters good up to 161 hours now
hey that sounds great
that doesnt include lss water or command module water
okay jack id just like to know what  what plans or thoughts being contemplated for the plsss or the ops wheher were going to use their lioh canisters or take the devices back in the command module wihus or just what will be your plans
yes were talking all that over now we havent decided 04 ih 09  cgr okay fl iii 1 1 cc ewtythini runjnini ral mocjlii tvtr ill tiihtt cove j irrl
sounds pretty good ttow about ati1lago 04 ih 15 11 cc same everythings smooth there too
good
jim weve had a lot fpeople working on the entry procedures and theyll be continuing to do so we got a few ideas wed like to toss at you so you can start hinking about them if you think youre in a position to discuss them with out waking up the other guys what do you think
yes go ahead its ckay h h o lf rr  one f h first things w wantto do i charge the battery in csm so we can get some impower over there to do that and we have pro cedures ginned up to do it in regards to reentry were planning our last mideolrse at 5 hours before entry interface and if we have to make one that is and then wed like to jettison the service module at 4 hours and a  half roughly before entry interface and take  the next 3 to 312 hours for taking pictures cranking up the command module gn taking care of stowage and other odds and ends and wed hang on to the lm until 1 hour before entry interface and then wed jettison that and these procedures are going to be run integrated in the cms and lms tomorrow morning and hope fully later on in the day well do it again with mission control on the loop a couple of other things wed like to toss at you one question is what do we do with the ops the thought is that there is adequate 02 in the command module and that the ops represents high pressure source and a stowage problem and people are thinking about letving them in the lm the other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry suiting up prior to lm jettison because what were doing is when we jettison the lm were going to do it like tap7414 we did in apollo 10  just let the beatlty go and if we werent suited why wed be betting on the hatch sea to take care of us so we thought wed toss these few ideas at you some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this tim
okay a suited entry would sort of  the 1hour lm jettison bak and  back and forth up to that time  impede our progress back and forth 
were losing you jim
okay i think ive got you back i guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to  04 14 26 5 cc affirmative jim midcourse 5 hours prior to entry interface oh 4 26 35 cdr if thats the case al1im worried about is having that all squared away its long before that  1 want everything in its place ail the stowage cleared aay all the  ready to go and know exactly what to do and  so that we can do the midcourse and  get into the command module  je3tison the service module and then know exactly how to get into he lm
roger ail those procedures will work  will be worked out precisely and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse
and i guess that latmidcourse wed want to start looking at midcourse fairly early if we have the power to do so mainly because of atti tude control this last time was fairly easy but im not too sure iowlong we can continue to 
i have  in and it seems about as cold as it is now well probably be going into suits long before entry
yes thats what we were thinking ape715 peg 547
i guess the two things which are somewhat unre solved at the moment ire what to do with the eps and what to do about the suited entry we thought wed toss thoro at you to see what you thought about them i44 29 06 cdr okay as far as thc isis cortcrncd we have enough oxygen in the paceeraft  to get us through i have no  coimnand module  suit loop prior to entry i was looking at  ops  sources of oxygen  also in the  in the front of the suit loop or  circulate 
jim im sorry wer not catching what youre saying the comm is getting kind of bad right now
okay jack how do you read now
ive still got you with quite a bit of background can hear you
okay my only concern about leaving the eps andor the plss in the command module s how soon do we have to live off the command module consumables prior to entry and the plss has a fan and has a ithium hydroxide  use the com mand module system also the ops  right now  command module  command module oxygen and electrical power is  but i had just as soon be  back in the lm
it sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the command module youd just as soon leave the ops in the lm is that affirm 04 ih 31 24 cdr thats affirm 04 ih 31 31 cc okay and maybe youd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead fap 746 afe 54jj 04 j4 32 06 cdr okay  how we aline the commanl moiul right for entry especially if you have tie i2 in back over
roger thats one subject thats been gettin a lot of attention and let me see if i can get some general ideas on that at the moment 04 14 32 3 cdr okay 04 j4 5 36 cc jim i can give you the genera idea of the proposed procedure for bringing the conhand module gn up its the presently proposed on we may come up with a better one but heres what were looking at ight now first thing we plan to do is to  usiag the lm coas sight on the earth with the lm just as we did in the mid course then well do a bodyaxis aline 400 plus 5 on the acs to put the ags ball at 000 and then we can give you an ags ball attitude to fly to to point the csm optics at the moon and if you can see stars why we can use those too then we can give you an equivalent set of cdu angles to put into noun 20 and to torque the platform over so now were coarse alined then we do a cine aline by shooting at the moon and then at the sun do you follow all that
okay jack let me see if i have it what we do is point the lm at the earth as we did for the midcourse coas and we do a bodyaxis aline on the ags then you give us an ags ball atti tude to fly to  te lm and then we  point the  at the moon then you would update the  give us some cdus to coarse aline  fine aline  on star or the moon or the earth stand by okay we had another master alarm jack i dont see any lights down there except the battery lights still there you want    display ecs okay and the number 2 battery still has a light on it i suspect it may be the same problem that we had before 
okay let us talk it over a second and well tell you what to do
jim is the battery light kind of flickering
yes thats affirm jack itll  i1 i iit  l l
yes thc battery lights flickeringmd it triggers off the master alarm
okay well that  temperature sensor on bat tery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does it triggers a master alapx jim
okay same old problen huh
yes
and jim finally on tae p52 were considering using the  the moon and then the sun for the fine aline
okay the moon and the sun for the fine aline understand well go through this again here  0114 14055 cdr okay jack once  0ne i get the spacecraft at the proper attitude 
jim i didnt copy youc last question due to background noise
okay once  once you get the aos ball alined  command module 
after we do the body axis aline on the ags we can tell you what attitude on the ags ball to fly to in order to poiat the csm optics at the moon or at some star and then we can knowing where the optics are pointed give you an equiv alent set of cdu angles to put in noun 20 to torque the platform
okay i see
thats the current thinking it may change between now and tomorrow but right now thats the way it looks jim itll probably be some takeoff on that anyway
okay are they planniag on a gn entry or using another system like s or something 1lke that
it will be a gn entry
nothing like going first class
yes thatll be a switch wont it
jim are you brokcn into the food loskor in tho lm yet
thats affirm jack i sure have  away
you say you did find everything in order in there huh 04 lh 6 20 cdr yes everything was great
okay ill pass it
i had a question about that earlier
right oh 14 48 13 cdr iiouston aquarius 04 ih 48 16 cc go ahoad
i understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the command module hatch  hasnt been good it doesnt seem to be any different but in the other  our hatch is no better than other spacecraft
no the situation jim is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we wont have a chance to verify it until so late in the game like 1 hour before entry interface in thss case whereas before why we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit over
oh okay
and that might make your time line a little too crowded getting your suits on there at the last minute say less than an hour before entry interface
okay 0l14 50 30 cc jim the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some lm ower up to the comland module main b so we csn start charging battery and i guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there so when you decide to get the other guys up or to have someone help why let us know and well start working on that ill 7 34 14 51 oj cdit okay iii let you haw jiak tld f4  when l the time in  04 ii  i  ay zltlill ijlll j itjllt ctl jlll  04 l4 5  cdr wmn in mr tilil  what th git do you tli ci9    04 ih 52 07 cc jim i didnt catch all of what you said l l l think you wanted to krow whn the procdur entry are going to be available and read up  you if thats the case why were talking about 120 hours or so as far as the  charyi battery a we want to do that as soon as th other guys get up to help you weve already passed up som of that piocedure and we le a couple of deltas to it
oger jk already up m askd  aulio when you wantd to do it did you unorstnd that  is that correct
jim were haviilg trouble hearing you the nxt order of business is to charge tattery a ant when you get somebody to help you theft why well go aheafi and get done with it
okay 3ounds good
and before you ntart working on it let l43w because weve got some deltas to the battery charging procedure
roger im putting jack on the line now to copy down the deltas 
 04 14 51t02 cc aquarius did you call
yes jack im on the line 
okay go ahead now i can hear better
okay jack joe kerwin passed me up the proce dure for powering the ism from the lm has it changed
yes if youll get tljat out ill read you the deltas tape 7 10 ae 52
okay ive got it 04 14 54 h7 cc okay the second step was in the i24circuit breakers panel ll and 16 ascent eca control close two of them cross that out in the next line we had battery 5 normal feed on cross out battery 5 an put battery 6 in there in the next line was  
 jack  hey jack i have for step 3 i have bat 5 and bat 6 normal fewjon you just want bat 6
thats affirmative just bat 6 jack and the next line you had battery i and 3 make that battery l 2 3 and 4 just add bats 2 and h all four descent bats and then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes cross that out and the next line about batteries 2 and 4 off reset cross that out too
okay let me read  0044 1144 5566 0192 cccc agnodahejaadck the  
let me read you all the steps as ive got them jack and make sure weve got them right  ascent eca two closed step 2 will now be bat 6 normal feed on step 3 bats 1 2 3 and 4 offreset
okay that parts al right jack and we had  ab6ut 11 or 12 steps for the command mod ule they go as is with no change and then we had a couple of more procedures for the lm stand by 1
okay jack let me read you command module pro cedures just to make sure i have them right also
okay go ahead with the command module procedures
okay connect lm and csm umbilicals step 2 panel 5 lm power i ac and 2 ac closed circuit breakers step 3 panel 5 eps sensor signal main b closed step 4 panel  closed then theres step 5 main b bat bus b closed i verify mafn buvcjtage thn witch the lm power to cj tep 7 cb main  bat iiji b open and on pane2 250 bat powe entry and postlanding open verify main bus voltage ilo 13 airtoirovhi voice rajscrpiin f  f 21 t lt t j
okay ack the flr procedutes okay anco lhen we had to fsoback to the ih and do something and the first line is okay cross out bat 5 and 6 off delete that and delete tile net line also that says am  to 16 ascent eca control open then we had a couple of notes which remain the same go ahead 04 4 59 20 cmp okay i didnt get the notes but ill read you the steps as i haw them now one step bat 1 2 3 and 4  and at this point should have batteries 2 2 3 4 and 6 on is that affirmat 5ye 04 14 59 9 cc thats affirmative so now we have bat 1 2 3 4 and 6 on and i got two notes number 1 is your csreuit breaker protection limits  your clrcuit breaker protection  limits the current to 15 amps nraber 2 note is now the umbilical between the lm and the command module
izuu jlll uii ivllti hukj vjj t 11 kli hiulli tored by selecting main b 04 15 00 46 cml okay jack these notes are circuit breaker protection limits current to 5 amps the tube the mnbiical between the csm and im is hot i can monitor main b for the bus voltage
thats affirm jack
okay jack one question here if we transfer power 15kc this were not going to cut us short on power remaining in the csm  are we 
say it again jack i idnt get it oh 15 01 43 cmp okay tandby if we confsgure the csm for powering up the lm we arent going to cut it short on lm power requirements to get us back in the entry interface are we
thats a negative jack according to the latest update weve got amperehours out to 203 hours
stand by  ok 15 02 40 cmp okay jack one question from jim is he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried  iae 75 2  u 04  okay try it again now jack what did jim want to know
okay ho wotlld like to know whether the proce dure has been tried and whether it has been folmd to be okay and theres no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on boart the i now 04 5 04 20 cc okay jack this procedure has not been tried out as such however the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory and theres not a problem with shorting out a descent battery over 04 15 04 47 cml okay ill reay that to jim oh 5 05 09 cc jack of corse the reason for all of this i that we see were 20 amphours short on one of the elry batteries and weve got to juice that up lo get you home with
okay 0i15 05 30 cc okay what we owe you from here on out is the actual battery a charge procedure and then a procedure to turn this all around again
okay ioyou have it there and how long is it 
okay jack i have the procedure in front of me its about 18 steps and the reason its so long is because were starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier it concerns a charge on battery a of course which is our low one so when youre ready to copy it lec me know
okay lets go at it
okay are you ready to read  copy it 04 15 06 53 cmt go ahead 04 15 06 54 cc okay on panel 250 circuit breaker bat a power entrypostlanding close on panel 275 circuit breaker inverttrpower 2 main b close next several circuit breakers are on panel 5 pase 55 circuit breaker bat relay bus bat a close circuit breaker bps sblnsor unit ac ius2 close cieps smnsor zignal ac2 close cb aitercyitargfr hain b close are you still with mef

how about reaching over there on your righthand side and turning the 2iomed off see if we can improve the comma little bit
okay how do you read now
okay im reading you real good now and i want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched off was bat alfa charlie
thats verified main bus tie bat alfa charlie off and that should   754 jli  j ac tnverit2to main 3 04 5 12 39 cmp okay ac inverter 2 to slain b
okay and switch inverter 2 ac bus 2 to on and another switch ac bus 2 reset to reset and center switch battery ciiarge to alfa wuuh u uuaun sjlub bat ciiargerad then what we want you to do is to report the charger current and voltage to msfn every l0 minutes for the first half hour and then once every 30 minutes after that and thatll be on our cai1 jack read back the switches that i just gave you
okay jack its panel 3 ac inverter 2 main b inverter 2 ac bus 2 on ac bus 2 reset to reset and center bat ciiarger to a ac indicator select to bat carger report amps and volts to msfn every 10 minutes fozthe first 30 minutes and then every 30 minutes on a msfn call 04 15 1 29 cc okay thats a good readback jack now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this which we will have 04 15 14 40 cmi okay let me ask one question here about how long do you think itll take to charge these batteries
its going to take you about 15 hours
jack about how many speres of lm power will this 15 hours 
stand by well get iifor you   04 15 5 22 cmp how many jack
okay re got it he got the question
okay jack thats going to take 120 mnphours out of the lm which is equivalent to 10 hours which will put us back to 193 hours and thats plenty
okay let me relay that to jim here itll be 120 amp hours which leaves us  which puts us back from 203 hours  to 193 hours  e 04 15 16 20 1241 yes teres that much to spare 415 16 35 lm okay jack one question here ifwe have any prohlemtitllgup this im power to the csm is the quickest way to et out of it return to the norta configuration as it is for me to just switch the im power to csm to reset then off
stand by l
i would lke to give one quick step in case that gave jim report some sort of problem for us to get out oiit quickly
okay let us talk it over for a minute jack 04 15 17 16 cml okay real fine and while you guys are talk ing it over you might read back  rave you got the procedure for revrsing this ill copy that 04 15 20 o0 civil okay jack are you with me
yes were still here jack what we want to do is follow you through on this so were going to get high bit rate to do it in answer to your question to undo this procedure quicky in the event a problem develops be sure thab you dont touch the 124power switch because its got a reset position but the way to undo it is go into the csm and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers and theyre some of the first ones we read to you open lm power1 in b and open lm power2 main b you copy that 0115 20 45 cml kay understand if i want to get out of this real quickly i have to open just two circuit breakers in the csm thats on panel 5 lm power main b lm power2 main b
okay aridbefore you go ahead with this lets establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that and then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on main b so we cart take a look at main b without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries
okay i understand you want high bit rate on the ior csm just before we start this qqe 750 a6e 5q 04 15 21 0 cc that will be high bit rate on the lm and stand by cor it 04 15 21 45 c okay oh 15 21 52 cc okay jack before we go ahead with this what we want to do is read you the reverse  the normal reverse procedure
okay im ready to copy
okay jack i got the start on how you reverse this procedure ready to copy
go ahead jack 04 15 23 06 cnv oksy first you want to reverse the battery charge procedure to do that on panel b switch battery ciiarge off ac inverter 2 off pane 5 iiin bus tie bat alfa charlie on up panel 250 circuit breaker bat alfa por entry anostianding open read back 0115 23 59 cmp okay jack on panel battery charger off ac inverter 2 off on panel 5 main bus tie alfa charlc on panel 250 cb bat a power entry and postlanding open 01115 24 23 cc thats affirmative jack and then if youll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list and just opposite  open them ali up stand by 1 04 15 2h 52 cc okay jack go back to the battery charge pro cedure i gave you and in order to terminate charge just  youll just have to write open or off next to the circuit switch that i gave you so on panel 250 that circuit breaker youve already opened on panel 275 inverter power2 main b open panel 5 bat relay bus bat a open eps sensor unit ac bus 2 open eps sensor signal ac2 open battery charger main b open battery charger ac power open battery cirger bat a ctlarge open inverter control 2 open inverter control 3 open youve already done the main bus tie and then bat ctrge switch to ac 1 over on panel 3 you have already set the ac inverter 2 to off pae 50 md icn iivertfr 2 ac btit 2 oiil al bus 2 reut tt hf you hvo already put the 145qlly ciiargfr witch tooff and your dc ndicator select to main b over
okay jack do you want me to read it back to you
no iiyouve got something in the righthand column for all of tose we dont want to have to do it and now one more thing i owe you is how to ultransfer lm power to the csm and ill get that oryou in a jiffy
okay i be standing by to copy it
okay we have a last minute change to that
iouston 13 0il15 33 23 cc go ahead 04 q  o o  one thng i guess you probably all have considered it but what heavy things can we store down there where the srcs normally go to help increase our l over d
i understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the srcs go
yes they go down in the leb underneath the computer and the heavier things you have down there increases the l over d we dont have any srcs so i was just wondering what heavy things  we could probably put some cameras television csxaeras things like that that nor mally pretty heavy down there in  that in our src no we cant put the in our src but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our l over d any thing else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we dont even have a throwaway station so were down a little bit in l over d 01j15 34 33 cc okay let me pass that question along and get somebody working on it

 you got just a lttle bit scratchy there be cause of the aifienna problem let me read this back to you
okay what i got jack was the procedure assumes that all descent battzies are on and bat 6 is on normal feed now ere going into the lm and on panel 5 we take lm or cb impow2 main b open and thats as far as i got 04 15 318 cc okay the second one is on panel 5 also circuit breaker lm poweri main a open circuit breaker eps sensor signal main b open okay read those back for the csm and ill give you some steps in the lm
okay
okay cb impower2 main b open cb lm powerl main a open cb eps sensor signal main b open stand by 1 jack

okay when do you plan to start this 0h 15 41 10 cc darn soon
did you say not soon
no were going to do it pretty soon but we want to have high bit rate and we dont want you to give that to us until we teli you
okay i think ill go back and try to undamp up there do you have anything more for the command module
were dicussingtwo items but we dont have them ready right now
one of them i hope is a foolproof alinement procedzre
okay jack just for curiositys sake does fiio have any information as to whether that helium  that helium tank dump affected our trajectory at all
okay aquarius our tzacking data shows that since the helium dump our ertry angle bas not changed pae 563 prom it value of 624 and omebody cacuatd that if we had a propulsive vent that hcim could roughly at the maximtn only impart a deltav of a half a foot per second or less anyway tlt were continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info well pass it along
okay thats swell jack thank you
sure
your 6h sounds good oh 15 44 14 cdr im still awake i guess
they said that it would be a while because they warn to get high bit rate they dont want to put high bit rate 
okay aquarius were ready so we want some high bit rate to do that go over to panel 16 under comm and close the primary sband power amplifi on your comm panel  oh 15 46 56 cmp okay okay jack wait 1 while  id like to get the whole crew up for this if you dont mind
okay
 theyre ready to start yes you want to get fredo up
we want to transfer some power  i want to go to high bit rate here first then want to transfer lm power to csm fred
okay jim ill give you the comm 04 15 h7 40 cc aquarius theres no great big rush if you want to let fred come up to speed slowly why maybe thatll help out
okay 
and houston jack is showing fred the procedures before we start up
say again jim
 tap7511 ii54 04 15 50 2 cc aquarius lowdo you relld 04 15 50 3 cdr loud and ctlear
okay im hearing you now i think i missed your last transmission jim
okay jack is showing fred the procedures want to get tim fliariewith them and how to get out of any problems before we proceed oh 15 50 5h cc roger no rush just let us know when youre ready we dont want old fredo to slip a gimbal there
yes were watching him
boy if you took 120 hours out oh  okay 
houston aquarius
hello fred go ahead
okay i guess the only question i have is in the first  the very first portion involving the lm here where it has me tlrnon the only bat 6 and then turn off all the descent batteries are you still reading me
okay i read you until after turn off bat 6  correction turn on only bat 6
okay the question is only one ascent battery bat 6 on the line iimnediately followed by turning off four deoce  bats is that correct
thats affirmative fred that question has been banged around and we decided to go that way 0115 55 38 lmp lets see we will be powering other bus via the cross tie balance loads breaker is that correct
2nats affirmative and were reading a current of 11 amps right now
okay okay i guess im ready then thats 11 amps
and after you turn bat 6 on the line you might as well take a look at the bats 1 through 4 and so forth and make sure that its okay to turn them off iwct5
yes were ready for the power amplifier and the higtt bit rate and normal voice on the function switch please
okay fl nm ff fo flrl 1 i 4l ltfi tdam u u u   es   got liu tfimm now 
roger
okay we sebat 6 on and it looks good fredo 04 15 57 38 jmp okay n i cleared to proceed with the next step getting 1 2 3 and 4 offreset
affivnative youre cleared for bats 1 through 4 offreset
okay fjj i  kp i r ff pnr  i 1nnkn onnc 04 15 59 13 limp okay houston we need a call from you when to have jack to proceed up into the odyssey and start up there
okay aquarius and jack can get with it right now
okay
okay houston aquarius weve completed the powerup and things look good upstairs are we go for proceeding with battery charge
okay aquarius youre go on the battery charge
roger 04 16 07 36 imp boy this is really a switch isnt it jack
thats an understatement youre not known for that 04 16 07 54 sip yes i think if you add up the  yes  if you add up the operating time i think the lm beats the csm by a considerable margin on this flight
grumman just hired you 04 16 05 38 tap yes
youre out there at 134000 coming in at about 4900 feet a second
very good
the spercrit tank went off at about 193 just bj like e
yes it  it also must of not did very much ex cept the rates i was asleep then and i didnt hear a thing
is the command  service module still venting
jack said it was just before he went up right now the suns over there and i cant really tell  
and   04 16 10 44 co we asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics i dont think we ever got an answer
okay 04 16 11 04 imp thats a pretty good sleep station i had rigged up jack i took one of the sleep restraints out of the command module zipped up in it and then hooked the tie right at the top of the zipper onto the lm upper hatch handle so it kind of held me there and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch so the sunlight didnt get in my eyes and that worked pretty good
did you sleep pretty well that way
yes no problem at all
is jim sleeping that way now or is he standing next to you 04 16 11 49 imp hes standing next to me
about time for him to go to bed tapersll iage 57
okay tlevoltage upstairs s 343 and the charger is reading 25 amps
okay b4b and 25 and  says    04 16 12 11 iapp   pretty cold good
say again your last 04 16 12 16 ip they came  both came down here rubbing their hands shivering its pretty cool upstairs
are you keeping warm in the lm
yes its pretty reasonable down here
okay and right now it looks like  right now it looks like the command module isnt venting jack so im going to try to take a look at the optics
okay you say it is not venting
yes thats the word weve just looked through the a0t and you cant see anything back there
okay and everythings fine in e1 lago
very good
aquarius were ready to secure the high bit rate
okay 04 16 16 32 imp houston aquarius how do you read
im hearing you with a lot of background noise fredo
okay how now i just switched omnis again
aquarius could you get a  amps and volts readout from odyssey please 04 16 23 45 i2p okay stand by
the cmp is dotting across there youd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times
i didnt get your last there fredo wed like you to verify that your power amplifier circuit breaker is open 04 16 24 44 mp okay thats verified power ampl breaker is open
roger 04 16 25 00 ip okay jack thats 346 volts and just a little bit under 25 amps
okay fred i copied 25 amps say again the volts please 04 16 25 15 imp 343 and that was just a little bit below 25
343 thank you 04 16 25 33 imp okay  point 
fredo i didnt copy the last say again the voltage please
okay and the voltge is 346  346 amps slightly less than 25
346 and a little below 25 thank you
were  the way we are torquing around to the side here jack  we are getting some intervals where i cant hardly get to it with either of the omnis apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
houston aquarius
go ahead hous aquarius
okay jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the lm  portion of the lm quad and other thruster  right now  really moving around 
okay the part i got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads thats all i got
yes the point being that at least in the present orientation you have to kind of wait until sun isnt reflected off the lm to see them
okay what youre saying is you kind of have to wait until the  there is no sun reflection on the lm to see the stars is that right
yes thats for the present orientation of collrse
but later on if you can stop it moving around and  04 16 34 35 cc okay  
 04 16 34 47 co okay fredo and we need a volts and amps reading
okay and bring it back upstairs 04 16 35 36  okay the volts 350 amps 24
okay 350 and 24 thanks fred
the weather prediction for your landing area is still good 2000 scattered high scattered 4foot seas 15knots wind theres a hurricane 500 miles to the west which doesnt pose a problem 04 16 39 02 i24p a hurricane or a typhoon
delay my last its degraded to a tropical storm
aquarius houston we need another readout amps and volts and that will be our last one for a half hour over
okay the reading is 378 volts 23 amps
say again fred
378 volts 23 amps
378 and 23 and that will be our last one for a half hour thank you and im about to exercise my fifth general order here and pass it along to joe
yes it must be getting around a mealtime
aquarius houston over
okay this is your friendly doityourself kit comm with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation youre looking good we read 18 millimeters and you do have sufficient lm  to last you the rest of the flight however being on the conservative side we would like to use one more set of command module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the lm primary canister and i have a simplified procedure for doing that if you want to listen to it now over
okay i think i read that you were ready i forgot  earphones this simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the command module putting one band of sticky tape that is the gray tape with the sticky side out around the sides of each new canister near the top taking a piece of eva cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side bending those at a right angle to form corner support attaching them to the sticky tape so that theyll stick up and overlap the old canister and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together the only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge and thats it over
okay as i read youj we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get  the back sticks around the outside of the canisters then we mount to that four sides of our  cards like our eva  cards then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister then we  then we  over the  at the top  then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones 
okay fred i think you got it i didnt com pletely copy your readback but its just that simple were just putting the new cartridge  the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one moving that towel plug using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners and taping her up
okay the top of the new against the bottom of the old
roger that that way you dont have to touch the hose
hey for a change i took the  lm  this morning joe
okay go ahead
i got 
im afraid i didnt copy that fred and while i was listening eecom told me that hed like another battery charge  readout
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
you want us to start on this lithium right now joe or is it necessary
its not timecritical fred but if you have the people awake now you might go ahead and do it incidentally you probably know this but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view were working on the entry procedures and should he ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours and between now and then theres not an awful lot going to be going on so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule over 04 1723 22 ltw okay jo
and we would like another readout on the amps and volts 04 17 23 31 l55 roger
okay the volts joe are 389 and the amps are 19
okay copy that fred thank you very much 389 and 19 and eecom is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps were putting back into the battery thats why he wants it at halfhour intervals if that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so give us a call over
okay 
yes jims sleeping now and jack and i are awake and i just finished sleeping around i guess about another 5 or 6 hours so im not particularly inclined to go back to sleep right now
okay
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
okay weve got one of them ready to go and it looks like we could do a pretty good job just using the tape strips first combining them together and then just using a piece of paper and the bag  get a pretty good seal 
hey okay fred we suspected that youd gotten at least one on weve noticed a partial pressure drop from the 18 to 08 which is real good
okay you might run that by the cpcb and see if they approve our inhouse 
roger that
aquarius houston
aquarius houston 04 17 40 26 i2v go ahead jo
roger were convening the cpcb on that change fred but flight has given you an interim go ahead over
okay
and how do you read now
not too had fred
okay weve got both canisters completed now
okay roger that fred and youre reading 01 again on the co2 incidentally are you guys having good luck getting water out of the command module
we  we havent tried that yet today
okay
yes this is quite an apparatus hanging on to these hoses now and that ecs design engineer · because it sure seems to work
roger that
and aquarius houston at your convenience wed like another volts and amps readout
okay
how do you read joe
pretty good fred
okay volts 390 amps 17
390 17 thank you apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription
aquarius houston go ahead youre pretty weak
i didnt call you joe
say again
i didnt call
oh sorry about that incidentally fred if switching omnis every couple of minutes bugs you you can skip it for now we can always wait until you come around
no it doesnt this is jack joe fred  it doesnt bother me at all
okay
just happy to know that youre standing by
roger that except im sitting by
did that co2 drop
joe how far out are we now and how fast are we closing
okay jack the plot shows you about 130 000 miles out which is about gee 10 000 closer than you were when i came on a couple of hours ago and let me check with fido for your rate of closure
hey jack over
go ahead
your smiling fido says youre making 5040 in a 5000mile zone
i cant  i 
aquarius houston over
go ahead joe
roger jack hate to keep bugging you but we would like another volts and amps reading over
okay well get it for you
good show
joe did our sticky mod on that  those co2 canisters work im sorry  
jack i think you asked if the canister mod was working and the answer is it sure as hell is
okay joe i got the voltage its 390 amps and 175
copy 390 and 175
houston do you read aquarius
aquarius houston thats affirmative
okay we had a dropout there for a few minutes  on either antenna
gee whiz jack i  when did it happen over
just now i just got you back
okay we had a handover but that was about a half an hour ago and i didnt call you on it let me check with inco and see if he thinks everythings okay your comm sounds just as good as its ever been
yes im in real good shape
jack houston over
go ahead
roger were checking into it we think we lost lock in madrid for a while and weve got it back now
okay real fine 
okay
you might also check with fido whether we  perigee 
youre getting a little weak did you say you wanted to verify what  what your vacuum perigee is over
yes 
jack houston over
go ahead
okay the good fido gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 236 with a flight path angle of minus 625 degrees thats without a midcourse hes kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry if we do it it looks like it wont be more than 2 feet per second over
okay
and jack houston we verified that that c04 problem was a ground problem
okay thank you that fid0 is really cooking today
oh hes having a ball
it must be because we havent made any waste water dumps
laughter
you can tell jay and david that i went for a whole flight and didnt use the bathroom
laughter he copies that davids here he says youve kept him so busy he hasnt had time to work on his stereo all week
aquarius houston over
go ahead
jack wed like another volts and amps reading at your convenience 019 09 25 cmp okay houston it 392 ots 6 flfls
okay thank you we copy 392 volts and 16 amps
right
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
i just relieved the watch just thought id find out how things are going
okay jim good morning and understand you relieved the watch and the rest was kind of blurry did you have any questions
no questions joe just  apuijlo i3 airtogrtjitlvoice trancription
okay that was  that was loud and clear that one there now we dont have a heck of a lot going on as you know were working on the entry procedures ive got preliminary copies but were not ready to pass  to pass it up to you looks like youre about 125 000 miles out starting to  starting to really pick up speed and the astros won last night and thats about all ive got over
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay jim its about time at your convenience for another volts and amps reading on the command module for your information we put 6 amphours back in the battery already and weve got about 14 to go its looking real good and i also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time really looks great
thats good when i went to bed last night  a lot of rain 
couldnt copy that jim sorry
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
roger 392 on the volts 14 on the amps
392 and 14 thank you
aquarius houston
go ahead joe
roger just for your information in case it happened when you were off watch the master caution circuit breaker is still pulled and were seeing the  the malfunction indication on the descent battery now but all the param eters still look just as good as ever and thats just for information
okay i see the battery light flickering now tp 782 age 579
okay recommend you ignore it
okay
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim its volts and amps time again at your convenience
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
aquarius houston if you gave me those read ings i didnt copy them over
houston aquarius do you read
aquarius houston okay go ahead
volts 393 amps 125
okay copied 393 and 125 jim did jack tell you what your trajectory looks like over
havent got up to  on it how about giving me a rundown
okay we are looking at a vacuum perigee right now of 236 flight path angle of minus 625 and if we decide we want to trim that up were looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per sec ond your consumables of course are getting better all the time weve got 163 hours of water 230 hours of oxygen and 172 hours worth of electrical power over
that sounds good
roger
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim we would like to get another check from you on the propellant tank temperatures as we did yesterday and the procedure is to on panel 16 circuit breaker propellant display engine ovridelogic to close then go to your display and read the tank 1 and tank 2 tempera tures for us and then open the circuit breaker again over
okay im closing now  the displayengine overridelogic
roger
okay and the reaction control temperatures are 65 in a and 65 in b
okay jim wed like the descent tank tempera tures too over
67 oxidizer is 63 descent tank 1  is 64 the oxidizer is  did you copy over 01421 02 22 cdr hello houston did you copy the  the dps dis play temperatures
jim i copied 63 and 64 which i think were the descent 1 temps and thats all i got
okay ill go over it again im on descent 1 now and fuel is about 64 and oxidizer is 65 and ill go to descent 2  
okay thank you very much  
  our descent 2 okay ive got descent 2 now right up on 67 and 66
roger we copy that and once again wed like to get the volts and amps check in the command module over
okay im going to go up there and get it jack is  and fred are asleep so ill be off the air a minute
okay real good
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
volts 393 amps 12 zip 04 2 05 45 cc okay we copy 393 and 120 and jim ive got one more item for information for you at  in about 45 minutes or so you will get an lio quantity caution light on the descent tank wa expect this it occurs at 16 percent and its no problem because we intend to run the tank dry just for drill to reset the  the light on panel 2 just set the 02 h20 quantity monitor to the cautionwarning reset position and the light will go away over
okay i understand were going to get a h20 warning light here shortly and ill reset it
okay good deal apollo 13 airtoground voice tratscription
houston apollo 13
aquarius houston go dlead
okay joe we got the water warning light
okay roger that
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
okay jim the experts would like another volt and amp reading
okay have them stand by
okay no rush
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go dead
voltage is 393 amps 126
copy 393 and 126
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
joe you might pass to our friends in crew systems that lunar boots make great footwarmers
i guess you need them up there too is  is anybody sleeping in the command module right now jim
negative joe its just too cold in there i got fred stashed over here to my left hes asleep and jackrs 
roger
you can eliminate the chilldown procedure for reentry
laughter well we figured we were in that mode now ·
aquarius this is earth over
go ahead earth aquarius here
roger earth is here also and jim it is time for another one of those voltamp checks for your information weve got that battery back up to 30 amphours now over
hey that sounds great jacks gone up to check it
roger
aquarius earth oh 22 26 37 cc go ahead
you know i think aquarius is 
weve got garble now jim itm sorry
i said aquarius 
roger
houston aquarius
go ahead
voltage 393 amps 126
okay copy that jim
jim houston have you guys put on any extra clothes to try and ward off the nip of jack frost over
well the lunar boots and two pair of underwear and everyone is  crawl into their sleep restraints
yes
were a little reluctant to break out the suits
yes thats understandable you can always use them if you have to i guess its pretty hard to get extra coveralls on huh
well joe i didnt think we had any extra inflight garments aboard but were going to check right now
well stand by
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
roger jim we noticed you just went to auto and back to close on the suit relief valve is everything okay
we didnt do that intentionally stand by
okay maybe you didnt incidentally youre less than 24 hours to go
roger what happened was our lithium hydroxide device here got caught in the suit relief valve it is closed now thats where you want it right
okay apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription pao 585
okay
and joe just a reminder now that you mention it  that its less than 24 hours to go what id like to do and i have aboard all the pro cedures that you are working up so i can run through them with the crew and make sure that we get all our signals straight
roger that jim we are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can they exist whats going on now is the guys are running them in the cmsles integrate to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and re isxed and all that good stuff and they wont be finished that run for another few hours however we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time and well start with the procedures as soon as they get ready over
okay thats good i think  ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to
okay jim roger were going to do that to the maximum extent possible and it looks reasonably feasible to begin with in the com mand module were going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time the closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist by the time were about at ei minus 45 were on the checklist all the way
okay
and just as a reminder dont forget our stowage problem we  we still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the im and et cetera
roger that weve got a team working on that and incidentally one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the command module are empty they just want to know that for weight and balance  and theres no rush about it   oh 22 47 18 cdr 
aquarius houston
go ahead aquarius
another note of interest to the crew systems people  tell them that they dont have to bother putting the refrigerator onboard i just brought out some hot dogs and theyre practically frozen
laughter okay we copy that jim
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay wed like another volt amp reading jim
okay stand by joe
roger
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
volt 394 amp 123
okay roger that and jim we ought to have a  an entry time line to discuss with you in one hour
aquarius houston over
go ahead
guess what
what
your volts and amps time jim
that goes like the amos and andy show
houston aquarius guess what
aquarius houston what over
394 127
are you really going up there and looking at them
thats what the meters say
okay we copy jim apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
aquarius houston over
go ahead 05 00 17 3 cc okay jim we show the suit circuit relief valve is back in the auto position and wed like to have it off for good scrubbing over
have you seen  out there
okay thank you jim
 up there  about  of the scrubbers if you think 
roger no sweat jim in a few minutes im going to be coming at you with the  with the overall time line for tomorrow morning you might want to think about taking a few notes although we dont have detailed procedures for you at this time maybe you want to have fred or jack listen over
right were alt set to copy
okay
aquarius houston over
go ahead
for our benefit while we do this briefing jim wed like to have the the comm better and we can sure spare the power so wed like you on panel 16 to close the power amplifier circuit breaker and on panel 12 wed like you to move the voice function switch to voice over
okay aquarius houston how do you read
read you loud and clear
okay and youre real good its a  its a pleasure not to have all that noise let me tell you what i want to do jim as i said were not going to give you detailed procedures now what we expect to have for you shortly are pro cedures which well try and get up to you in the following form first well have a time line 1 sort of a flight plan thing which will have the times of all the major events and any configura tions switch settings and so forth which are peculiar to our configuration and which there fore you wont find in the checklist this for instance will be true of the way we power up the command module and second of course well have any redlines to the checklist so that you can enter the checklist where possible to  to perform functions and the time line will simply refer you to the checklist when thats appropriate okay
okay bounds good youre going to give me an overall time line now i take it is that right
thats affirm im going to first of all just quickly run through the times of the major events and then well go back and fill in some of the details okay entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes 612 hours roughly prior to that or at about 13610 well start this whole thing going by applying imu heater power by checking the cmrcs temperatures and preheating the cmrcs if required and we suspect well probably want to do that well have detailed procedures up for it later at about 6 hours prior to ei or about 13640 we will commence powering up the lm powering up the ags using the modified lmdps rcs 30minute checklist which you have used for the previous midcourse then shortly just before 5 hours prior to ei or at about 13749 well want you in the attitude for a lm ags body axis alinement using the earth terminator like we did before and as soon as we have that well perform mcc7 which looks like now about a 2footpersecond burn or about 15 seconds of rcs and im told that its dovn to 112 now so its comfortably within the rcs margin okay when we do that well immediately start the maneuver to the service module jettison attitude which will be in plane since were jettisoning it earlier than we usually do we dont need and dont want the outof plane component so itll be in plane with the service module pointed back out along the radius vector we will then commence to get the command module ready for service module sep including command module rcs checkout and hot fire and at approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to ei or 1810 well jettison the service module well pitch the m up until we aquire the service module in the  and try and get some photographs but were not going to fool around with lm translation maneuvers for pictures because we dont want to screw up  foul up your flight path angle at that time okay that gives us 2 hours to  of more or less open time here to finish up if were late on that to go on over to checklist and prepare for powering up the command module were going to start the command module full powerup at ei minus 2 hours and 30 minutes or 14010 get well get the computer on the line well get the imu up well start uplinking your state vectors and so forth and alining the command module platform at about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest giving us an hour to do this command module stuff we will start the maneuver to the lm jettison attitude youll then start to close out the lm of course we dont have our stowage all configured way before this well close the hatch do a pressure integrity check and at ei minus 1 hour or 141 hoars and 40 minutes well jettison the im as soon as we do that you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude when youre there do a sextant star check take down the optics and at that point well be giving you your final entry pad you can initialize the ems and youll essentially be right back on the checklist at that point theres one  one little difference from your nominal entry youre a little bit earlier in the morning so it going  its going to be nighttime when you get to ei however were fortunate enough to have the moon in a perfect position for a horizon check well give you a moon check instead of a horizon check and you can track it right down to moonset which is going to be at ei roughly minus 3 minutes and thats it for the quick time line do you have any questions right now
i dont believe so joe right now well have to look at those time lines and think about it for a little bit
okay real fine were ready to talk in some more detail about the alinement procedures the cm powerup procedures and so forth but why dont we give you a few minutes to digest what youve already heard
houston aquau
go ahead lqualas
two question ofar on heating up the cmrcs we assume ihts lm power and we assume that were goinl upboth cm buses right
okay jim i didnt waistto talk about that because were not quite ready to recommend a procedure we cant power up tile cmrcs per the nornal ehecklj st on thclm power because we havent got quite enouh amps it may he that we want you to heat  to do the preheat one ring at a time and were looking at that another possibility is tlatwe may want to take down lm power at ibattime dthe preheat and then go backlto pcr uritii we have to take it down fnaly over
okay understand oecnt question when we finish mcc7 that maneuver to sm jetattitude will be angles given to tisby you using the ags aline ball right
thats afflrmagive lucwo get that ags alined and get a time hack on it the good people down here will be able to give us ags  ags 8ball attitudes for the service module separation attitude for the comnand module alinement attitude which we are iointo pass you up the  a moonsim p52type ailmwnebll have ags 8ball attitudes for those and well be able to uplink through the command module once we get the computtup a pefer r esmmatwhich will be identical l the matt ludeat the time of the burn aud well  into dai  on that later
okay just stand by l tll give it to you
will do
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
we would like to have plenty of  the control characteristics are of the lmcommand module and whqhrwn nshe attitude control  controltnlyimeuvr the combination to photograh the evemodule t 4 plus 30
okay good thinking we are  its  there has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to ibotograph the lm i mean the service module we consider it quite low priority the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the service module but they are not required for our troubleshooting program as far as the  the attitude control authority and so fortb we will get you more detailed word on that later we are working it it appears that using the aa instead of the ttca after srvluu module jett will give you excellent attitude control authority and thats what we reconnend
okay and im   use an ags att hoi confignlra tion to keep the attitudes  turn the lm jett attitude s
thats affirm we are  we are probably going to recommend a tight deadband ags attitude hold for that
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead
okay the star ceck al the entry attitude is it a sextant star check or a coas star check
itll probably be a snt star check jim it really depends on how 6ood that platform is that we get and we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check
okay
fnile we are on that subject jim i want to mention one thing to jack as i said this csm alinement procedure we are going to recommend is a moonsun and there are sim filters stowed they are stowed in compartment ri however they are for the telescope only of course not the sextant one is for the long eyerelief piece the tber for the normal eyepiece and if he haujlyquestions about that well be glad to talk about it
okay
and because it will be too late to do much about a hatch integrity check if it fails you want us to have our suits on sometime during this period
okay jim we are laying for you on that one it is a subject that we wanted to  to bring up with you we have been considering it  and our feelings are  of course it is up to you but as we see the pros and cons you just put your finger on tilepro we do a hatch integrity check shortly before ei minus 1 hours and if we bust it you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits on the other hand the disad vantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably not even counting the time to don them and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits you might get too warm and we might have to power up the suit loop to ventilate the suits and we dont particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power consequent ly our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate and we can certainly hack that what do you think over
weil i have confidence in the hatch as long as it goes in and locks in smoothly i see no reason why we need the suits and one thing we are going to do during our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on make sure we get it on and locked
okay real good and with that precaution think we can concur on that decision
and thats all the questions we had about the time line you gave us
okay let me take a check here and see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you right now age594 05 o0 8 51 fc aquatic ifouton 05 o0 38 58 cdh go ahead
roger one detail that i thought you ought to know about the service module jett is that were going to recommend a pushpull maneuver that is in the attitude i described well want you to go half a foot per second plusx on the lm then jettison the service module then go half a foot per second minusx which will be less time be cause youre suddenly a heck of a lot lighter over
oksy understand you want me to go a half a foot per second plusx jett the service module and go a half a foot per second minusx
thats affirm we think that will give you plenty of separation and also will be a slow enough rate so youll have a chance to get some photos
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay one more thing we want to update you on with a little detail as we told you the ascent sep attitude was in plane and the lm jett atti tude will be more similar to a normal service module sep attitude that is it will be lm up out the radius vector smd 45 degrees right out of plane toward the south we are going to recom mend that prior to jett the configuration be with the lm overhead hatch closed with the vent valve open and well jett with the tunnel pressurized over
okay joe understand that the lm jett attitude will be similar to service module normal jettison which will be up and out of plane and as soon as i finish maneuvering to left jett attitude ill scramble up and close the lm hatch making sure the vent valve is open and then well vent it  or jettison it with the tunnel pressurized
thats affirmative and deke says dont forget to close the command module hatch on your way in tap815
im already scared that jack will have it closed before i get up there
laughter
okay jim i think thats about all we have for you right now whenever you feel like you dont have any more questions at the moment wed like you to reeonfigure for down voice backup and wed like you to do that to move the voice function switch to downvoice baceqjp as usual but instead of pulling the circuit breaker wed like you to throw the power amp switch to off
okay joe i have one more question here if we get a little bit ahead of time on the command module full powerup after we jettison the ser vice module id like to go to lm jett attitude early and make sure we get that part squared aw and sit there for a while before lm jett of i hour now will we be using lm power up to that time theres two cables which well probably have to disconnect on the wy up through the tunnel if were still going to use lm power
thats affirmative let me get word on when we expect to go off lm power
aquarius houston
go ahead
roger we expect to go off lm power at the time we start powering up the csm or about minus 212 hours that is not a hard number and well be updating you on it as far as going to the ia jett attitude thats completely permissible as soon as you have a powered up command module and a satisfactory platform you can go there immediately were giving you a maximum of i hour just for grins over
okkv fine and that will be a lm maneuver i assume because we lost the service module so no strain there
affirm
and jack would like to knc what entry angle the mdcourse7 will gve us
oh itll lutus right in the middle of the corridor lim
okay
650 dgts and jim houston i guess as a last ilrrwe expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your timlines sometime later on today and wed just like you to consider that i expect itll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready
okay well be standing by for that and now power am3t71fierswitch is going to go off and then we be going to down voice banfup 05 o0 l639 cc okay

roger copy thank you
okay vance were ready to cover  to copy the stowage list
okay jim now ill give it to you in two parts the first is lm to command module equipment trans fer the second part will be the reverse command module to lm equipment transfer and both parts represent deltas from the launch stowage and here comes the first list lm to command module equip ment transfer first dsea and ill give you the stowage location too that goes in r13
vance what was that again
dsea thats recorder in  will go in the command module its recommended you stow it in r13 over
okay the dsea  thats the recorder  will be stowed in r13
thats affirm next lm flight data file that will go in ri r2 and r3 next three ppks in a8
okay
okay 16millimeter and 70millimeter exposed film in r13 okay next 02 hose screen caps on the 02 hoses next two 70millimeter has selblad cameras and stow these in b6 in the empty lioh volume
okay next blackandwhite tv camera and rec ommend stow that on top of a7 and aii in decon tamination bag next flag kit stowage location a8 next lm fecal bags used r9 waste man agement system chute
okay thats the first list jim
okay
and if you want to read that one back why then ill  ill give you the second one
this is the lm to command module transfer and this is the delta from the launch stowage num ber 1 dsea  number 2 lm flight data file in ri r2 r3 three ppks in a8  
 a8 and used lm fecal bags in r9
okay thats affirm jim we had a lot of noise and we didnt get the middle part but i think thats fairly  should be fairly clear to you and dont bother with the readbaek of that that we missed unless you have any doubts and then ill if youre ready to copy ill give you the second list
okay
okay this is cm to lm equipment transfer cabin fan filter and bag and that in the lm should go in the isa okay next decontamination bags except for the ones used to wrap camera should go in the isa
okay two lcgs if you dont have them on already to the is  isa i realize you wouldnt have them on because youre cold enough already
thats right
okay and finally four li0h cans the ones used in the lm and those can go in the jettison bag in the lm okay a couple of notes after load ing the isa recommend secure it to the right hand restraint system
and secure the jettison bag to the plss on the floor and thats all
okay vance this is command module to lm cabin fan filter and bag in the isa decontamination bags except for the ones we use for the tv camera in the isa two lcgs in the isa four l0ih sic cans in the jett bag and well secure the isa on the righthand side  on the righthand restraint system and well secure the jett bags to the plss on the floor
roger thats it

jim would you give us pcm to hi bit rate we think maybe we might be able to lock up on your high bit rate now over
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay jim were getting it intermittently we think we might get it steady and improve circuit margins if you would in addition on panel 16 open the primary power ampl circuit breaker and ill give you next step in a minute
okay primary power ampl is opened
okay and on panel 12 power ampl to primary
power ampl to primary
roger
aquarius 13
go ahead houston
or rather houston jim it looks like we got a loekon which is going to improve our data flow here only thing is well probably lose data and probably voice too during a portion of each roll so you might expect that the other thing is if anyone has on any biomed would you switch your switch to  your biomed switch to that position
understand the first vance and no one has on any biomed  
okay
  fred and jack are maneuvering things around right now and mine is long since departed the scene tape 8214
okay copy
vance you might be interested  the way were  the way we got this thing arranged we have one helmet attached to the comm lines attached to the lm hoses and the guy thats got the duty wears the helmet so the other people are free to maneuver
right thats understandable one guys on the leash huh
yes 
aquarius houston
go ahead
jim when you get finished moving your stowage around and its convenient wed like to terminate the battery charge for a little while to bring up the cm tm so we can take a look at the temperatures again like we did yesterday advise that right now on your batteries you have lll amphours and eventually we hope to have them up  peaked up to about ll6 one other point we  we can either read that procedure up again which involves cranking up the telemetry or if jack still has it we can use his notes and  but i have one or two changes to  to make on them over
okay understand that youll want us to terminate battery charge for a while and crank up the cm tm to read out temperatures and you have a few changes to jacks checklist and ill turn the comm over here to jack shortly as soon as hes finished and well get along with it
okay well be standing by for  theres no hurry on it
houston aquarius
go ahead jim
just out of curiosity vance whats our distance and velocity now
hey stand by 1 youre speeding up i think
jim we have you 101 000 miles out and your velocity is 5848 starting to speed up
okay thank you
sure enough
okay houston aquarius
go ahead jack
okay vance jim said that you want to terminate battery charge on battery a
thats affirm jack request to  before you terminate it get the usual readout on voltage and current and wed also like a time of termi nation and understand you have the termination procedures is that affirm 05 02 42 35 cml okay thats affirm stand by let me just make sure ive got everything here before i go off on a tangent
okay jack and your batterycharge termination procedure remains unchanged but when we go to power up the cm and look at your tm we have a couple of additional steps
okay vance i do have the procedure for stopping the battery charge and do you want me to copy this procedure now or do you want me to come back and give you the volt amps and time and  after i complete this termination
okay just  just give us the volts and amps just before you start the termination of the pro cedure and understand you say you have the charge  the procedure for taking the charge off is that affirm
thats affirm
okay and just give us a hack on the time  
and you want to  you want to review it at all
negative unless you want me to ill tell you what i could run through it very quickly just to verify that were getting started off on the correct path here 05 02 44 3i cmp yes okay the first four or five things that i have is panel bat charge to off on panel 3 ac inverter 2 off panel 5 main bus tie bat ac on panel 250 cb bat a power entrypostlanding open panel 275 inverter power 2 main b open and then the  just to go ahead and reverse the position of the switches and circuit breakers that i started out with and these dont have to be in reverse order is that charlie
roger thats  thats charlie have at it
okay well get a volts and amps right now
okay
okay vance the volts and amps 394 amps 125
okay jack we copy that incidentally  
okay were going up to termin  go ahead vance
never mind jack ill bring this up later when youve finished the procedure
okay im going off the air ill put fredo on im going to stop the battery charge
okay
now how do you read vance
hey loud and clear fred understand youve been doing some spring housecleaning moving stowage around up there
boy you wouldnt believe this lm right now its nothing but bags from floor to ceiling
hey that brings up a question we were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue it occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the lm down about where the lmp normally stands underneath the is  isaer perhaps you have a better idea over
yes i do vance  would go in the lm but i thought maybe we ought to stow it where the cdr stands hows that
okay i can tell that youre just getting  getting that one over because jim just got off the loop
yes hes sleeping no thats  thats actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal lm jetts
okay and  hey we just  well record that ald figure that youll stow the probe and drogue over in the  where the cdr stands we have a  a change to this  equipment transfer list that i just read up to jim why dont you make a note of this one item forget about the lm  
stand by stand by 1
okay
i think jack hauled off the piece of paper with that  all that on it why dont you hold it until jack gets done doing the battery charge
okay
and fred request pcm on lo bit rate now
okay and there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didnt bring along this time
what was that
thats a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it
yes when you  when you get off nominal why you just need scratch paper dont you
yes
okay vance i got the stowage list now
okay i gave you two lists  
and jacks got  and jack said hes completed  the  secured the battery charge now
okay and were recording the time that that was complete you have two lists there one is lm to cm equipment transfer and the second list is the reverse request you scratch the last item on the first list which is returning used bags to the cm 50 02 52 ii i2vip okay we didnt have any of those so that didnt pose any problem anyway
okay
aquarius houston
 okay vance aquarius is back on
okay jack understand you completed securing the battery charge now if you are ready to copy jack i would like to give you the two changes that we have to the powerup for the cm procedure over
okay stand by 1
okay
okay vance you say you have some changes in the procedures that i used before to get telemetry and to check out the csm system
yes thats correct jack theyre pretty simple about halfway through the procedure we have a step on panel 3 which is power ampl high wed like to change that to power ampl low
okay copy power ampl low
and the next change jack is panel 275 scratch the step cb main b bat b close  bat bus b cmos e
okay you want to delete the step cb main b bat bus b close
roger as you know were going to do this on lm power so this reflects that
okay real fine
okay and have at it we  wed like to have the tm up for about 5 or l0 minutes to look at the data from the cm look at your temperatures et cetera and after that well go back to charging the battery again and the charge will probably go until around get 126
okay do you want the same readouts from me that i gave you before tape829
thats affirmative jack and just to make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure it starts out for the baekout part panel 3 power ampl off thansponder off ac inverter 2 off then goes to panel 250 et cetera 05 02 57 07 cml thats  thats the way i read it
okay
okay going back up into the refrigerator
hey i thought it was the bedroom 05 02 57 22 cml well its got a new name now because it is about 30 degrees cooler
roger returning to the deep freeze  
  hey vance one thing that i wanted to ask you  is on the stowage list where you have us putting the blackandwhite tv camera on top of a7 in an a  decontamination bag i was wondering if it would be possible or if you  there would be any problem in putting it into b6 along with the two 70millimeter hasselblad cameras 
jack i dont think therell be any problem if you can get it in but let us get  work that and get back with you okay
ail right i was just thinking im trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that leb we have no srcs and then our waste tank is  you know  rather depleted i think its about down to 40 percent or so so im trying to get as much l over d as i can and any heavy items we can get down there id be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention
okay we copy that and we owe you an answer on your last question
okay and im in work going to give you some telemetry
okay
aquarius houston were receiving csm data now
roger
aquarius houston
say again vance
fred we just lost data on aquar  on jack would you have him select best omni please 05 03 09 27 lmp okay 05 03 11 3 cc aquarius houston 05 03 11 9 lmp ail right go ahead
fred we have enough data recommend that jack take off the tm and power back down again using his backout procedure just let us know when he does it
okay 05 03 1 59 cc and after that well start the battery charge and well have to know when he starts that
oksy hes starting to back out now just out of curiosity what  did you all get a readout on what the cabin temp was up there
yes were getting 45 to 46 degrees
now you see why we call it the refrigerator
yes its kind of a cold winter day up there isnt it is it snowing in the command module yet 05 0t12 50 lmp is it what vance
is it snowing in there yet
oh snowing no  no not quite the windows are in pretty bad shape and i guess the service module  well be trying to shoot out of the lm window because every window in the command module is just covered with water droplets its going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off
roger understand pete says to tell you that youll have some time on the beach in samoa to thaw out after this cold experience
hey that sounds great
vance have you all thought about what cameras you wanted to use right now weve got config ured a hasselblad with a 250 and ive got the lunarsurface number 1 hasselblad and ive got the lunar surface sequence camera also rigged and ready to go did you have any other druthers about the 
you are referring to the photography of the ser vice module is that right
thats right
we have some procedures in work and ive seen them fred i think pretty soon well be shoot ing them up to you to specify which cameras and settings but that  that sounds pretty close
okay you might let them know that if they hadnt thought of it that we got this lunarsurface sequence camera on board which has its own bat tery pack setup and to shoot quite a few pictures with and that could also be used for this
roger i know we are planning to use that cam era among others
okay
okay houston aquarius jack has backed out of powering up the cm and now hes proceeding to restart battery charge on bat a
okay real good fred we copy
okay and we are charging battery a now apollo 13 airt0ground voice transcription
roger charging battery a fred
and fred request now first reading of voltage  bat a voltage and charger current over
okay vance i can give it to you i read it right after i started it bat a voltage was 394 and the current had jumped up to 14
okay 394 and 14 thanks jack
okay how about  you ready for some other readouts that you wanted there
ready to copy
okay bat b 370 pyro a 370 pyro b 370 sps helium pressure 31100 and nitrogen a and b  just for throwing it in for kicks 2200 and 2400 respectively and the injector temperature  stand by the sun went down okay the injector temperature 5 charlie 39 5 dog 32 6 alfa 36 6 baker 39 6 charlie 35 6 dog 34 the battery manifold pressure 14
okay we copy all thai jack thank you
okay
you say you figure you are going to be charging bat a until about 1267
roger about 12630 is an estimate jack
okay you figure it will bc fully charged then huh
yes thats right well have all the batteries up to about 116 ampshours
thats good news
thats better than 99 huh
youtre right
how did all our systems look on  vance
i didntt hear any complaints but just a minute let me make a detailed check tap 812 iagr 6 0
aquarius houston
go ahead
jack its a general statement it looks like temperatures have cooled off in the ballpark of 6 to 8 degrees cooler than what they were yester day looks like everything is still within tolerance but were working up a detailed sheet of temperatures to send up to you for your inter est
okay that sounds good
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
vance joe brought up the alinement at ei minus 2 plus 30 were you going to send up or have a discussion about that later on
thats correct jack we just about have proce dures in hand detail checklisttype procedures to send to you in other words a time line with reference to entry checklist and any changes in the entry checklist so if you have a few pages of scratch paper why i think well have that to you within an hour
okay ill be standing by
one other thing jack  you still with me
yes go ahead the stowage people have tried out this blackandwhite tv camera into b6 idea and they say even with the lens off they cant get it in so i still recommend that it be stowed where we had it on the list thats a7
no problem
ail right go ahead
jack request another voltagereadout on bat a and current on bat charger
okay vance tilevoit 393 amp 13
hoger copy 393 and 13
aquarius houston over
go ahead vance
jack looks like the lm suit release valve has been bumped to auto again request it  
okay
  closed over
in work
okay
hows that right there
okay they say it looks good
okay
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay jack we need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while
oh dont worry about it id like to have you talk with us volts and amps coming up
okay
okay vance volts 394 amps 125
okay eecoms got it duly recorded
is john aaron on
no gee i dont know what shift he is on but he comes in later i guess 05 0 46 13 cmp actually all the shifts are mornint shifts lo us 05 03 46 9 cc say that one afain   05  46 21 cmp the sun is always shining  ail of the shifts are morning shifts to us because the sun is always shining 05 03 46 2f cc that was a short night 05 03 46 9 cmp just for curiositys sake are we still holding entry angle at 625
oky jack right now were told that its closer to 6 and  but they would ike to vra it some more looks like your next midcoursc will be in the order of 2 to 3 foot per second
okay 05 13 54 03 cm i just got a good view of the southern ross alpha and beta centaur and atria
ttouston 13 05 03 56 115 cc go ahead jack 5 0 56 19 cmf kay were still in ood shape as far as water goes in the lm 5 3 541 5i cc kay we copy  q 57 il mp ije reason i ask s im asstmtint thnl w are um i have no idea eacl time i prenme the ur6e tank to get water out of lhe command odule bow mlcl drot that suvlank and il we are in good shape a fnr a wter u n in ile lm wed like o fi i1 a oullc l rink b to get some water for drijtinf imrpos   l  c ikay hawe you run out of iilllllq watr ye1 jack  d  4  i4l qb no weve got plmly of dritki walet  think the  i dont lave any idea what the sur tank pressure is
okay its 750  
  and i dont have any  
its 750 jack
okay 750
aquarius houston
go ahead vance
okay stand by 1 jaek and well give you an indication of how that water situation on the lm is  which is your question right
okay but i guess what i was really asking is if youd have any violent objections if we filled two drink bags from lm water rather than repres surizing the surge tank
okay stand by on that
also jim is asleep up there and we didnt want to bother him either
okay we understand
and jack well be changing stations in 1 minute so we may have a temporary dropout in comm
okay
aquarius houston
okay vance go ahead loud and clear
okay jack were going to bargain with you on this one instead of two would  wish that you would just get just one bag full that shouldnt do any harm however  
okay
  we are not all that fat on water that we want to do any drinking out of the lm as a regular thing after this one bag so would you let us know when you get the water out and give us a mark on it so we can watch the tm over iilli5 cml okly irijboul t withdraw the water now  h   c41 fkrl vjrll wv wl hdrwrj  h tljt  oqics of w r
okay jack hows it taste
its  good its not quite as gaseous as that in the command module
apollo 13 houston  or rather aquarius houston over
go ahead
iieyjack we need another reading volts and amps
okay theyre coming up
vance you wont believe this but fredo says its 394 and 1245
okay our eecom is recording those numbers charlie dumas this time
oh
not changing very fast is it
how far out are we
okay 953 and 6068 on velocity per fido
okay
bill stoval
thank you
houston aquarius over
go ahead aquarius
are the flowers in bloom in houston
no not yet still must be winter
suspicions confirmed
yes i doubt if they will be blooming even saturday when you return
i concur
hey jim we have some photo information to pass up to you discussed this briefly with fred earlier its instructions or suggestions for which photos  which cameras and lenses to use during your service module photography over
okay stand by 1
okay
go ahead
okay we have three cameras here two of them to be used for picture taking from the lm one to be used from the number 5 window of the csm first ill hit the lm cameras and this camera that i mention now has first priority its considered the one to give you the best results thats the 70millimeter dc reseau camera hasselblad that is with the 80millimeter lens from box a13 suggest fresh magazine of 3400 blackandwhite film
okay
okay suggest either magazine r or magazine s from a13 transfer all of this to the imand recommend the following settings ldc80bw 3400 f56 at a 250th
and thats all for that one
okay vance let me see if i have it here for the lm want to mse the 70millimeter dc hasselblad 80millimeter lens in a13 using 3400 blackandwhite film mags r or s prepare to take camera to the lm and the setting would be the lmdc80bw 3400 f56 at a 250th
thats correct okay next the next camera  stand by 1 ive got noise here okay the next lm  the next camera for the lm will be the 16millimeter and these photos are considered to be priority 3 okay one get the 16millimeter dac and powerpack from a8 get the 10millimeter lens and remove it  remove the 10millimeter lens and take the 18millimeter lens from b3 and attach it to the camera and attach the power cable transfer to the lm set frame rate at 12 frames per second and the same data line that i gave you before reads this way this time lmdac18cex battery f8 and 1250th okay now looking at these two cameras in the lm its recommended that you use the 16millimeter for the first 212 minutes and then switch to the 70millimeter thats partly because the frames been  or the  theyve been optimized for closer and longer range okay read back please
okay vance essentially what you wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the lm goes is our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the powerpack we use the 18millimeter lens set it at 12 frames per second  f8 at 250th of a second
roger f8 at 250th
right f8 at 250th
okay would you believe that we have a correc tion now to the last camera i gave you correct that 18millimeter lens to 75millimeter lens
okay the 18millimeter to the 75millimeter lens okay
right okay next for the command module pic tures it may be a little hard to see the service module from the command module but if you can see it it will be through window 5 people down here think recommend for that the cm 70 millimeter these photos have priority 2 so this is 70millimeter el with  which has the 80millimeter attached and this is all in b3 take off the 80millimeter lens and attach the 250millimeter lens and the 250millimeter lens can be found in u4 use cex film from a13 ring sight from a7 and these pictures will be f8 at a 250th and i think probably by now you probably all have  already have these cameras configured and this may be redun dant information but here it is anyway over
okay vance youre right we do have cameras almost configured like you said for the command module you think that the el with the 250 lens cex film f8 at a 250th is the best bet and youre saying now that where you think youll see it is out window 5 is that it
thats right jim
okay my procedure now after service module jett is going to be to pitch up in order to try to get the service module into the  to get the center window in view of the service module which we are going to have somebody there  to photograph why do you think window 5 will be it
okay stand by on that one this is a question of geometry and ill get right back apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim regarding window 5 i have a drawing here and when youre docked you have approximately a 60degree angle between the zaxes of the two spacecraft it appears that peering out win dow 5 you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the lm which would if you pitched more or less give you a view of the service module that is if you pitched so  from  and i think that this has been run by quite a few folks here so offhand i cant see where any other window would be as good or per haps even possible
okay i understand yes youre right when we look out window 5 we can see rendezvous radar and well try  well try window 5
roger it presumes though that there has to be a pitch to be able to see it you guys sound a lot more rested today 05 o 59 33 cdr well i just went back and sacked out for an hour or so and didrlt get back up
very good
and jim houston we really are going to get those checklists up to you
okay
aquarius houston over
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim its time for readings on the battery charging again request the bat a voltage and the charger amps over
okay stand by vance
houston aquarius j 5  09 cc go ahead jim o05 j9 12 di okay whaw no more water in the potable tank we tried to get some more out a few minutes ago and there isnt any
okay understand you ran out of water in the cm potable tank
affirmative
aquarius houston over
aquarius houston over
go ahead houston
jim we  you were able to get those voltage  bat a voltage and current readings
oh yes freds  freds up there now
okay and were ready to read you the first checklist installment this will  what were going to readup is going to be a lm time line a csm time line and checklist changes to con form with these and right now i have the first installment of the csm time line ready to read up over
okay jack im going to get  vance im going to get jack on the line for that and so stand by
okay and hell need a lot of paper
okay volts are 395 amps 124 stand by
okay we got it
aquarius houston
okay vance itm on and ready to copy
okay jack wait 1 we want to get one into the hands of flight and eecom and itll take about a minute or 2 sorry to wake you up for this but take about a minute and then well read it up to you ial 620 005 tl 07 cc aquarius lloutorl
okay vance go ahead
okay jack do you have any of that cm water  bagged water left 0ver
negative i went up and tried to repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay but there was no water that came out of the water tank
ys we understand that there isnt any more in the potable tank but we understood that you had put some water from that tank into bags and i wondered if any of the bags were left
negative
okay
okay jack ready to copy
okay vance ready to copy
okay start at ei minus 612 hours youre going to re  get lm pads and csm pads and i dont know if you want to copy them or not this is something i can just read off to you over without you copying unless you especially want it
okay
okay lm pad sm jettison  
okay go ahead read which ones wetre going to get
okay ill read them fast first here so you get a general idea impad service module jett attitude moon viewing attitude sun viewing attitude and lm jett attitude the cm pads are coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat and cmc angles on entry refsmmat for iajett moon viewing and entry okay that  thats general pad infor mation if you want itll read it slowly so you can copy it all down otherwise ill go ahead tape 81 lag 621 05 05 5 0 cml  gt   wa tryng to copy it as you were reading it vanv the lm pada arz service module jttlon atttud moon viewing attitude sun vicwjng attitude and lm jettison attitude is that correct
thats correct okay ill read the cm pads now slowly coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings
okay the next coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat okay the next cmc angles on entry refsmmat for 1 lm jett 2 moon viewing 3 entry okay ill stand by until you read that back
okay the csm pads will be coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat cmc  cmc angles on entry refsmmat for 1 lm jettison 2 moon viewing 3 entry
okay thats correct
okay jack going to hold up 1 ail the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute and theyd like to hold up until everybody can listen in
get that jack
okay vance were ready to go
okay we lost you there briefly while you were in an attitude where we eouldntt receive you jack wed like to hold off for about 5 minutes we have some more people coming in to listen to this and it took a lot of people to devise this procedure and a few people have been testing it out so wed like to have them all on hsd while we give you the rest
okay
hows the temperature up there jack you guys chopping wood to keep warm
deke its about 51 i think or 50 in the lm and itts about  i dont know  45 or little bit less in the command module
oh its a nice fall day huh
yes i tell you we dont have to worry about chilldown
okay vance while were waiting do you have there also what i can expect ground to uplink me 
well have that jack but  stand by for that
okay
jack probably  probably the thing to do is to give you all of the checklist and it will include things like this then well have a big question and answer session afterwards if thats okay by you 05 05 44 2i cmp okay that sounds good
okay vance while were waiting just for your information the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two hasselblad cameras
roger got that jack
and the lm is pretty well stowed with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe and the drogue
roger got that
relative to your water situation jack were going to have a pretty good hack on the lm here in the next few hours and we anticipate letting you fill your own tanks before we transfer over so you should be in reasonably good shape there
okay we have a number of juice bags all out and ready to go and we tried to get the water out of the command module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the command modules potable tank was empty so we have no bags made up now so were dependent on lm water plss water
roger if you feel like trying the plss thats all excess and you might want to try that at any time im sure itll taste like plss but you might as well try it la6e 023
okay
okay deke ail the windows in the command module are heavily coated with water right now so i dont know what kind of pictures well get out of them but im going to try and clean them off and do the best i can with the 250millimeter lens on the hasselblad
roger thats why we have the top priority stuff in the lm we figure youve got a much better chance of getting it through there
okay
aquarius tiouston
are you ready to send it up vance
jack before we start reading the procedure wed like  we find that bat a is topped off and in great shape like to switch over and top off bat b some more give it 2 more hours of charging have about a seven or eightstep procedure here to give you if you want to copy that we tre switching before we start recording the entry procedures
okay stand by and let me get out my other checklist
okay vance ready to copy
okay panel 3 switch battery charge to off panel 5 main bus tie bat ac to bat ac cb battery charger bat a charge to open cb battery charger bat b charge close next panel 250 cb bat b power entrypostlanding to close panel 5 main bus tie bat bc off panel 3 battery charge to b advise well stand by jack advise that we have a baekout procedure for this but well read that up to you later in about 2 hours and also that this procedure is a delta to your  the first battery charging procedure that we gave you in other words itts a delta from where you are right now 05 o 57 lo cml okay this s the procedure for charging bat 2aker panel 3 bat charge off panel 5 main bus tie bat ac to ac cb bat charger bat a charge open cb bat charger bat b charge close panel 250 cb bat b power entry and postlanding close panel 5 main bus tie bat bc to off panel 3 bat charge to b this is a delta for the first battery charging procedure youll give me the backout procedure in a couple hours
thats affirm
okay ill put it in work right now then come back and stand by to copy the rest of  well i  not the rest  everything
everything is right
youtd never believe how much this procedurets been massaged in the last day
okay vance i put bat baker on charge i dont think it quite had stabilized it was reading 11 amps 396 volts when i left up there
okay we got that
okay i guess now is as good a time to start as any
just a second jack
aquarius houston
okay vance youre kind of weak but readable
jack were going to need readings on the bat volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 min utes for a while so is there somebody else that can be reading them out while youre copying over
yes jim will take a run up there fredo is sleeping right now were trying to get some sleep here and jimll run up and take a look at voltage and current whenever you call
okay age 025
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
vance weve got to realize that weve got to establish a workrest cycle up here so we just cant wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn wetve got to get them up here look at them and then weve got to get the people to sleep so take that into consideration when you get ready to send up the pads
i know jim were very conscious of that we we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes thats all i can say stand by
okay
aquarius houston
okay vance were ready to go
okay we need a  sorry laughter we need a readout volts and amps
okay in work
and might as well bring the comm up to a higher fidelity for this long period of checklist reading that requires panel 16 cb primary sband power amp closed
okay primary sband power amp closed now how do you read
okay and next step panel 12 sband function to voice and ranging function to hanging
okay vance the sband function is at voice and the ranging switch was at ranging
okay that makes it so we can hear you better jack
okay can we  since the first part of it youre just going to read and im going to copy and were going to have a question and answer period later can we get started lage 626 0 0   5 jc okay lrocr4ures coming back in again multi copies lor distribution and kens back hes a local expert on this now so well turn you over to him and hell read it off
okay stand by ill give you volts and amps okay the voltage is 391 amps 175
okay
hello aquarius houston how do you read
okay very good ken
okay let me take it from the top here just  there might be some overlap but to make sure were all on the same signal were starting off with a set of time line procedures that are going to give us  end up with the normal entry checklist there will be some checklist changes into the book but the bulk of what i have for you is the time line stuff and it starts at 6 hours and 30 minutes prior to ei and assumes that were getting im power to main b in the command module i think you already have the numbers for the lm pads and the comand module pads i mean the types of pads well be giving you and if you have a question on what theyll be doing or what theyre for i can go over those now or when we get through
okay yes ill make a little note there and well discuss it when we get everything copied huh
ail right and the first item then after you get ready to start this checklist is to install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow ordeal on panel 8 we want to turn the floodlights to fixed
okay wait a minute youre going too fast here
okay ill tell you ill go line at a time and wait for your verification before i go on to the next one i have panel 8 floodlights fixed 05 06 6 j cc okay install lioh cariistcrs stow ordeal i111it iixjl 05 0 6 12 cc okay thats the panel 8 floodlights now were going to take panel 5 and put the floodlight rheostat to flood and the leb thats panel 100 floodlights are also going to fixed and the purpose of this is to balance up buses a and b

thats affirmative okay now were at ei minus 5 plus 05 and as far as youre concerned jack the command module is using this for infor mation only this will be the lm doing an earth terminator ags alinement and at the tme of 5 plus 05 is the time theyll be going ahead and releasing their ball and this will be covered in the lm checklist itll be uplinked after this one at ei minus 5 we perform midcourse mzm ber 7 over 05 06 30 16 cme okay at ei minus 0505 the lm is making an earthterminator aline and at ei minus 0500 we perform mcc7
thats correct at the completion of mid course 7 the lm will maneuver to a separation attitude and this attitude will be sent up on one of the pads that youre going to get before all the sequence starts and itll be flown to the lm ball angles on that pad 05 06 30 47 cml okay understand
ail right at ei minus 4 plus 40 we want to perform page 16 step 39 of the entry checklist paf 6f2 ri ill 1  cml kcll i  i didnl il il w flj t hillfep mfii flirl could you ay il  ttin ji minu il dash  or 0440 w do omethin

okay after that lock both rotation hand con trollers
thats affirm on panel 8 sequential pyro arm two to arm 11511636 7 cmp okay panel 8 set fyro arm two to arm do i get a msfn go for that 05 06 36 143 cc thats negative jack we havent powered up any of the downlink a this time youll be doing this and the command module rcs pressuri zation both by yourself
okay
okay now the next event is going to be the separation of the service module and these are some lm steps but so that you will know what is going on ill read them to you the lm will do a lm plusx of onehalf foot per second then youll be hitting the cm sm sep on and up on their command as soon as we are free of the service module the lm will do another 4 minusx for 05 feet per second this is called the pushpull maneuver i think it was described this afternoon
yes ken it was i heard about it
okay i just wanted you to know thats the sequence youre in okay at the completion of that we go back to panel 8 and its sequential pyro ap4both of them to safe
okay panel 8 seq pyro arm two to safe b06 j 28 cc okay and olowing thls we take sequential ioic hw to off 05 06 8 i cml ilay ijlctwo to off
im sorry jack i1 have to ask you to repeat that
okay panel 8 seq logic two to off are they on now ken i dont remember turning them  i guess thats part of one of the other sequences huh that we turned them on
thats affirm the reason were turning the logic off jack is a power savings so well be turning them off md ill ge getting them back on when we go to get off of the lm and then turn them back off then well be turning them on prior to entry just so you know whats coming
okay real fine
okay then following this the lm will pitch up to acquire the moon  excuse me theyre going to pitch up and acquire lhe service module and photo graph and theyll be using the aca for rotations from now on and you may see the lm out of window number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire it
okay the lm pitches up acquires the service module and photographs it and i should expect to find  might possibly see the service modle out of window 5
thats affirmative kay now were down to ei minus 3 hours or the next timeevent and the i2 starts a maneuver to what we call the moonview attitude this maneuver is designed to place the command module optics pointing with zero zero at the moon and it will be flown to on the lm ball angle
okay the lm maneuvers to the moonviewing atti tude which would place the moon in the center of the command module optics with them at zero zero
thats affirmative okay now were going to panel 5 and its circuit breaker gn computer main b closed 05 06 421 cmp okay panel 5 cb gn computer main b closed 05 641 55 cc thats affirmative now youre oing to come up with a 37 enter 06 enter most likely on t eoyntutraxlewhat w wmt to do is to iut the computer to taadby ifyojome up with a 37 06 you have to do an enter in order to get the code 62 if fitsgot 62 on it you can do a proceed until the dsky blanks you might remember that the ac s still off at this time so you wont be getting the standby status light and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the dsky goes blank 05 06 42 6 cmp okay youre saying that i will probably get a program 06 with a verb 37 enter flashing 05 06 42 7 cc i expect that you   05 06 42 2it cmp enter 06
i expect you are  
say again ken
yes we think that youre going to come up with a 37 06 already nthe dsky if you do do an enter and that should take you to the code 00062 which is the request for standby and when you get that hit proceed until the dsky blanks if you come up with something else thats where we want to end up anyhow with ether when you get the code 62 when it comes up just do a proceed on it
okay is there anything else i could get 05 06 42 cc i dont believe so jack thats one that when you get to that step if you do get something else we will be standing by to see that you see the whole scheme is to go to standby
will you be getting i on downlink
no sir we dont have that powered up yet
okay ill yell to jm and jim will give you a call
okay the basic thing jack is just to get the computer in standby to save power 05 06 h3 40 cmp okay pa t

thats correct and the next thilyou will do will be to set the mission timer and what weve done is to only turn on the missisti on the mlc and youll probably have to wai here until they get through with the uplink sc yi  have the computer
kay set it from th chc huh
thats affirm okay now we are getting ready to start the alinement sequence and are you familiar with the general sequence of events were going to use jack
how do you mean we are going to make an aline ment on the looannd on the sun other than that  i didnt get any  i wasnt on the headset when the general information was passed up so if there was any more than that i didnt get it fap 8511 jm i41 ij 0 il 115 c okty lirli ly itlji  corrfrt lad m itt rft holr i b hlrlrlnvrlryij fr a rniflut and thcr ill rmd you tho tep i think it will make more ense the scheme is that the lm can fly to a set of ball angles that will point your optics at the moon now at any time in any attitude that we happen to be at if you can look in the telescope and recognize star patterns sufficient that you believe you can make an alinement all on your own thats the place wed like to break off and let you go ead and take over with your own alinement however we are giving you a procedure which will gve you things weknow you can see in the telescope with out worrying about any reflections or anything of that nature and its not intended that this procedure les to be followed past the point where you know youve got geed definition of star patterns in your telescope if you need to go on well maneuver take a look at the moon well take a mark there and then well maneuver with the lmfdai angles again and take a look at the sun and get yourself another mark on the sun and that will complete the alinement now the alinement scheme s that we are going to give you a set of angles that you can coarse aline the ball through when the lm is oiiting you at the moon now this set of angles will agree with the refsmmat that you have in as a nominal refsmmat in you cmc you can coarse aline to that set a drift flag and eefsmmat flag and you have a good platform and well be within a couple of degrees of a good alinement and if we have to we could break off at this point and go ahead with an entry however in an attempt to get a good platform we are going to have you then do a p52 option l and what you are going c find in the option 1 slots in the entry refs2lz youll come up with the noun 22 values and we intend to go ahead and coarse aline the ball to the entry refsmmat attitude and then well ge ahead and take marks through a normal p52 sequence so thats the general scheme that we are going to use if you think you have a handle on that i will go ahea and read you the steps 05 07 i i cml okay well lei me ask a quast ion the lm matlcuvof to  set of moonviewint anlles oky at this time i am going to do a p52 is thzt right with the planet option
the first thing we arc going to do is to coarse aline the platform an6 get it inertial based on the refsb94at that you have in the present slot inside the cmc well then go  and do a p52 option h  correction option 1
okay  thats after the lm gets established at the attitude jim says im here at the moon viewing attitude i do a verb 41 noun 20 to the set of angles that youre going to give me in the pad
thats affirmative  
and then i enter the p52
thats correct
okay heni enter the p52 and thats an option 3 right
the p52 will be done as an option 1 the only reason you have the other refsmmat inside tho computer is that in order to set the refsmmat flag you need some rlative orientation
okay i see i do a p52 option 1 and when do i set the refsmmat flag and the drift flag
that will be before entering p52 i am going to give you this procedure in detail 05 07 04 38 cml okay ali right lets go at it maybe itll all fall out and i wont have any questions go ahead
okay im ready to start reading again we start with a verb 41 noun 20
okay when the lm is in the moonviewing attitude i do a verb 41 noun 20 enter
thats right and youll put in the attitudes that youll get from one of the pads and this will be for the coarse aline angles when the lm palc643 is at th moonviawing attitude then when theyre all quared away i tell you they have the right attitude we then pick up again with a verb 40 noun 20 enter
okay verb 40 noun 20 enter when moon is  the lm is satisfied that theyre at the moon viewing attitude
thats correct now were going to set the refsmmat and drift flags according to the gc checklist page g71 steps 3 and 4
okay set the refsmmat flag for gc 71 steps 3 and 4
thats correct now verb 37 enter 52 enter option 1
verb 37 enter 52 enter option 1
thats correct and ell do the coarse aline
okay perform the coarse aline function
okay now when it gets back to the mark rou tines we want to take a mark on the moon
okay mark on the moon with the crosshairs in the center is that right
thats affirmative okay when thats complete the lm will maneuver to the sunviewing angle for attitude and when they get there you take a mark on the sun using the sun filter and the telescope and again were marking on the center
okay now let me ask you a question is the first mark on the moon made with the  are all these made with the telescope and not the sextant
if  im not sure right offhand what the angular size of the moon is jack if you can get it in the sextant thats the best thing to do but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center either ones acceptable 9 07 08 04 cmp okay i1  can define the center through thc soxtatlt do it that way anti if f can t usc thc telescope
lats affirmed we know youre going to usc the telescope on the sun
okay you ready to press on
im ready
okay just reminded we owe somebody a bat b voltage
okay another volts ard amps coming up
ail right thank you and this left us in p52 with two marks and well go ahead and torque the noun 93s
okay  torque the noun 93s after the two marks
okay so that gives us a good platform now the lm will maneuver to the jettison attitude and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform
okay the lm maneuvers to the jettison attitude and i just monitor the maneuver and yell at jim if he gets near a gimbal lock
thats affirmed okay and then the lm will  to a max deadband attitude hold in the jettiscn attitude 05 07 10 04 cml okay qaelm goes to max deadband attitude hold
okay now were ready to go back to work 51e next thing well do is to continue to powerup procedures do you have any further questions on that alinement jack
no no i think  i think its all self explanatory now
okay the one thing that everybody wou2d like for you to understand is we certainly dont insist orliirltfhmorijldthe earth if you find you haw good stars why use them itowever this airlmont is mor than adequate te give us a good guided entry
okay if i get a set of good stars do i start right out to a basic p51 and a p52 option 17
thats affirmative
okay
okay now were ready to go to work on panel 275 and it starts with a circuit breaker main a   05 07 11 01 cp wait  wait just a minute wait just a minute i owe you some volts md amps
okay ail right 05 07 tl 09 cmp okay volts are 394 amps 125
okay i thought mayb your meter was stuck before
no laughter
all right you ready to go back to 275 have a circuit breaker main a bat bus a closed
cb main a bat bus a closed
thats correct and circuit breaker main b bat c closed
cb main baker bat charlie closed
okay thats correct now were up to ei minus 1 plus 30 and at this time were going to proceed with the closeout and hatch installa tion
okay closeout and hatch installation at ei minus 0130
thats right jack and were going to close the im hatch and well make the dump valve in the lm hatch closed tape 856
understald youre going to close tiledump valw now on the 34hatch right
thats correct
okay this is a change from what we had under stood previously
thats correct
im  personally im happy to see it but thats good
okay thats one vote on your side kay and were going to go ahead and do the  use the decal to perform the hatch installation and well start on the hatch integrity check
okay per the decal perform the hatch installa tion smd start on the hatch integrity check
thats correct
okay ken one thing i think that  i dont know whether anybody the decal dont take into account the fact that we still have the umbili eals connected at what point in time should they be removed
okay jack that doesnt matter were going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals and you can leave them right there
okay does it make y difference if we disengage  the im we have pulled the circuit breakers impower1 aad 2 so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals theres no harm right
thats right no sweat john aarons just saying that they may he hot hes checking on it so how about holdng a decision on that and let me come back to you
okay
okay and let me tell you what were going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon on this tunnel were actually going to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with about 112 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel and this will give us a deltap of 3 so we12 do our hatch intgrjty check rtthe same time were venting the tu31nel down
okay it sounds good
okay now let me giw you some plumbing switches here lets take the surge tank oxygen valve to on
surge tank 02 to on
ail right take the main regs two open
main regs two to open
okay and the water and glycol tank pressure the pressure valve and the relief valve to both

okay on panel 8 rotation control power direct 1 and 2 main amain b
okay these are circuit breakers rotation control power direct 1 and 2 main a and main b closed
okay jack i was thinking switch let me verify thats a circuit breaker too i think we have to get both of them
okay theres those four circuit breakers over there ken when you said panel 8 thats what i thought you were talking about i dont think the circuit breakers are out right now t but why doufw iraiut verify the circuit brakruulput thwjlrhtqo matn amain i iyi c kuyihjlrrctjlxoky at 1minu 1 hour wre gojnlbtbe doing thc lm jettison so just prior to that we want to do a p47
okay say at about 1 inute prior to lm jettison huh
yes just something thats comfortable for you
okay
all right after wew done that we want to get panel 8 sequential pyro arm two of them on
okay i get a go fron msfn for this
okay john says we can watch it
okay
all right the next thing is csmlm final sep two of them on up
csml final sep two on
thats correct now were going back bo panel 8 and its sequential pyro arm two of them to safe
okay seq pyro arm two to safe
thats correct and go back to po0
okay go to po0 05 07 24 4 cc all right and now its time to configure for single ring
okay configure for single ring rcs
thats right and since youre still a hour from ei i guess it wouldnt hurt to use minimum impulse or something like that rather than the dap at least not until you get closer down well have the dap loads for you later
  tape852o pae 650
okay and as soon as youve gotten yourself all set up wth a good control mode you want to maneuver lo the entry attitude 05 07 25 5 cmp maneuver to entry attitude per the pad
thats correct and we show ei minus 55 which really means when you get to the entry attitude we have a sextat star check for you and that will be on the pad
kay perform a sextmlt star check
okay and i want to remind you to park the optics at 90 degrees of shaft
okay say again why ken i didnt understand that
okay this is just a precaution jack if we park the optics with a 90degree shaft angle that will line up the slits so it gives you the best airflow over that part of the heat shield and avoids a hot spot if you dont remember it i dont think it makes much difference its just good procedure
okay
okay and after youve got it parked wherever you want it well turr the optics power off and stow the optics
kay optics power off stow the optics
okay thats good okay the next thing well do is to initialize the ems and thats on entry checklist page 21 step number 2
okay perform ems initialization per entry checklist page 21 step 2
okay thats correct now were coming up on ei minus 5 minutes and well give you an entry pad and a final state vector
okay at minus 45 entry pad and final state vector from msfn
okay now were going to perform what we call the moon check rather than go into detail if pal65 i yl al rdy imw wftut r jirll tjt jy  olhrw ill drib th ti o th jon attitmd i 0 07 28 38 cmp maybe you better describe it
okay jack you remember everybody in the past has commented on seeini moonset just a couple minutes prior to ei and your horizon will prob ably be dark at the time that you get there youre having an early morning entry and coming in from the west youll still be looking at a dark horizon so just as a backup technique just like you would track the horizon were going to give you an attitude which will be on the pad so that you can look directly at the moon this is an inertial attitude it wont be changing and youll put the 36degree window line on the moon and hen just sit there and watch it and just pr or to ei the earth will come up and occult it and you will then have a good horizon check and i have some times and ill give you that later and if you just look at this thing now at vhat point you cl set the gdc or whatever you desire and you will have a known attitude reference its just like a horizon check
okay i maneuver to the moon check attitude at which time i put the 36 window line on the moon and just prior to ei the earth will occult the moon
thats correct and that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that youd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the hori zon attitude several minutes prior to ei its the same thing
yes thats that one at 17 minutes prior okay
okay and were just getting it in a little closer okay the xt item on the check  checklist here is an ei minus 40 were going to panel 7 and its ag number 2 power to warm up
okay panel 7 biagnumber 2 power to warm up
thats correct now id like to verify the surge tank and repress packages are on 507 1iz cml vrifysurge tank and repress package are on 05 0 1 16 cc thats correct on panel 5 circuit brewer environmental  contro systa waste water urine dump heater two of them closed
panel 5 cb ecs wastj h20urine dump heaters two to close
thats correct suit compressor number 2 to off
suit compressor 2 to off
thats right jack and what this  what were planning to do in order to conserve power is were going to run the suit compressor from a hour to this point at minus 40 and well be watching the pc02 if nhat things working well turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin and then well just leave iv off and in the event that the pco2 gage isnt working properly or something like that well well just go ahead and run it loc this time frame
kay that sounds good
ail right row were at ei minus 30 sequen tial logic thats two of them to on up
ei minus 30 seq logic two on
okay in panel 7 the bmag number 2 power to on
okay we  you only gave that 10 minutes for the warmup huh
thats okay
okay
ail right and fdai power to both
fdai power to both
okay and we want to activate the primary evaporator
okay activate the primary evaporator ail this time ken whatve we been getting our cooling right now i think we have the radiators at pull to bypass f
thats correct we started out that way and we tinned the glycol pump on and were just cir culatinf it internally and were counting on the command module being a heat sink its pretty cold soaked and it looks like this is good enough you got some relatively low heat loads   05 07 34 20 cml okay
  and well keep watching the temps and if we need it why well start the evaporator early
okay that sounds good
do you believe its cold up there
yes and we used to call the command module the bedroom and its now the refrigerator
okay just dont call it the reefer okay at about ei minus 19 we get back into the standard entry checklist on page22 where it starts with p61
okay at ei minus 19 we get back into the entry checklist at page 22 where we start entering p61
okay jack now thats the  those are the timeline notes i had for you i hate to tell you this but i also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist they arent cor rections they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what ive written  already read to you and im ready to to on that whenever you are and vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now
we can get into the descent water for inking huh
yes
sounds good
hey go to it
jim would like to know whether the descent water will be good until lm jettison tap 852 pagr654 05   i ii okly lud iog l il wrrl ir tc l00rj th amit tuks at 2130 arid it looks ljk  
okay understand we are going  
  you have plenty of water im sorry we cut each other out say again
okay yes i was going to say understand were going to go on the ascent tanks at 12830
thats right based on the current rate thats what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water no sweat
okay real fine and ive got the entrr check list out and im ready to copy just give me the page
okay jack youre starting to sound lke an lmp
i think im probably the only cmp thats ever witnessed an  a lm burn from inside the lm in  in space flight
laughter i hope it stays that way okay jack were starting orpage 11
go ahead
okay down in the middle of the page on line 9 were just going to strike out the activate vhf for comm checks and line 10 verify the dse were going to leave the dse off and thats to save power as is the vhf activation
okay
okay on page 12 at minus 2 hours theres a title logic sequence check and were deleting that entire sequence thats included in what i read up to you
okay delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there
thats correct and delete lines 23 24 and 25 that means a maneuver to supercirc entry attitude everything below that is deleted
okay delete lines 23 through 28
thats correct you got ahead of me all right on line 29 on page 13 were going to put in a time of minus 0055 thats the time we gave you for the boresight check
okay  
thats your sextant check really
got that
okay on the top of page 14 where it said l hour and 15 minutes next to line 32 were going to change that to minus 2 hours and 30 minutes
okay minus 0230 opposite item 32
okay down at the bottom of the ems entry check right there where we are the bottom line now reads ems mode to standby well just above that  like to remind you to put a remark do not initialize the range to go this is because youre going to come into the ems entry check youre going to run through all these things then were going to remove power from the is and just didnt want you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry parameters because youll lose them when we power up
okay
and after we go ems mode to standby like for you to add circuit breaker ts two to open
okay cb ems two to open
thats correct and we want to delete this set up camera thats listed on the bottom of the page were deleting that for power reasons thats line 33 alfa
okay were way ahead of you we already got it stowed
okay on the top of the next page where it says secondary water evap just keep in mind we dont plan to use the secondary evaporators un less the primary fails on line 35 on page 15 jalt 656 rxt lo crjmtrjdmodbll  rhkti dtirri is now mifus 060
okay minus 0630 gad the voltage reding 39 still is good right 05 07 hi 21 cc okay very good undec final stowage the first thing thats lised on line 36 page 15 is optics and if you want to get started on your stowage wed like to leave the optics out because well have the star check coming up quite a bit after this the rest of that stuff can be taken care of at your convenience
okay
ali right still on pace 15 line 37 the time is now minus 0610
got that
okay and this is one time it looks like we might actually do the preheat so thats the reason we want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat we may not be able to watch it at that time because you arent powered up
okay either 20 minutes or until 39 volts dc
thats correct jack and now lets go to page 16 and about onethird of the wy down it shows panel 275 cb main a bat c closed we want to strike off hatline the next two lines and were going to strike out main a bat c closed main b bat c closed and dc indicator main b
okay after that step on panel 275 strike out cb main a bat c cb main b bat c and dc indicators to main b
thats correct now reader panel 8 it ells you to close all circuit breakers except and i have four additions the first one is cb service module rcs heaters quad charlie main b open
service module rcs heaters quad charlie main baker open ta 8527 pac65 i i 4  u cc ply ahd ih arjr thirl for jivice moiuie rc iieaier qiiad dejta main a open
rvice module rcs heaters quad delta main a open
thats correct and clrcuit breaker ems thats two of them open
cb ems two to open
ail right and the last is the circuit breakers for sps gaging four of them open
sps gaging four to open
okay and how about our readout on the battery and that charger
okay bats at volts and amps
thats affirmed and lets go back to page 16 line 41 lets put in a time minus 0440
minus 0440
thats correct on page 21 line number 2 put in a time of minus 55 minutes
okay minus 55 minutes
okay and the first thing you want to do under ems initialization is circuit breakers ems thats two of them to close
okay cb ems two to close
thats correct ail right line 4 or step 4 where it shows cm rcs check that occurs at minus 0430
okay minus 0430
ail right under cm rcs checks the fourth line down says manual attitude three to mini mum impulse well have to use accel command and the reason for that jack is we dont have the sps powered up so theres no minimum impulse generator ta 51
okay manual attitude three to accel command
thats correct and on the same page 21 strike out the last three lins starting with rcs transfer to service modmle
right the last three lines are scratched out we aint got one of those things
thats correct okay lets flip to page 22 and strike out the first two lines
okay now wait a second i need to give you volts and amps ken 05 07 414 cc all right go ahead
okay its 396 112
sounds like youre getting there okay i believe we scratched out the first two lines on 22 now were  right below that it says separation checklist so were going to just delete that whole thing its included in the notes i gave you
okay its included in the notations
all right line number 7 it says maneuver to horizon check attitude were going to call this the mooncheck attitude and this is the one we discussed jack the angle of 265 is not correct ill have one of those for you first thing in the morning
okay
okay and at the bottom of the page step number 1 that will be at ei minus 19 minutes and were off and running through a normal sequence of events
okay that sounds good ken i guess if youve read this thing  is it a comfortable time line any areas where you had problems with
jack it is very comfortable weve run it several times now and in fact its being run right now again and weve run it both here at houston and at the cape the only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of tam 859 ia 659 things is during the platformalinement period when youre getting ready to close out the lm and then once you get into the command module and jettison the lm why youre back on a very com fortable time and of course well be watching and anything we can do like keeping track of time for you well remind you of that as we go along
hey that would be good  that would be good ken
okay let me emphasize jack that 212 hours is the earliest time we can start in on that powerup stuff everything else you can do the way you normally would where you get as far ahead of the game as you can but the 212 hour time is based on saving command module con sumables and if you do that why were fat weve got plenty of time to give you some fans on the water even so thats the one point you dont want to start early on i do have a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist and two pages in the gc and i think that will clean us up
okay ken and gc checklist now
let me finish a couple more things in the entry book you still got that
yes go ahead
okay on  these are just cleanup items jack on page 23 it lists now you separate from the cmsm sep and all that so obviously if were on step 5 at 43 minutes down  thats all deleted and that gets deleted all the way over onto page 24 up to the line where it says 15 min utes and at that point we pick back up and everything from 15 minutes down is valid
okay delete item 5 down to the point where it says minus 15 minutes
thats correct jack okay on page 25 the top line where we had horizon cheek thats now the moonset check and the time is approxi mately 5737 and thats minus 0223 and that angle thats listed in the book there  177  thats really a horizon time at 2 minutes well lapcl0 have you  can look that up on the back of yon entry cue card and ill look that number up again for you tonight
okay
okay another thing is to remember when we begin blackout which is arcmd 05g and you can write this in your checklist wherever its convenient once weve lost comm were going to go ahead and power down the sce power off and the pmp power off and we just want to do that after you lose comm which comes up around ei any time after that go ahead and secare the pmp and the sce power
okay when comm is lost sce power off pmp power off 05 07 52 147 cc thats correct jack and that completes the entry checklist lets look at the gc book
okay ready to copy
okay lets go to page 21
okay go ahead
okay jack the second line under imu powerup says fdai power to both and were going to make that a 1 the reason were doing that is again to conserve power theres no reason to drive the second fdai before we get that information to put on it
okay fdai power to 1
ail right thats correct on page 22 05 07 54 06 cml go ahead
okay under cmc powerup line  or step 2 says flashing 3700 enter the time were going to use this jack is going to be when youve just brought the computer up and it has a state vector in it thats way back many many hours ago so we want to do a verb 96 enter to stop the inte gration to keep it from just sitting there ambling along and when the ground gives you a new state vector why then we can go through po0 and well be back in business pag 61 ij  51 1 cml okay rlmwml rrjto  1o vihb 7 jjijjho rj iniii iillj lhlri ri jvji  05 07 54 5 cc whnyou comup 1 guss youre going to  once you get the cmc powered up youre probably going to be going  youre going to come up in a flash ing 37 and if youll just do a verb 96 enter right there that will take care of it
okay
ail right and the last one i have for you is on page 24
okay go ahead
okay under the scs powerup the first line says auto rcs select 16 to off okay you can just delete that part on the fifth line it says circuit breaker scs logic power thats really logic bus four of them to closed the deltav cg is not important since we are not burning the engine the signal conditioner driver bias power lists two to ac 1 we are going to make that just one of them make it signal conditiondriver bias power one to ac 1 the bmag power which is the third line from the bottom says bmag power two on we are going to make that just one well bring up number 1 and well make fdai power num ber 1 and the last line auto rcs select 16 enable you can strike that off and reslace it with bmag mode three of them to rate 1 you want to try reading that back
okay delete auto rcs select 16 off change cb logic power to logic thrust power  cbs cs logic thrust four to closed delete deltav cg coming down here signal conditionerdriver bias power one ac 1 bmag power 1 to on and its the number 1 tmag fdai power to 1 bmag mode three to rate 1 deleting the auto rcs select 16 to enable
thats correct youve got them all jack very good thank you
thank you this does it huh ij r  1 iic y jr il r  lji l rron  bt m hk lhi hal ch ald irjlrity check maybe  an tl you somrthng gout that and i do have an answer to your i power question about the umbilicals the umbilicals will be unpowered according to the lm procedures so if youd like to disconnect them you can
okay i think we will
ail right sir okay jack and theyd like us to stand by just a second
jack would you get the battery charger off please and well send you  
okay
  the rest of that procedure later
you mean theres more okay in work battery charger is going off
right
okay vance okay  i dont think youve given me the backout procedure have you for the battery chargers
thats negative wait ail we want to do jack is say battery charge off at the moment well complete that procedure as soon as you are through with ken completely
ay vance the battery chargers off and im ready to continue with ken
okay jack and well get the backout to you after that
okay jack it looks like weve closed up the loose ends here amazingly enough out of all that stuff it looks like we only generated one question on the floor and well research that one well even let you guess what it might have been if you have any questions after you mull it over why were always available just ask us what youre thinking about
okay thats what were going to do were going to wait until the lm people get theirs and then were going to discuss it and coordinate things here and make sure that  that we dont have any interface problems and if we have uly more questions well be coming back at you
okay we did run the thing integrated so we think weve got all the little surprises ironed out for you
i hope so because tomorrow is examination time
roger
ken this is jim
yes sir
appreciate the work youve done and jack says that its going to be nard to beat his record about saving sm rcs fuel all the way there and back
i cant do much about that
some people will do anything to set a record

yes thats fine okay and we have one other comment rearding the systems checklist and stand by 1 and thatl  thatll wrap it up for us oh a new item came in jack we need to switch to ascent water and t have a threestep procedure for you if youre ready to ccpy
okay jim will copy tiat
okay descent wathr wdve close ascent water valve to close amd water tnk select valve to ascent 05 08 07 211 cdr okay vance descenri aker valve closed ascniit water valve closed ard water select tk to ascent is thst correct 05 08 07 3 cc water tank seltctvalve ascent thats correct jim 05 08 07 h5 cdr and well proceed with that rihht now and how about still drinking descent water
jim we understand that you should be able to continue drinkinf it 05 08 08 2h cdr okay we switched to ascent water but well probably have to have the descent water valve back open up again to drink water
thats affirm thats the one thing youll have to do is whenever you want to drink out of the descent tank s open the descent valve  the iesceit waiigivalve monentarily
okay and we are now cn ascent water
okay okay and i need jack back again please
okay vance im here and you have somethinff in the systems checklist
thats right refer to s26 this  really what were talking about jack is the hatch integrity check decal and i think itll be easiest if youll open to s26 and i explain it to you tr h  iff ft   111 mi ikiy vir ir radv i dy
okay this wlil  this just involves ehan  look down to the third line where it stkvs ri ii vent valw tiffnel vent for 0 seconds cre out 30 seconds and cross out the two lines below that in other words lm csm deltaf check deltai and recycle to tunnel if2 05 08 10 24 674p okay you want me to delete for 0 seconds 05 08 i0 34 cc thats affirm and the two lines below 30 see onds and actually the part of tie fourth line there which is 812 minutes
stand by can you read okay 05 08 0 53 cc yes  hear you now 05 08 j0 55 cmt kay delete the two lines bcow ta or the twoandahalf lines below that also
thats acfirm and no we have an addition to put in pace of what wc deletect sland by i the comms bad how do you read 05 08 ll 4 c  roger 1omd md clear
okay we wallt you to ent  tunnel vent unt and add the following until imcm deltap s equal to 30 psid
okay until lmcm deitap equals 30
okay amd that means that youll have a pressure of 15 to 2 in the tunre absolute thats   05 08 1i 57 cmp okay
thats a note
jack thats what we want to end up with utimately is 112 to 2 there n that tunnel and depending on the gage reading btt that should be about 3 05 08 12 10 cml kay deke
okay then jack continuing on everythings okay until you get dowrj to  on the next page you get throueh verify 02 flow indicator no in crease we would like to delete everything below lage 667 that unti the iast atop which  tunnel ligtj off ilo tarting with before undocking only delete ail lines through tunnel vent valve to tifnnel vent 05 08 2 50 cmj okay delete tilesection that says before ul docking only down to where it says tunnel vent valve to tinnel vent
yes through that
well through that leave tfnnel lights off is the only step remaining
roger anjust  thats a verify 05 08 13 11 cmp kay got that 0 08 13 5 cc okay eallywhat this does for you then is it gives you a prssure  a tunnel pressure integrity  or a hatch pressure integary  integ rity check with a iel2t  of 3 psi between the tunnel and the cabin and then you never go on to the steps of ventin that on out you just leave it in there for the time that you separate from the lm and that gives you a shotgun deitav effect
okay copy that
okay i think thats 11 but were polling the house here to see if theres another conent for you stand by
aquarius houston
go ahead vance 05 08 5 24 cc jack thats it unes you have any more ques tions why everyone ishoping youll hit the sack and get some rest
okay you want that battery backout procedure now to take that  to complete the remaining steps 05 08 5 50 cc thats affirm jack we request that you go ahead and finish out the backout completely until you get to square 1 over
okay ta ti 05 08 16 214 cdr houston aquarius 05 08 6 26 cc go dtead jim 05 08 16 29 cd do you have any more updates for us
weve still got a lm update but we strongly recommend that you d jack work as hard as you can sleeping for about the next 5 hours fred can handle it 05 08 6 42 cdr okay thats what wel do well put fred on watch here and jack and i will take it easy and if fred copies the lm update well then well all start from fresh in the morning 05 86 56 cc you bet
aquarius houston over 05 08 23 48 imp all right go ahead vance
okay fred two  three things first thing is we need a docking angle check as soon as you can conveniently get it second point youre free to drink all the descent stage water you want if that wasnt clear before and the third point if you have a piece of paper stand by to get writers crrtlps we have something to give you here 05 08 24 2 lmp okay you want the  ain a look at the docking tunnel index
why dont you go ahead and look at that  
look at that first yes
okay 05 08 25 h6 lmp okay jim says the docking tunnel index is a plus 21 degrees
okay plus 21 degrees docking tunnel index
okay he corrects himself he says make that sign a minus minus 21 degrees
okay we justchanged plus to minus fj f 6 i mi okay and yolr rorld itrn wa w crj drirlk t  lhal irit watr tshal l jlt  look lie jbout 2 lrttilt and jl d book here ar  roady to tgt writing
okay get  this wont be as long as  as thc one t k read up but youll need several pages probably
okay ive got lots of pages here of kens qoto log set to go
okay fredo okay this is entry lm pret starts ei minus 6 hours at that time you poer up the acs i think ill give you a line at a time and when i hear you sam okay on that ill to to the next that sound reasonable 05 08 21 lmp okay il go hot mike briefly
okay bat 5 
hey how do you read now
okay i read you okay fred okay battery 5   05 08 27 33 lbi okay 
battery normal feed on is the first step
okay vance that  go ahead
okay use modified lm dpsrcs 30minute activation checklist
okay
ei mnus 5 hours midcourse7 if required next lm preentry proedure and fred the time on lm preentry procedure is just  
okay go ahead
okay the time on the lm preentry procedure is just as soon as you finish midcourse7 or 5 hours 
all right go ahead vance
okay age70 1508 29 0 lm1 okay ive got this tei minus 5 hours mcc7 f required and now youre going to start me a new procedure called lm preentry procedure go ead 05 08 2919 cc roger maneuver to sm sep attitude configure for csm hotfire

go ahead jim
have we looked seriously now at just the essential things required to make a safe lm jettison were not  i dont think we have the time to really do any engineering data that people might want to look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere
well jim i  i think that that was what every body aimed for and people down here feel that its the essentials that its what you need tape86i8 but i ut dont want lc bthrowkng switches at the last aiinute what were realy thinking about getting that command module in good shape
hey jim this is tom the only reason were bringing up the pgns is to have another reference system just to control the lm when you jettison the thing over
okay okay tom its  i thought the  an ags att hold would have been sufficient for this when we first thought about this
yes i agree but we decided just in case we have any glitch with the ags we want to make sure we get that lm off in a good shape and i agree with you on keepiag out all the garbage on t

okay you ought to have it now jack
okay youre coming through good now fred ive got three deltas to the checklist thetre minor changes id like to pass them along now one of them is to the csm checklist so if youll pick that up ill give it to you 05 12 31 25 ly okay which one
okay stand by 1
is it the one jack wrote them all in the big long readout he also wrote something in the gn book
its in the big long one he wrote out at about ei minus 0230 ems entry check paga 690
okay hes coming back down with it
meanwhile fred ive got two for you on the lm prep checklist
okay jacks here now ill hand it to him
okay houston aquarius
hello aquarius ive got a couple of changes for you on your csm checklist
okay stand by 1
okay go ahead 05 12 3100 cc okay jack the time line between ei minus 0230 and 1 hour is real crowded so youre really going to have to hustle and weve decided to delete the ems entry check at minus 0230 thatll give you a little more time in there what weve decided to do with it is wait until after ei minus 1 just before you initialize the ems if you have time and only if you have time do the ems entry check otherwise forget it and go right on into ems initialization you understand
okay youre going to delete between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 0215 there and youre going to add it if there is time only if there is time at ei minus 1 hour where the ems initialization oc cus 
thats right you got it correctly okay jack one other item just before ei minus 2 hours and 15 minutes we need an ememory dump verb 74 enter over
okay stand by 1 would you please
okay right before 2 hours and 15 minutes i assume thats before msn gives their p27 update i do a verb 74 right
thats affirmative jack
how much sleep did you get jack
oh i guess  stand by i guess maybe 2 or 3 hours it was awful cold and it wasnt very good sleep lni qb ll idll
roger you plan to try to get any more
what get do you have
we got 13237
well if i  if i get everything done ill try but i te21 you its almost impossible to sleep ail of us have that same problem its just too cold to sleep
roger iqeway were looking at it looks like you ought to have a couple 3 hours here before you have to really get with it 05 2 38 19 cmp well  well take it esy hut i  and well try to seep but its just awful cold
present data indicates that you entry anle is mjnu 603 degrees your dettav at the mideourse is oingto 28 feet a second
okay copy 05 238 54 cdr jack thss ejsm i understand this is going to be an tbuirn 0 12 9 01 cc 77rats afijmnatiw jim its zoing to be an rcs burn
okay
and we need the suit circuit relief valve back to auto correctson back to close
hey jack thats in work ld one thing comparing jims checklist with my own i find one difference there at ei minus 0230 his checklist has me changing a  opening a eps sensor signal circuit breaker right prior to turning off lm power s  id like to find out which checklist is correct apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription
hey jack le lm checklist is just for infor mation to jim its just to tell him that  that youre changing back to command module power your checklist is correct over
okay and when do you figure that youll be sending up the pads that you have
aquarius all of your pads will be coming up in about 312 hours at ei minus 0630 and one thing we want to remind you of when you remove power from the conmaud module lm umbilical is to be sure that you open the lm power main b circuit breakers both of them before you start throwing switches and circuit breakers in the lm do it as weve outlined it in the procedure in that order over 05 12 44 33 lmj okay thats the way we planned on it well let jack do his three and then hell tell us when were go from there what pages are those changes on
okay fred the one ive got for you is at the end of power removal from the command module lm umbilical and just for your information after you go through that entire procedllre and about the time youre ready to transfer to the command module at that time power will be removed from the umbilical and its okay to disconnect it that is after youve thrown the switches in the lm is that clear
roger thats where ive got a remark here to check with you to see if its all right to pro ceed
roger and that would be just after on panel 16 you opening ascent eca control breakers 05 12 45 2 lmp which step number is that 05 12 46 03 lm the confusing thing is jack where they told me to wait for msfn gc before proceeding was that bat 2 low volts offreset then on
okay thats still affirmative well give you a go after waiting 5 seconds and then down from there just a few steps after you have opened the ascent eca control breakers on panel 16 at that point the umbilical is not powered and its okay to disconnect them should you care to do so
okay after the last step then im free to disconnect
right and one other change we have is shortly after that where were configuring for jettison we have closed both the forward dump valve and the overhead dump valve and we dont want to get in a locked up position like that so one way to get around it is to  after we close the forward dump valve turn the descent oxygen valve off over 05 12 47 7 lmi okay after the forward dump valve add a step in that says the descent ox valve off
okay fred that concludes the deltas and perhaps you heard that our gammas are still minus 603 and our deltav will be a 28foot persecond rcs burn 05 2 47 46 lmp roger
fredo weve got one more change wed like to give you to clarify a question that jack asked earlier at ei minus 0230  
okay hold on a minute jack i meant to cll jack back down im not familiar with the pre vious discussion
negative this is on your checklist
okay go ahead 05 12 14849 cc at e mi  ei minus 0230 during power removal from the umbilical frst thing we do is two steps with the csm we open the main b the lm power to main b circuit breakers and then theres a third step which says circuit breaker eps sensor signal main b open just delete that step over
okay delete the third step
and aquarius for your information as far as our water supply is concerned including our tape 89 plans for powerup we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this point 1512 51 01 imp okay eighteen hottrs of water remaining from this point jack
hello tlouston aquarius
hello aquarius go ahead
okay jack this is jim i just want to make sure that youre filtering the changes to the checklist that come up to make sure that theyre absolutely essential when we learn our pro cedures we can only do it one time and we cant make changes at the last minute wed like to do the best the safest way possible but unless the changes are really essential dont bother sending them up
roger we wont the chairman of the cpcb is still active and one thing were trying to do is to save you all the time we can between ei minus 0230 and 1 hour
thats affirm thats a real important time
yes for your information jim i dont know whether you heard that originally but that time from 212 to 1 in there has been run about three times and its pretty tight so weve tried to weed out what we could which isnt much but i thinza the other message you might impress on jack hen you get around to alining that platform dont try to get it down too neat it doesnt have to be all that good just do a nice quick and dirty one and thats going to be good enough anyway
i concur i think for reentry we dont have to have a real accurate platform but i havent told jack that
roger hey jim while youre up and things are nice and quiet let me give you a couple of other things to think about one specifically i know none of you are sleeping worth a damn because its so cold and you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 0135 or in that ballpark and pull out a couple of dexedrines apiece and try one about then and another around 0139 to 0140 05 12 53 i5 cdr well i hadnt brought that up we might  we might consider it
okay
wish we could figure a way to get a hot cum of coffee up to you itd probably taste pretty good about now wouldnt it
yes it sure would yu dont realize how cold this thing becomes when its in a ptc mode thats slowing down and i just clocked the cycles on my  and its about 11 to 12 minutes now and the sun is directly overhead so its shining on the engine bell of the service module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all 05 2 54 6 f hang in there it wont be long now
yes thats right as a matter of fact doing this alinement on the earth this time will be like making a landing with a foggedup windshield
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
okay skipper we figured out a way for you to keep warm we decided to start powering you up now and what we want you to do  what we want you to do is take your entry lm prep checklist and start at the top here it says bat 5 nopial feed on and then jump over as it says to your 30minute activation and do all of the 30minute activation up to but not including the burn you copy
okay if i understand you correctly then that gives me leeway to mareuver when we get up to activation complete and we can be in position for the burn but we will not burn we dont have a pad anyway
thats affirm jim you could maneuver to burn attitude or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the sun in the windows to warm the place up
sounds good and youre sure we have plenty of electrical power to do this page 696 05 13 3p9 ic thats affirmative weve got plenty of power to do it i can fet you a nlmfier thoukh ip i    i jim youw tot about o0pcrccul itrlin on everyhilf fromhere on in 05 13 l31t9 cdr that sounds encouraging
roger thats in the lm were not talking about the csm right now
i understand
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay question this short turnon step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the rcs system ab two quads and tbe breakers are still out on panel 11 did you want those in too or are we just going to use one set of heaters
stand by 05 3 31 32 cc aquarius houston go as the checklist recom mends for now when you get into the circuit breaker panel configuration youre going to get the ntmlber 1 set of heaters on anyway
okay
okay houston wed like to get a hack to set our mission timer here jack
okay fredo set it at 13335 straight up youve got about 30 seconds to set it
okay standing by
okay ill give you the 2second delay in there stand by to start
start 05 13 35 03 limp okay weve got it
okay im counting 1333510
right on tape 89 5  3 5 4 cc a1arius llouston one other way lo wlrm thitl up in a hurry in there is when you get your ac on to turn on tlle window heaters
okay i gaess the ony question i have is what its liable to do to us with the  looks like almost a frost on it now
understand this jack id like to let it maybe warm up just a little bit more before hitting it with the heat load
not a bad idea
and as you can see houston at turnon we got our old friend downlink 2 back
roger were seeing it fred
aquarius houston it looks like youre proceeding toward the gimbal lock there wed like you to check that please
roger not much we can do about it we cant use the thrusters houston
okay forget it now well get it later 05 13 44 h4 imp and houston aquarius i guess the next thing for the pgns will be a coarse aline 000 but i guess we ought to holup now anti we get enough time on the rcs thrusters
roger were looking at them well give you the go on them okay aquarius your quads are 120 to 133 now so youre cleared for  cleared for thrusters
aquarius houston
go ahead
roger did you get my go for rcs
thats affirm were go what were doing now jack is letting the spacecraft drift in this mode to pick up the earth again
okay
i dont want to just go blasting around the sky and get high rates because i dont have anything tape 89 to null tho rates on urltl the earth comes back up again and  once i get the erth ill sif hl  we haw no strain on nullint rate that pat of the larththat is 05 3 53 50 cdr its going to be interesting today jack the earths a lot bigger the crescent is a lot more pronounced than it was yesterday
well youre going in the right direction 05 13 5h 10 cdr thats right 05 13 55 27 i24p and jack i guess we havent changed our angle much with respect to the sun 93 million miles away so it ought to be in about the same place in the aot isnt that charlie
tiold1 on that fred ill get an answer for you 05 13 55 54 lm okay
aquarius your asa is warmed up now you can activate the ags 3513 57 26 lmp okay
aquarius houston when you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude what you ought to see is the sun at 12 oclock about halfway between the top of the aot and the center of the pipper and you ought to see the earth  
okay 05 14 o 04 cc   at 6 oclock 05 1io1 07 lmp okay 05 lh o1 41 cdr and its getting a little warmer in here now thank you
duck blinds are always warmer timwhen the birds are flying
right
jack ive gotten so used to flying attitude with the ttca i wont be able to do it normally 05 4 02 56 cc say again jim 1 14 02 59 cii  said  otten so used to lyink tiudo wth th lrusztiona control 1 wont bc lblo to do will lhe aca
aquarius we see your glycol temperature gettin up there if you want to make it a little warmer or you can try putting your suit temp valve to high iiyou havent already got it there
okay
aquarius something were thinking about right now is if we can do it without using a lot of rcs it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alinemert
okay you mean a p527 05 il ll 05 cc were  
ill  around
a combination of 51 and 52
ill see what we can do jack 05 1i ll 18 cc okay and wed planned to use the moon and the sun for that aiiio i  airifjcifijiii vici afiiion 1afe fo c5 14 ll 16 cc aquarius ltouston on panel 16 wed like for you to close the cross tie bal loads breaker pese
okay lts closed
and it looks like we could support a  an aline ment in a few minutes if youd be willing to go ahead with that 05 ih 15 13 cdr jack it sounds good i think from our position here we know where the sun and moon are and its strictly going to be a pitch maneuver but i think we can save some gas ill see what we can do 05 1415 24 cc roger
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
were all set to go are you going to ship us up a refsmmat
yes we are stand by 1 05 11423 09 cdr okay 05 ih 23 25 cdr the sun feels wonderful its shining in the rendezvous window
and aquarius before we can ship you a load well have to have on panel 11 under comm the updata link circuit breaker closed
its closed
roger itll be a few  
 closed  
okay and itll be a ew minutes yet jim were still cranking it up
okay stay with it jack and ill go back to data
roger
i got bat in about 3313 percent on that unk too fast alarm
say again on that fred
i just got another uplink too fast when i took the data switch back off  its happening i guess about a third of the time
roger
aquarius houston were ready with your load if youll give us data please
going to data you got it
aquarius houston after the uplink youll have to set the drift and the refsmat flag as on page 8 of the contingency book steps 5 and 6
page 8 steps 5 and 6 roger 05 14 37 21 iap okay are you done with the computer now jack 05 14 7 24 cc negative well give you the word
roger aquarius were through with it its your computer
thank you
and aquarius houston take option i on a p52 when you get to it and ive got some ball angles for a sun and moon
okay we want an option 1 and youve got some ball angles for sun and moon and right now jim has the sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of aot
and have you got some plan in vectors for us jack
okay fredo for the san ive got 246 for the moon ive got 250
are you talking about ball theta angles
negative i was  i was reporting the code for noun 70 ia702 i i1 41 7 i myr ih ih rrfmtr ird  iii 11 i0 irl j kay
okay  llouton we have the unmarks anill start up at pitch now to go over and pick up the moon
roger 05 4 53 22 cdr houston aquarius
go ahead
just as a note of interest in this dock con figurations for p52s the command module docking probe is right down the middle of  the dockn lght rather is rght down the middle of the detent and when the sun flashes on it really makes it difficult
roger
just like the simulator
yes it was good training
well jack thats what it says the torquing angles are
we havent got them yet
aquarius hold on to torquing angles flease
were doing that
jim the reason for the delay is that were not seeing the data yet were having to check a point here and as soon as they come up well let you know what to do with them
okay we had a large noun 105 of  what  112 and our torquing angles jack are minus 01713 minus 03278 minus 01395
roger minus 01713 and we see them now
aquarius torque them
okay
at 350425 05 15 06 0 cc aquarius do you have a star close by there you could check
ill look around jack i was just trying to get a check on the moon again to see if those angles were indeed true and we got the moon back again and centered
roger
okay jack what youre reading now the angles we had the moon centered and its pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball i guess close enough for any entry that wed like to do
roger and im told that denubla  denebola and regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star check
okay im going to start pitching around again and ill see if i can pick them up i have orion out here to my left a little bit but its pretty close to the  oh here ive got sirius thats a nice one tiow about that
sounds good here
aquarius is jack sitting on the rumble seat there
he was he just headed upstairs to take another look around
okay i got a minor addition to the entry check list for him this time its in the  
okay stand  
  entry book
okay stand by 1 he has that in his pocket
what im doing jack is just  im pitching over now im going to pick up another star sirius was just too far off i thought i was going to use too much gas getting there
roger b rlim il w didrlt law odymy attj ehrd wr ould jut auto  aiji ilriivtfovrir these things 05 15 6 28 cc looks to us lke youve ot her alined jim so i wouldnt worry about it too much
yes im pretty confiaent that the platforms fairly descent
aquarius houston we need an e hod verb 74 when youve got a chance please
okay coming to you
okay jack on your entry checklist on pa 25 down there on step 9 where it says 152 degrees pitch at o5g adjacent to that so that recovery can see you better on the way down we want you to turn your sband power amplifier to high over 05 i5 23 25 cmp okay turn sband power amp to high at o5g time
thats affirmative 05 15 23 49 cml okay is that it
thats it jack
aquarius houston were considering doing the midcourse with pgns lless youd rather do it in ags
no pgns is fine with me i just aline myself up with the old ball again so ive got you foresighted again but any way you want to do it
like you say you might as well go first class
i guess youre right
now wait a minute jack
i just lost a lot of friends there 05 15 35 20 i2p and jack you can tell owen morris that the rcs system ab 2 quad 1 breaker is still nicely in i515 35 52 cc roger well pass the word 05 15 73821 cc aquarius tlouston we think weve figured out a way to save you some time at a very critical  very full schedule and thats by doing a docked coarse aline since we got the lm up now that would save you a maneuver or two
houston aquarius it seemed to me a docked coarse aline might be quicker for  for jack
yes we think it would be and itd save quite a bit of time at a place where youre going to be pretty busy also save you some petrol
affirm 05 15 40 3 cc okay jim were looking at doing this in the service module sep attitude and the optics will be pointed away from the sun so it should be a good attitude for a p52
okay so well be going to the service module sep attitude at which time well do a docked coarse aline and 
then you want  you want jack then to do a p527
the way well do that in our time line jim is to go ahead and do the service module jett and then well just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in our time line as weve outlined to bring the platform up well proceed with the p52  coarse aline and then the p52
okay are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for lm activation in other words i try to maintain an attitude smd give him some angles and then  are you going to give him the angles then he does the 52
basically its the same procedure just reversed jim
okay
another nice thing about this is its one weve done before
and aquarius one thing however that we do not plan to do is to proceed with the command module powerup prematurely patio 0 05 15 42 51 om ioger 05 l5 11257 cdr understand
okay houston this is jack
co ahead jack alohl i  airtojiouni voice traiisciipiion iage 707
okay i just wanted to talk over with you it looks like weve had some changes in the flight plan here due to jims p52 do you have  can you talk over with me what your plans are
roger jack since weve got the pgns up we plan to use that information to give the cmc a dock coarse alone and then were in the service module jettison attitude well wait until it comes time to power up the cmc and well get the cmc a dock coarse aline and well pick some good stars to give you a fine aline with and it looks like we can pick some stars that are looking away from the sun in wlieh you can find in that service module jettison attitude so well save you quite a bit of gas and save you some time in a very busy time 515 46 36 cmp hey that sounds good really fine
keeping warm 05 15 h6 43 cmp hey its warmed up here now its almost com fortable
im looking out the window now jack and that earth is whistling in like a highspeed freight train
were clocking you at b8 000 miles and coming in at about 9000
i dont think theres nany lms that have seen it like this im still ooking for fra mauro and cone crater 05 5 47 38 cc youre going the wrong way son
okay jack it looks  just looking over what i may expect here it locks like im just going to get three angles to do a verb 41 noun 20 right
thats what it looks like from here jack its pretty much the opposite of the lm activation procedure where we do the dock coarse aline
yes except in a way we did a lot of verb 06 noun 20 enters simultaneously and then you all shipped him up posttorque values youre not going to do anything like that are you
say again please jack
okay during the activation part we do a lot of verb 06 noun 20 enters simultaneously reading you out the difference in the angles and then mbfn furnishes the posttorquing angles in order to get the platform fine alined do you plan something like that or just three coarse aline angles
jack were going to give you three coarse aline angles and then you cn go right to your cheek list as were giving it and start in with the verb 40 noun 20
okay rel fine
asldjack how do you ead
fine  square
i was arolmd shooting tictures of all the debris inside here before we left and i inadvertently changed the settings ox the dc command module reseau camera that we need for the service module pictures i wonder if fao can dig them out again  what we need fstop aldspeed
okay fred stand by
fred in regards to the camera settings for blackandwhite 3400 film the settings were f56 at 1250th 0ve
okay id guessed right after all but thank you
aquarius houston ovr
go ahead houston
okay jim i got mcc7 pad when youre ready to copy over
okay stand by
okay were in luck  got one pad left
okay well take care not to change this one ready to go
go ahead joe
mcc7 137394839 llinus 00031 plus all zeros plus 00001 na plus 00205 00031 023 008 359 the rest is na remarks plus four jets rcs and yol weights for the dap load lm weight 25181 csm weight 6268 over

okay readback correct
and aquarius ttouston i have a service module sep pad if you want to copy that now over
say again joe
roger fred i have a service module sep pad with the attitudes you dont need a pad sheet for it just any old blank sheet will do
okay i was going to say i dont  we dont hardly carry a service module sep pad
yes well have to change that 05 6 09 02 lmp okay im using a p27 here go ahead
okay the pad reads as follows and then ill re peat the angles for yo so you can copy them the following mcc7 maneuver the lm to the following fdai attitudes roll 000 pitch 913 yaw 000 now do you want those attitudes re peated fred
okay following mcc7 were to maneuver to the following attitudes roll 000 pitch 0913 yaw 000
okay thats correct and the last part of the pad is at get 1381000 which is ei minus 45 hours execute a push of 05 feet per second four jet plusx perform s sep then execute pull 05 feet per second four jet minusx over
houston aquarius jacks entering the command module now para70 05 i il 48 x oky lira 05 16 1 i lm okay that tjoe was execute at tileget at 1381000 which is eirlinus 412 hours execute a push of 05 feet per second fourjet ullage then execute sm sep followedby a pull of 05 feet per second with respect to a nomenclatlzre on the ttca i think we really need an up of 05 and then a down of 05
thats correct fred
okay aquarius the lt pad i had for you right now is the lm jettison pad similar to the  stand by 1 aquarius
okay aquarius houston request po0 and data for a data load over
you got it
okay and i was about to say the lm jettison pad is similar to the sm sep pad fred when youre ready to copy 05 16 12 l2 lmt jtut about the same nunber of lines 05 16 2 44 cc yes
okay go ahead joe
okay fred prior to 414000 which is ei minus 1 hour maneuver the lm to the following fdai angles roll 130 pitch 125 yaw 0124 the corres ponding csm gimbal angles will be roll 291 pitch 196 yaw 045 and thats the pad over and the computer is yours aquerius 05 16 114 cdr thank you
okay a lm sep pad prior to 1414000 ei minus 1 hour maneuver to folowing attitudes roll 130 pitch 125 yaw 0124 the corresponding csm gimbal angles are o11 291 pitch 196 yaw 045
readback correct
aquarius houston t 7 i 
go ahead joe
okay were so efficient down here that we got m entry pad ready fred do you want to copy that for jack over
stand by ill have tctry to borrow his book from him
roger
can we hold off on that a little bit joe
oh absolutely jim were well ahead i just wanted to let you know that we had it 05 16 6 25 cdr okay i hope that when you send up all those uplinks to jack that you could get them up tc him quicky
were shooting for lesthan 5 minutes
sounds good 05 16 i6 43 lmp and are you still using the computer
thats a negative fred the computer s yours
and fred the computer has your target load in
okay
ttouston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay i just want to clarify one thing on the lm sep pad it appears to me that in my configura tion i could probably use a verb 49 loading in 622 yaw pitch and roll in that order and then being able to fly out at 5018 in roll pitch and yaw is that correct
stand by ill verify it jim
okay joe and while youre doing that ive got a question about the command module checklist
okay jack go ahead with your question
okay either i copied the circuit breaker wrong or  i cant read it comes down just about the  paf712 oh about the 20th one down after panel 276 whore it aycb instientat1on power control 3 and ilopn the next circuit lreaker on panel 5  i  would you give that to me again
roger thats cb essential instrumentation power main b over and its closed
okay i just cant rght  i just cant read trywriting essential instrulventation power main b closed
thats affirmative
acluarius houston
co ahead joe
roger the word we hae is that you cant make a verb 49 maleuver to vhe lm jettison attitude because those are fdai angles we gave you they dont correspond to tht gimbal angles for the load itll have to be a manual maneuver over
okay
and mind out for gimb lock
we will
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
roger were looking ttlm current to see if jack has started his preheat and we havent seen it yet is he doing okay down there
houston jack said hes already started it and he said that in 1 more minute hell be up to 20 minutes
oh roger that
jim houston have him let us know what his test meter reads when hes done
he says that he had a tattery a voltage drop of 2 volts and hell try to look at the test meter for you right now · a6v 717 0 16 112 b5 cc okay 0 16  5j cdll ilt itj jookflll al tltmt ut lhy httmtt bu coming up no far
we copy
do you see a current now houston 05 16 3 28 cc stand by 1 on that jim thats affirmative jim it looks like we are seing one now
okay and thanks for keeping us on it
okay
aquarius homton
go ahead
roger reminder p41 for the rcs burn 05 16 1654 cdr thanks for keeping us honest
we got to protect our jobs jim
weve been dpsing so cng here
yes
okay houston i finished up the maneuvers the auto maneuver in 41bt niyroll and yaw needles seem to be offset pitch is okay
okay jim we copy stand by aquarius houston we recommend pgns mode control to att hold save a little gas and stand by on the error needles
okay
houston aquarius
aquarius houston dis you call
roger joe figured if were going to do this burn in pgns now i ought to give you an update on the contingency book pages 32 33 and 34 be cause the last time we went through this portion we were burning it in acs tae918 ljla 7 4  17 ob 21 c kky  lrd ctltd by wtv bn llkinli about iobly itavir you do il in 5ii we pommend at iai tirrle lhrd you  ylrjalii 1 cjnti in the lie piti 3 procdm tm only over
okay
and aquarius houston
go ahead houston 05 17 06 2h cc roger we recommend that you perform this burn in ags as you did the last midcourse mmaeuver we think it will save gas over
okay joe do you want me to line up the same way we did the last one too
stand by on that 05 17 3657 lmp and joe jack just hsalded me some injector eer atures if yotwant to read these on  so i  plug them in
roger go ahead with those
okay 5 charlie 1405 dogs 37 6 able 35 6 bravo 41 6 charlie 42 6 delta 38
okay copy those fred
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
okay jim our recommendation on this burn is that you maneuver to the bucn attitude in pgns min impulse then do a bodtaxis aline 400 plus 5 followed by h00 plus 0 and then do the burn in ags over
okay now were spinn2ng it with the pgns what you gave us for a pgns attitude is this the wrong one do you want me to just to aline up the earth as i did before in the last midcourse
no we dont want you to do that read me your dai angles and lets compare them with what we have down here pae 75 05 7 09 55 cdr okay youre looking at them in the dsky ive got roll cf847 pitch of about 051 and yaw looking at about b750
okay jim those are very close  i guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit
i plan to do a final trim  auto trim and then a fourjet translation
okay jim for fuel conservation wed prefer you to trim it up min impulse and theres really very little trim required and then go alead and do it ags were on the expected fuel usage but were just being old ladies about it
okay understand m only question joe is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when i did an auto maneuver id tried to go manually to the attitude sldthen went to auto but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all 05 7 11 14 cc roger i havent got an answer on that yet but your attitude looks ve7 close
okay i can take it on 
and houston aquarius im not sure that if i follow and null the needles that will be the proper attitude 05 7 13 02 cc okay stand by 1 jim were talking about it its going to be very close in any event close enough
okay 05 17 lb 16 cc and jim just for yotninformation i have the entry pad i have the landing area weather summary which you probably dont even have to copy but which ill read up to you when youre ready and some stars for jack that im holding for him for later on
okay
and joe jack says ali the injector temperatures he just checked them again and theyre all over 39
that theyre all over 39 now thanks a lot 05 7 3 58 cc you can tell him that its looking good to us they were even happy with the previous ones
okay
and nv only question houston is do you want me to null the pgns needle manually
okay stand by 1 more minute jim
houston aquarius 05 17 16 h9 cc go ahead aquarius
yes i guess the basic question is comparing the balls here and out the window it doesnt look too unreasonable and i guess jim says the coas is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might eyeball but yet the fdai air needles for pgns are showing a full scale left in roll and full scale left in yaw 
okay go ahead
yes it appears if we track those we obviously arent going to be on the attitude that we burned the last midcourse
okay well this attitude we passed you is not quite alined to the tezninator and stand by on this
it should be off about 8 degrees flight apollo 13 airtoground voice transcription tape 92 a fi 7 05 17  i1 cdi ijow you ooirl thorr ioljlorl
oh were getting there jim were  were all agreed that youre almost but not quite in the proper attitude and were just trying to get you one firm recommendation on how to proceed from here
okay i have nulled the null  roll needle and the pitch needle now and im yawed  rolled left now im rolled left about 9 degrees
okay understand the needles are nulled
the yaw isnt but the pitch and roll are
roger that
aquarius tlouston
go ahead
okay heres the big story your attitude really looks quite good except in roll and wed like you to do the following in min impulse pgns wed like you to trim to zero pitch which is about where you are now to 008 degrees in roll which is about 16 degrees from your pres ent roll attitude and to zero degrees in yaw which is about where you are now then wed like you to do the bodyaxis aline 400 plus 5 400 plus 0 pitch and roll to pulse select ags do the burn in ags how does that sound over
okay im rolled the wrong way that is what youre saying right
thats right 05 17 21149 cdr and you know i cant roll in minimum impulse ive got to use ttcas
thats right jim sorry
and you dont want me to automatically trim 5018 i take it
thats affirm jim dont trim 5018
okay
we just want you to cycle on through p41 to get the average g and burn it out
okay 05 7 27 5 cc aquarius houston
go ahead 517 27 54 cc just for your information we see 30 in regis ter 1 we read you up 31 on the pad the actual deltav was 305 and they warned me that it might come out 30 3517 28 11 cdr okay thats a lttle burn
right
aquarius tiouston your attitude looks real good we will give you a mark at 10 minutes to the burn which is in 28 seconds 05 17 29 h6 cdr okay well burn it in ags and use the ags ball
right i was looking at the wrong clock and were a little under 10 minutes now 111 give you a mark at 9 minutes okay
thats fine
aquarius houston we have 10 seconds until 9 minutes to the burn 3 2 1 
mark
nine minutes
very well that agrees with our event timer
okay
okay houston about 3 minutes to go aldwere all squared away
and aquarius houston roger that and were standing by for your bodyaxis aline and your zeroing 404 405 406 going to 470 jage719  17   imi okay yud asked  yud asked me before joe to go 400 jjur 3 whictj  did i assume youve changed lb cript a6afl
okay fred we did tell you to do that awhile ago and it doesnt matter youre looking good
okay
yes it looks like we had a minus 02 bias at 470 were burning
copy that fred
good show aquarius
were tweaking now joe
roger aquarius houston youre good right where you are
okay thats it 05 17 40 49 imp okay if youre happy can we maneuver to service module sep attitude now
thats affirmative aquarius
and im pitching up to the proper attitude
okay were looking at it
and its again necessary to use the ttca to pitch
okay affirmative
aquarius houston
go ahead houston
okay recommend you terminate p41
okay
hey jim have you broken into the medical kit per my recommendation a few hours ago
yes everything is taken care of deke
okay fine you might hit it again in about 2 hours tpe 924 05 17 1755 cdr okay 05 7 50 37 cc aquarius houston aft omni
i beat you to it houston
yes i thought you did but i thought id s it anyway
okay aquarius ttouston that attitude looks pretty good itows jack getting along
hes getting along all set to go and im geing to go into pgns att hold
roger 05 17 506 cc aquarius houston
go ahead
roger again for fuelconsumption reasons wed like you to go back to the ags mode you were in rather than pgns att hold over
okay im in pgns minimum impulse right now while were firing and ill go back to the ags mode 05 17 531 cc okay jim pgns min impulse is okay ags is okay too its your choice
soon as we get rid of the service module joe i think ill be able to maneuver a lot better 05 7 57 42 cc sure thing 05 7 57 48 cdr okay jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings
real fine real fine

aquarius tiouston 05 if o0 11 cr o lead 05 l o0 15 c roger w recommend that you use thc a for the separation msmeuver because wed like to get the proper weight in for the daf before we use the fges again
roger we will stamd by
sm sep
copy that
do you see it jack 05 lj04 26 cc okay aquarius houston i recommend you termi nate average g over
okay ive got her houston 05 18 0ii36 cc beautiful beautiful and for you information jim you be coming up on an rcs caution light for helium no sweat over
and theres one whole side of that spacecraft missing 05 18 0 50 cc is that right
right by the  look out there will you right by the high gain antenna the whole panel is blown out almost from the base to the engine
copy that
yes it looks like it got to the sps bell too houston
think it zinged the sps engine bell huh la6e 122
thats the way it looks unless thats just a dark brown strek its really a mess
okay jim wed like you to get some pictures but we want you to conserve rcs dont make unnecessary maneuvers
and jim houston in particular of course e dont want any translation maneuvers
right on that joe you realize that when i went up to the sm sep attitude i had to use ttca to do it 05 8 06 25 cc thats affirm we know that thats okay
ail right shes drifting right down in front of our windows now ilouston
okay
okay joe im now looking down the sps bell and it looks  looks okay on the inside maybe it is just a streak
okay copy that fred was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what
i think the explosion from what i could see joe had  had stained it i dont knew whether it did any actual deformation or not
okay
man thats unbelievable
and joe looks like a lot of  a lot of debris is just hanging out the side near the sband antenna
roger jim
aquarius houston
go ahead
i know youre busy but when jack gets a chance wed like bat c current and main a voltage in the command module lage723  i i i ch itjrl aquariu  i i 1 i  rdfnd aqljrilj
okay ive pitched up to about 180 degrees now and do you want me to go to the lm sep attitude for his alinement
stand by on that jim 05 18 12 146 cc aquarius llouston 05 18 12 118 cdr go ahead 05 18 2 49 cc roger we want you to go to the service module sep attitude 05 18 2 54 cdr okay
and jim when you have leisure to copy i have your noun 46 and noun 47 dap data load numbers
okay go ahead
okay noun 46 31021 noun 47 plus 25248 and plus 09050 over
roger 31021 plus 25248 plus 09050 05 18 3 ii0 cc thats correct
and now houston do you still think that ags is going to be less expensive than pgns mode 1518 14 33 cc thats affirmative jim
okay im in ags pulse right now its the 
okay we concur
going back to i2sep attitude  or csm sep attitude 05 18 4 53 cc roger that
aquarius houston
stand by jacks on the line and he says that he cant get the computer to go into standby ou ili20 cc okay hlw him tell us what hus  what iloooks at and remind him that he wont see the light he wont see the standby light   05 18 16 31 cm7 okay  
  because its not pcwered 
  joe  
go ahead jack
joe okay i get a flashing 37 i am in program 06 there is no standby light but when i enter i dont get the three balls 62 displayed like im supposed to
okay jack   05 18 6 53 cmp and this  
go ahead  
  and this occurs on both dskys
okay understand were  were thinking about it stand by 1
okay jack houston wed like you to go verb 37 enter 06 enter again over
okay in work
okay
okay houston im back in the service module sep attitude
okay copy that jim looks good do you know whether jack got any pictures out of window 5 was it still fogged up over 05 18 9 09 cdr i dont think so i think he came right down here because i think he saw it first in the  in the lm
okay good deal and whenever you get cleaned up we got the entry pad and the landing area summary for you
okay vance this is jack
go ahead rape929 ij rr  15i il mi lljy i iljt vihp l ljlll06 hfjlll doar brirlg uf itl ihr brjjir 62 jiruay  lut i rlt iciidr it rl iiht ik jrld vrj33 doesnt wok ajther
okay 05 18 19 56 cm its still just a flashing 5025 with a code 00062
okay copy that jack stand by 1
jack houston how long did you hold proceed before you quit on it
well it was varying lengths is it suppose to be a longtime proceed 518 20 56 cc we think it may be jack we think it may be 15 to 20 seconds and our recommendation is that you pro and hold it down for a good period ef time probably half a minute or more and see if the dsky blanks
okay all right i didnt hold it in that long maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest i held it
okay
okay jack just came down the tunnel again and said the computers okay
okay good to hear it and did you ever get that bat c main a reading for us
i guess in the heat of the battle i forgot to to give it to you i guess stand by
okay
bat c current was 2 amps and bat a voltage 302
copy 2 amps 302 and that sounds good to us jim 05 18 o3 26 cc aquarius houston
go ahead tape 9211o 05 j  i cc okay wd lke to have jack wciy thd til yos in 1 are afe and wd lik lo rmilll him to do no further powerup of the csm imtil ei minus 2 plus 30 05 18 23 4 cdr roger he reports that the pyros are safe and were standing by for 0230
okay real good
well i cant say that this week hasnt been filled with excitement
well james if you cant take any better care of a spacecraft than that we might not give you another one hey jim houston you might ask jack while hes down there to take a peek through the telescope and tell us whether he can see any stars over
okay
joe jack tells me that theres still a lot of particles floating around and hes  he cant pick out any constellation that he recognizes so far but it might clear here in a little while
okay understand
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay eecom is looking at that battery amperage that you gave us awhile ago hed like to see it about a half an amp to an amp lower like you to ask jack to just check the circuit breakers and switches that hes pulled in so far and make sure he doesnt have any extra loads on main a specifically the floodlight configuration and his caution and warning circuit breakers and his essential instrumentation power circuit breakers over
okay 518 31 37 cc thanks la77 1 i ii r 11 jky jil tlrlj ljijt ijr ti3rrlrr rut jll lhr lj i ilill  05 8 34 45 cc okay okay we copy that like to have him check the amperage on there see what you have now and give us a voltage reading too
okay will do 05 18 b5 33 cmp okay joe this is jack
go ahead
okay ive been not reading any voltage at all on bat c and the amperage looks like about 2 amps but that could be kind of noiselevel stuff ive got all the floodlights off and i  can you think of anything  i could power dewar to lower main a
okay how about reading the voltage off of main a
okay oh this is ken okay ken it was 302 05 8 36 03 cc 0ksy were checking out the floodlights we gave you actually jack you ought to be able to go ahead and use the lights we gave you theres no reason to sit in the dark aeyre supposed to be coming off of main b and were checking that now
okay its not bad down there were in  got plenty of light but should i be reading the voltage on bat c
jack you should be reading bat c voltage that circuit breaker should be open
okay okay can you think of anything else you want to get turned off to lighten load on main a
okay were perusing that subject right now jack its really not that big a thing just something we wanted to dress up
okay
okay aquarius houston
go ahead  i
say jim as something to try you might have jack turn off the ring ls auto coils which are probably on main a rave him turn those off and take a look at the readings
okay
okay jack has turned off ring 1 that was on main a and hes still reading 302 volts
roger that jim whats his amperage did he read that off
i guess re says its down in the mud its less than 2 amps
down in the mud okay understand that re1est he turn them back on and  okay jim thats the auto coils back on ring 1 in a and when you get that done id like you to copy the entry pad
okay joe standing by to copy the entry pad
okay here we come entry pad midpacific 000153 000 the next two lines will be the get of moonset and the mooncheck attitude 1423817 178 noun 61 minus 2166 minus 16537 067 36211 651 11689 36292 1424040 0028 the next four are na do is 400 0204 0017 0322 0814 33 3531 299 boresight star is sigma libra down 088 left 04 lift vector up comments gdc for entry alinement stars 31 and 23 the roll aline 041 pitch 245 yaw 024 use ems nonexit pattern maintain mooncheck attitude until moonset then go to entry atti tude or track horizon with the 36degree window mark last comment constant g entry is roll right over
entry pad as follows midpac 000153 000 1423817 178 minus 2166 minus 16537 067 36211 651 11689 36292 1424040 0028 next four columns are na do is 400 0204 0017 0322 0814 33 3531 299 zebra libra or something like that beta libra is down 088 left 04 lift vector up gdc entry alined stars 31 33 roll 041 pitch 045 yaw 024 ems nonexit pattern to be used ljfje13 mainbair moorchck atlitudc trllt moozlct and if al1 else is lost thc constant g entry is right  roll is right
okay roger that jim i want to verify a couple of things im not sure i heard you read back the first one was zebra libra laughter thats sigma libra the set stars 31 and 23 did you get that over
okay no i had 31 and 33 and i got sigma libra now and itll be 31 and 23 for the set stars
okay and your gdc pitch aline i wasnt sure whether that was  whether you read back 245 or 045 the correct number is 245 over
good show because i have 045 down 245
okay and the moon check here unlike the horizon check is on the 36degree window mark all the way just wanted to repeat that
moon check on 30degree window mark
thats 36degree window mark jim
three six roger
okay readback correct and aquarius houston if you want me to read you the landing area summary ill do that
sounds good
okay in the midpacific landing area the weather is good the cloud cover is 2000 scattered visibility 10 winds 060 at 10 wave heights are 4 feet and the altimeter 2986 if you care scattered showers less than 10 percent of the area recovery forces are as follows the iwo jima will be at the touchdown point the aircraft call sign will be recovery 1 on station with swimmers on board the  we have the constant g backup reentry area covered with the uss hall the good liberty ship and the other recovery aircraft whose call signs you may hear are samoa rescue c130s tate 9214 pa9 31  t  i 11 kly linc w haw th iwo lima il ltl priln rcovcry ill 05 18 it734 cc thats correct
joe jack tells me he is still having trouble looking through the optics im just going to pitch up a little bit more here to see if he can get into the dark spot
okay real fine you might tell him when we get to that point we have some  some stars with corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case the computer doesnt happen to point him straight at one and its the summer triangle
and are you tracking us and do you have any results on that last midcourse
stand by it looks good ill try and get you numbers aiollo 13 airtotrouiivoice titnsciilion pae 731 1518 52 14 cd it feels nic to use the hand controller again
go ahead aquarius
i just said joe it feels nice to use the hand controller again
oh roger that fid0 says hes got you nailed within a half a foot per second the midcourse looked real good
okay
and ive got two things wed like jack to do in the command module to ease the load on main a one of them is to verify or turn the cmrcs heater switch to off were done with that and even though the circuit breakers are pulled the switches might be drawing a little current and the second one is wed like him to turn scs logic power 23 to off we dont need it now its called up in the checklist at the appropri ate time and wed like him to turn that off over
okay ill tell jack to check that the cmrcs heater switch is off and if not well turn it off and also to turn off the scs logic power 23 switch off since it comes up later in the checklist
thats correct
houston aquarius were recording main a volt age up to 310
roger thats 310 were smiling
houston aquarius
go aquarius
okay how about if i hold a pitch attitude of about 115 instead of about 91 i think jack can use the optics a little bit better at that angle
jim thats perfectly okay with us if it looks good for stars 05 8 59 35 cdr tiejust ooked at them briefly il o down nd look at them a little bit better here
okay with the new attitude our shaft and trun nion angles we were going to pass him dont mean anything but its more important to have a good star field
aquarius houston
go ahead
okay jim we  weve been talking about your going to a different atitude than the pad atti tude for better star field vision out the command module and what wed like to have you do is this if you can predict now or sometime soon what attitude it is that you would like to hold at that time and go to that attitude now wed like to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal angles for the csm and we can do that if you go to the selected attitude hold it call up a verb 06 noun 20 and read us your lm gimbal angles we can take those and compute csm coarse aline gimbal angles on the assumption that when we get back into the csm coarse aline you will return to that selected attitude does that sound okay over
yes ill try to hold the attitude we select directly while youre giving us the coarse aline attitude were not too sure what  whats the best attitude im going to ask jack again if 115 is sufficient for him
okay you can take some time figuring out the best attitude and then you wont have to hold it all the way from now until then if you just get back to it 05 19 2 58 cdr houston jack would like to know what constella tions are in his sextant or scanning telescope field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch zero roll zero yaw can you give that to us
okay well sure give it a go as i said we  we have some stars theyre not  theyre not centered with the shaft and trunnion zero let us take a quick look at 105 pitch shaft and trunnion zero and see if we can get you an answer ff iu i  fi aqllrill llollill 5 li lb b flll 0 ahcjl 05 19 13 5 cc roger these  none of these stars will be exactly centered but at a pitch attitude of 115 we had computed that vega altair rasalhague and deneh would all be in the telescope field of view and the first three were also in view at the 91degree pitch so he should be able to see one or more of those four stars over
okay thank you very much
okay and jim i can give shaft and trunnions if  if hes interesteb
okay why dont you give us the shaft and trl nion for  say altair at 115 and ill go up there and ill see if he can pick it up
okay real fine at 115 degrees of pitch altair shaft 274 trunnion 222 over
roger shaft is 274 trunnion 222
thats affirm
aquarius houston
go ahead joe
okay jim in the lm there we have  we show battery 3 only drawing about an amp and we think its probably time to get it off the line bat tery 3 to offreset over
battery 3 is offreset 05 19 6 12 cc okay
just bows our power consumption houston just out of curiosity
ill verify it jim im sure its okay
okay aquarius houston with the present amount of power youve got in the i24which is over 500 amphours and the rate youre using them we figure youve got anost 12 hours of power left 05 19 7 04 cdr twelve hours huh we could reenter with it
thats affirm
thats enough for two touchandgoes and a full stop jim
thats right joe if you could dig a crater like cone crater i could might hit it
laughter okay
jack reports that he thinks he can see altair
very good
liesays he thinks he can see altair 05 19 17 t4 cc okay ill take back the very but ill leave the good
houston aquarius i
aquarius houston go
i ran back there to take a look and see what i could see in the  in the scanning telescope it looks pretty grim back there right now it might be that we have to go with the coarse aline and maybe computation of some fine aline docking angles if we have time
okay wed like to do that too wait a minute stand by jim
aquarius houston how do you read
i read you loud and clear 519 23 32 cc okay what wed like to do jim is  well go ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal angles that  that youre going to be holding for us and well get the platform up and then when you call p52 and you use picapar it prob ably wont be close enough to put the star in the sextant but if you can see any kind of a bright star in the general vicinity  and like general vicinity i mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center of the telescope so that you have some clue as to which way to go then the identifica tion problem shouldnt present much of a  of a  3 dilliculty and once you get tl thin5 il th sextant thon you earl go ahead and treat il ilk any other icapar
that sounds great ken one little problem theres all sorts of bright objects floating around us and also that just staring at part of aquarius its just reflecting light like mad we can give it a try theres no problem there if we can see it well get it
okay and in  in the event that that doesnt work were standing by with the original scheme a set of lm fdai angles to fly to thatll point the command module optscs at the moon and the sun so we can always go back to that
okay 519 25 10 cc and aquarius houston wed like you to verify the suit relief valve to closed over
stand by its closed
okay
okay houston aquarius
aquarius houston go
well go with your original 91degree angle if you have the stars figured out and the coarse aline angle for it
okay roger that jim then at  at your con venience here wed like you to go to that atti tude as close as you can get and call up a noun 20 for us
okay in work now
okay
houston aquarius
go ahead aquarius
okay i take it that if  if jack cannot see stars at this attitude after you give him the coarse aline angles were just not going to j pat 736 rad dowrl 1yu mr imhl lhlj arid hlvo you iiur ul r irll lrlgl ir jzek bul you wlrjt him to do riiitrig on the moor and the sun i that correct
thats roughly correct jim jack will coarse aline at that attitude this is what were hav ing you maneuver to the  to that attitude for were going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles and pass them up to him and the first thing hell do when he gets there per his checklist is to coarse aline his platform then hell go into the p52 and if he cant see stars we will quickly pass up to you the  your fdai angles to put him in the moonview attitude and hell do his p52 on the moon and then have you maneuver on the sun and complete the p52 of the sun
okay but im going to have to maneuver to the moon to help him out
oh thats  thats affirmative if he cant see stars at the  at the sep attitude that  that youll be holding youll have to maneuver to the moon attitude and then to the sun attitude for him
aquarius houston
go ahead
just like to mention that even if for some reason we run out of time or something and dont complete the moonsun p52 jack will have a platform coarse aline to the entry refsmmat which we feel will be plenty good enough
roger thats my feelings too 05 19 348 cc okay
aquarius houston
hello there houston
hi jim we  weve gone ahead and computed the csm coarse aline gimbal angles based on your being at the service module sep attitude at the time that jack cranks up the computer and  and coarse alines the imu that is we assume that age737 youre going to be at roll 0 pitch 091 yaw 0 and if you concur on that id like to pass up the angles for  for yackto have
okay ill be there to the best of my ability
good show you ready to copy
go ahead
okay csm coarse aline angles roll plus 29895 pitch plus 27130 yaw plus 00020
okay the command module angles will be roll 29895 pitch 27130 and yaw 00020
thats affirmative and thats for his verb 4 noun 20 when he gets there
aquarius houston over
go ahead ttouston aquarius here
okay jim were getting about 9 minutes from the commencement of command module powerup and we wanted to just mention to you for jacks benefit that although the batteries are looking real good in case theyre cool and have a little difficulty hacking the load just at first wed like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts or above during the powerup procedure and if it falls below well have a couple of circuit breakers for him that  that will solve the prob lem
okay and i take it youre also monitoring main bus voltage
negative not in the command module at this time because we dont call up telemetry until a little bit later on
ah so thats right i forgot okay i will tell him
thank you

 unable to read any bat b voltage we do have current  though on bat b
okay copy that fred
why dont you check
youre looking good on the ground odyssey
okay
and i think the reason you dont read voltage is its a circuit breaker that we have called as being out
all right
odyssey houston the uplink is going well we have one more load to get in
okay real fine
is the computer mine now joe 05 20 39 3 cc stand by 1 second
okay jack wed like the verb 74 enter and itll take less than a minute for emod dump

and odyssey ttouston the computer is yours you can press on
okay
houston aquarius
aquarius houston go ahead
roger he just did the coarse aline im going to the jettison attitude
copy that
aquarius houston i copied that you  that hes completed the coarse aline hes going into the p52 now is that right
let me check i think he is
okay youre staying at your present attitude arent you
yes well  ill stay in the present attitude
roger that
okay houston i got a 220 alarm here 
roger that
odyssey houston have you set the drift light and the refsmmat light over
odyssey houston
 flag
you were noisy i didnt copy have you set the drift and refsmmat flag
okay joe i dont have a star in the sextant im going to hunt for it in a minute
roger that jack
okay joe can you give me any stars that i might try here
thats affirmative vega and altair should be good vega is 36 altair is 40
okay well give that a try
okay and you might look for them in the tele scope if theyre not in the sextant right off they should be close to the crosshairs
okay i got all that material thats venting from the bottom of the command module
roger that
i have an rcs light houston
okay jim thats the one we warned you about some time ago low helium no sweat
oh okay
okay houston theres a star angle difference with stars 36 and 40
how about that baby
an odd maneuver houston
roger that copy youre maneuvering to the lm jett attitude is that right 05 20 52 58 cml thats affirm 
thats affirm
im going to torque those gimbal angles 05 20 5b 05 cc torque them babe full stroke gimbal
there it is okay ill do a star check
okay 05 0 53 27 cc okay odyssey youre suddenly ahead of the time line
odyssey ttouston request 0mni bravo 05 20 5h 06 cmp i am omni bravo jim
okay
okay houston the sextant star check passes
say again jack
i did a star check and it passes it puts that star right in the telescope
good enough you can ress on in the checklist jack
find out lm gimbal lock jim
its the command modules gimbal lock im worried about
laughter okay
aquarius houston
go ahead
roger if you concur we would be inclined to re commend that you go to ags for the maneuver because youll have to be there later on anyway
okay 05 20 55 13 cc and ags pulse is the recommendation
were having trouble maneuvering joe without getting it in gimbal lock
okay you can 
you picked a lousy attitude though to separate
well we apologize just take your time jim weve got time now
okay
houston why carat i stay in pgns att hold for the lm attitude hold
stand by on that jim
aquarius houston over
go ahead
okay our recommendation is that you stay in a for the lm jtt simply because we ye thought it through weve got the right deadbands and all set up over
okay its a lot easier for me to maneuver in pgns joe than it is gs
yes you can maneuver in pgns jim im sorz i thought you were talking about the att hold and the lm jett afterward you can maneuver in pgns if you want to
i want to get way over here joe to prevent him into gimbal lock i have the yaw at about  id say about almost 50 degrees
roger that just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45degree isnt critical  the out of plane that is
odysseys houston request 0mni charlie
okay going omni charie
thank you 05 20 59 12 cm there
okay good
roger thats verb 46 roger aquarius houston
go ahead
okay jim the particular dap configuration we have set up now is using more fuel than wed like out of system b wed like you to reconfigure the dap to 30021 over 05 2 00 57 cc thank you
odyssey houston 0 2 0 l  cml go jjlead
wed like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again and we would like to have you check the rcs ring 1 and 2 temps for us over
optics power going off
okay
okay joe our ring 1 is 50 ring 2 is plus 42 05 2 2 09 cc ring 1 is 50 copy what was tileother
42
got it thank you
okay houston aquarius i am at the lm sep attitude and im planning on bailing out
okay i cant think of a better idea jim

okay good deal jack let me mention something about the hatch integrity check youre going to vent the tunnel until you get a 3psi deltap that should take 9 or 0 minutes and its our firm feeling that you dont have to wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check if it holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets down there you know youve got a good hatch over
okay copy that
okay
