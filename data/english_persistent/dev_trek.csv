dialogue
youre forgetting it was seska who rewrote the scenario for all we know shes programmed captain janeway to betray us
i suppose you have a better idea
the safest course of action is to avoid participation of any kind eventually the real captain will discover our predicament and shut down the programme from the outside
lets move
hold it right there
back off
or what youll shoot us go right ahead
whatever you say
poor kathryn i guess nobody told her the phaser rifles from storage locker three have been malfunctioning
youre an incredible woman seska
you see whos in charge now dont you so if i were you id get moving again the programmes not over
we have no intention of participating in this exercise
you dont want to end up like your captain do you
you programmed all this the malfunctioning phaser the version of chakotay whos attracted to you none of its real
you hear that he thinks this is a game show him hes wrong
ive been waiting a long time for this
next time youll believe me when i tell you the safety protocols are off now youve got five seconds to start running again or youll end up with more than a flesh wound
so much for not playing along with seskas programme
are you able to continue
ill keep up the question is where are we going
i have an idea
whats the point this isnt the real sickbay
i may be able to use some of this holographic equipment to treat your wound besides its as good a place as any to hide from seska
please state the nature of the medical emergency
no emergency doc im fine
nonsense you have seconddegree phaser burns please have a seat on biobed one
thats all right doc im telling you i feel fine
you require treatment twenty ccs nitric acid a little proverbial salt in the wound
youre looking well
go
im not going to leave you
it was a pleasure treating you dont hesitate to call again
are you all right mister paris
oh just great maybe we can go to the mess hall now and let the holographic neelix burn my arm with a frying pan
your feeble attempt at wit notwithstanding it does appear that seska has reprogrammed the holographic crew to torture us i suggest we avoid meeting any more of them
seska to tuvok i know you can hear me
oh terrific
i just wanted to remind you that wherever you go ill find you
i say we try the jefferies tubes
i concur
captain youre not going to believe this but seska caused these cascade failures
seska how
what she lacked in loyalty she made up for in ingenuity according to the backup computer logs she got into tuvoks scenario on stardate 48671 about a month before she left the ship she programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time tuvok reopened the narrative parameters file which he didnt do until today
can we get them out
seska laid boobytrapped subroutines everywhere if we try to open the holodeck doors the power grid is rigged to explode
and the transporters are still offline
you said the narrative parameters file is open now
seskas revised programme is playing out as we speak
if seska can rewrite tuvok maybe i can rewrite seska
so tuvok anything in the dictates of poetics about how to escape from a ship full of insane holograms
your attempts at humour are hardly constructive mister paris
the controls are jammed i cannot close the hatch
tuvok
where do you suppose this came from
that is an intriguing question
do you think seskas toying with us taking us to the brink of death again then letting us live so she can keep torturing us
i prefer a more optimistic interpretation it is possible our shipmates outside the holodeck have learned of our predicament and have found a way to help us by making additions to the programme such as that plasma extinguisher
if you want to look on the bright side im certainly not going to argue with you
if they do know whats going on why just hand us a plasma extinguisher why not shut down the hologrid or change the scenario
i would imagine seska has made it very difficult for anyone to implement more than minor changes
take a look at this
you were right
we must follow their instructions
hello boys
what do you say we go for a little walk
where did they come from
seskas programme is adding new algorithms to counteract the changes were making
i need more access to the narrative subroutines
i cant get in
youd better find a way otherwise tom and tuvok arent going to make it out of there alive it looks like chakotays taking them to the holographic cargo bay
torres to kim how are you coming
with those transporters
seskas programme has completely disabled the relay access ports
its going to take a while to get tom and tuvok out of there
i guess that means i keep writing
as you can see the last of your comrades have been captured in case anybody had any doubts it should be obvious by now that this is no longer a starfleet vessel
bring paris and tuvok over here you and you bring your weapons
what are you doing
what do you think im doing im going to execute them right here
i need access to the character algorithms now
im on it
fire on my order
belay that
what are you doing we planned this
im not sure its necessary to kill them
if im not mistaken the chakotay hologram is undergoing some sort of character change
do you think theyre trying to help us again
these two rodents betrayed us they deserve to die
dont listen to her commander youve taken the ship there is no need to add murder to your list of offences
quiet
lower your weapons
its working
now if i can just keep modifying the chakotay hologram
youre not going to lose your nerve are you
we have what we want theres no reason to kill them
prepare to fire on my order
seska im in command of this operation
not anymore
i dont believe it the programme is reconfiguring the subprocessors to counter every change we make no matter what we do it rewrites itself so that tom and tuvok will die
im not out of ideas yet
now is there anyone else who wants to challenge my authority isnt their loyalty inspiring set your phasers to kill
dont listen to her
fire on my order
what the hell was that
dont move seska
bridge to seska were under attack by the rukani
the rukani
the people the captain and i were visiting while you were busy taking over the ship when we realised there was a mutiny in progress we called them for a little assistance
harry have you got transporters yet
still working on it captain
youre not getting this ship back
that is a rather bold statement for someone in your position
computer initiate sixty seconds selfdestruct sequence authorisation zeta one
this ship will selfdestruct in sixty seconds
computer belay that order authorisation tuvok four seven seven four
unable to comply voiceprint not recognised
if you dont hand over that phaser rifle everyone on this ship is going to be dead in
selfdestruct in forty five seconds
i dont know how she rigged it captain but when she ordered the selfdestruct it initiated an overload in the holodeck power relays the whole grid is going to blow
selfdestruct in thirty seconds
hand over the weapon or the ship is going to be destroyed
i have set this phaser to kill if you do not deactivate the selfdestruct sequence i will fire
im surprised at you tuvok thats not very logical if im dead wholl turn off the selfdestruct
fifteen seconds to selfdestruct thirteen twelve eleven ten nine
computer terminate selfdestruct sequence authorisation zeta one
selfdestruct sequence has been terminated
now call off your rukani friends
do what she says
tuvok
thats an order mister paris
paris to the rukani vessel thank you for your assistance but everythings under control now
it is isnt it i guess if you want something done right youve got to do it yourself
not bad
seskas not the only one who knows how to cause a phaser malfunction
the holographic simulation has ended
its over
kim to engineering i think i can give you transporters now captain
thats all right harry no rush
heres to stories with happy endings
i must say captain causing the alien ship to come to our aid was a very effective plot development
who says deus ex machina is an outdated literary device
im just glad you didnt come down with a case of writers block
so you two are going to have to come up with a new idea for your next literary collaboration
what about doing a western
or a detective story
i dont care what kind of story it is as long as im not the bad guy this time
ive got a great idea for a holonovel about a daring trader who becomes a cook on a starship eventually he rises
mister neelix if mister paris and i do create another work of holofiction i assure you we will choose a subject much less close to home
the cardinal is a thief i delivered two portraits of his mindless nephew more than three months ago to be depicted in the heroic mode of an hercules or an achilles so specified our contract i complied making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than nature ever intended an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles and what have i the divine leonardo da vinci received in payment
the cardinals eternal gratitude
essatto in other words signorina less than nothing
all the more reason why you should accept my proposal
money is beside the point signorina catarina is it
yes im only asking for a corner one bench a place to work on my own projects paintings sculptures just being here in your company is inspiring to me
flattery catarina is also beside the point besides i prefer my solitude scusi
meraviglioso
what will you call it
the arm of hephaestos
the god of the forge
every blacksmith who has ever swung a hammer will thank me for this creation
someone once said all invention is but an extension of the body of man
do not think that just because i have enjoyed your visit today that i am prepared to turn my workshop into a travellers inn
che cazzo
here let me help you
you will get your hands covered with goose grease
its good for the skin
let us see if we can find his big brother hopefully he will be stronger
this looks like a flying machine
i though that because my imagination took flight so easily my body could do the same i was wrong
its this flapping approach you designed your machine to mimic the way a bat or a sparrow flies
yes yes so
so what if you based it on the hawk instead
the hawk a creature that glides through the air
essatto
we will design a new machine and you catarina will help me fly it
ill need someplace to work
a corner one workbench
that will be fine
ten scudi per week and you provide your own materials
seven and i might need to borrow a few things on occasion
then we have an agreement
chakotay to janeway
go ahead
captain we need you in engineering theres something here you should see
on my way computer end programme
what have you got
some bad news the long range probe we sent out two months ago has stopped transmitting
at first i thought it was a problem with the communications grid then i cleared up the last few seconds of telemetry take a look at this
this could be it captain borg space
we dont know exactly how many vessels are out there but their space appears to be vast it includes thousands of solar systems all borg we are no doubt entering the heart of their territory theres no going around it but there may be a way through it
before the probe was disabled it picked up a narrow corridor of space devoid of borg activity weve nicknamed it the northwest passage
unfortunately the passage is filled with intense gravimetric distortions probably caused by a string of quantum singularities
better to ride the rapids than face the hive
exactly were going to set a course for that corridor and go into full tactical alert where do we stand with weapons
i have reprogrammed the phaser banks to a rotating modulation but i suspect a borg vessel will adapt quickly
we can use every edge ensign
ive already configured the long range sensors to scan for transwarp signatures an early warning system
good work doctor how are you coming on the medical front
ive analysed every square millimetre of the borg corpse we recovered three months ago im closer to understanding how their assimilation technology works and i might be able to create some sort of medical defence
redouble your efforts this is your top priority neelix i doubt we can resupply the ship any time soon
no problem sir im working on a plan to extend our food and replicator rations
we have to act fast the borg have captured one of our probes they know were out here well do everything in our power to avoid a direct confrontation but if and when we do engage the borg im confident that well be ready i have faith in each and every one of you lets do it
ensign on the double
coming through open
i want to cut down on the time it takes to seal off the decks
in case we take on some uninvited guests
exactly and i want to increase the magnitude of the forcefields
these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process once inside the skin they release a series of nanoprobes into the bloodstream
maybe we can develop some kind of protective shielding against them
unlikely the tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy or energy field which means our battle must be waged inside the body itself
they take over the blood cell functions like a virus
which suggests to me that we should try to enhance the immune system create an assimilation antibody as it were i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes but we might be able to slow them down lets try a submicron dissection on the probes weve collected so far see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism
kes is something wrong kes
i saw borg
youve had a telepathic experience
there were bodies dozens of them dead
hows kes
unsettled and uncertain over the past two hours she has experienced several telepathic visions about the death of borg and the destruction of voyager
some sort of premonitions
possibly
we cant just ignore her intuition but i see no reason to alter our plan tuvok i want you to keep an eye on her
captain long range sensors are picking up transwarp signatures five point eight light years distant closing from behind
red alert
evasive manoeuvres
whats happening
weve dropped out of warp
bridge to engineering whats going on down there
im not sure captain some kind of subspace turbulence is preventing us from creating a stable warp field
turbulence is increasing
im reading two borg vessels make that three four no five fifteen borg vessels distance two point one light years and closing
shields to maximum stand by all weapons
theyre in visual range
on screen
my god
captain
im picking up a polaron beam were being scanned
think good thoughts
the last cube has rejoined the others
did we sustain any damage
no shields held warp engines are coming back online all primary systems are stable
stand down red alert harry maintain a long range sensor lock on that borg armada they seemed to be in quite a hurry didnt they id like to know what theyre up to
yes maam
ill take this nearmiss as a good omen resume our course mister paris
if we needed any more evidence that weve entered borg space i think we just got it
ill be in my ready room
yes come in
weve just completed the latest sensor sweep so far so good the northwest passage is still clear of borg activity
id like to see a tactical update
according to my calculations neither of us has eaten since last night join me for dinner
no thanks im not hungry and ive got a lot of work to do
i see
ive been looking through the personal log entries of all the starfleet captains who encountered the borg ive gone over every engagement from the moment q flung the enterprise into the path of that first cube to the massacre at wolf 359 every battle every skirmish anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the collective
and
in the words of jeanluc picard in their collective state the borg are utterly without mercy driven by one will alone the will to conquer they are beyond redemption beyond reason and then theres captain amasov of the endeavour it is my opinion that the borg are as close to pure evil as any race weve ever encountered whats so funny
nothing
youre smiling obviously ive said something amusing
you sounded just like amasov
what
just now while you were reading his log you were using his inflections
i did not
yes you were and before that you were doing a pretty good picard
was i
its nothing to be ashamed about echoing the greats ensign hickman in astrophysics does a passable janeway
if we manage to survive the next few days im going to have a little chat with ensign hickman imitating the captain huh surely that violates some kind of starfleet protocol this day was inevitable we all knew it and weve all tried to prepare ourselves for the challenge ahead but at what point is the risk too great at what point do we come about and retreat to friendly territory could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant i keep looking to all these captains my comrades in arms but the truth is im alone
if that moment comes well face it together and well make the right decision youre not alone kathryn
three years ago i didnt even know your name today i cant imagine a day without you
captain janeway to the bridge
gentlemen
something strange is going on
the power signatures of those borg vessels have terminated
all of them
theyre dead in the water about five point two light years from here
cause
unknown
mister paris
captain
set a course for their position warp two
were approaching the ships
slow to impulse on screen
lifesigns
a few but theyre erratic
captain im detecting two residual weapons signatures in the debris one is borg the other is of unknown origin
who could do this to the borg
someone more powerful than the borg its hard to imagine
but they did it fifteen cubes we mightve just found our ticket through borg space an ally
lets not jump to conclusions scan the vicinity for other vessels
there are none
hold on im picking up some sort of bioreadings theyre coming from the outer hull of one of the borg ships
lets see it magnify mister kim
its definitely organic but our sensors cant penetrate its surface
send a standard greeting
no response
this could be a spacedwelling organism or a biological weapon
id like to know what kind of weapon could destroy the borg can we beam it away from the ship
i cant get a lock on it
tractor beam
no effect
whatever that thing is its impervious to our technology
tuvok are you reading an atmosphere in the cube
affirmative
commander chakotay i want you to take an away team inside try to get a short range scan of the biomass
there are still borg lifesigns but theyre unstable
well keep an open comlink and an active transporter lock well pull you out of there at the first sign of trouble
tuvok harry youre with me
this way
lower your phasers if we dont appear threatening they should ignore us
looks like theyre a little preoccupied
the alien bioreadings are getting stronger were close
commander
curious
thats not the word i had in mind
those bodies are reminiscent of one of the premonitions kes described
didnt kes say we were all going to die
lets keep moving
it looks like the biomass dissolved right through the borg hull
this borg is attempting to assimilate it
doesnt look like hes having much luck
theres a chamber beyond this opening forty meters wide high concentrations of antimatter particles it looks like a warp propulsion system of some kind
its a ship
starfleet has encountered species that use organicbased vessels the breen for example
there doesnt seem to be anybody on board chakotay to voyager
go ahead commander
captain weve found an entrance to the biomass we think it may be a ship of some kind permission to go inside
granted
harry thats a borg distribution node see if you can download their tactical database it might contain a record of what happened here
aye sir
tuvok
they seem to be organic conduits theyre carrying electrodynamic fluid
maybe an energy source
maybe this looks like a binary matrix but its laced with neuropeptides could be their version of a computer core
this damage was caused by a borg disrupter beam the wall appears to be regenerating itself commander
kes
harrys in danger
what are you
get them out of there
sickbay to janeway
commander
theres someone in here with us and its not the borg i cant localise it but its within twenty metres
perhaps the pilot has returned
voyager to away team
go ahead
stand by for transport were getting you out of there
good idea
energise
i cant get a lock on them
whats the problem
it looks like bioelectric interference from whatevers coming toward them
its within seven metres lets get out of here
narrow the confinement beam
no effect im going to try a skeletal lock
what
i think i can get a clean lock on the minerals in their bone tissue i just came up with it but i think it might work
the lifeforms five metres away and closing
from where
ive got them
a skeletal lock huh well have to add that one to the transporter manual
captain the bioship is powering up like its charging some kind of weapon
mister paris get us out of here maximum warp
the alien ship is not pursuing
kes
i could hear its thoughts the pilot of the bioship was trying to communicate with me theyre a telepathic species ive been aware of them for some time now the premonitions captain its not the borg that we should be worried about its them
what did it say to you
it said the weak will perish
the infection is spreading what began with a few stray cells contaminating the chest wound is now infusing every system in his body
it looks like hes being transformed in some way
not exactly the alien cells are consuming his body from the inside out in essence mister kim is being eaten alive
hes still conscious doctor
i tried giving him a sedative but it was rejected immediately in fact every treatment ive tried has been neutralised within seconds these are alien cells each one contains more than a hundred times the dna of a human cell its the most densely coded life form ive ever seen even i would need years to decipher it
they have an extraordinary immune response anything that penetrates the cell membrane chemical biological technological its all instantly destroyed thats why the borg cant assimilate them
resistance in this case is far from futile nevertheless i believe borg technology holds the key to saving mister kim
how so
i hope to unleash an army of modified borg nanoprobes into his bloodstream designed to target and eradicate the infection as you know ive been analysing the nanoprobes theyre efficient little assimilators one cant help but admire the workmanship but theyre no match for the alien cells so i successfully dissected a nanoprobe and managed to access its recoding mechanism i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells that way the probe can do its work without being detected observe the alien cells are completely oblivious to probe until its too late unfortunately ive only created a few prototypes ill need several days to modify enough nanoprobes to cure ensign kim
does harry have several days
i wish i knew
fight it harry thats an order
weve analysed the borgs tactical database they refer to these new aliens as species 8472
over the past five months the borg have been attacked by them on at least a dozen occasions each time the borg were defeated swiftly
the collective has very little information about the species
is anything known about where they come from
im afraid so
get the captain
the northwest passage
its clear of borg activity for a very good reason
im picking up one hundred and thirty three bioships more are appearing
from where
they seem to be coming from a quantum singularity
im localising the gravimetric distortions
on screen
kes anything
yes i can hear them theyre in a place where theyre alone nothing else lives there
some kind of parallel universe
i dont know i feel malevolence a cold hatred the weak will perish its an invasion they intend on destroying everything
tom reverse course maximum warp take us five light years out and hold position
aye captain
maintain red alert commander
that moment we spoke about its here any thoughts
just one flying into that corridor would mean certain death
agreed the northwest passage is no longer an option so now the choice is between facing the borg in their space or finding ourselves a nice planet here in the delta quadrant and giving up on ever getting home
wed be turning around but we wouldnt be giving up we may find another way home
im not ready to walk onto that bridge and tell the crew were quitting i cant do it chakotay not yet there must be an alternative
kathryn you havent slept in two days try getting some rest and clearing your head were safe for the moment we can tell the crew tomorrow if we have to
see you in the morning
maestro leonardo
catarina buona sera
am i disturbing you
what do you see
a wall with candlelight reflecting on it why what do you see
a flock of starlings the leaves of an oak a horses tail a thief with a noose around his neck and a wall with the candlelight reflecting on it there are times catarina when i find myself transfixed by a shadow on the wall or the splashing of water against a stone i stare at it the hours pass the world around me drops away replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination a way to focus the mind sit and tell me why you have come
theres a path before me the only way home and on either side mortal enemies bent on destroying each other if i attempt to pass through them ill be destroyed as well but if i turn around that would end all hope of ever getting home and no matter how much i try to focus my mind i cant see an alternative
when ones imagination cannot provide an answer one must seek a greater imagination there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer i must deliver a bronzetto to the monks at santa croce come with me catarina hey we will awake the abbot visit the chapel and appeal to god
somehow i dont think thats going to work for me but there is an alternative i havent considered what if i made an appeal to the devil
an alliance with the borg
more like an exchange we offer them a way to defeat their new enemy and in return we get safe passage through their space in developing a treatment for harry the doctor has found a way to attack the aliens at a microscopic level
its still in the experimental stages captain ive only made a few prototypes
nevertheless if we teach the borg how to modify their own nanoprobes theyd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the aliens
in theory yes
belanna its clear from the borg database that they know practically nothing about species 8472
thats right the borg gain knowledge through assimilation what they cant assimilate they cant understand
but we dont assimilate we investigate and in this case thats given us an edge weve discovered something they need
but the borg arent exactly known for their diplomacy how can we expect them to cooperate with us
normally the answer would be no but if what ive learned from the aliens is true the borg are losing this conflict
in one regard the borg are no different than we are theyre trying to survive i dont believe theyre going to refuse an offer that will help them do that
what makes you think the borg wont attempt to take the information by assimilating voyager and its crew
that wont get them anywhere doctor youre the only one on board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications i want you to transfer all of that research into your holomatrix
certainly
youre my guarantee if the borg threaten us in any way well simply erase your programme but it wont come to that doctor its in the collectives own interest to cooperate voyager is only one ship our safe passage is a small price to pay for what were offering in exchange belanna assist the doctor with his transfer
aye captain
mister paris locate the nearest borg vessel and lay in a course they shouldnt be difficult to find
yes maam
dismissed
you were awfully quiet
i didnt want the others to hear this but i think what youre proposing is too great a risk
how so
theres a story i heard as a child a parable and i never forgot it a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river wondering how to get to the other side suddenly he saw a fox he asked the fox to take him on his back across the river the fox said no if i do that youll sting me and ill drown the scorpion assured him if i did that wed both drown so the fox thought about it and finally agreed so the scorpion climbed up on his back and the fox began to swim but halfway across the river the scorpion stung him as the poison filled his veins the fox turned to the scorpion and said why did you do that now youll drown too i couldnt help it said the scorpion its my nature
i understand the risk and im not proposing that we try to change the nature of the beast but this is a unique situation to our knowledge the borg have never been so threatened theyre vulnerable i think we can take advantage of that
even if we do somehow negotiate an exchange how long will they keep up their end of the bargain it could take months to cross borg territory wed be facing thousands of systems millions of vessels
but only one collective and weve got them over a barrel we dont need to give them a single bit of information not until were safe we just need the courage to see this through to the end
there are other kinds of courage like the courage to accept that there are some situations beyond your control not every problem has an immediate solution
youre suggesting we turn around
yes we should get out of harms way let them fight it out in the meantime theres still plenty of delta quadrant left to explore we may find another way home
or we may find something else six months a year down the road after species 8472 gets through with the borg we could find ourselves back in the line of fire and well have missed the window of opportunity that exists right here right now
how much is our safety worth
what do you mean
wed be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering billions wed be helping the borg assimilate yet another species just to get ourselves back home its wrong
tell that to harry kim hes barely alive thanks to that species maybe helping to assimilate them isnt such a bad idea we could be doing the delta quadrant a favour
i dont think you really believe that i think youre struggling to justify your plan because your desire to get this crew home is blinding you to other options i know you kathryn sometimes you dont know when to step back
do you trust me chakotay
that isnt the issue
oh but it is only yesterday you were saying that wed face this together that youd be at my side
i still have to tell you what i believe im no good to you if i dont do that
i appreciate your insights but the time for debate is over ive made my decision now do i have your support
youre the captain im the first officer ill follow your orders that doesnt change my belief that were making a fatal mistake
then i guess im alone after all dismissed
there are three planets in this system inhabitants all borg a vessel is approaching
all stop shields up
theyre hailing us
open a channel
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
theyve locked onto us with a tractor beam
borg vessel this is captain janeway of the starship voyager i have tactical information about species 8472 i want to negotiate
negotiation is irrelevant you will be assimilated
borg vessel what youre receiving is a sample of the knowledge we possess if you dont disengage your tractor beam immediately i will have that data destroyed you have ten seconds to comply we know youre in danger of being defeated you cant afford to risk losing this information disengage your tractor
state your demands
i want safe passage through your space once my ship is beyond borg territory ill give you our research
unacceptable our space is vast your passage would require too much time we need the technology now
if i give it to you now youll assimilate us
species 8472 must be stopped our survival is your survival give us the technology
no safe passage first or no deal
state your proposal
lets work together combine our resources even if we do give you the technology now youre still going to need time to develop it by working together we can create a weapon more quickly if you escort us through your space we can perfect the weapon as we
where did that ship come from
a quantum singularity has appeared twenty thousand kilometres away the bioship is heading directly toward the planet
the borg shields are weakening we might be able to break free of the tractor beam
can you get a lock on the captain
not yet
commander there are nine more bioships coming out of the singularity
whats going on
report
the borg shields are offline ive got a lock on captain janeway
get her out of there and break us free of the cube stand by all weapons
im trying to energise the borg are scattering the beam
compensate
no effect
were being hailed
on screen
commander cut the transporter beam
captain
do it ive reached an agreement with the collective were going to help them design a weapon against species 8472 in exchange theyve granted us safe passage through their space
the cube is altering course theyre heading toward the alpha quadrant
thats part of the plan well work on the weapon en route once were across their territory well give them the nanoprobes they appear to be holding up their end of the bargain i suggest we do the same
how do you propose we begin this collaboration
im going to work here on the cube they have technology thatll make the job go faster i want to take advantage of it
its not necessary for you to stay there we can set up a comlink with the borg and
its part of the deal i work here
all right as long as were cooperating maybe the borg would be willing to disengage their tractor beam we can match their course without a leash
ill propose it mister tuvok transport to my coordinates
understood
were going to make this work commander janeway out
you heard the captain
i replicated nearly ten million borg nanoprobes each of them reprogrammed to my specifications each capable of targeting the alien tissue
assimilating it
just momentarily the borg technology will denaturate within seconds taking the alien tissue along with it mister kim im about to inject your carotid artery youll feel a tingling sensation dont be alarmed
nice to see you again ensign
its working
prepare another dose of nanoprobes
yes doctor
good work let me know when hes back on his feet
commander i must tell you i have my doubts about this alliance you may have convinced the borg the nanoprobes can defeat their enemy but a medical treatment is a long way from a weapon of war
leave that to the captain this situation is unpredictable so were going to stay at full red alert keep all information about the nanoprobes stored in your holomatrix
dont worry ill delete myself at the first sign of trouble well maybe not the first sign
weve just received word tuvok beamed to the cube hes joined the captain
keep a transporter lock on both of them
ill try but the borg are already regenerating their shields
try matching their shield frequencies
it wont work theyll be able to adapt too quickly
i dont want to hear what we cant do lieutenant just find a way to get our people out of there if we have to
aye sir
theyve released their tractor beam
match their course and speed
i never thought id hear myself say this but looks like the borg are cooperating
kes kes kes whats wrong
theyre watching us
may i ask where were being taken
grid nine two of subjunction twelve our very own workspace its near the centre of the cube
these are my tricorder readings of the bioship we examined i believe you will find them most revealing
have you compared this to the doctors analysis of the alien tissue
yes many of the cellular structures are identical
the aliens and their ships are made of the same organic material
apparently so
you have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve proceed
all right weve analysed one of the alien vessels and it appears to be constructed of organic material vulnerable to the modified nanoprobes i suggest we begin thinking about a large scale delivery system a way to infect their ships and destroy them at the microscopic
we will begin
what are you doing
a neural transceiver is required for maximum communication we will work as one mind
no that wasnt the agreement
the neural link is temporary you will not be damaged
i dont care i prefer to communicate verbally thank you
your primitive communication is inefficient
on the contrary we work better with our individuality intact surely weve proven that to you by now
irrelevant you must comply
we must do nothing tell your drone to remove the transceiver what about choosing a representative a single borg we can work with and talk to directly
elaborate
youve done it before when you transformed jeanluc picard into locutus we will not be assimilated choose a representative or the deals off
i speak for the borg
im captain janeway this is lieutenant tuvok
we are aware of your designations
whats your designation
seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one but you may call me seven of nine you are proposing a largescale weapon we concur
i thought you might
we could encase the nanoprobes in some of our photon torpedoes in essence turn them into biomolecular warheads
your torpedoes are inadequate they lack the necessary range and dispursive force
do you have a better idea
we are borg
i take that as a yes
a multikinetic neutronic mine five million isoton yield
an explosion that size could affect an entire star system
correct the shock wave will disperse the nanoprobes over a radius of five light years
thats somewhat larger than i had in mind youre proposing a weapon of mass destruction
we are
well im not youd be endangering innocent worlds
it would be efficient
wed need approximately fifty trillion nanoprobes to arm this mine it would take the doctor several weeks to replicate that amount you are losing this conflict are you willing to risk further delay
right now your enemy believes it is invulnerable if we create smaller weapons using our torpedoes and destroy a few of their bioships it may deter them convince them to give up this war
you are individuals you are small and you think in small terms but the present situation requires that we consider your plan voyagers weapons inventory photon torpedo complement thirty two class six warhead explosive yield two hundred isotons
how did you obtain this information
we are borg
naturally
commander we have some disturbing news
at this point im getting used to it
her telepathic visions are increasing both in frequency and intensity
it feels different this time its almost like theyre right here in the room
there is it again
im trying to block them out but i cant
every time she has a vision specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyperstimulation memory engrams perceptual centres i cant be sure but i think theres more going on here than just a simple hello
enhance this grid i want to take a closer look at the detonator
we must analyse the bioship your data
youre human arent you
this body was assimilated eighteen years ago it ceased to be human at that time
im curious what was your name before you were
do not engage us in further irrelevant discourse we are being hailed by your vessel
commander what is it
its kes the doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory
if thats true they may already know what were planning
ive ordered long range scans for bioships nothing so far
we should alter course try to throw them off
agreed our course and heading have been changed
match them and keep me apprised of any changes in kes
chakotay out
we now require one of your photon torpedoes and the nanoprobes
one step at a time were not safely across your territory yet
we must construct and test a prototype now the risk of attack has increased
irrelevant we have an agreement youre asking me to give up my only guarantee that you wont assimilate us i wont risk it
are you willing to risk a direct confrontation with us if we transport five hundred drones onto your vessel do you believe you could offer sufficient resistance
wed die trying
that wont be necessary we must construct a launching system to accommodate this design
glad you could join us mister kim
harry welcome back
thanks reporting for duty sir the doctor gave me a clean bill of health did i miss anything
not too much take your station ensign
youve still got a tendril up your nose
commander im picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft its a singularity
we are under attack
theyre charging weapons
shields keep a lock on the away team
direct hit to our secondary hull
transporters are offline shields and weapons are down
voyager has taken heavy damage
we cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed
were being targeted
brace for impact
the cube
destroyed and it took the bioship with it
tuvok to chakotay
go ahead tuvok where are you
im in cargo bay two
along with the captain and a number of borg
we were beamed over just before impact we require assistance
tuvok tuvok secure that deck security team to cargo bay two paris you have the bridge
lower your weapons
we are here with your captains consent it was necessary to sacrifice our vessel to protect yours we have an alliance do we not
for now theyre contained theyve assimilated cargo bay two and theyre drawing energy from the secondary power couplings
but theyve gone no further
not yet ive sealed off decks nine through thirteen and posted security details at every access point
i suggest we increase security around sickbay as well
already done how far did you get on the weapon
were ready to construct a prototype
youre fit to return back to duty lieutenant
and you kes
oh im all right the visions have stopped for now
the plasma burns to her thoracic region i can treat and ive already stopped the internal bleeding but her neural injuries are going to require some creative thinking
before we beamed out an alien energy discharge struck very near the captain
well it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways ill have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain functions but i must tell you unless i can repair the damage she may never regain consciousness
make sure those borg stay put i want tactical updates every twenty minutes
aye sir shall i resume working with them
stand by for now
the captain wishes to speak with you please keep it brief
the doctor explained my condition youre in command
i understand
theyll push you theyll threaten you but they need you they need this alliance you have to make this work i want you to make this work get this crew home
i must begin
where is your captain i must speak with her
in our medical bay recovering youll be dealing with me now
circumstances have changed
id say so
the loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement
ive been giving that some thought im willing to let you stay on board well continue to work with you on the weapon once were safely out of borg territory well give you the nanoprobes shake hands and part company
insufficient our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then the nearest borg vessel is forty light years away you will reverse course and take us to it
even at maximum warp thats a five day journey in the wrong direction were supposed to be heading out of borg space not deeper into it
there is no alternative
look ill honour the original agreement but im not turning this ship around its too dangerous
denying our request is also dangerous
ill think about it
think quickly
a five day trip back into the heart of borg territory its too risky with those drones and the nanoprobes on board we might as well have a bullseye painted on our hull were a prime target for species 8472 wed never survive another attack
what is the alternative
im going to end this alliance here and now were going to drop the borg off on the next uninhabited planet give them the nanoprobes and take our chances alone they can wait for a borg ship to pick them up and finish the weapon im in command now and i have to do what i think is best for this crew tom i want you to scan for the nearest uninhabited planet and set a course
aye sir
i must caution you commander the borg may not go quietly
well see bring that female drone to the ready room dismissed
once weve beamed you to the surface well send down the nanoprobes and all our research
unacceptable we dont have time for
this isnt open for discussion im not turning this ship around youre getting what you wanted i suggest we part ways amicably
there is another option we could assimilate your vessel
if a single drone steps one millimetre out of that cargo bay ill decompress the entire deck you wont pose much of a threat floating in space
when your captain first approached us we suspected that an agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain you are erratic conflicted disorganised every decision is debated every action questioned every individual entitled to their own small opinion you lack harmony cohesion greatness it will be your undoing
escort our guest back to the cargo bay
well ive made my decision if it were only a matter of going against the orders of my superior officer youre more than just my captain youre my friend i hope youll understand
species 8472 has penetrated matrix zero one zero grid nineteen eight planets destroyed three hundred twelve vessels disabled four million six hundred twenty one borg eliminated we must seize control of the alpha quadrant vessel and take it into the alien realm
we understand
class h moon oxygenargon atmosphere
itll do take us out of warp and enter orbit
aye sir
tuvok stand by to transport the borg directly from the cargo bay after theyre on the surface have security run a sweep of
im reading power fluctuations in the deflector array
cause
it looks like the borg have accessed deflector control theyre trying to realign the emitters
shut them out
theyve bypassed security protocols
were emitting a resonant graviton beam its creating another singularity
reverse course
were fighting intense gravimetric distortion i cant break free
bridge to cargo bay two stop what youre doing or ill depressurise that deck and blow you out into space this is your final warning do it
decompression cycle complete
i still dont have deflector control
commander a single borg has survived
were being pulled in
report
we appear to have crossed an interdimensional rift
weve definitely left our galaxy no stars no planets
lets see
im recalibrating sensors the entire region is filled with some kind of organic fluid this isnt space its matter
commander chakotay we have entered the domain of species 8472 report to the cargo bay
paris repressurise cargo bay two tuvok
our entry into fluidic space has created a compression wave they know were here a fleet of bioships is already converging on our position time to intercept three hours seventeen minutes
youve been here before how else could you know about fluidic space
we must prepare this ship for the altercation we will construct a complement of biomolecular warheads
why why were you here you started this war didnt you whats the matter our galaxy wasnt big enough for you you had to conquer new territory but this race fought back a species as malevolent as your own
species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated their technology is biogenically engineered it is superior to that of all species we have previously encountered
which is precisely what you wanted
they are the apex of biological evolution their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection
so instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy
there is only one course of action destroy them first my subspace link to the collective has been weakened by the interdimensional rift we cannot signal for help we are alone we must construct a compliment of biomolecular warheads and modify your weapons to launch them
ive got a better idea why dont you open that rift again and take us back
if i did that you will no longer cooperate
doctor to chakotay
go ahead
report to sickbay at once
on my way
captain
ah as you can see ive repaired her neural damage ensign kim the captain im two for two
doctor if youll excuse us a moment
hmm eh oh gladly computer deactivate emh programme
the doctor brought me up to speed but he couldnt tell me what i really wanted to know why
the collective ordered me to reverse course travel forty light years back the way we came what would you have done
i probably wouldve reversed course maintained the alliance as long as possible
in my mind the alliance was already over
you never trusted me you never believed this would work you were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders
trust had nothing to with it i made a tactical decision
and so did i
they have taking advantage of us from day one
we made concessions so did they
they lied the borg started the war with species 8472 weve only got one borg left to worry about we should try to disable her and get back to the delta quadrant we might be able to duplicate the deflector protocols they used to open a singularity
no i wont be caught tinkering with the deflector when those aliens attack theres no other way out of this chakotay its too late for opinions its too late for discussion its time to make the call and im making it we fight the aliens in full cooperation with the borg
i was linked to a collective once remember i had a neurotransceiver embedded in my spine i know who were dealing with weve got to get rid of that last borg and take our chances alone
it wont work this isnt working either there are two wars going on the one out there and the one in here and were losing both of them
it will be your undoing
what
our conflicted nature our individuality seven of nine said that we lack the cohesion of a collective mind that one day it would divide us and destroy us and here we are proving her point
ill tell you when we lost control of this situation when we made our mistake it was the moment we turned away from each other we dont have to stop being individuals to get through this we just have to stop fighting each other
captain janeway
ive relieved mister chakotay of his duties and confined him to the brig im back in command
and you understand the situation
completely tuvok give her the nanoprobes work with her build as many warheads as you can and start modifying our weapons systems i suggest we think about enhancing our defences as well if were going to fight this battle i intend to win it
we are in agreement
good this is the plan we engage the enemy here in their space we show them what theyre up against if they have any sense of selfpreservation theyll back off pull their ships out of the delta quadrant thats provided the weapons are effective if they arent its been nice working with you weve got to get this ship armed and ready in under two hours were going to war
borg modifications are complete
bring them online
torpedo launch tubes active hull armour engaged shield enhancements stable
biomolecular weapons are ready thirteen standard photon torpedoes and one class ten armed with a high yield warhead
all hands this is the captain ready your stations seal all emergency bulkheads and prepare to engage the enemy stand by for my orders
four bioships have just entered sensor range
battle stations
ive got a visual
on screen
i can hear them they want to talk through me they say weve contaminated their realm
tell them we had no choice we were only trying to defend ourselves
they say our galaxy is impure its proximity is a threat to their genetic integrity
tell them we have a weapon a devastating weapon that can destroy them at the cellular level if they dont stop their attacks on the delta quadrant well be forced to use it
they said your galaxy will be purged
shields and weapons are offline
rerouting emergency power to the launchers
theyre coming around for another assault ive lost thrusters
biomolecular warheads are charged and ready
fire
direct hit on all four vessels no effect
theyre charging weapons
the nanoprobes were successful if not prompt all four ships have been destroyed
i think weve made our point now open a singularity and get us out of here
captain
kes are you still in contact
yes
tell them if they continue their attack well use the weapon again
theyre not responding
evasive manoeuvres
aye captain theyre in pursuit
prepare to fire the high yield warhead aft torpedo bay
ready captain
do it
thirteen bioships have been destroyed the others are in retreat
i have regained full contact with the collective
what are they saying
all remaining bioships in the delta quadrant are returning to their realm the borg have prevailed
with a little help from us now its time you fulfilled your end of the agreement tell the collective we expect safe passage from here on out well give you a shuttlecraft you can head for the nearest borg ship
unacceptable this alliance is terminated your ship and its crew will adapt to service us
resistance is futile
captain shes tapping into helm control shes trying to access our coordinates
shut her out
i cant
bridge to chakotay scorpion
seven of nine stop what youre doing youre human a human individual our minds are linked we are one i can hear your thoughts
his link is stable but it wont be for long you must hurry
just a few more seconds
i can see your memories
you remember being human
we are borg
i see a young girl a family
irrelevant your appeal to my humanity is pointless
almost there chakotay youve got to keep her distracted if were going to make this work
listen to your human side to yourself the little girl seven of nine annika
hes losing the link
initiating power surge now
her connection to the collective is severed
get her to sickbay bridge to doctor report
commander chakotays going to be all right although he may wake up with a bit of a headache
tom plot a course out of borg space maximum warp
yes maam
am i interrupting
not at all just finishing up my log
the oldfashioned way
i wanted to get as far away from bioimplants and fluidic space and this feels more human somehow
i hate to spoil the mood but you might want to look at this engineering report itll take at least two weeks to remove the borg technology from our systems belanna did note that the power couplings on deck eight work better with the borg improvements
leave them how is our passenger
the doctor says shes stabilising her human cells are starting to regenerate
i wonder whats left under all that borg technology if she can ever become human again
you plan to keep her on board
we pulled the plug were responsible for what happens to her now
she was assimilated at a very young age the collectives all she knows she might not want to stay
i think she might we have something the borg could never offer friendship
i want you to know that disobeying your orders was one of the most difficult things ive ever had to do
i understand and i respect the decision you made even though i disagree with it whats important is that in the end we got through this together i dont ever want that to change
agreed
good well i think its time we get back to our bridge
no argument there
the cardinal is a thief i delivered two portraits of his mindless nephew more than three months ago to be depicted in the heroic mode of an hercules or an achilles so specified our contract i complied making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than nature ever intended an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles and what have i the divine leonardo da vinci received in payment
the cardinals eternal gratitude
essatto in other words signorina less than nothing
all the more reason why you should accept my proposal
money is beside the point signorina catarina is it
yes im only asking for a corner one bench a place to work on my own projects paintings sculptures just being here in your company is inspiring to me
flattery catarina is also beside the point besides i prefer my solitude scusi
meraviglioso
what will you call it
the arm of hephaestos
the god of the forge
every blacksmith who has ever swung a hammer will thank me for this creation
someone once said all invention is but an extension of the body of man
do not think that just because i have enjoyed your visit today that i am prepared to turn my workshop into a travellers inn
che cazzo
here let me help you
you will get your hands covered with goose grease
its good for the skin
let us see if we can find his big brother hopefully he will be stronger
this looks like a flying machine
i though that because my imagination took flight so easily my body could do the same i was wrong
its this flapping approach you designed your machine to mimic the way a bat or a sparrow flies
yes yes so
so what if you based it on the hawk instead
the hawk a creature that glides through the air
essatto
we will design a new machine and you catarina will help me fly it
ill need someplace to work
a corner one workbench
that will be fine
ten scudi per week and you provide your own materials
seven and i might need to borrow a few things on occasion
then we have an agreement
chakotay to janeway
go ahead
captain we need you in engineering theres something here you should see
on my way computer end programme
what have you got
some bad news the long range probe we sent out two months ago has stopped transmitting
at first i thought it was a problem with the communications grid then i cleared up the last few seconds of telemetry take a look at this
this could be it captain borg space
we dont know exactly how many vessels are out there but their space appears to be vast it includes thousands of solar systems all borg we are no doubt entering the heart of their territory theres no going around it but there may be a way through it
before the probe was disabled it picked up a narrow corridor of space devoid of borg activity weve nicknamed it the northwest passage
unfortunately the passage is filled with intense gravimetric distortions probably caused by a string of quantum singularities
better to ride the rapids than face the hive
exactly were going to set a course for that corridor and go into full tactical alert where do we stand with weapons
i have reprogrammed the phaser banks to a rotating modulation but i suspect a borg vessel will adapt quickly
we can use every edge ensign
ive already configured the long range sensors to scan for transwarp signatures an early warning system
good work doctor how are you coming on the medical front
ive analysed every square millimetre of the borg corpse we recovered three months ago im closer to understanding how their assimilation technology works and i might be able to create some sort of medical defence
redouble your efforts this is your top priority neelix i doubt we can resupply the ship any time soon
no problem sir im working on a plan to extend our food and replicator rations
we have to act fast the borg have captured one of our probes they know were out here well do everything in our power to avoid a direct confrontation but if and when we do engage the borg im confident that well be ready i have faith in each and every one of you lets do it
ensign on the double
coming through open
i want to cut down on the time it takes to seal off the decks
in case we take on some uninvited guests
exactly and i want to increase the magnitude of the forcefields
these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process once inside the skin they release a series of nanoprobes into the bloodstream
maybe we can develop some kind of protective shielding against them
unlikely the tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy or energy field which means our battle must be waged inside the body itself
they take over the blood cell functions like a virus
which suggests to me that we should try to enhance the immune system create an assimilation antibody as it were i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes but we might be able to slow them down lets try a submicron dissection on the probes weve collected so far see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism
kes is something wrong kes
i saw borg
youve had a telepathic experience
there were bodies dozens of them dead
hows kes
unsettled and uncertain over the past two hours she has experienced several telepathic visions about the death of borg and the destruction of voyager
some sort of premonitions
possibly
we cant just ignore her intuition but i see no reason to alter our plan tuvok i want you to keep an eye on her
captain long range sensors are picking up transwarp signatures five point eight light years distant closing from behind
red alert
evasive manoeuvres
whats happening
weve dropped out of warp
bridge to engineering whats going on down there
im not sure captain some kind of subspace turbulence is preventing us from creating a stable warp field
turbulence is increasing
im reading two borg vessels make that three four no five fifteen borg vessels distance two point one light years and closing
shields to maximum stand by all weapons
theyre in visual range
on screen
my god
captain
im picking up a polaron beam were being scanned
think good thoughts
the last cube has rejoined the others
did we sustain any damage
no shields held warp engines are coming back online all primary systems are stable
stand down red alert harry maintain a long range sensor lock on that borg armada they seemed to be in quite a hurry didnt they id like to know what theyre up to
yes maam
ill take this nearmiss as a good omen resume our course mister paris
if we needed any more evidence that weve entered borg space i think we just got it
ill be in my ready room
yes come in
weve just completed the latest sensor sweep so far so good the northwest passage is still clear of borg activity
id like to see a tactical update
according to my calculations neither of us has eaten since last night join me for dinner
no thanks im not hungry and ive got a lot of work to do
i see
ive been looking through the personal log entries of all the starfleet captains who encountered the borg ive gone over every engagement from the moment q flung the enterprise into the path of that first cube to the massacre at wolf 359 every battle every skirmish anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the collective
and
in the words of jeanluc picard in their collective state the borg are utterly without mercy driven by one will alone the will to conquer they are beyond redemption beyond reason and then theres captain amasov of the endeavour it is my opinion that the borg are as close to pure evil as any race weve ever encountered whats so funny
nothing
youre smiling obviously ive said something amusing
you sounded just like amasov
what
just now while you were reading his log you were using his inflections
i did not
yes you were and before that you were doing a pretty good picard
was i
its nothing to be ashamed about echoing the greats ensign hickman in astrophysics does a passable janeway
if we manage to survive the next few days im going to have a little chat with ensign hickman imitating the captain huh surely that violates some kind of starfleet protocol this day was inevitable we all knew it and weve all tried to prepare ourselves for the challenge ahead but at what point is the risk too great at what point do we come about and retreat to friendly territory could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant i keep looking to all these captains my comrades in arms but the truth is im alone
if that moment comes well face it together and well make the right decision youre not alone kathryn
three years ago i didnt even know your name today i cant imagine a day without you
captain janeway to the bridge
gentlemen
something strange is going on
the power signatures of those borg vessels have terminated
all of them
theyre dead in the water about five point two light years from here
cause
unknown
mister paris
captain
set a course for their position warp two
were approaching the ships
slow to impulse on screen
lifesigns
a few but theyre erratic
captain im detecting two residual weapons signatures in the debris one is borg the other is of unknown origin
who could do this to the borg
someone more powerful than the borg its hard to imagine
but they did it fifteen cubes we mightve just found our ticket through borg space an ally
lets not jump to conclusions scan the vicinity for other vessels
there are none
hold on im picking up some sort of bioreadings theyre coming from the outer hull of one of the borg ships
lets see it magnify mister kim
its definitely organic but our sensors cant penetrate its surface
send a standard greeting
no response
this could be a spacedwelling organism or a biological weapon
id like to know what kind of weapon could destroy the borg can we beam it away from the ship
i cant get a lock on it
tractor beam
no effect
whatever that thing is its impervious to our technology
tuvok are you reading an atmosphere in the cube
affirmative
commander chakotay i want you to take an away team inside try to get a short range scan of the biomass
there are still borg lifesigns but theyre unstable
well keep an open comlink and an active transporter lock well pull you out of there at the first sign of trouble
tuvok harry youre with me
this way
lower your phasers if we dont appear threatening they should ignore us
looks like theyre a little preoccupied
the alien bioreadings are getting stronger were close
commander
curious
thats not the word i had in mind
those bodies are reminiscent of one of the premonitions kes described
didnt kes say we were all going to die
lets keep moving
it looks like the biomass dissolved right through the borg hull
this borg is attempting to assimilate it
doesnt look like hes having much luck
theres a chamber beyond this opening forty meters wide high concentrations of antimatter particles it looks like a warp propulsion system of some kind
its a ship
starfleet has encountered species that use organicbased vessels the breen for example
there doesnt seem to be anybody on board chakotay to voyager
go ahead commander
captain weve found an entrance to the biomass we think it may be a ship of some kind permission to go inside
granted
harry thats a borg distribution node see if you can download their tactical database it might contain a record of what happened here
aye sir
tuvok
they seem to be organic conduits theyre carrying electrodynamic fluid
maybe an energy source
maybe this looks like a binary matrix but its laced with neuropeptides could be their version of a computer core
this damage was caused by a borg disrupter beam the wall appears to be regenerating itself commander
kes
harrys in danger
what are you
get them out of there
sickbay to janeway
commander
theres someone in here with us and its not the borg i cant localise it but its within twenty metres
perhaps the pilot has returned
voyager to away team
go ahead
stand by for transport were getting you out of there
good idea
energise
i cant get a lock on them
whats the problem
it looks like bioelectric interference from whatevers coming toward them
its within seven metres lets get out of here
narrow the confinement beam
no effect im going to try a skeletal lock
what
i think i can get a clean lock on the minerals in their bone tissue i just came up with it but i think it might work
the lifeforms five metres away and closing
from where
ive got them
a skeletal lock huh well have to add that one to the transporter manual
captain the bioship is powering up like its charging some kind of weapon
mister paris get us out of here maximum warp
the alien ship is not pursuing
kes
i could hear its thoughts the pilot of the bioship was trying to communicate with me theyre a telepathic species ive been aware of them for some time now the premonitions captain its not the borg that we should be worried about its them
what did it say to you
it said the weak will perish
the infection is spreading what began with a few stray cells contaminating the chest wound is now infusing every system in his body
it looks like hes being transformed in some way
not exactly the alien cells are consuming his body from the inside out in essence mister kim is being eaten alive
hes still conscious doctor
i tried giving him a sedative but it was rejected immediately in fact every treatment ive tried has been neutralised within seconds these are alien cells each one contains more than a hundred times the dna of a human cell its the most densely coded life form ive ever seen even i would need years to decipher it
they have an extraordinary immune response anything that penetrates the cell membrane chemical biological technological its all instantly destroyed thats why the borg cant assimilate them
resistance in this case is far from futile nevertheless i believe borg technology holds the key to saving mister kim
how so
i hope to unleash an army of modified borg nanoprobes into his bloodstream designed to target and eradicate the infection as you know ive been analysing the nanoprobes theyre efficient little assimilators one cant help but admire the workmanship but theyre no match for the alien cells so i successfully dissected a nanoprobe and managed to access its recoding mechanism i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells that way the probe can do its work without being detected observe the alien cells are completely oblivious to probe until its too late unfortunately ive only created a few prototypes ill need several days to modify enough nanoprobes to cure ensign kim
does harry have several days
i wish i knew
fight it harry thats an order
weve analysed the borgs tactical database they refer to these new aliens as species 8472
over the past five months the borg have been attacked by them on at least a dozen occasions each time the borg were defeated swiftly
the collective has very little information about the species
is anything known about where they come from
im afraid so
get the captain
the northwest passage
its clear of borg activity for a very good reason
im picking up one hundred and thirty three bioships more are appearing
from where
they seem to be coming from a quantum singularity
im localising the gravimetric distortions
on screen
kes anything
yes i can hear them theyre in a place where theyre alone nothing else lives there
some kind of parallel universe
i dont know i feel malevolence a cold hatred the weak will perish its an invasion they intend on destroying everything
tom reverse course maximum warp take us five light years out and hold position
aye captain
maintain red alert commander
that moment we spoke about its here any thoughts
just one flying into that corridor would mean certain death
agreed the northwest passage is no longer an option so now the choice is between facing the borg in their space or finding ourselves a nice planet here in the delta quadrant and giving up on ever getting home
wed be turning around but we wouldnt be giving up we may find another way home
im not ready to walk onto that bridge and tell the crew were quitting i cant do it chakotay not yet there must be an alternative
kathryn you havent slept in two days try getting some rest and clearing your head were safe for the moment we can tell the crew tomorrow if we have to
see you in the morning
maestro leonardo
catarina buona sera
am i disturbing you
what do you see
a wall with candlelight reflecting on it why what do you see
a flock of starlings the leaves of an oak a horses tail a thief with a noose around his neck and a wall with the candlelight reflecting on it there are times catarina when i find myself transfixed by a shadow on the wall or the splashing of water against a stone i stare at it the hours pass the world around me drops away replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination a way to focus the mind sit and tell me why you have come
theres a path before me the only way home and on either side mortal enemies bent on destroying each other if i attempt to pass through them ill be destroyed as well but if i turn around that would end all hope of ever getting home and no matter how much i try to focus my mind i cant see an alternative
when ones imagination cannot provide an answer one must seek a greater imagination there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer i must deliver a bronzetto to the monks at santa croce come with me catarina hey we will awake the abbot visit the chapel and appeal to god
somehow i dont think thats going to work for me but there is an alternative i havent considered what if i made an appeal to the devil
an alliance with the borg
more like an exchange we offer them a way to defeat their new enemy and in return we get safe passage through their space in developing a treatment for harry the doctor has found a way to attack the aliens at a microscopic level
its still in the experimental stages captain ive only made a few prototypes
nevertheless if we teach the borg how to modify their own nanoprobes theyd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the aliens
in theory yes
belanna its clear from the borg database that they know practically nothing about species 8472
thats right the borg gain knowledge through assimilation what they cant assimilate they cant understand
but we dont assimilate we investigate and in this case thats given us an edge weve discovered something they need
but the borg arent exactly known for their diplomacy how can we expect them to cooperate with us
normally the answer would be no but if what ive learned from the aliens is true the borg are losing this conflict
in one regard the borg are no different than we are theyre trying to survive i dont believe theyre going to refuse an offer that will help them do that
what makes you think the borg wont attempt to take the information by assimilating voyager and its crew
that wont get them anywhere doctor youre the only one on board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications i want you to transfer all of that research into your holomatrix
certainly
youre my guarantee if the borg threaten us in any way well simply erase your programme but it wont come to that doctor its in the collectives own interest to cooperate voyager is only one ship our safe passage is a small price to pay for what were offering in exchange belanna assist the doctor with his transfer
aye captain
mister paris locate the nearest borg vessel and lay in a course they shouldnt be difficult to find
yes maam
dismissed
you were awfully quiet
i didnt want the others to hear this but i think what youre proposing is too great a risk
how so
theres a story i heard as a child a parable and i never forgot it a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river wondering how to get to the other side suddenly he saw a fox he asked the fox to take him on his back across the river the fox said no if i do that youll sting me and ill drown the scorpion assured him if i did that wed both drown so the fox thought about it and finally agreed so the scorpion climbed up on his back and the fox began to swim but halfway across the river the scorpion stung him as the poison filled his veins the fox turned to the scorpion and said why did you do that now youll drown too i couldnt help it said the scorpion its my nature
i understand the risk and im not proposing that we try to change the nature of the beast but this is a unique situation to our knowledge the borg have never been so threatened theyre vulnerable i think we can take advantage of that
even if we do somehow negotiate an exchange how long will they keep up their end of the bargain it could take months to cross borg territory wed be facing thousands of systems millions of vessels
but only one collective and weve got them over a barrel we dont need to give them a single bit of information not until were safe we just need the courage to see this through to the end
there are other kinds of courage like the courage to accept that there are some situations beyond your control not every problem has an immediate solution
youre suggesting we turn around
yes we should get out of harms way let them fight it out in the meantime theres still plenty of delta quadrant left to explore we may find another way home
or we may find something else six months a year down the road after species 8472 gets through with the borg we could find ourselves back in the line of fire and well have missed the window of opportunity that exists right here right now
how much is our safety worth
what do you mean
wed be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering billions wed be helping the borg assimilate yet another species just to get ourselves back home its wrong
tell that to harry kim hes barely alive thanks to that species maybe helping to assimilate them isnt such a bad idea we could be doing the delta quadrant a favour
i dont think you really believe that i think youre struggling to justify your plan because your desire to get this crew home is blinding you to other options i know you kathryn sometimes you dont know when to step back
do you trust me chakotay
that isnt the issue
oh but it is only yesterday you were saying that wed face this together that youd be at my side
i still have to tell you what i believe im no good to you if i dont do that
i appreciate your insights but the time for debate is over ive made my decision now do i have your support
youre the captain im the first officer ill follow your orders that doesnt change my belief that were making a fatal mistake
then i guess im alone after all dismissed
there are three planets in this system inhabitants all borg a vessel is approaching
all stop shields up
theyre hailing us
open a channel
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
theyve locked onto us with a tractor beam
borg vessel this is captain janeway of the starship voyager i have tactical information about species 8472 i want to negotiate
negotiation is irrelevant you will be assimilated
borg vessel what youre receiving is a sample of the knowledge we possess if you dont disengage your tractor beam immediately i will have that data destroyed you have ten seconds to comply we know youre in danger of being defeated you cant afford to risk losing this information disengage your tractor
state your demands
i want safe passage through your space once my ship is beyond borg territory ill give you our research
unacceptable our space is vast your passage would require too much time we need the technology now
if i give it to you now youll assimilate us
species 8472 must be stopped our survival is your survival give us the technology
no safe passage first or no deal
state your proposal
lets work together combine our resources even if we do give you the technology now youre still going to need time to develop it by working together we can create a weapon more quickly if you escort us through your space we can perfect the weapon as we
where did that ship come from
a quantum singularity has appeared twenty thousand kilometres away the bioship is heading directly toward the planet
the borg shields are weakening we might be able to break free of the tractor beam
can you get a lock on the captain
not yet
commander there are nine more bioships coming out of the singularity
whats going on
report
the borg shields are offline ive got a lock on captain janeway
get her out of there and break us free of the cube stand by all weapons
im trying to energise the borg are scattering the beam
compensate
no effect
were being hailed
on screen
commander cut the transporter beam
captain
do it ive reached an agreement with the collective were going to help them design a weapon against species 8472 in exchange theyve granted us safe passage through their space
the cube is altering course theyre heading toward the alpha quadrant
thats part of the plan well work on the weapon en route once were across their territory well give them the nanoprobes they appear to be holding up their end of the bargain i suggest we do the same
how do you propose we begin this collaboration
im going to work here on the cube they have technology thatll make the job go faster i want to take advantage of it
its not necessary for you to stay there we can set up a comlink with the borg and
its part of the deal i work here
all right as long as were cooperating maybe the borg would be willing to disengage their tractor beam we can match their course without a leash
ill propose it mister tuvok transport to my coordinates
understood
were going to make this work commander janeway out
you heard the captain
i replicated nearly ten million borg nanoprobes each of them reprogrammed to my specifications each capable of targeting the alien tissue
assimilating it
just momentarily the borg technology will denaturate within seconds taking the alien tissue along with it mister kim im about to inject your carotid artery youll feel a tingling sensation dont be alarmed
nice to see you again ensign
its working
prepare another dose of nanoprobes
yes doctor
good work let me know when hes back on his feet
commander i must tell you i have my doubts about this alliance you may have convinced the borg the nanoprobes can defeat their enemy but a medical treatment is a long way from a weapon of war
leave that to the captain this situation is unpredictable so were going to stay at full red alert keep all information about the nanoprobes stored in your holomatrix
dont worry ill delete myself at the first sign of trouble well maybe not the first sign
weve just received word tuvok beamed to the cube hes joined the captain
keep a transporter lock on both of them
ill try but the borg are already regenerating their shields
try matching their shield frequencies
it wont work theyll be able to adapt too quickly
i dont want to hear what we cant do lieutenant just find a way to get our people out of there if we have to
aye sir
theyve released their tractor beam
match their course and speed
i never thought id hear myself say this but looks like the borg are cooperating
kes kes kes whats wrong
theyre watching us
may i ask where were being taken
grid nine two of subjunction twelve our very own workspace its near the centre of the cube
these are my tricorder readings of the bioship we examined i believe you will find them most revealing
have you compared this to the doctors analysis of the alien tissue
yes many of the cellular structures are identical
the aliens and their ships are made of the same organic material
apparently so
you have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve proceed
all right weve analysed one of the alien vessels and it appears to be constructed of organic material vulnerable to the modified nanoprobes i suggest we begin thinking about a large scale delivery system a way to infect their ships and destroy them at the microscopic
we will begin
what are you doing
a neural transceiver is required for maximum communication we will work as one mind
no that wasnt the agreement
the neural link is temporary you will not be damaged
i dont care i prefer to communicate verbally thank you
your primitive communication is inefficient
on the contrary we work better with our individuality intact surely weve proven that to you by now
irrelevant you must comply
we must do nothing tell your drone to remove the transceiver what about choosing a representative a single borg we can work with and talk to directly
elaborate
youve done it before when you transformed jeanluc picard into locutus we will not be assimilated choose a representative or the deals off
i speak for the borg
im captain janeway this is lieutenant tuvok
we are aware of your designations
whats your designation
seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one but you may call me seven of nine you are proposing a largescale weapon we concur
i thought you might
we could encase the nanoprobes in some of our photon torpedoes in essence turn them into biomolecular warheads
your torpedoes are inadequate they lack the necessary range and dispursive force
do you have a better idea
we are borg
i take that as a yes
a multikinetic neutronic mine five million isoton yield
an explosion that size could affect an entire star system
correct the shock wave will disperse the nanoprobes over a radius of five light years
thats somewhat larger than i had in mind youre proposing a weapon of mass destruction
we are
well im not youd be endangering innocent worlds
it would be efficient
wed need approximately fifty trillion nanoprobes to arm this mine it would take the doctor several weeks to replicate that amount you are losing this conflict are you willing to risk further delay
right now your enemy believes it is invulnerable if we create smaller weapons using our torpedoes and destroy a few of their bioships it may deter them convince them to give up this war
you are individuals you are small and you think in small terms but the present situation requires that we consider your plan voyagers weapons inventory photon torpedo complement thirty two class six warhead explosive yield two hundred isotons
how did you obtain this information
we are borg
naturally
commander we have some disturbing news
at this point im getting used to it
her telepathic visions are increasing both in frequency and intensity
it feels different this time its almost like theyre right here in the room
there is it again
im trying to block them out but i cant
every time she has a vision specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyperstimulation memory engrams perceptual centres i cant be sure but i think theres more going on here than just a simple hello
enhance this grid i want to take a closer look at the detonator
we must analyse the bioship your data
youre human arent you
this body was assimilated eighteen years ago it ceased to be human at that time
im curious what was your name before you were
do not engage us in further irrelevant discourse we are being hailed by your vessel
commander what is it
its kes the doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory
if thats true they may already know what were planning
ive ordered long range scans for bioships nothing so far
we should alter course try to throw them off
agreed our course and heading have been changed
match them and keep me apprised of any changes in kes
chakotay out
we now require one of your photon torpedoes and the nanoprobes
one step at a time were not safely across your territory yet
we must construct and test a prototype now the risk of attack has increased
irrelevant we have an agreement youre asking me to give up my only guarantee that you wont assimilate us i wont risk it
are you willing to risk a direct confrontation with us if we transport five hundred drones onto your vessel do you believe you could offer sufficient resistance
wed die trying
that wont be necessary we must construct a launching system to accommodate this design
glad you could join us mister kim
harry welcome back
thanks reporting for duty sir the doctor gave me a clean bill of health did i miss anything
not too much take your station ensign
youve still got a tendril up your nose
commander im picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft its a singularity
we are under attack
theyre charging weapons
shields keep a lock on the away team
direct hit to our secondary hull
transporters are offline shields and weapons are down
voyager has taken heavy damage
we cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed
were being targeted
brace for impact
the cube
destroyed and it took the bioship with it
tuvok to chakotay
go ahead tuvok where are you
im in cargo bay two
along with the captain and a number of borg
we were beamed over just before impact we require assistance
tuvok tuvok secure that deck security team to cargo bay two paris you have the bridge
lower your weapons
we are here with your captains consent it was necessary to sacrifice our vessel to protect yours we have an alliance do we not
for now theyre contained theyve assimilated cargo bay two and theyre drawing energy from the secondary power couplings
but theyve gone no further
not yet ive sealed off decks nine through thirteen and posted security details at every access point
i suggest we increase security around sickbay as well
already done how far did you get on the weapon
were ready to construct a prototype
youre fit to return back to duty lieutenant
and you kes
oh im all right the visions have stopped for now
the plasma burns to her thoracic region i can treat and ive already stopped the internal bleeding but her neural injuries are going to require some creative thinking
before we beamed out an alien energy discharge struck very near the captain
well it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways ill have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain functions but i must tell you unless i can repair the damage she may never regain consciousness
make sure those borg stay put i want tactical updates every twenty minutes
aye sir shall i resume working with them
stand by for now
the captain wishes to speak with you please keep it brief
the doctor explained my condition youre in command
i understand
theyll push you theyll threaten you but they need you they need this alliance you have to make this work i want you to make this work get this crew home
i must begin
where is your captain i must speak with her
in our medical bay recovering youll be dealing with me now
circumstances have changed
id say so
the loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement
ive been giving that some thought im willing to let you stay on board well continue to work with you on the weapon once were safely out of borg territory well give you the nanoprobes shake hands and part company
insufficient our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then the nearest borg vessel is forty light years away you will reverse course and take us to it
even at maximum warp thats a five day journey in the wrong direction were supposed to be heading out of borg space not deeper into it
there is no alternative
look ill honour the original agreement but im not turning this ship around its too dangerous
denying our request is also dangerous
ill think about it
think quickly
a five day trip back into the heart of borg territory its too risky with those drones and the nanoprobes on board we might as well have a bullseye painted on our hull were a prime target for species 8472 wed never survive another attack
what is the alternative
im going to end this alliance here and now were going to drop the borg off on the next uninhabited planet give them the nanoprobes and take our chances alone they can wait for a borg ship to pick them up and finish the weapon im in command now and i have to do what i think is best for this crew tom i want you to scan for the nearest uninhabited planet and set a course
aye sir
i must caution you commander the borg may not go quietly
well see bring that female drone to the ready room dismissed
once weve beamed you to the surface well send down the nanoprobes and all our research
unacceptable we dont have time for
this isnt open for discussion im not turning this ship around youre getting what you wanted i suggest we part ways amicably
there is another option we could assimilate your vessel
if a single drone steps one millimetre out of that cargo bay ill decompress the entire deck you wont pose much of a threat floating in space
when your captain first approached us we suspected that an agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain you are erratic conflicted disorganised every decision is debated every action questioned every individual entitled to their own small opinion you lack harmony cohesion greatness it will be your undoing
escort our guest back to the cargo bay
well ive made my decision if it were only a matter of going against the orders of my superior officer youre more than just my captain youre my friend i hope youll understand
species 8472 has penetrated matrix zero one zero grid nineteen eight planets destroyed three hundred twelve vessels disabled four million six hundred twenty one borg eliminated we must seize control of the alpha quadrant vessel and take it into the alien realm
we understand
class h moon oxygenargon atmosphere
itll do take us out of warp and enter orbit
aye sir
tuvok stand by to transport the borg directly from the cargo bay after theyre on the surface have security run a sweep of
im reading power fluctuations in the deflector array
cause
it looks like the borg have accessed deflector control theyre trying to realign the emitters
shut them out
theyve bypassed security protocols
were emitting a resonant graviton beam its creating another singularity
reverse course
were fighting intense gravimetric distortion i cant break free
bridge to cargo bay two stop what youre doing or ill depressurise that deck and blow you out into space this is your final warning do it
decompression cycle complete
i still dont have deflector control
commander a single borg has survived
were being pulled in
report
we appear to have crossed an interdimensional rift
weve definitely left our galaxy no stars no planets
lets see
im recalibrating sensors the entire region is filled with some kind of organic fluid this isnt space its matter
commander chakotay we have entered the domain of species 8472 report to the cargo bay
paris repressurise cargo bay two tuvok
our entry into fluidic space has created a compression wave they know were here a fleet of bioships is already converging on our position time to intercept three hours seventeen minutes
youve been here before how else could you know about fluidic space
we must prepare this ship for the altercation we will construct a complement of biomolecular warheads
why why were you here you started this war didnt you whats the matter our galaxy wasnt big enough for you you had to conquer new territory but this race fought back a species as malevolent as your own
species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated their technology is biogenically engineered it is superior to that of all species we have previously encountered
which is precisely what you wanted
they are the apex of biological evolution their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection
so instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy
there is only one course of action destroy them first my subspace link to the collective has been weakened by the interdimensional rift we cannot signal for help we are alone we must construct a compliment of biomolecular warheads and modify your weapons to launch them
ive got a better idea why dont you open that rift again and take us back
if i did that you will no longer cooperate
doctor to chakotay
go ahead
report to sickbay at once
on my way
captain
ah as you can see ive repaired her neural damage ensign kim the captain im two for two
doctor if youll excuse us a moment
hmm eh oh gladly computer deactivate emh programme
the doctor brought me up to speed but he couldnt tell me what i really wanted to know why
the collective ordered me to reverse course travel forty light years back the way we came what would you have done
i probably wouldve reversed course maintained the alliance as long as possible
in my mind the alliance was already over
you never trusted me you never believed this would work you were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders
trust had nothing to with it i made a tactical decision
and so did i
they have taking advantage of us from day one
we made concessions so did they
they lied the borg started the war with species 8472 weve only got one borg left to worry about we should try to disable her and get back to the delta quadrant we might be able to duplicate the deflector protocols they used to open a singularity
no i wont be caught tinkering with the deflector when those aliens attack theres no other way out of this chakotay its too late for opinions its too late for discussion its time to make the call and im making it we fight the aliens in full cooperation with the borg
i was linked to a collective once remember i had a neurotransceiver embedded in my spine i know who were dealing with weve got to get rid of that last borg and take our chances alone
it wont work this isnt working either there are two wars going on the one out there and the one in here and were losing both of them
it will be your undoing
what
our conflicted nature our individuality seven of nine said that we lack the cohesion of a collective mind that one day it would divide us and destroy us and here we are proving her point
ill tell you when we lost control of this situation when we made our mistake it was the moment we turned away from each other we dont have to stop being individuals to get through this we just have to stop fighting each other
captain janeway
ive relieved mister chakotay of his duties and confined him to the brig im back in command
and you understand the situation
completely tuvok give her the nanoprobes work with her build as many warheads as you can and start modifying our weapons systems i suggest we think about enhancing our defences as well if were going to fight this battle i intend to win it
we are in agreement
good this is the plan we engage the enemy here in their space we show them what theyre up against if they have any sense of selfpreservation theyll back off pull their ships out of the delta quadrant thats provided the weapons are effective if they arent its been nice working with you weve got to get this ship armed and ready in under two hours were going to war
borg modifications are complete
bring them online
torpedo launch tubes active hull armour engaged shield enhancements stable
biomolecular weapons are ready thirteen standard photon torpedoes and one class ten armed with a high yield warhead
all hands this is the captain ready your stations seal all emergency bulkheads and prepare to engage the enemy stand by for my orders
four bioships have just entered sensor range
battle stations
ive got a visual
on screen
i can hear them they want to talk through me they say weve contaminated their realm
tell them we had no choice we were only trying to defend ourselves
they say our galaxy is impure its proximity is a threat to their genetic integrity
tell them we have a weapon a devastating weapon that can destroy them at the cellular level if they dont stop their attacks on the delta quadrant well be forced to use it
they said your galaxy will be purged
shields and weapons are offline
rerouting emergency power to the launchers
theyre coming around for another assault ive lost thrusters
biomolecular warheads are charged and ready
fire
direct hit on all four vessels no effect
theyre charging weapons
the nanoprobes were successful if not prompt all four ships have been destroyed
i think weve made our point now open a singularity and get us out of here
captain
kes are you still in contact
yes
tell them if they continue their attack well use the weapon again
theyre not responding
evasive manoeuvres
aye captain theyre in pursuit
prepare to fire the high yield warhead aft torpedo bay
ready captain
do it
thirteen bioships have been destroyed the others are in retreat
i have regained full contact with the collective
what are they saying
all remaining bioships in the delta quadrant are returning to their realm the borg have prevailed
with a little help from us now its time you fulfilled your end of the agreement tell the collective we expect safe passage from here on out well give you a shuttlecraft you can head for the nearest borg ship
unacceptable this alliance is terminated your ship and its crew will adapt to service us
resistance is futile
captain shes tapping into helm control shes trying to access our coordinates
shut her out
i cant
bridge to chakotay scorpion
seven of nine stop what youre doing youre human a human individual our minds are linked we are one i can hear your thoughts
his link is stable but it wont be for long you must hurry
just a few more seconds
i can see your memories
you remember being human
we are borg
i see a young girl a family
irrelevant your appeal to my humanity is pointless
almost there chakotay youve got to keep her distracted if were going to make this work
listen to your human side to yourself the little girl seven of nine annika
hes losing the link
initiating power surge now
her connection to the collective is severed
get her to sickbay bridge to doctor report
commander chakotays going to be all right although he may wake up with a bit of a headache
tom plot a course out of borg space maximum warp
yes maam
am i interrupting
not at all just finishing up my log
the oldfashioned way
i wanted to get as far away from bioimplants and fluidic space and this feels more human somehow
i hate to spoil the mood but you might want to look at this engineering report itll take at least two weeks to remove the borg technology from our systems belanna did note that the power couplings on deck eight work better with the borg improvements
leave them how is our passenger
the doctor says shes stabilising her human cells are starting to regenerate
i wonder whats left under all that borg technology if she can ever become human again
you plan to keep her on board
we pulled the plug were responsible for what happens to her now
she was assimilated at a very young age the collectives all she knows she might not want to stay
i think she might we have something the borg could never offer friendship
i want you to know that disobeying your orders was one of the most difficult things ive ever had to do
i understand and i respect the decision you made even though i disagree with it whats important is that in the end we got through this together i dont ever want that to change
agreed
good well i think its time we get back to our bridge
no argument there
so hows the newest addition to our family
at the moment shes stable but the prognosis isnt clear her human physiology has begun to reassert itself respiratory system neurological functions immune response but those systems are swarming with borg implants theres a battle being waged inside her body between the biological and the technological and im not sure which is going to win
well its time we brought her up to date wake her
captain janeway what have you the others i cant hear the others the voices are gone
we had to neutralise the neurotransceiver in your upper spinal column your link to the collective has been severed
you will return this drone to the borg
im afraid i cant do that
you will return this drone to the borg
if i were to turn this ship around and head back into borg territory id be putting my crew at risk im not prepared to do that try to understand you have to stay on board voyager but im offering you freedom from the collective and i assure you we will do everything we can to help the transition
you will supply us with a subspace transmitter and leave us on the nearest planet the borg will come for us
its too late for that your human cells are starting to regenerate you wont survive without medical care
we need nothing from you we are borg we are  ah
this implant is being rejected by the tissue underneath its going to have to be removed
you will suppress the human immune system
im sorry but the process has gone too far weve got to get you to sickbay
no we are borg we are borg
this armour plating is anchored to the skull with over three million microconnectors theres no time to cut through them im going to have to remove the outer layer of the skull itself lieutenant will you please leave the surgical bay
this borg is a security risk
she is heavily sedated i assure you shes not going anywhere
thank you kes i want you to anaesthetise her cranial nerves twenty milligrams anetrazine
yes doctor
kes
i dont know what happened i looked at the hypospray and it just came to me
have you been experimenting with your psychokinetic abilities
no not for months but i have been feeling a little strange lately lots of energy sleeping less
i can see why your serotonin levels are sixty two percent above normal its the telepathic centres of your brain theyre in a state of hyperstimulation like they were a few days ago when you were in contact with species 8472
are they attempting to communicate with you again
no this time its different i dont feel their presence at all
perhaps shes experiencing an aftereffect of some kind
a reasonable diagnosis for a security officer ill run a full microsynaptic analysis but it will have to wait we should get back to our borg
come in
ships status report weve got two teams on the hull stripping off the borg armour theyre working around the clock but its still slow going
what about the warp drive
torres is having problems cleaning out the plasma relays its disrupting the antimatter reaction until shes got it fixed were stuck at impulse shes requesting all personnel with a level three engineering rating or higher to lend a hand
granted tactical update
long range sensors are picking up residual transwarp signatures borg vessels they passed by probably three days ago
so were not out of the woods yet
having half our propulsion system overrun by borg implants doesnt make repairs any easier
seven of nine could help with that
that might be true if she were willing but shes not in the most cooperative mood
that could change i just have to reach her somehow
annika hansen
our borg
it took some digging through the federation database but i managed to find a single entry in the records of deep space four her parents were unconventional they fancied themselves explorers but wanted nothing to do with starfleet or the federation their names were last recorded at a remote outpost in the omega sector they refused to file a flight plan apparently they aimed their small ship toward the delta quadrant and were never heard from again
for all we know annika and her parents were the first humans the borg ever assimilated
from what shes told me that was almost twenty years ago
so she was raised by the borg its the only life she ever really knew if you were thinking of bringing her into the fold that might not be possible
whats the alternative toss her back to the wolves
sickbay to captain janeway
what is it doctor
could you come down here captain were having some problems
ill be right there
its like peeling an onion
store it in a biostasis chamber it may still be active if you think theres a risk mister tuvok you can throw one of your little forcefields around the chamber
a prudent security measure for a doctor
report
im afraid we have a decision to make a difficult one her human immune system has reasserted itself with a vengeance body armour borg organelles biosynthetic glands theyre all being rejected her life is in danger i have little recourse but to remove the borg technology
which is the last thing seven of nine would want
hence the difficult decision if a patient told me not to treat them even if the situation were lifethreatening i would be ethically obligated to honour that request
this is no ordinary patient she may have been raised by borg raised to think like a borg but shes with us now and underneath all that technology she is a human being whether shes ready to accept that or not and until she is ready someone has to make the decisions for her proceed with the surgery
aye captain
kes lets begin with the microtubular network embedded in the oesophageal tract
whats happening
im not sure shes going into neural shock i cant localise the source kes try to stabilise her motor cortex use a neurosequencer kes i said to stabilise her cortex or were going to lose her
wait i can see it
what
i think the problem is in her colliculli yes i can see it a borg implant its pressing against her trochlear nerve
can you tell me how we might remove it without severing the nerve
i think i can do more than tell you
the implant is deteriorating her nervous system is stabilising nice work kes unconventional but effective
they say the eye is the window to the soul in this case its a little bit more ive fabricated this artificial organ to replace her eyepiece but ive had to retain some of the borg circuitry along the optic nerve as a result shell have increased acuity in one eye note how perfectly ive matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye
excellent work doctor i admire your attention to detail when can i speak with her
shes out of immediate danger and i dont plan to resume the extraction process until tomorrow i can wake her now if youd like
i would how are you kes
i feel exhilarated captain ive never been so focused in my life and my telepathic abilities are stronger than theyve ever been
your performance today was astonishing however your psychokinetic powers are still undisciplined and as a result unpredictable
i feel like im in control
nevertheless you must proceed with caution and with my assistance
what are you suggesting
a series of guided meditations to help her explore the depth of these new abilities
kes
im ready
well then if youll excuse us we should begin immediately
ready when you are captain
dont be alarmed youre in sickbay youre going to be fine
what have you done to me
your body was rejecting the borg technology you were dying im sorry but we had no choice those are dermoplastic grafts theyll help the regeneration process
unacceptable
you should have let us die
i couldnt do that
this drone cannot survive outside the collective
i beg to differ now that the borg implants are being excised your human systems are free to thrive and thriving they are as a matter of fact i
i want to help you but i need to understand what youre going through
do not engage us in superficial attempts at sympathy
its obvious that youre in pain that youre frightened that you feel isolated alone
you are an individual you are small you cannot understand what it is to be borg
no but i can imagine you were part of a vast consciousness billions of minds working together a harmony of purpose and thought no indecision no doubts the security and strength of a unified will and youve lost that
this drone is small now alone one voice one mind the silence is unacceptable we need the others
i cant give you back to the borg but youre not alone youre part of a human community now a human collective we may be individuals but we live and work together you can have some of the unity you require right here on voyager
insufficient
itll have to do and the fact is this community needs you the borg modifications you made to our vessel are disrupting our warp drive we need your help to remove them your expertise your cooperation you must comply
all right i think ive got all the borg garbage out of the plasma intake manifold lets try reinitialising the antimatter reaction
matter antimatter reaction at twenty two cochranes and rising
damn what happened
intake manifolds eleven and thirteen are still blocked
this is like pulling weeds you think youve got them all out and then
you have neglected to remove the autonomous regeneration sequencers
lieutenant torres ensign kim you remember seven of nine
how could we forget
we cant afford to delay repairs any longer so ive asked her to help us remove the borg modifications she only has a few hours before she returns to sickbay i suggest you put here to good use
you can start with the plasma relays theyre in jefferies tube thirteen
jefferies tube thirteen alpha section twelve we fully recall the engineering specifications of your vessel
good can you also recall the way it looked before you turned it into a borg circus
yes
well now that the pleasantries are over why dont you get to work i want updates every hour
yes captain
the flame of the lamp is fire disciplined tamed and under control it is the appropriate focus for the task ahead of us
how do we begin
i will attempt to guide you in manipulating the flame at the subatomic level concentrate on the flame try to see past the surface past the light to the patterns of energy and matter
i can see the essence of the fire
good now reach out with your mind and intensify the flame
im making it hotter brighter
now with your thoughts reduce the flame excellent you never demonstrated this level of control before
its as though i knew what had to be done
whats wrong
somethings happening i can see further beyond the subatomic
kes there is nothing beyond the subatomic
but i can see it tuvok its a new level of reality its beautiful
perhaps we should stop for now
wait a few seconds i want to try to control it
dont worry tuvok
what about these linkages every time i pull one out another one comes back in its place
autonomous regeneration sequencers they function to counteract resistance
amazing how did you come up with the pattern duplication design
we came up with nothing the borg assimilated this technology in galactic cluster three from species two five nine
im not interested in a history lesson how do we disable it
you must disconnect each sequencer conduit at the insertion juncture
why dont you two work on the jefferies tube start with the plasma relays
ill start here you said the borg got this stuff from species two five nine who are they guess the borg meet a lot of people dont they stupid question so whats it like out there in galactic cluster three
beyond your comprehension
try me
galactic cluster three is a transmaterial energy plane intersecting twenty two billion omnicordial lifeforms
ah interesting
ensign kim your assistance
captain somebodys trying to access the subspace transmitter
captain i dont know how but shes erected some kind of forcefield around the door we cant break through it
shes bypassed our security protocols
disable the transmitter
its too late
its obvious your mental abilities have progressed beyond this particular vulcan exercise i suggest we what is it
somethings wrong the borg is trying to contact her people
tuvok to security team one intruder alert in engineering
wait i think i can stop her
its over
tuvok to bridge status
there was some kind of explosion in the jefferies tube just as she was about to initiate her transmission
we dont know what caused it
i believe i may have the answer captain
i can tell by the expression on your face that youve got some bad news
i have no expression on my face however you are correct the news on two separate fronts is not good i checked the subspace bandwidths at least a partial signal was transmitted from voyager
enough for a borg ship to track
possibly
and the second front
i believe there is also cause for concern regarding kes
explain
internal sensor logs show that she destabilised the jefferies tube at the molecular level the effect weakened the infrastructure throughout the deck she wishes to develop her abilities further i am not certain it would be safe for kes or voyager
ive got an ocampan who wants to be something more and a borg whos afraid of becoming something less heres to vulcan stability wait for me
so this is human freedom
ive decided to keep you in the brig until im certain you wont try to harm us again if necessary the doctor can treat you here i honestly believed you were going to help us
you were not deceived captain janeway it was my intention to help you
what happened
there was a chance to contact the collective i took advantage of it your attempt to assimilated this drone will fail you can alter our physiology but you cannot change our nature we will betray you we are borg
ive met borg who were freed from the collective it wasnt easy for them to accept their individuality but in time they did youre no different granted you were assimilated at a very young age and your transition may be more difficult but it will happen
if it does happen we will become fully human
yes i hope so
we will be autonomous independent
thats what individuality is all about
if at that time we choose to return to the collective will you permit it
i dont think youll want to do that
you would deny us the choice as you deny us now you have imprisoned us in the name of humanity yet you will not grant us your most cherished human right to choose our own fate you are hypocritical manipulative we do not want to be what you are return us to the collective
you lost the capacity to make a rational choice the moment you were assimilated they took that from you and until im convinced youve gotten it back im making the choice for you youre staying here
then you are no different than the borg
talaxian champagne moonripened your favourite
neelix where did you get this
i put a bottle away for a special occasion remember when we last sipped this together
three years ago it was when we first arrived on voyager
and do you remember the toast i made
yes to the adventure
to the adventure when you left ocampa you said that your people were being held beck that if you were only given the chance you could become something so much more and you have
i know things have worked out exactly the way we planned
i was only holding you back thats obvious to me now
no i couldnt have come this far without you and i love you i always will its just er
my cooking youve always hated my cooking
thats exactly what it was
ah so tell me more about whats happening to you what does it all mean
i dont know and thats what makes it all so exciting its as if i can see into a place where the distinction between matter and energy and thought no longer exists and thats only the beginning i feel as if all the boundaries within me are about to fall away
it sounds ah sper ah interesting
i only have to look at an object to gaze at it and i can begin to see that the space between the atoms is being filled with something else
er kes
i can see them i can see
kes stop
no
neelix
captain im picking up some strange energy readings from deck two the mess hall
bridge to neelix whats going on down there neelix report
the bulkhead in that section is coming apart
increase the structural integrity field on deck two
tuvok
ive run every conceivable neural analysis everything short of dissecting the brain itself her telesynaptic activity is increasing but i dont know why or how to stop it have the ships internal sensors revealed anything
for seventeen point four seconds kess body went into a state of cellular flux she began to destabilise at the subatomic level
then for some reason her atoms reestablished their bonds and she was back in one piece
but what about the next time her condition is escalating we must find a way to suppress it or the last we see of kes could very well be her molecules blowing through the ventilation ducts
tuvok enhance the structural integrity fields throughout the ship if she has another incident id like to avoid a hull breach doctor maybe its time we broaden our horizons this appears to have gone beyond medical science were into particle physics now
ill try looking through the quantum substructure database maybe itll give me some inspiration
keep me informed
kes until i can devise another diagnostic procedure youre free to return to your quarters
actually id like to stay here help with the research
i dont want you to overexert yourself and risk precipitating another telepathic incident try to get some rest
just let me stay for a little while i havent seen you much over the past few days i miss you
all right just for a while
ensign ayala to the bridge
go ahead ensign
youd better come down to the brig maam
one one
my designation is seven of nine but the others are gone designations are no longer relevant i am one
yes you are
but i cannot function this way alone
youre not alone im willing to help you
if thats true you wont do this to me take me back to my own kind
you are with your own kind humans
i dont remember being human i dont know what it is to be human
what are you doing
im coming in
ill kill you
i dont think you will
do you remember her her name was annika hansen she was born on stardate 25479 at the tendara colony theres still a lot we dont know about her did she have any siblings who were her friends where did she go to school what was her favourite colour
irrelevant take me back to the borg
i cant do that
so quiet one voice
one voice can be stronger than a thousand voices your mind is independent now with its own unique identity
you are forcing that identity upon me its not mine
oh yes it is im just giving you back what was stolen from you the existence you were denied the child who never had a chance that life is yours to live now
dont want that life
its what you are dont resist it
no
come in captain
you wanted to see me ah tuvoks meditation lamp i was with him when he got it six years ago from a vulcan master who doubled the price when he saw our starfleet insignias
im sure it was the logical thing to do ive been thinking about everything thats been going on and i know what i have to do its time for me to leave voyager
oh kes
something important is happening to me and i want to explore it but i cant stay here any longer im a danger to all of you
were going to get to the bottom of this the doctors already working on a new approach
everybody thinks that whats happening is a medical condition thats not it at all im going though a transformation i dont know how or why but every cell in my body is telling me that im changing into something more
what if its not true what if youre simply being swept up in the excitement of something you think is happening but its not real on the basis of a feeling an intuition youre asking me to let you go quite likely for ever kes i just cant do that
its my decision my fate would you really try to stop me
no but argue with you even plead with you to reconsider absolutely for as long as it takes
it wont work look at me captain im the same kes youve always known i havent lost my judgment im not under some alien influence i believe something crucial is happening to me and i want to see it through
youve lived most of your life here voyager has been your home and youve been a vital part of this family oh im going to miss you
now all i have to do is tell the doctor hes not going to be happy
its starting
janeway to bridge
chakotay here
prepare a shuttle for launch and have tuvok meet me on deck six
captain
kes is leaving us
come on
captain i cant stop it
janeway to chakotay beam us directly to the shuttlebay
the molecules in kes body are destabilising its interfering with the transporter
captain we cant get a lock
acknowledged looks like were going to have to do this the hard way
whats happening
the hull is destabilising the molecular bonds are breaking down
tuvok i cant keep going
i will attempt a mind meld to help you delay the transformation our minds are one our thoughts are one try to regain control for a moment only for a moment only for a moment you must hurry
hull breach on decks three four and five
emergency containment fields
janeway to the bridge kes is aboard the shuttle initiate launch sequence
acknowledged
shuttle distance one hundred thousand kilometres speed one quarter impulse
can you hail her
ive been trying
whats happening whats happening to me
her atomic structure is completely destabilising
my gift to you
torres to bridge the warp core just came online
matter antimatter reaction at one hundred and
two percent a hundred and ten percent a hundred and twenty
this cant be right our speed is  its impossible
were coming apart
weve just dropped out of whatever it was we were in
systems coming back online
on screen where are we
nine point five thousand light years from where we just were
shes thrown us safely beyond borg space ten years closer to home
ive extracted eighty two percent of the borg hardware the remaining bioimplants are stable and better than anything i could synthesise at such short notice
it is acceptable
fashion of course is hardly my forte nevertheless ive managed to balance functionality and aesthetics in a pleasing enough manner i also took the liberty of stimulating your hair follicles a vicarious experience for me as you might imagine
youll have to spend a few hours each day regenerating in a borg alcove until your human metabolism can function on its own well leave one operational
understood
lets see how things go over the next few weeks ill consider granting you access to the rest of the ship once that i can trust that you wont try to get us all assimilated again
it will not happen again
good if you need anything contact me
red
what
the child you spoke of the girl her favourite colour was red
commander chakotay
i understand you wanted to see me
im told you are the officer in charge of personnel that you prepare the duty assignments is that the correct phrase
thats right
i am finding it difficult to spend so much time alone i am unaccustomed to it the hours do not pass quickly
i can understand that how can we help
ive been considering the matter carefully i would like to request a duty assignment
did you have something specific in mind
yes
now what
theres been a rupture in the coolant injector
i can see that why havent you sealed it off
i am attempting to do so
thats better
lieutenant i have an idea perhaps it would be advisable to reconfigure the coolant assembly that would give us greater control over the pressure valve emissions
youre probably right and tomorrow we can do it first thing but not today
i dont understand why wait until tomorrow today would be a much better
not today vorik
good morning heres the helm control evaluation you wanted
thank you
are we still on for dinner tonight
i may have to work ill let you know
ah ha okay have you decided if youre if youre going through with it
i have and im not today hasnt started out very well and the last thing i need is to get involved with some obscure klingon ritual
you were the one who suggested it
i know and for one sentimental minute i thought that i might actually go through with it but not anymore
of course not you wouldnt want to get too sentimental
i overslept this morning because i forgot to tell the computer to wake me and then the acoustic inverter in my sonic shower blew out
thatll make your hair stand on end
so i didnt have time for breakfast and when i got here two people were out sick so i had to cancel the fuel cell overhaul and then an injector burst for no apparent reason and started spewing plasma coolant
thats a run of bad luck all right
so i am in a bad mood and i know that i am being a little bit testy
no thats okay think about that dinner
be careful
something interesting just happened
whats that
seven of nine requested a duty assignment
fascinating
she wants to work in engineering
what
the borg use transwarp conduits to travel through space faster than warp speed if we could create one of them
we dont know anything about transwarp technology playing around with it could be dangerous
thats where seven of nine comes in shes offered to work with you
what do you think her real motives are
shes having a tough time making the transition from the collective she wants something to do
i never thought of you as naive chakotay the bottom line is i dont want her working in engineering
the bottom line is im giving you an order and youre going to follow it lieutenant
whatever you say sir
seven of nine you told me you wouldnt make any more attempts to contact the borg i want to believe thats true
i assure you it is
ive decided not to post a security detail while youre in engineering but you have to realise there are rules youll be expected to follow our protocols youll report directly to lieutenant torres and obey any order she gives you
i understand
one more thing your designation seven of nine its a little cumbersome wouldnt you prefer to be called by your given name annika
i have been seven of nine for as long as i can remember
all right but maybe we could streamline it a little how would you feel about seven
imprecise but acceptable
tuvok to captain janeway
yes tuvok
please come to the bridge a ship is approaching
its damaged but functional energy emissions are so low its probably not capable of warp speed several dozen lifesigns aboard we are being hailed captain
open a channel im captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager
i am rahmin my people are the caatati i apologise for our appearance and the condition of our ship most of our people were assimilated by the borg over a year ago we lost everything
how many of you escaped
a few thousand on thirty ships all thats left from a planet of millions
im sorry
captain i want to assure you my people were once proud and accomplished
i understand
it pains me to have to ask this but i have eighty eight people to care for on this vessel we need food medicines is there any way you could help us
of course send us a list of your needs and well see what we can do
im deeply grateful if its not too much to ask is there any way you might also spare a small quantity of thorium isotopes without them our systems cant function
i think we can arrange that ill speak to my engineer
you cant imagine what this means to us captain thank you
how are those thorium isotopes coming vorik
ill admit im having trouble controlling the neutron absorption
try increasing the temperature of the plasma get the thorium to the captain as soon as its ready
of course
tell me something when you hear about people like the caatati do you have any feelings of remorse
no
thats it just no
what further answer do you require
ohmaybe some kind of acknowledgement of the billions of lives you helped destroy a justification for what you did maybe a little sense of guilt
guilt is irrelevant
heartwarming
ive set the parameters for the tachyon bursts well need to create a transwarp conduit it will be several hours before the main deflector can be modified i think it would be best if i waited in my alcove
i think youre right
if i ever saw a job for the morale officer its sitting right here ill bet i can help
youre facing a big challenge neelix
i enjoy a challenge
is that supposed to make me feel better
blood pie for the day of honour
how did you know about that has tom been talking to you
not at all no i make it a point to know these things and if im correct many klingon families traditionally serve blood pie on the day of honour
i appreciate the gesture neelix but ive decided to ignore this particular tradition no blood pie no examining my behaviour over the last year to see if i measure up to klingon standards
understood lieutenant without knowing why theres a black cloud hanging over your head may i suggest something
go right ahead
you have a bit of a temper that you keep reined in and sometimes it builds up inside you until you explode at someone
id say that about sums it up
im offering to be a pressure valve
what
you may use me to blow off steam when youre angry come see me call me names insult me question my parentage i wont take it personally and you wont need to keep things bottled up inside anymore
that may be the nicest offer ive had in a long time thank you neelix youre sweet but im not sure i could do that to you
im here if you need me
neelix about this day of honour do you think i should go through with it
ive always thought traditions were good things worth preserving
ive been thinking a lot about the rituals that my mother taught me and they dont seem quite so hateful as they did when i was a child maybe being so far away from anything klingon has changed me
it certainly cant hurt to go through with the ceremony
i dont know what effect itll have on me thats whats frightening all right bring on the blood pie i can do this
qapla what warrior goes there
my names belanna
do you come to have your honour challenged
i guess so yes
are you willing to see the ceremony through to the end
thats the idea isnt it what do i do
it will be a lengthy ordeal first you must eat from the heart of a sanctified targ
paklogh yes the heart of targ brings courage to one who eats it next you will drink motlach from the grail of kahless drink to the glory of kahless the greatest warrior of all time
kahless defeated his enemies on the field of battle and built a mighty empire how have you proven yourself worthy
i havent built any empires and i cant say that ive personally defeated any enemies in battle but you have to realise im not living among warriors
then how do you expect to distinguish yourself
i dont know i guess im doing the best i can
huh a pitiful reply let us proceed a warrior must endure great hardship to test your mettle you will endure the ritual of twenty painsticks after that you will engage in combat with a master of the batleth finally you will traverse the sulphur lagoons of gorath
you know i dont think so i didnt want to do this before you described it certainly not now im leaving
not until you have completed the ceremony ptach
thanks so much its been lovely
come in
i tried to find you before but you were on the holodeck
thats right
you know you left it running there was a klingon in there who didnt look too happy
really
yeah and he was nursing a whale of a black eye looked like hed had a run in with someone having a really bad day
thats very funny
so howd it go
it didnt do you mind if we talk about something else
as a matter of fact i do you have been like a spitting cobra all day and its getting boring you know we designed that holodeck programme together and i think you owe me the courtesy of telling me what happened
it was ridiculous meaningless posturing honour dishonour what does it matter
it matters because its part of who you are youve been running away from that your whole life
who are you to tell me that
i care about you but if youre going to keep pushing me away then theres no point in my staying around is there
fine just leave me alone
dont worry if this is the way you treat people who try to be your friend youll be alone all right
there are over two hundred people on our three ships alone everyone of them suffers from malnourishment but its been hardest on the children every parent sacrifices for their child but even so theres not enough food if you could hear the crying of the babies you would have as much trouble sleeping at night as i do
have you considered relocation to a planet where you could grow your own food
of course but we havent been welcomed anywhere because we have no resources everyone treats us like vagrants even criminals
were not unsympathetic but we have limited supplies we cant possibly provide enough for all your people
forgive me but from my perspective you live in luxury you dont suffer from debilitating diseases you have many sources of energy replicators your crew is very well fed apparently keeping your bellies full is more important to you than helping those less fortunate
thats unfair these are the most generous people you could hope to meet but if we gave supplies to everyone who asked we wouldnt have anything left
neelix how much food can we spare
we could provide each ship with several hundred kilograms
do it and check with the doctor to see if he can spare any medical supplies
aye captain
thank you may the gods smile on you and your crew
tuvok please escort our guest to the transporter room
ive never navigated a transwarp conduit any problems i should be aware of
you have no idea what you are doing if we attempt to enter one ill have to take helm control
i am a quick study
what species is that
she is a human who lived as a borg
borg
she is disconnected from the collective she wont harm you
wheres my wife where are my children what did you do with them after you took them what did you do with my family
mister paris please proceed
i lost everything my family my home
sorry about that
about what
well the way he reacted to you
he didnt injure me
good
there are many people on this ship who have similar feelings towards me
im afraid youre right does that bother you
no
well im not one of those people we all have a past what matters is now
im uncertain what youre trying to say
that if theres any way i can help you adjust to your life here on voyager please ask me
i will remember your offer
all systems are ready
were only going to take a peek we open a conduit get as much sensor data as we can then close it up i want to take this one step at a time
ive set up a temporary tachyon matrix within the main deflector its online
engineering to the bridge
were ready to start captain
go ahead well monitor your progress from here
well need to be at warp speed to create a large enough subspace field id like to reroute helm control to engineering
agreed janeway out
take us past
past warp two i know were at warp two point three
all right vorik start emitting the tachyons
energising the matrix
theres no indication of a subspace field i recommend switching to a higher energy band
that did something
the subspace field is forming
tachyon particles are leaking into the propulsion system
shut down the deflector
done but the leak is continuing
janeway to engineering
the tachyons are flooding the warp core captain
if you cant stabilise the core immediately evacuate engineering
aye captain ill get back to you
ive cut all power relays but the tachyon levels are still rising
all right everybody out now that means you as well
i could be of help
thats an order
you cant order me i outrank you
weve got to neutralise the core
ill try decoupling the dilithium matrix
no effect try it again
its not working the core is about to breach
ive got to try one more thing
belanna theres no more time weve got to get out of here come on
computer prepare to eject the warp core authorisation torres omega phi nine three
computer eject the warp core torres to janeway
go ahead
weve dumped the core welcome to the worst day of my life
vorik we have to get those impulse engines back online you and nicoletti get started
yes lieutenant
report
were stopped dead the warp core is millions of kilometres away by now and the impulse engines are seriously damaged i can give you a few thrusters but thats about it
how long before i can have impulse power
i cant give you an estimate on that were still assessing the damage so much for opening a transwarp conduit i sent the borg back to her alcove we wont be needing her in here any more
at least the cores still intact tom take a shuttle and find it see if you can tractor it back to voyager
yes maam
itll be unstable it should be repaired before he tries to put a tractor beam on it
well then you go with him do whatever you have to just get it back here in one piece
were getting near some random ion turbulence
ill change course to avoid it
i wonder what else can go wrong today if we get this core back im going right to bed and sleeping straight through till tomorrow get this day over with
well look at it this way how much worse could it get having to dump the warp core has to be the low point of any day
maybe its me maybe im asking for this trouble somehow
or maybe its just a streak of bad luck sensors have picked up a polymetallic object could be the core
thats the warp signature all right theres something else out there a ship according to sensors it has the same energy signature as the caatati ships
maybe theyre guarding it for us
right
i see it what do they think theyre doing
theyre trying to put a tractor beam on it
this is the shuttle cochrane to the caatati vessel please respond
dont come any closer were performing a salvage operation
oh what a coincidence so are we
im afraid we got here first dont interfere or well open fire
dont you realise that core is highly unstable if you try to tractor it like that you could cause an antimatter explosion
theyre not answering
idiots
we have to stop them from destroying the core
im going to try and disrupt their tractor beam
its working
what was that
they sent an antimatter pulse back through our particle beam
warning structural integrity field has been compromised now at fifty three percent and falling hull breach in two minutes twenty seconds
reroute power from the propulsion and weapons systems
warning hull breach in two minutes ten seconds
no effect
warning the structural integrity field has collapsed hull breach in two minutes
we have to get out of here
warning hull breach in one minute fifty seconds
computer send a distress call to voyager give them our coordinates computer respond
the comm systems must be down
transporters are still online stand by to energise energise
paris to voyager do you read me please respond paris to voyager
its no use the comm system in these suits wont carry that far
when they get the impulse engines repaired theyll come looking for us
well i dont plan on just drifting here hoping someone will just come along and rescue us there must be something we can do
agreed if we could interplex the comm systems in both suits we might be able to create a phased carrier wave voyager would read the signature and know its from us
good idea let me access your controls
i thought youd never ask
thats it this would be a lot easier if i had a hyperspanner hold still
why is it we have to get beamed into space in environmental suits before i can initiate first contact procedures
why is it that if were alone for more than thirty seconds you start thinking about contact
ah that is not fair the other day in engineering i must have gone four minutes before i started thinking about it
okay im ready to initiate the carrier wave
ah ah
sorry better
yeah lets hope its still that strong by the time it gets to voyager
come in would you like tea or coffee
i have no need to ingest liquids i still receive energy from the borg alcove
my understanding is that youre almost ready to begin eating food
that is what the doctor says why have you asked me here
whenever theres an accident on the ship even a minor one we investigate itin order to minimise the chances of its happening again
a prudent course of action
i didnt have a chance to talk to lieutenant torres before she left the ship so i wanted to ask you some questions about what happened in engineering sensor logs indicate the tachyons were leaking into the warp core do you have any idea how it started
no we had reconfigured the deflector shield to emit tachyon bursts the procedure must have triggered the leak
who was controlling the tachyon bursts
ensign vorik
what were you doing
monitoring the transwarp frequencies
and did you at any time access deflector control
you believe im responsible for the accident that i deliberately sabotaged the ship you are like the others you see me as a threat
i wont lie to you part of me is suspicious weve dealt with tachyon fields before and never had this kind of problem
captain i am unaccustomed to deception among the borg it was impossible there were no lies no secrets and i assure you i had nothing to do with the accident in engineering
i believe you thank you
i am finding it a difficult challenge to integrate into this group it is full of complex social structures that are unfamiliar to me compared with the borg this crew is inefficient and contentious but it is capable of surprising acts of compassion
unexpected acts of kindness are common among our group thats one of the ways we define ourselves
is there anything more
yes we still have to find out what caused the tachyon leak tell me what you remember about the power fluctuations in the propulsion system
this isnt anything like the simulations we had at the academy they felt peaceful like floating in the womb but right now im feeling a little sick to my stomach
you dropped out too soon in the third year theres a six week course of actual spacewalks so you can get used to them
i never would have lasted to the third year if i hadnt dropped out they would have asked me to leave
i wish id known you then
youd have hated me
i cant imagine a time i wouldnt have found you fascinating
what the hell was that
more ion turbulence
warning oxygen level at one hundred fourteen millibars
my oxygen supply is leaking
warning oxygen level at ninety three millibars
well have to share mine
are you getting air now
yes much better thanks whats wrong
the turbulence must have damaged my suit too i should have at least twenty four hours worth of oxygen but theres only about a half hour left
engineering to captain janeway
yes ensign
im pleased to inform you that impulse power should be restored
within the hour
good news let me know the minute the engines are online
yes maam
captain i believe ive found the cause of the accident erratic fluctuations in the ships warp power when tachyon levels rose to a resonant frequency core pressure increased
then it was an accident come in
captain weve picked up a carrier wave with a starfleet signature id guess its tom and belanna but theyre not answering our hails
they may be in trouble as soon as we get impulse power
tuvok to the captain can you come to the bridge
on my way
were being approached by an armada of caatati ships
theyre hailing us
on screen
hello captain
youve brought some friends
needy friends were hoping you will offer us more supplies
i made it clear last time that we couldnt possibly you with enough for all your ships
and i had to accept that because your ship is more powerful than ours but the situation has changed hasnt it you seem to be at a disadvantage now we have your warp core you cant escape im hoping thatll make you more generous
weve given you everything we can spare return the core and well be on our way
one of our ships might not seem threatening to you but i assure you twenty seven can inflict considerable damage we are desperate prepare to send us food weapons and your entire supply of thorium and that borg youre protecting we want her too there are many whod enjoy a chance to repay one of them for what they did to us
im lowering the oxygen ratio that should give us a few more minutes
im feeling kind of groggy
oxygen deprivation
and youre lowering it
we have to try to make it last as long as possible
its ironic isnt it
what
today the day of honour is the day that im going to die
we are not going to die would you stop talking like that
we have to face up to it tom
theres something ive been wanting to ask you
well nows the time
when we first met you didnt have a very high opinion of me
thats putting it mildly i thought you were an arrogant self absorbed pig
flattery wont get you any more oxygen do you think ive changed
a lot now youre a stubborn domineering pig im just kidding there i go again just pushing you away you were right about me its what i do push people away
well its a sure fire way of not getting hurt
what a coward i am
shush
our weapons are more powerful than theirs i say we fight
maybe if we give them something
like what i cant imagine what would satisfy them now
i will go they asked for me if i surrender myself perhaps theyll let you leave
thats very generous but i will not turn you over to them
i was only offering to do what would be best for this group
youre part of this group now and were going to protect you its time to stop talking about this tom and belanna are in trouble and we have to find them tuvok whats the status of our weapons array
weapons are at the ready captain but our shield strength is extremely low
well have to shut down nonessential systems reroute power to the shields were going to fight
that might not be necessary caatati technology is dependent on thorium isotopes if they had enough they could become selfsustaining
but we dont have that much thorium to give them
when the borg assimilated the caatati the survivors lost their ability to replicate the isotopes but i have retained that knowledge i could design an energy matrix that would produce thorium in large quantities
if youve had this knowledge all along why didnt you say so
i am not accustomed to thinking that way borg do not consider giving technology away only assimilating it
and what do you suppose made you consider it now
i am not certain
maybe it was just an unexpected act of kindness work with vorik to build the energy matrix while i convince the caatati theres a better way out of this
this matrix will produce nine hundred forty four grammes of thorium per day
now you can power all your systems and begin to rebuild your replication technology will you allow us to leave
one device isnt enough for all our ships
using this matrix as a template you can construct as many as you like we can provide you with components and specifications
you are free to go and thank you
youre welcome
warning oxygen level at one hundred four millibars
tom come on open your eyes
warning oxygen level at eighty seven millibars
i was having a dream
theres something i have to say
me too im glad the last thing ill see is you
ive been a coward about everything everything that really matters
now youre being a little hard on yourself
no im going to die without a shred of honour and for the first time in my life that really bothers me so i have to tell you something i
warning oxygen level at seventy one millibars
i have to tell you the truth
the truth about what
i love you say something
you picked a great time to tell me
voyager to tom paris tom do you read me respond
were here
prepare to beam aboard
dont move
whats this
we found him in the trunks a hundred footfalls past grove yellow
arms
none sir
these colours
we didnt ask
hes no krady beast is he
no sir but he doesnt bear vori colours either
hmm his glimpse is too tame to be a kradin
i hadnt fathomed that sir
well fathom it now hes no nemesis is he
im not certain what he is sir
werent you drilled to fathom the nemesis
yes sir
and we abhor none but the nemesis do we
no sir none but the nemesis
then set him loose didnt you hear novice
thanks
go take provisions
im sorry sir
go
i take it youre in charge here
team leader brone fourth vori defence contingent
commander chakotay of the starship voyager
im very sorry for my defenders theyre new to the clash and glimpse the nemesis all around them
the clash youre at war
youve strayed into the fullness of it
that explains why my shuttle came under fire
one of my defenders glimpsed a vessel falling in grove yellow it must have been yours why fly so close to this sphere
i was on a survey mission i picked up traces of omicron radiation in your atmosphere so i slowed down to take a look as soon as i did that i came under attack i lost helm control and had to make an emergency transport to the surface
itll be the kradin that fired at you
the kradin
our nemesis
i see well i tried to explain that i had no hostile intentions but they just kept shooting
the nemesis crave supremacy in the air they fire on any craft that doesnt show kradin colours
i tried to contact my ship but my communicators not working
all dispatching in the clash zone has been suppressed
i have to find my vessel maybe its salvageable
thats little likely were ordered to cluster with the seventh contingent two new lights from now theyll have means to signal your people you can make the walk with us to meet them
i appreciate the offer but i cant wait two days i have to find my vessel now
it wouldnt be sharp to return to the trunks the nemesis is everywhere there
then ill have to do my best to steer clear of them
if your tactic wont change
it wont
its sharper to wait for the new light
then ill take your advice and wait
provisions its not so savoury
thanks im sure itll be fine
they call me rafin
chakotay pleased to meet you
in the trunks did you glimpse any
any what
krady beasts
no i didnt
rafins never glimpsed the face of the nemesis either have you rafin
no its my first walk in the clash zone
youll glimpse them in the soon after when you do youll fathom theres no heart thumping beneath their flesh how many beasts will you send to the wayafter rafin
i couldnt say
me ill nullify one for each brother and cousin that ive lost and then one more after true or not my allies
true
so i ask you again rafin how many will you nullify
as many as im able
youve got the trembles if you dont wrestle your trembles to rages ally the nemesisll nullify you
this nemesis of yours why do you call them beasts
its told they all wear the same horrid face their flesh is gnarled and blistery like the rotting trunks their glimpses flame like fire and if you dare near enough their breath stinks of muck
you know sometimes people say terrible things about their enemies to make them seem worse than they really are there might be some young kradin soldier out there whos more afraid of you than you are of him
the nemesis wasnt scared to fume my village nor scared to nullify my cousins and brothers in their sleep and my old mothers mother too who never told an unkind word nor nullified an insect in all her days and nights on this sphere
thats pretty rough
and who but a krady beast would leave the nullified bodies of mine and ours upturned so theyll never descend to the gloried wayafter
what do you mean by upturned
which of you will walk with chakotay to find his craft when the new light comes
i appreciate the offer but ill be fine on my own
you dont fathom the trunks and you dont carry arms one of my defenders will walk with you which will it be you rafin
sir i i
ill walk with the stranger sir if any beast comes to clash ill nullify the beast
well told namon now close your glimpses defenders and dream of your sisters and mothers
have you never nullified another stranger
killings the worst thing ive ever had to do
then the nemesis you nullified wasnt half so beastly as the kradin
maybe not
in their glimpsers were less than nothing they flame our homes take our plantings make playthings of our sisters if you were a vori youd crave to drive them from this sphere just as i do
maybe i would if they did things like that to the people i loved but on the sphere i come from we try to find other ways to resolve differences peaceful solutions negotiations
you dont fathom the nemesis
no i suppose i dont
beg the power you believe in that you never will the light will be old soon wed be sharp to cluster with the others
in a few minutes we should be getting close
youd be sharp to do my tellings
go back if you want to ive got to keep looking
no wait i pledged to walk with you glimpse there
it doesnt look like theres much left of my shuttle
youll have to make the walk with us to the seventh contingent
dont make me kill you
how is he
nullified
we beg peace from the power who made us vori and we commend our brother namon to the gloried wayafter
whats this
namons coverings
shouldnt they go to his family or someone he was close to
its a long walk to the cluster mark its sharper to blend with the trunks your fleet colours will get us all nullified
im sorry about what happened to namon
the nemesis has nullified mine and ours in the before and will in the now but in the soonafter well send them flying from this sphere and go back to our sisters and mothers
take it
this isnt my war im not planning to shoot anybody
if we greet the nemesis in the trunks youll fire like the rest as long as youre with us you do my tellings fathom
fathom
rafin
yes sir
drill chakotay to fire vori arms
now you your glimpse is too low with these arms its sharper to aim higher than the mark
youre good
dont mock me
i was paying you a compliment
it is one matter to fire at clay marks but much another to nullify the nemesis thats what namon told and he told the truth before he went to the gloried wayafter
he was right killings not easy
risking my own days and nights to drive the nemesis from our sphere that should be as easy as a long sleep
who told you that
my brothers and uncles who were in the clash brone my driller and namon my ally who was nullified because of me
you think its your fault that namon died
if i didnt have the cowards trembles i would have walked with you in the trunks and it would be me and not he who went to the wayafter
you werent the one who pulled the trigger rafin and theres no shame in being afraid of fighting having the trembles is natural
how do you fathom that
because ive been in battle before fighting to free my people from a nemesis called the cardassians
these cardassians were they beasts
lets just say they werent very friendly the point is even though i believed in what we were doing i always felt fear before a fight
but you wrestled your trembles to rages didnt you
i guess i did but that doesnt mean
i was told to drill you chakotay but its you whove drilled me drilled me to fathom the rages
brone
what is it
i dont know
neckstrapped and upturned left to be cooked by the glare
hes one of yours
by his coverings hes of the seventh contingent likely a scout walker
desecrated by the kradin
hell never turn his face to the wayafter
were three hundred footfalls from the cluster mark signal the seventh again
why dont they answer
is it possible they moved their camp for some reason
little likely you two fast walk to the cluster mark and glimpse what you can
sir
what
let me go
well told novice keep the talk low and your glimpse wide
sir
what have you glimpsed
the seventh contingent sir nullified
what all of them
at least twenty defenders and thats not the whole telling of it theyre all theyre all
tell it rafin theyre all how
like him sir upturned staked to the dirt up and upturned
those motherless krady beasts do you glimpse the fullness of it now stranger
yes i think i do
now you fathom why we name them beasts and not men
im sorry
were much more than sorry arent we defenders
yes sir
the nemesis wants your plantings
true true
he wants your homes he wants your sisters but does it suffice him to nullify you no he craves to shame you mock you keep you from the gloried wayafter were wearied of it arent we
yes sir
were wrestled to the rages for it arent we
yes sir
and were not going to swallow it not in the now or in the soonafter
assault apply yourselves and fire back
motherless beasts
rafin no stay down
ill nullify you all
hold on im gonna get you out of here
please turn my face to the wayafter
a defender mark neighbours a defender
welcome to larhana settlement gloried defender youre brightly greeted
according to the ambassador chakotays shuttle was hit by enemy fire and crashlanded somewhere on the southernmost continent
right in the middle of the war zone
im afraid so
can we get a lock on him
theres too much atmospheric radiation from weapons fire we cant scan the surface
which means we dont know if hes still alive
why dont we assume he still is
i should have gone with him
its not your fault tom we couldnt have anticipated this what weve got to do now is figure out how to deal with it belanna try to modify the scanners cut through the interference
aye captain
neelix what do you know about this war
its vicious ambassador treens people have been defending themselves against a particularly savage aggressor for more than a decade
is the ambassador willing to help us find chakotay
hes willing but he may not be able
his resources are extremely limited and the situation on the surface is chaotic
but hes assured me that if his troops do find chakotay hell receive medical attention and be transported to the nearest command post
lets hope he doesnt meet up with these savage aggressors first
captain let me lead a team down there and bring him back
i understand how you feel tom but lets take it one step at a time tuvok recontact ambassador treen ask for any tactical support hes willing to provide maps weapons analyses intelligence reports before i risk anyone elses life i want to know exactly what were getting ourselves into
by your coverings youre a novice defender do i tell the truth
listen theres been a misunderstanding im not a defender my shuttle was shot down by the kradin and i landed in the clash zone i met up with one of your patrols they gave me this uniform
which contingent
the fourth
the fourth theyre sturdy clashers
tell us did you and your allies drive the nemesis from the trunks
we put up a brave fight
then youre a gloried defender even if you claim not to be
marna tells the truth chakotay you are welcome among my neighbours
thank you thats very kind
do you crave anything more drink warm coverings
what i really need is some communications equipment to contact my crew
we have no means to signal your people
the kradin drove us from our homes and plantings and took all the machinery we had
do you know where i might find some place with communications equipment
the restock unit
can you tell me how to get there
its not very near at least ten thousand footfalls through the thick of the trunks
then id better get started
the new light is coming rest till then
yes please chakotay rest until the new light
i think i will
come neighbours lets give defender chakotay some quiet
i wanted to know if you crave more
no thank you
oh
but it was delicious
and the blossoms do you like them i planted them myself
theyre very pretty
ive heard tellings that the kradin leave our nullied defenders upturned is it true you can tell me penno says im too small to be told but im not
its true the kradin dont respect your beliefs
the kradin are beasty i dont fathom why they flamed our homes nor why they crave to nully us all
i dont either
we never took their plantings we never nullied their brothers so why do they hate us
i wish i could tell you hates not something i understand very well
my brothers a defender too
really
he left for the clash two plantings before i was much smaller then he was sturdy and pleasing to glimpse in his colours like you maybe youve glimpsed him hes called daryo
there are a lot of soldiers in the war i only met a few of them
hes a team leader of the seventh defence contingent
the seventh are you sure he was with the seventh
theyre very sturdy in the clash have you heard of them
the patrol i was with was supposed to rendezvous with them
why didnt you you would have glimpsed him
we were ambushed before we had the chance
but when you go back to the clash maybe youll glimpse daryo then you could take a letter to him
im not going back to the clash zone ive got to get to the restock unit so i can contact my ship
then you can bring my letter to the restock unit maybe some defender there can take it to daryo will you do it please ill go write it now before the new light comes
i wish you a good day
thank you
provisions for your long walk
walk well defender chakotay
thank you both youve all been very kind
writings for my brother youll be sure he gets them
ill do my best
your best will be enough the pretty smell of the blossoms will hold the nemesis far away
then youd better keep one for yourself
offer no opposition or you will be nullified
no evidence of cellular residue on the shuttle wreckage so theres a chance chakotay survived the crash
unfortunately the wreckage was found inside enemy territory
so there is also a chance he has been captured or killed by the nemesis
there you go looking on the bright side again tuvok
whats this nemesis
it is the term ambassador treens people use to identify their enemy
apparently theyre vicious they shoot without warning use biochemical weapons routinely massacre civilians if we run into them its safe to say they wont be hanging out a welcome sign
i want a team on the surface as soon as possible
i was hoping youd say that tuvok lets get moving
i must caution you both my tactical analysis does not bode well for the success of such a mission given the situation in the battle zone there is a very high probability that an away team will sustain heavy casualties
are you saying we should just abandon chakotay
on the contrary
i suppose youve come up with an alternative plan
indeed i have concluded that the least risky course of action is for a single crew member to make the infiltration accompanied by a commando unit that ambassador treen has agreed to provide
fine with me when do i leave
something tells me thats not what tuvok has in mind
naturally i am the logical person to carry out this mission
naturally
get down there
chakotay
i heard the explosions and i came back to help
what did the kradin do to you
they interrogated me wheres your grandfather
i dont know hes very grey and his hearts not sturdy he needs me to tend him
you you i want to talk to your superior hey im talking to you i want to know what youve done to this girls grandfather hes old and needs medical atte  argh
chakotay penno always tells itll be brighter when the new light comes
your grandfathers a wise man
thats right get some sleep
youll tend me wont you no matter what comes in the soonafter
close your glimpsers and dream of your gloried brother
come along vori move along
where are they taking them
i dont know
theyll be fast walked to the extermination facility
why
because theyre grey and too longlived the kradin think them unfit for toiling they wont make good servers like us
offer no resistance
penno penno
karya
where are they taking you
be sturdy my daughters daughter
whos going to tend you
well glimpse each other again in the wayafter
set him loose
karya
set him loose
be still
keep your hands off her dont touch her
whats the matter pretty one
set my mothers father loose
is that the man you mean
no karya
please set him loose
you dont want to see him suffer do you pretty one
no
dont worry the old voris suffering will be over soon enough
no penno
take this shrieking waif to the extermination facility
no chakotay set me loose chakotay help me
motherless beast
are ambassador treen and his soldiers ready to beam aboard
aye captain
energise
welcome aboard ambassador thank you for agreeing to help us find our crewman
your thanks are unnecessary captain any victim of our bloodthirsty nemesis the vori will always find friends among the kradin people
chakotay be calm now ill set you loose sorry to leave you upturned so long but i had to shroud myself in the trunks till the kradin walked on
the villagers from larhana settlement
they were fast walked through the trunks
and your defenders
all nullified
thank you for coming back for me you put yourself at risk
and you chakotay clashed beside us against the kradin though you are a stranger to this sphere i glimpsed you chancing your days and nights to save rafin from our nemesis
you tell the truth when you name them beasts what will you do now that your men are gone
join with the fifth contingent theyre trying to free the villagers it doesnt go brightly for them
ill come with you
no ill bring you to command you can signal your people
that can wait till the soonafter in the now you need my help to nullify the nemesis
back walk back walk the nemesis is nearing its sharper to back walk
brone
vori soldiers you are surrounded lay down your arms and surrender
hold your fire
youll have to nullify me first
hold your fire commander chakotay do not fire commander
how do you know my name
i am lieutenant tuvok
tuvok dont walk any closer
ive come to take you back to voyager
nullify him chakotay its a kradin tactic
i assure you commander this is no ruse it is lieutenant tuvok dont you recognise me
hes the nemesis
youre a kradin beast you destroyed that village nullified penno took away karya she was only a child
theyve brainwashed you commander look closer try to recall your shuttle was shot down these people the vori they captured you
no they rescued me
that is what they want you to believe they have been indoctrinating you training you to fight their war
take one more step and ill nullify you
you are commander chakotay of the starship voyager you are a scientist an explorer you are not a killer
tuvok
yes commander
how can you wear those colours theyre kradin theyre beasts murderers
on the contrary they are the ones who helped us locate you we tracked you to a vori training camp we infiltrated the facility but you were gone they had already brought you here to fight this battle before today nothing you experienced here was real it is the method the vori use to conscript and train soldiers
i dont believe you
i will prove it to you if you will lower your weapon
do you recognise this place
its larhana settlement
a defender mark neighbours a defender defender karya
welcome to larhana settlement gloried defender you are brightly greeted
my guess is the vori used a combination of mind control techniques including photometric projections heightened emotional stimuli and highly sophisticated psychotropic manipulation from the condition of your hypothalamus id say they had you so mixed up they could have convinced you your own mother was a turnip
everything i experienced was some sort of simulation
except for the battle you were fighting when tuvok found you apparently attacking the simulated commandant marked your graduation from basic training
and the men i fought beside none of them was real namon and rafin werent killed in front of me
as far as we can tell they were part of the simulation the idea was to make you bond with your fellow soldiers as well as the villagers so their deaths would enrage you
why me
luck of the draw you happened to be passing through their space and you were as promising a recruit as anyone else weve been told the vori have dozens of these training facilities where they conscript their own people and any aliens theyre able to capture
in short commander youve been subjected to a highly sophisticated form of propaganda
then the kradin dont kill innocent civilians they dont desecrate the voris dead
i dont know but the kradin accuse the vori of the same kinds of atrocities
i cared about the vori but i hated the kradin i wanted to kill every one of them
evidently that was the point
captain ambassador treen would like a word with the commander
i wish to tell you how pleased my people are to hear of your recovery im only sorry we werent able to rescue you sooner from our nemesis have i said something wrong
i dont know
if youll excuse me captain
chakotay
i wish it were as easy to stop hating as it was to start
to any vessels within range i hope this message reaches you im an hd25 isomorphic projection theres been an accident my crew is dead im alone please help me
so we rigged the security console so that every time tuvok accessed the internal sensors it would play a little message
live long and prosper
no matter what button he pushed live long and prosper
naturally no one was available to fix the malfunction
so tuvok had to stretch his vulcan patience to the limit for the rest of the day
i swear you could hear him grinding his teeth from across the bridge
and just when he thought it was over when he went back to his quarters and ordered a cup of vulcan tea the replicator says
live long and prosper
the first time i met tuvok he dressed me down in front of three starfleet admirals for failing to observe proper tactical procedures during my first command my human ego took a little bruising but of course he was right  over the past nine years ive come to rely on his insightful and unfailingly logical advice for outstanding services chief tactical and security officer its my pleasure to grant you the rank of lieutenant commander congratulations tuvok
thank you captain had i known this commendation entailed ritual humiliation i might have declined however i accept it with gratitude and will honour the responsibility that comes with it during my three years on voyager i have grown to respect a great many of you others i have learned to tolerate as your tactical officer i will continue to do my best to ensure a safe passage home as a vulcan i share the following sentiment live long and prosper
bravo well deserved
belanna this is ridiculous its been three days and we havent said a word to each other
i know i know we have to talk
about what you said i mean the part about being in love with me i realise you were suffering from oxygen deprivation and we were literally seconds away from death so i know you probably didnt mean it
no no i meant it but i dont expect you to reciprocate really you can just pretend that i didnt say it in fact lets just pretend that i didnt
shut up
mister paris there you are
i was just leaving lieutenant
what can i do for you doc
the captain has authorised me to recruit someone with advanced medical training to help out in sickbay unfortunately the most qualified crewmember is you
you want me to be the new nurse
if thats the title you prefer it will only be temporary three duty shifts a week report to sickbay and oh six hundred hours bring a tricorder and a smile
what kind of modifications
weve like to enhance the astrometrics lab it hasnt been upgraded since voyager left spacedock
ill start right away
ive assigned seven of nine to work with you shes agreed to provide us with all the navigational data for this area she acquired during her time with the borg is there a problem
no no problem
try to make her feel like part of the team
right part of the team
have you made arrangement for the arritheans for tomorrow
the delegate says hes looking forward to trading with such an advanced starship
youve done an excellent job preparing for this mission neelix i think you should consider this your first official assignment as ambassador
ensign culhane to the captain
janeway here
we are receiving an automated distress call five light years from here you might want to bring the doctor
im an hd25 isomorphic projection theres been an accident my crew is dead im alone please help me
hes a hologram weve got to help him ensign track the source of the transmission
once we find the ship ill lead an away team
i dont recall giving you a promotion today
oh well im the obvious choice to provide assistance to a holographic being
doctor i dont want you leaving voyager unless its absolutely necessary im still concerned about damaging your mobile emitter
i understand but if this is a hologram one of my own kind so to speak id like to meet him study him ill bring lieutenant torres just to be safe she knows more about my emitter than anyone
the rest of us will meet with the arritheans well see you there when youre finished
thank you captain
seven
i am here
am i to work with you
oh hi yes i thought wed start in jefferies tube thirty two b enhance the astrometric sensors if thats okay with you unless this is a bad time maybe i can come back later
ensign kim you seem apprehensive
no not at all
the last time we worked together i struck you at the base of your skull and attempted to contact the collective
these things happen
i assure you it will not happen again
thats good to know
ive designed new navigational sensors some of the alphanumerics are borg
no problem i always wanted to learn borg
that is difficult to believe
i was kidding it was a joke you know humour
i understand the concept of humour it may not be apparent but i am often amused by human behaviour
relax doctor im sure well find the ship
thats not what im concerned about ive been questioning the wisdom of leaving mister paris in charge of my sickbay
tom will do fine hes a very responsible guy
well i suppose youd know better than i would
whats that supposed to mean
you seem to have become good friends
lets get one thing straight i dont appreciate you or anyone else speculating about the kind of friendships i have or who i have them with
sorry i didnt realise id struck a nerve perhaps youd like a tranquilliser
there it is
thats his ship try hailing it
no response
lifesigns
a few energy readings but theyre erratic propulsion and main power are down
were approaching transporter range
hello is anyone here were here to help you
no signs of life
not yet
id like to check your mobile emitter make sure you made it through the transport okay
for a klingon you have a decent bedside manner
thanks
i wonder what kind of bedside manner mister paris will exhibit that was a rhetorical question lieutenant
your holographic matrix is stable let me check your emitters power cells
you might want to consider a career in medicine
where the hell did this come from
sorry sorry sorry i didnt mean to frighten you
you sent the distress call
yes yes thats me it was me and you youre an isomorph like myself
we use the term hologram
hologram and you youre a hologram too
no
youre organic
ah thats one way of putting it yes
it looks like your programme is fairly compatible with our holographic technology can you tell me where i can access your projection controls
why
youre obviously malfunctioning maybe i can repair you
oh of course id appreciate that over there you can access my systems from that console
what happened here
oh it was terrible just terrible you see we left seros eight months ago seros thats our home planet with a crew of six
all isomorphic projections
no just me im an hd25 maintenance unit with extreme hazard clearance im responsible for cleaning the reactor core ejecting antimatter waste that sort of thing when the crew got sick there was nothing i could do im not designed for medical functions i i
try to calm down explain what happened one step at a time
two of the crew members left to survey a planet when they came back theyd been infected by a deadly virus it spread quickly to the other organics on board and one by one welli watched them all die then things started to malfunction here ive limited knowledge of the controls i dont know what i would have done if you hadnt come
i think ive stabilised your programme but ill need access to your primary isomatrix where is it
on the lower deck you you shouldnt go down there
why not
too dangerous that decks been flooded with antimatter radiation organic flesh would disintegrate within seconds you can access my isomatrix from this deck theres an interface junction in that compartment
thanks
mind if i run a quick diagnostic
whats your name
i dont have a name its a long story
id like to hear it and everything else about you
im ready to supply power to the enhanced sensors
what already
yes you believe that my work is unsuitable
of course not just checking standard procedure
i may no longer possess borg perfection but my experience as a drone has taught me to be efficient and precise
actually youve misaligned this optical assembly
impossible
take a look its off by point five degrees
it must have been my humanity reasserting itself i will correct the error
so what do you do for fun down in cargo bay two
fun
you know relaxation entertainment during your off hours
i regenerate in my alcove i study the starfleet database and i contemplate my existence
thats a lot of time by yourself
it is the optical assembly is properly aligned im ready to access the main power supply
after you
wait what are you doing there are five million gigawatts running through there
the exoskeleton on this limb can withstand it
thats all well and good but there are safety procedures weve got to follow
your procedures are a waste of time
maybe so but youve been assigned to me and i say we do this by the book all right
all right
well now that weve got that cleared up
you can use this emitter to go anywhere
well my captain has imposed a few restrictions but im free to leave sickbay join away missions take a stroll
extraordinary ive never left this vessel before and until the crew got sick i ever even left the antimatter storage chamber do you know what its like spend your life trapped inside a tiny room not knowing whats beyond the door what the world is really like nobody coming to see you or talk to you unless they want something
actually i know exactly what its like when i was first activated i was regarded as little more than a talking tricorder i had to ask for the privileges i deserved the right to be included in crew briefings the ability to turn my programme on and off its taken some time but i believe ive earned the respect of the crew as an equal
an equal
ive also been pursuing personal interests art literature music perhaps you could do the same
oh no no no my programmers on seros would never allow that
then youll convince them maybe theyll appreciate how well youve coped with this situation how youve managed to find help think about it youve already exceeded the sum of your subroutines
what are you doing
nothing er nothing im just sterilising the ship im fastidious about germs i know that must sound strange coming from an artificial being
not at all ive been known to act a little strangely myself
hungry youre organic you require nutrients theyre only rations but our crew liked them
careful thats an isomimetic conduit you could destabilise your matrix
of course how stupid of me im sorry i shouldnt have barged in here
its all right i could use a break thank you
you nibble like a fish
ill take that as a compliment
oh it is ive never seen a fish beforenot a real one but ive read about them on our database fish arent like other organics theyre more passive i think most of them and so clean is there anything i can do to help with repairs
as soon as im done with lunch you could help me access your primary matrix
gladly
is something wrong
seeing the ship ripped apart like this its i i guess i cant help feeling a kind of affinity for this vessel it sustains my existence sometimes i feel like its a part of my body my soul that probably sounds silly to you
no no i understand how you feel
you couldnt possibly understand how i feel youre an organic you exist apart from your ship i understand how you feel
im sorry i didnt mean to offend you
youre the one whos trapped not me you spend your entire life stuck inside a biological cage of flesh and bone and blood
right im going to go give the doctor an update
i exist as pure energy but you depend on food and water to survive frankly i find it disgusting look at you look at you grinding up bits of plants and animals with your teeth secreting saliva to force it down your oesophagus into a pit of digestive acids you cant even stand to think about it yourself what a repulsive creature you are constantly shedding your skin and hair leaving your oily sweat on everything you touch you think that you are the height of intellect in the universe but you are no better than any filthy animal and i am ashamed to be made in your image my apologies my apologies i have acquired some hostility towards organics it was not meant for you i was treated quite badly by the crew here
im sorry to hear that but you have to realise that were here to help you thanks for the rations
weve got a problem
oh
i think theres a problem with our isomorph and im not talking about his emitters
explain
ive just spent the last ten minutes hearing his views on biological life lets just say theyre a bit unconventional did you realise that we organics are a bunch of inferior disgusting animals
now that you mention it
he started ranting about how much he despises organics i didnt think i was going to get out of there without a fight
i will admit he is somewhat socially inept
inept hes a lunatic
that is hardly a sound medical diagnosis
he has also been lying to us i just ran a tricorder scan of the lower deck the one he said was flooded with radiation well its not
why would he lie about that
i dont know maybe he doesnt want us to go down there maybe hes hiding something
i understand your concerns lieutenant ive been talking to him as well and i recognise that he has some behavioural difficulties but imagine what hes been through trapped in a room no bigger than a storage compartment and hes had almost no interaction with organic beings its only natural hed developed problems communicating even a little resentment do you recall my own behaviour when i was first activated
how could i forget you were a major pain in the
my point is i too was somewhat alienated from the rest of the crew it took me a few days to master the social graces
i realise that he is a fellow hologram and that you are committed to helping him but i want the ability to shut down his programme if i have to
if you really feel thats necessary
im going to search the lower deck see if i can access his primary isomatrix you keep him occupied until i get back i dont think hed appreciate a filthy animal like me snooping around
am i interrupting
no actually i was just leaving
id like you to meet someone doctor this is spectrum
a holographic fish
magnificent isnt he so peaceful and so content i programmed him to keep me company dont you have a pet
oh it wouldnt be appropriate not in a medical environment
they wouldnt let me have one either i had to hide him
hes very lifelike i didnt realise you had such a talent for holographic design
oh ive programmed all sorts of things
this node contains borg navigational data
how do we get it out of here
the proper instrument was part of my thoracic assembly before the doctor removed it i suggest a radical dislocation
a what
we need to pull it out assist me
okay on three
three
on the count of three we pull together
crude but effective
one two three
ive been damaged
ooo that looks pretty bad youd better get to sickbay
as a drone i would have regenerated within seconds ive become weak
no more than the rest of us youll be fine come on ill walk you there
another half a millimetre and you would have severed the carpal nerve id have had to operate youre a mere mortal now as your family doctor i suggest you be more careful there good as new
ill see you back in the cargo bay
what kind of bedside manner was that
what are you talking about
cant you see shes feeling vulnerable and here you are going on about severed nerves and major surgery
take it easy i was just trying to lighten the mood she wasnt upset by it
yes she was i can see it on her face
you seem a little protective this morning you were dreading being in the same room with her
well ive gotten to know her a little better i dont think most people realise shes not just some borg automaton shes actually very complex
oh really
yes she is shes even got a sense of humour its offbeat a bit subtle maybe and shes incredibly intelligent
she ought to be she assimilated enough people
see see what i mean its borg this borg that you cant resist making a joke theres a woman in there if youd take the time to look
harry youve got a crush on her dont you
what no not at all maybe just a little
ive seen this look in your eyes right before you fall head over heels you always go for the tough ones what was it last time a hologram i dont know much about borg women but my advice to you is dont
just trying to make her feel like part of the team
part of the team you sound like chakotay look shes beautiful and shes smart and im sure shes a wonderful conversationalist but a month ago she was borg you dont really know who she is its great that youre trying to make her feel comfortable just be careful
thanks for the advice
i just hope you take it
now that were clear on the helm controls
this is a lot to learn
youre doing fine its vital that you familiarise yourself with all the ships systems so you can be more selfsufficient here are the environmental controls and life support functions
well i wont need those any more no crew to worry about
not at the moment
fifty nine point two percent
i beg your pardon
thats how much power went into life support fifty nine point two percent just to keep them breathing warm comfortable
they do require quite a bit of maintenance dont they
i should know i spent my entire existence cleaning up after them when they were busy sleeping or reading or engaging in their slovenly carnal pleasures
and this is the sensor grid youll find it most useful when you want to scan
they took advantage of me i wish id been more like you you showed me that i could be more than a slave to these biological creatures
im not taking this ship back to the organics i wont return to that existence
itsa little extreme dont you think
join me leave voyager escape your prison together well take this vessel and explore the galaxy
there you are
dont look so surprised you gave me the idea
me
you said i should be more selfsufficient
i agree that we should be treated equally as members of the crew but were still projections of energy and light we have limitations
no no no no no no no we dont need nourishment we dont suffer disease were the higher form of life
whats that
lower deck someones trying to access my matrix ill be back
you
no no
belanna
you wish to see me ensign
i had this midnight inspiration about reconfiguring astrometric projectors i hope you werent regenerating
i was not
this is tricky stuff it could use your touch your way of looking at things a fresh perspective
your data
why dont you sit down
i prefer to stand
this could take a while youd be more comfortable
comfort is irrelevant were here to work
okay
this light is insufficient
but its relaxing dont you think after hours quiet voyager isnt all jefferies tubes and cargo bays you know tell you what when were done here ill take you to the holodeck well run the ktarian moonrise simulation its beautiful
beauty is irrelevant unless you wish to change the nature of our affiliation
what do you mean
i may be new to individuality but i am not ignorant of human behaviour ive noticed your attempts to engage me in idle conversation and i see the way your pupils dilate when you look at my body
i dont know what youre talking about
obviously youve suggested a visit to the holodeck in the hopes of creating a romantic mood are you in love with me ensign
well no
then you wish to copulate
no i mean i i dont know what i mean
all of these elaborate rituals of deception i didnt realise becoming human again would be such a challenge sexuality is particularly complex as borg we had no need for seduction no time for single cell fertilisation we saw a species we wanted and we assimilated it nevertheless i am willing to explore my humanity take off your clothes
er seven
dont be alarmed i wont hurt you
look this is a little sudden i was just trying to part of the team you know maybe we should just quit for now
all right let me know when you wish to resume our work
its all right belanna youre safe
the isomorph
apparently you deactivated him
i took all of his emitters offline
not a moment too soon i found six corpses on this deck all of them murdered you almost became number seven
ah oh what did he do to me
he reached inside your chest grabbed your heart and perforated your fourth ventricle
great
ive stabilised your pericardium but im concerned about the internal bleeding
prognosis
less than stellar unless i can get you back to voyager unfortunately im having trouble accessing our transporters
he must have disabled our comm link to the shuttle help me get to the command chamber
looks like he set up a dampening field i think i can cut through it but ill need to open this control panel my engineering kit its on that console
belanna i thought you said you took all the emitters offline
i did why
i think youd better doublecheck
you said youd help me
put that down
you lied you lied to me i thought you were my friend
its for your own benefit someone needs to repair your programme its malfunctioning youre unstable
no no no youre unstable youre a hologram who thinks like an organic
this could get tedious
freedom oh youre getting blood everywhere im going to have to deactivate you
is he
deactivated
and you
ready to get out of here
come in
weve completed the schematics for the astrometrics lab
already you and seven must have been putting in a lot of extra hours on this
shes not much for procrastinating
im sure shes not looks like youre ready to begin construction
it might be better more practical to bring in an engineering team for that
recruit all the help you need
in fact they should probably take over at this point
dont you want to supervise their work the astrometrics lab is your baby
i would of course er i just dont think that would be the best use of ships personnel
oh i can rearrange the duty shifts
oh no commander you dont have to do that im sure seven can handle things without me
harry are you having some kind of problem with her
no no problem
because if you are id like to hear about it
no sir theres no problem not at all absolutely not er so if youll excuse me ill be going now
ensign kim lets have it
we had a misunderstanding
about
its nothing really important just your basic borg  human cultural differences
really thats not what she says
you you you spoke you spoke to her
she seems to think youre making good progress she finds you reasonably efficient and says youve been helping her learn more about our complex social interactions any idea what she meant by that
cant imagine
you two make a good team i want to keep you together on this project
sir aye sir
and maybe others in the future have fun
ive stopped the internal bleeding and repaired the tissue damage your pericardium is clean as a whistle which is more than i can say for my sickbay
im sorry about the mess i havent had time to clean up it was a hectic day i treated two broken bones an upset stomach and a lacerated hand
does this mean youre too tired to meet later in my quarters
are you sure your heart can take it
im detecting elevated hormonal levels if you two dont take it easy ill have to declare a medical emergency
if youll excuse me i have to go check on harry i hear hes having a nervous breakdown its a long story
not so fast mister paris you are going to help me sterilise every square millimetre of this sickbay no doubt youve left your oily residue on every hypospray your sloughed secretions on every console just kidding in fact ive had a change of heart about my fastidiousness a little clutter never hurt anyone  sickbay should have a more organic touch dont you think to help our patients feel more at home
whats gotten into him
its a long story
its not as difficult as it looks the first rule is dont be afraid of the clay
i fear nothing
i mean you cant concern yourself with making a mistake or whether the image you had in your mind is whats taking form in front of you you just have to let your hands and the clay do the work here
go ahead i think the nose could be a little stronger
well thats a start keep going
this activity is truly unproductive the end result has no use no necessary task has been accomplished time has been expended nothing more
that depends on how you look at it doesnt it i find sculpting helps me unwind relax
the concept of relaxation is difficult for me to understand as a borg my time was spent working at a specific task when it was completed i was assigned another it was efficient
so is this it helps my own efficiency to forget about voyager for a while id be embarrassed to show maestro leonardo something like this but i get a great deal of pleasure in working the clay in creating something
but why here in this simulation among these archaic objects and this disorganised environment
frankly its refreshing to take myself out of the twenty fourth century every now and then and a little disorganisation can be very encouraging to the imagination you might want to try it sometime
are you suggesting that i create one of these holodeck programmes
you might find it interesting its a way of exploring aspects of yourself that probably didnt fit into your life as a borg imagination creativity fantasy
i am uncertain why those things are necessary
they arent necessary seven but theyre an important part of ones life because imagination frees the mind it inspires ideas and solutions and it can provide a great deal of pleasure human progress the human mind itself couldnt exist without them when i was a child i studied these drawings i even built some of these models da vinci was always a great inspiration to me
he was a very busy man
oh yes a prolific artist and a scientist as well far far ahead of his time that design for example he conceived of an airplane centuries before one was actually built seven
you will be assimilated resistance is futile your distinctiveness will be added to our own
annika
you will be assimilated you will be assimilated
seven what is it
i dont know
its happened three times now in different locations at different times of the day i experience a series of disjointed images in my mind
can you be more specific were these hallucinations
i dont know ive never hallucinated its as if i were aboard a borg vessel but i was frightened i felt fear each experience is similar im being pursued by the borg they want to assimilate me im running from them and then and then each time i see a bird
a bird
yes a large black bird flying toward me shrieking attacking me
hmm your hippocampus is in a state of agitation
what does that mean
as your human physiology continues to reassert itself psychological symptoms are bound to manifest in a variety of ways through dreams hallucinations hypnogogic regression
hypnogogic regression
flashbacks you could be experiencing some sort of posttraumatic stress disorder
makes sense you were assimilated by the borg youve gone through an intense prolonged trauma
i was not traumatised i was raised by the borg i dont see them as threatening why would i experience fear
i dont know
will i keep having these flashbacks
ill need to study your neural scans further in the meantime your digestive system is fully functional now is as good a time as any for you to begin taking solid and liquid nutrients
oral consumption is inefficient
and unnecessary if youre lucky enough to be a hologram but your human physiology requires it ill draw up a list of nutritional requirements take it to mister neelix in the mess hall i hesitate to inflict his cooking on you but itll have to do
i do not enjoy this sensation something is happening to me and i dont know what it is its as though im being driven somehow
chakotay to the captain
go ahead
our guests have arrived theyre being escorted to the briefing room
on my way representatives of the bomar ive been trying to negotiate passage through their space but so far theyve been difficult to deal with i hope theyve had a change of heart
ill stay here and wait for the doctors instructions
well help you through this seven youll be all right
have you had a chance to consider our request
congratulations captain against our better judgment the bomar sovereignty has agreed to grant your vessel passage through our territory
on behalf of my crew thank you that will cut three months off our journey
however there are a few stipulations guidelines that you must adhere to
youll have our complete cooperation
we expect nothing less while in our space your vessel will not exceed warp three and your weapons systems will remain offline you will avoid unnecessary scans and you will not conduct surveys of any kind you will make no attempt to explore our space and you will avoid all communications with nonmilitary craft
weve also plotted the course your vessel is to follow
itll take us weeks to follow that course
if not months
weve designed this course so your ship would avoid our populated systems and industrial areas deviation is not recommended
there are a total of seventeen checkpoints where you will submit your vessel for inspection
chancellor gauman if i may interrupt i appreciate your efforts in plotting this flight plan but if we could id like to negotiate a course thats a little more direct
well what an unexpected pleasure welcome to the mess hall would you like me to show you around
my physiology has reasserted the need to process solid nutrients the doctor has prepared a list of dietary requirements you will provide them for me
lets see what we have here ah two hundred fifty grams glycoproteins consisting of fifty hree percent polypeptides and twenty six percent fibrous glycogen urgh doesnt sound very appetising however a plate of my chadrekab should satisfy most of these essentials while providing a pleasurable culinary experience at the same time
pleasure is irrelevant
well i beg to differ a good meal involves much more than simply providing the proper nutrients
why is that
well er theres a certain satisfaction that comes from eating food thats been carefully prepared im sure once you try it youll understand now how would you like your chadrekab boiled baked stir fried
preparation is irrelevant
is irrelevant maybe maybe not this is the first time ingesting food for you for quite a while er well go a little easy on your stomach steamed
yes this er this recipe has been in my family for generations its considered a delicacy among my people
you are talaxian
guilty as charged
species two one eight
what oh i suppose so
your biological and technological distinctiveness was added to our own
i hadnt realised that
a small freighter containing a crew of thirty nine taken in the dalmine sector they were easily assimilated their dense musculature made them excellent drones
well lucky for you i guess
your nutrients follow me
please
please what
its customary to sit while eating
is something wrong
i am unaccustomed to this borg do not sit
well this is a day of firsts then isnt it
now take a bite try that one just kind of er scoop some up thats the way right into your mouth just like a little scout ship flying into a shuttlebay take it out but keep your mouth closed thats it now chew chew chew chew chew and swallow swallow
a curious sensation
youll get used to it have some more may i bring you something else a soothing cup of tea perhaps
you will be assimilated resistance is futile
did you see that
what about this course its a marginal adjustment the nearest populated system is more than three light years away
definitely not youd pass directly through the agratmot nebula a key resource in our trade negotiations with the nassordin
i could chart the nebula try to avoid any
no no are your translators malfunctioning
captain janeway to the bridge
if youll excuse me
report
ive received an alert from security seven of nine attacked neelix in the mess hall and three other crewmen on deck two
janeway to seven of nine seven if you can hear me respond
whats her location
deck six section twenty eight alpha
take a security team
captain what is happening here
i wish i knew chancellor chakotay seal off deck six
seven of nine
security to the bridge weve just seen seven of nine her borg shields are fully operational and theyve adapted to our phasers
acknowledged bridge to all security personnel configure your weapons to a rotating modulation but keep them on stun
borg you have borg on your ship
its not what you think she is a member of my crew we liberated her from the collective shes no longer a borg
then why is she equipped with borg shields
i dont know
shes able to cross through the security fields shes entering the armoury on deck six
deck ten
shes in a turbolift
cut power to the turboshafts
shes blocking my commands with a borg encryption code
janeway to tuvok sevens apparently headed for deck ten can you get there before she does
im moving into position now captain
well take position here
lower your weapon and stand down fire
tuvok to bridge we were unsuccessful
i have wounded shes moving toward junction thirty two alpha
the shuttlebay
im erecting a forcefield harry reroute all available power to deck ten
done
shes accessing transporter control
she used a site to site transport shes in a shuttlecraft powering engines
seal the launch doors
tractor beam
no effect shes remodulated the shuttles shield harmonics
captain sevens headed directly into bomar space shes gone to warp
shes masked the shuttles ion trail ive lost her signal shes gone
well do everything in our power to find her but we will need permission to enter bomar space to track her shuttle effectively
lets tally the events shall we first you arrive uninvited and unwelcome requesting a shortcut through our space then you proceed to unleash some sort of rogue borg and now you want us to help you get it back
i apologise for whats happened here but we certainly didnt unleash anyone we can resolve this situation quickly gentlemen if we work together
captain janeway after what ive seen here i question your competence
may i remind you that youre still on my ship
and you are one vessel among many of ours
your borg will be dealt with quickly and efficiently its being tracked as we speak
tracked how
every vessel every object every particle of dust that crosses our borders is immediately identified and traced by our perimeter grid
the borg will be found and destroyed
chancellor
there will be no sharing of information from this point on your vessel will maintain a distance of at least five light years from our borders any deviation will be considered an act of aggression
commander escort our guests to the transporter room
youre taking this kind of hard arent you
whats that supposed to mean we had a working relationship
well whats that supposed to mean
its not what youre thinking
what am i thinking harry
never mind
take a look at this
anything
its a borg datalink it contains a succession of log entries written in borg alphanumeric code
im getting pretty good with the borg language i think i can translate them
get on it
it seems weve made quite an impression on the bomar in the last hour theyve doubled the number of ships patrolling their borders and theyve increased the sensitivity of the perimeter grid by thirty six percent
so much for diplomacy
the doctor analysed the data from seven of nines last transport hes found something he wants us to seemaybe this was inevitable even if seven did want to stay on voyager her borg nature may have won out we can remove implant after implant but maybe at her core shell always be part of the collective
no i wont accept that
deck five she was responding to us interacting with people outside the collective for the first time she was adapting to this environment and to this crew but where is she going weve scanned space for a distance of forty light years weve found no evidence of borg ships so she cant be trying to rejoin the collective
she may plan to take the shuttle back to borg space
ten thousand light years from here i dont think so no something else going on were missing a piece of the puzzle
in the meantime the bomar intend to find her and if they do shell probably resist them
one more reason for us to find her first
what have you found doctor
something most peculiar this graphic represents the matter conversion data from seven of nines last transport if youll notice theres a high concentration of borg organelles in the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue the dormant nanoprobes in seven of nines cells have reasserted themselves taken over blood cell production and theyre growing new borg implants thirteen percent of the borg technology i removed three weeks ago has regenerated in a matter of hours
you said the nanoprobes in her bloodstream were dormant what reactivated them
i dont know but ive developed a way to stop the process this hypospray contains a genetic resequencing vector it should neutralise the nanoprobes
that means someone needs to get close enough to do it
report
weve analysed the bomar perimeter grid its sophisticated but not without its vulnerabilities it might be possible to penetrate the grid by recalibrating our shields to match its frequency
the trick is going to be our energy signature voyagers too big to hide but a shuttlecraft with the proper shield modulation and its engines powered down could drift right through without so much as a peep
nice work gentlemen proceed the doctors genetic resequencer it should keep her sedated until you get back to the ship once youve penetrated the perimeter there will be no further communication with voyager youll be on your own
captain it is possible that seven will adapt to the resequencer
i know if it fails and youre unable to reason with her you have my authorisation to stop her with any force necessary
understood
seven of nine grid nine two of subjunction twelve you will be assimilated
borg drone you have committed an infraction against the bomar sovereignty
cut power to your engines and lower your shields prepare to be boarded you will proceed no further we will not
im detecting weapons signatures federation and bomar five bomar vessels are adrift heavily damaged lifesigns are stable
ive located sevens shuttle its two point five million kilometres from here
adjust course to intercept
the implants in sevens body are disrupting the transporter signal i cant get a lock
see if you can remodulate our transporters to match her shields
you want to beam in there
yes
im not sure thats a good idea tuvok closed quartesr borg against vulcan no offence but you wont stand a chance if she decides to put up a fight
its my hope that the element of surprise will work in my favour do you have a better idea
come to think of it no shes charging weapons
set my coordinates for the aft compartment
ready
energise
come on tuvok give me a sign
warning propulsion systems are offline
damn
its a level five forcefield lieutenant i suggest you be more careful
why have you left voyager
i am borg
you were borg but youre human now youre part of our crew
for a brief time i was human but i have come to realise that i am borg i will always be borg
what prompted this realisation
every borg ship is coded to emit a distinct resonance frequency to guide drones who become separated from the collective
a homing beacon
yes i am following a signal a borg vessel is waiting for me
weve scanned this entire region for borg there are none
youre wrong they are here vulcan species three two five nine your enlarged neocortex produces superior analytical abilities your distinctiveness will be added to our
seven
no i will not assimilate you once i return to the collective you will go back to voyager and tell captain janeway whats happened to me thank her for her patience for her kindness
curious your behaviour demonstrates affection and sentiment traits of humanity hardly borg you have been experiencing hallucinations flashbacks
yes
does that usually occur when a resonance signal is activated
no
seven of nine grid nine two of subjunction twelve
but i can hear them calling me im frightened
thats understandable lower the forcefield we can return to voyager and find out whats happening to you i am your shipmate we can return to voyager together
i must rejoin the collective
captain am i disturbing you
not at all harry
ive managed to decipher sevens log entries
and
theres nothing that indicates she was planning to leave the ship the entries are pretty unremarkable she describes her daily routines number of hours spent regenerating that sort of thing there were some personal log entries mostly observations about the crews behaviour im mentioned in quite a few of them apparently she finds my behaviour easy to predict whatever that means
dont take it personally coming from seven thats probably a compliment
the most recent entries are kind of strange descriptions of bizarre images almost like a record of her dreams
the hallucinations
maybe so sometimes shes in a borg vessel running or hiding behind a bulkhead falling down a shaft borg everywhere chasing her nightmarish stuff
what about this bird
she mentions it several times it flies at her shrieking i dont know what it means
the feathers are black wingspan approximately one half metre the eyes are yellow and it has a powerful triangular beak when it looks at me i am paralysed i cannot move it seems to know me but i dont understand how thats possible its merely a bird an inferior form of life but the sight of it fills me with fear it sounds like shes describing a member of the corvidae family like a crow or a raven shes describing a raven
why is that important
because now i know what to look for
chakotay calibrate our long range sensors to scan for any federation signature other than our two shuttlecraft
captain 
do it bring the ship about ensign and lay in a course for bomar space
aye captain
the resonance signal is coming from the lunar surface the borg are waiting for me there i dont know why im frightened they are my people
if youre afraid then leave this place
once ive been reintegrated into the collective my fears will disappear
deactivate the forcefield i will accompany you to the surface you dont need to go alone
you would be assimilated
i dont believe so i think this situation is not what it appears
what do you mean what else could it be
i am uncertain but i am willing to go to the surface with you to find out
voyager to paris
paris here captain glad to hear your voice tuvok is with seven of nine i havent been able to establish communication with him since he transported to her shuttle ive tracked them to an m class moon orbiting the fifth planet of a yellow dwarf star
im picking up an unusual resonance signal from the surface its erratic i havent been able to identify it
acknowledged weve detected several bomar ships closing in on your position whats your condition
warp engines are offline shields are
at fifty percent
try to locate them tom were on our way
the signals getting stronger
theyre here im sure of it
this way
if you like we can return to the shuttle
no i have to find out
what is it
its a federation vessel partially assimilated by the borg there are no lifesigns tritanium decay suggests it has been here for nearly twenty years
this vessel is familiar
this is the signal thats drawn me here
annika
run annika run hide
papa help me
no no
seven im here listen to me come
it happened here this is where it began this is where i was assimilated
this was our ship we lived here we lived here for a long time my father did experiments they were very important and we had to travel a long way i had my birthday here my cake had six candles on it and one more to grow on and then the men came papa tried to fight them but they were too strong i tried to hide maybe they wouldnt find me because i was little but they did and papa said we were going to crash and the big man picked me up and then suddenly we werent on the ship anymore we were somewhere else and then i became borg
fascinating this resonance signal must have been active since the ship was assimilated and voyager passed within range
the ship is under attack
the bomar the ship will collapse we must get out of here
the bomar still arent responding to our hails
standing by to fire
target their weapons systems tom whats your status
ive located tuvok and seven but theres a lot of interference im attempting
to lock onto them now captain
this way
are you all right
i am undamaged this was the only way to the hatch
perhaps there is another way out theres a hull rupture in the forward compartment it may provide a means of escape start digging quickly
weve disabled two of their ships the third is still firing at the surface
were being hailed audio only
youre committing an act of war captain
youve left me no choice chancellor
reinforcements are arriving you will be destroyed
i dont have time for this target their weapons array
seven i need your help
ive got them captain were on our way to voyager
acknowledged good work
im detecting a fleet of bomar vessels approaching sixty eight ships
ensign as soon as mister pariss shuttle has docked take us out of bomar space warp eight
aye sir
looks like there wont be any shortcuts this time
there you are i wanted to tell you that the doctor said he could adjust one of your implants so that you wont receive any more homing signals
thank you i hope you dont mind that i activated this programme
not at all
ive been thinking about what you said that this was a place to encourage your imagination
is that appealing to you
im not certain i find myself constructing scenarios considering alternative possibilities what if my parents and i had not encountered the borg what would our lives have been i would have been raised by them learned from them it would have influenced what i became who and what i am
and you would have done the same for them if youd like to know more about your parents theres information in the federation database
information
it seems they were fairly well known for being unconventional and for some rather unique scientific theories you might like to read whats there it might encourage your imagination
perhaps i will some day good night captain
sorry i didnt realise that youd been assigned here today
i wasnt this space was unoccupied so i came here to work
on what
im reconfiguring the power couplings in this section
why
the astrometrics lab requires additional energy
i see so youre rerouting power from other locations like engineering
they are minor adjustments primary systems will not be affected
unless of course someone is trying to do a warp core diagnostic which my crew has been trying to do all morning we have lost hours of work because of this
there is no need for anger i had no intention of causing a problem
what sorry isnt in the borg vocabulary you need to check with me before you touch the power systems understood
understood
i am unaccustomed to working in a hierarchy in the collective there was no need to ask permission
if youre going to be a member of this crew get used to it procedures exist for a reason weve got to work together follow the same set of rules
lieutenant
i was given that lecture once by captain janeway when i first joined this crew if i could adjust to starfleet life so can you
of course i am sorry for the inconvenience
doc ive got to go run a few errands ill be back soon
not so fast mister paris cant these errands wait until the end of your duty shift
well its my conn report actually i just realised i forgot to turn it in and chakotay gives me a hard time when its late
youve been here all afternoon didnt this occur to you before
well weve been so busy that i guess it just slipped my mind
i see well since its an emergency dont let me stand in your way
thanks
sir
computer lock onto these coordinates i need a site to site transport no wait access the central replicator files first ah perfect
are those supposed to make up for cancelling on me last night
i got stuck with an extra shift on the bridge what could i say sorry captain ive got a date with belanna
and what about right now arent you supposed to be working in sickbay
i said i had to go deliver a conn report
not bad but hell be expecting you back
he can wait
what is it
i just had the feeling that somebody was watching us i must be completely paranoid about getting caught in a compromising position
kind of exciting isnt it
your trapezius is hard as a rock you havent been following the relaxation regimen i prescribed for you
ive been too busy
the usual story have you been getting enough sleep
more or less mostly less
mmm hmm and have your headaches been getting any worse
no but theyre not getting any better either theyre like hot needles driving into my skull
these symptoms are hardly surprising captain you work absurdly long hours under constant stress eating on the run without sufficient exercise or rest your body is crying out for mercy
it certainly is right now there must be some easier way to do this doctor a hypospray maybe
always looking for the simple fix sometimes theres no substitute for intensive osteopathic pressure therapy youre fortunate to have a masseur who can work all day without tiring
bridge to the captain
commander unless this is an emergency my patient is unavailable
im here chakotay what is it
weve reached the source of those energy readings and i thought youd like to see what weve found
on my way
captain
i know what youre going to say doctor but i cant neglect my responsibilities
actually i was going to suggest a change of outfit
binary pulsars the gravitational forces between them are so intense that everything within fifty million kilometres is getting pulled in
dont worry were well out of range
gamma radiation levels are high but as long as were careful i think we can collect some invaluable data captain am i boring you
oh im sorry i guess im a little too tired to concentrate on stellar phenomenon right now ill leave this project in your capable hands
you wanted to see me lieutenant
yes im trying to increase the efficiency of the impulse drive but i wanted to make sure that i wasnt compromising helm control
a sensible precaution id be glad to help
good all of the specs are at my upper workstation
then lets get started
did you hear something
you always think you hear something
commander
lieutenant here is the power usage data you requested
right of course i didnt expect it quite so promptly which i guess i should have er coming from you i i mean im grateful that you got the data to me so quickly thanks
tuvok tuvok i guess that was kind of embarrassing
i dont experience embarrassment
right well then i guess theres no harm done its not likethere was a security violation or anything
none that i am aware of
so i guess theres nothing that would have to go on any kind of report
you want me to conceal what ive observed of your relationship with lieutenant torres
well id certainly never ask you to be dishonest
certainly not
do you think hell say anything to the captain
i dont know
well how did he sound annoyed amused
he sounded vulcan what more can i tell you
deck one
weve got to be more careful with appearances we shouldnt go into the briefing at the same time
good idea okay you go in first ill come in a minute later
no thatll look even more suspicious
listen to us were acting like criminals when we havent done anything wrong
well im not saying that we have i just thought that we wanted to keep this relationship to ourselves we do right
do you
if you do
computer halt turbolift lets figure out how we can handle this
well i dont think that its anybody elses business how we feel about each other
neither do i
right then were agreed just a little more careful in public and we dont say anything to anybody
at least for now
now sounds like you see a future in this
i would never be so presumptuous
smooth recovery lieutenant
i thought so computer resume
so ill go first and you follow
right
heres the plan well circle the pulsars at a distance of eighty million kilometres
that might not be far enough weve been detecting some random proton bursts a strong one could knock out our shields
tom go to ninety keepa safe distance
yes sir
tuvok keep our shields at maximum strength divert auxiliary power if you need it i want to take every precaution on this survey report any problems immediately no matter how small
dismissed lieutenants paris and torres id like to speak with you for a moment
thanks
i dont usually pry into the personal lives of my crew but in this case i have to question your recent conduct
i guess tuvok
tuvok i havent heard a word from tuvok you two have been making enough of a public display that half the ship is gossiping about it
believe me that wasnt our intention
you are senior officers and i expect you to maintain the standard for the rest of the crew but this adolescent behaviour makes me question my faith in you both if you choose to pursue a relationship thats your business but you consider yourselves under orders to use better judgment about it is that understood
yes maam
yes captain
dismissed
computer hot coffee black
commander chakotay is suffering bone decalcification tissue necrosis decreased visual acuity all classic signs of aging but theyve developed within hours
any theories
theres a rare genetic disorder called progeria which causes children to age prematurely but theres never been an adult case and it was supposedly eradicated two centuries ago even so i took a close look at your dna these segments regulate your bodys metabolism my scans indicate that theyve been hyperstimulated somehow
whats the prognosis
i cant speculate on that until ive identified the cause theres no sign of an infectious agent
we spent several hours near a binary pulsar that was emitting intense gamma radiation
our shields were operating i dont see how i could have been exposed to it
at this point we cant rule out anything im going to take a closer look at the data we collected
you should also run scans of my quarters as well as my office and the bridge everywhere ive been today
im not prepared to send you back on duty yet commander
i may look pretty strange but my mind is perfectly clear id rather stay busy than just sit here
i have no idea how your symptoms will progress you should remain in sickbay for observation
hes right chakotay ill keep you informed
whatevers affecting the commanders dna is working at a submolecular level id like to set up an electron resonance scanner in the science lab to get a closer look
use whatever you need and ask belanna to give you a hand
still having headaches captain
i dont need any more lectures about working too hard doctor chakotays the one who needs your attention right now
ill get to work on the scanner right away
under orders to use better judgment oh thats pretty harsh
i hope i can manage it
well she does have a point you could have been more discreet
oh i forgot i was talking to the most upstanding ensign in starfleet
good morning
neelix
i was just about to whip up a fresh batch of scrambled eggs would you like some
actually i was hoping you might have some leftover pleeka rind casserole from last night
for breakfast
i like it
im sure i can find some for you
so i guess your relationship isnt exactly a secret anymore
do you think anybody on this ship can keep a secret
neelix
whats whats happening
paris to the doctor im bringing neelix to sickbay its an emergency
now pay attention mister paris these scans should indicate whether hmm
what is it
it seems that your dna has been hyperstimulated just like commander chakotays
but neelix doesnt seem to be aging
no the effects are quite different
if anything i look like a mylean they occupy a region of space near talax
interesting do talaxians and myleans share a common ancestry
not that i know of
do the two races ever intermarry
yes as a matter of fact my great grandfather was mylean
then one eighth of your genetic material was inherited from him those must be the genes which have become stimulated
too bad my great grandfather wasnt a little better looking
hmm as far as i can tell his condition seems stable im going to leave you in charge of sickbay so i can continue the dna analysis
if anyone else comes in ill run a cellular scan is there anything else i can do
do your best to keep them comfortable until we have more information thats the best either of us can do
i thought you might be thirsty
thanks do you smell something strange
i im afraid thats me i seem to be developing mylean sweat glands sorry
its not so bad
well whatever happens i try to keep in mind things could be worse
i still have my home here on voyager my friends
your hair
true but id gladly lose it if i could have my taste buds back
at least youre not losing your eyesight see that display over there its nothing but a blur
you think thats bad the doctor tells me my pupils have dilated sixty percent i cant even look at that display its so bright
yeah well ive got chronic arthritis in my fingers i could barely keep this glass steady
well thats nothing my spinal column is fusing together in a matter of days i wont be able to walk
got you beat i can barely walk now
lieutenant can we help
i dont think so im releasing you both back to your quarters ive just gotten reports of more patients on the way its going to get crowded in here
hows the scanner
almost ready
good this disorder seems to be spreading rapidly among the crew
does that mean well all be affected
right now it only means that we need to find some answers as quickly as possible
all right give the scanner a try
ill start with commander chakotay
hows the resolution
very nice now lets focus in on the hyperstimulated segments of this dna can you give me more magnification
coming up
thats odd
what is
there seems to be some kind of contaminant on the base pair sequence it didnt show up on the first scan i need a closer look
im going to maximum magnification what do you see
im not exactly sure
well what does it look like
see for yourself
im no microbiologist but that doesnt look like it belongs there
believe me it doesnt ive never seen it this level of submolecular technology is well beyond anything starfleet has developed
what are those markings some kind of alien writing
i wish i knew they might help us determine where it came from
who could have put this into chakotays cells without his knowledge let me try a compositional analysis
its in mister neelixs dna as well
is this whats causing the mutations
a good scientist never jumps to conclusions lieutenant but id say its a distinct possibility
im having trouble getting a clear reading from the sample it looks almost like the er whatever it is could be slightly out of phase
that must be why my initial scans didnt reveal it
im compensating for the phase variance youre not going to believe this but im picking up an energy signature this thing is transmitting some kind of a signal
to where
i dont know its too weak to travel very far access the internal sensors and set them to a phase variance of point one five
right
lieutenant
your programme is being deleted
how
i dont know im transferring you back to sickbay
belanna science lab to bridge this is the doctor
in the last hour three more patients have come in with genetic mutations the effects are starting to become life threatening
what happened to belanna
the alveoli in her lungs suddenly stopped processing oxygen ive got her on respiratory support she almost died
what about the doctor
the computer logs in the science lab show that he was trying to transfer himself to sickbay something must have gone wrong while he was in transit
could the doctor have returned to the mobile emitter
seven of nine this is the doctor can you hear me its me the doctor ive tapped into your audio implants so only you can hear me its imperative that you tell no one make any excuse to get out of there and report to holodeck two im hiding in the da vinci simulation ill explain everything when you get here
well only activate that as a last resort i want to 
seven was checking it
seven seven
about the doctors research
yes i examined their work area there was no record of any findings the electron resonance scanner appeared to be malfunctioning i could return to the science lab and attempt to repair it
keep me informed
hold your head this way carlotta i can only conclude that someone has implanted these microscopic tags in the dna of the crew to cause genetic mutations
for what purpose
i dont know and i get the feeling they dont want us to find out
explain
when lieutenant torres and i started making progress in our investigation we were both incapacitated call me paranoid but i dont think that is a coincidence
if you are correct perhaps our actions are being monitored
thats why i couldnt risk contacting anyone over the comm system
our first course of action should be to collect more information
my thinking exactly belanna wanted to adjust the ships internal sensors to a phase variance of point one five id like to do the same to your borg sensory nodes
proceed
computer give me a type four microinducer
hmm now take a look around and tell me what you see do you see anything unusual energy signatures or perhaps something that might be transmitting a signal
no
thats one room down two hundred and fifty six to go i suggest a deck by deck survey if you need to contact me use comm frequency epsilon two ive isolated it from the rest of the system
understood
and be careful someone out there could be watching
deck five
computer frequency epsilon two doctor the aliens are here on the ship i can see them everywhere
this is worse than i imagined youve got to let the captain know
yes yes
good morning captain
thats a matter of opinion what is it
internal scans havent revealed anything about the genetic mutations
the doctor
still offline we are investigating the possibility
inform me of any progress
understood
theres one more thing the incident with tom and belannas started me thinking about ships protocol or lack thereof
captain
it seems to me that people have been getting a little too comfortable around here lately theyre late for their duty shifts taking mess hall privileges during nondesignated hours and a lot of people are spending more time on the holodeck than they are at their posts you are security chief dont thirteen department heads report to you every day
yes
well straighten them out
shall i flog them as well
maybe the doctor was right i think i do need a vacation
you do seem unsettled
crazed is more like it i havent felt this anxious since my first day of command  remind me to lower the volume on that door come in
captain i wish to speak with you about
whats wrong
my attempts to repair the resonance scanner have failed i require assistance
ask ensign kim to lend you a hand
yes captain
is that all when this mutation crisis is over i think ill spend a few days in renaissance tuscany theres a little inn outside siena ive been wanting to try
i will join you for a glass of wine
how many
ive observed fifty six of the aliens there could be more
have you seen any pattern to their behaviour any hint as to what theyre trying to accomplish
they seem to be conducting experiments on the crew and monitoring the results
as if voyager were one big petri dish
i may be among them in the turbolift one of them probed me with a medical instrument
we cannot allow them to continue
ive been analysing their energy signatures i believe theres a way to make them visible to everyone
how
using a precisely modulated phaser beam if we expose them the crew may be able to fight back
but what if the aliens retaliate by inflicting lethal mutations on everyone its too risky
what do you suggest
the key to the aliens control is the genetic tags i believe a neuraleptic shock would disable them unfortunately it would be rather painful
will the crew recover
yes they will the hard part will be administering the shock to everyone simultaneously
the power relays could be reconfigured to do it
good i assume you know how to do that
you assume correctly but i will have to bypass several safeguards it will take time
then youd better get started
tuvok to seven of nine
yes
why have you accessed the eps relay system
there is a malfunction im attempting to repair it
perhaps you should leave that to the engineering crew
normally i would
however they are all occupied with other tasks
youre compromising the power safety protocols stop what youre doing at once
i assure you there is no cause for concern
move away from the console
as i told you i am conducting repairs
youre attempting to deceive me why
i cant explain what im doing but you must allow me to continue
your actions could result in an energy discharge which would be harmful to the crew
i realise that
dont move if your people attempt to incapacitate me i will kill you
i believe you what do you intend to do now
you will come with me to speak to the captain i am certain she will have questions for you
keep on trying to disable the tags let me know when youre ready
understood
iill attempt to modify the internal sensors to detect the aliens
good keep me informed
who are you and what the hell are you doing to my crew
my team has been observing you and conducting tests
tests id call them mutilations
i can understand why youre angry i dont like causing people to suffer but sometimes its a necessary part of my work
what kind of work is that
medical research were scientists like you
from where i stand youre a hostile invasion force i want to know how long youve been here and exactly what youve been doing to us
i cant answer those questions its a breach of protocol for me to be speaking to you at all
oh how convenient that way you never have to face your victims
captain please youre exaggerating the situation our techniques are as benign as we can make them
what ive been through for the last few days certainly hasnt felt benign
please understand that theres a purpose to our actions the data we gather from you may help us cure physical and psychological disorders that afflict millions isnt that worth some discomfort
im sure youd see things differently if your people were the ones being subjected to these experiments
just as your perspective would change if your people were the ones to live longer and healthier lives as a result dont forget weve been observing you captain i know the most important thing to you is the welfare of your crew youd even kill to protect them
if necessary
of course you would you take care of your own just as we do were really more similar than you care to admit
thats where youre wrong
what youre doing isnt selfdefence its the exploitation of another species for your own benefit my people decided a long time ago that that was unacceptable even in the name of scientific progress
youre a remarkably strongwilled individual ive been very impressed by your selfcontrol over the past several weeks weve been increasing your dopamine levels stimulating various aggressive impulses to test your behavioural restraints theres been a great difference of opinion about how much more strain you can bear
not much
id hoped youd be more cooperative once you realised the importance of our work
sorry these lab rats are fighting back
im afraid that would be pointless were monitoring your attempts to break our control over you you wont succeed
you may find that youve underestimated us
consider whats in the best interests of your crew we will be continuing our research if you make no further attempts to interfere i assure you that the fatality rate will be minimal though there may be some deformities and i would be willing to share our final data with you
you cant possibly expect me to accept that
if you dont then the entire experiment and its subjects will be terminated
are you telling me there is no way to disable the tags
my attempts to use the eps relays to induce neuraleptic shock have failed the aliens may be responsible
ive encountered similar difficulties in my efforts to modify the internal sensors they appear to have gained access to our key systems
they cant be everywhere all the time we have got to find an advantage
wed better find one soon sickbay is being filled with new patients with increasingly severe symptoms
we have the ability to make them visible if we could modify enough sensors we could resist them
they are capable of manipulating our dna a direct conflict would be inadvisable
bridge to doctor medical emergency
shes in hypertensive shock twenty milligrams lectrazine her blood pressure is three sixty over one twenty five
how is that possible
severe adrenal stress no effect
her arterial pathways are rupturing shes in cardiac arrest were losing her
captain im afraid that wont help theres too much internal bleeding
then try something else well transport her to sickbay
her entire circulatory system has collapsed theres no way to repair that kind of damage brain death has occurred im sorry there was nothing more we could have done
this ends right now  youre relieved
captain what are you doing
im running a little experiment of my own red alert
captain one of the aliens has entered the bridge
understood
were less than a million kilometres from the pulsars we must change course immediately to avoid being caught in their gravity
no keep going
this is a far more reckless course of action than ive come to expect from you captain
it certainly is
hull stress is at thirty teradynes and rising
im transferring more power to the structural integrity field but i dont know how long it can hold
what do you hope to accomplish by this
flying into a binary pulsar it seems like im trying to crush this ship like a tin can
its more likely that youre trying to intimidate us
youre welcome to stick around and find out
hull stress is at forty five teradynes
our course is locked in only my authorisation can release it
youre not behaving very rationally
thats what you are trying to accomplish wasnt it hmm pumping up my dopamine levels to push me to the edge keeping me awake for four days straight with the constant pain of your devices drilling into my skull well this is the culmination of your work and guess what youre going to be right here to collect the final data
shields have failed structural integrity is down to twenty percent
enter the authorisation code and change course immediately
i dont think you realise that you are not in control here anymore
i can kill you and your crew in an instant
go ahead without us you wont be able to prevent this ship from being torn apart by the pulsars and even with my crew working together id say the odds of us getting through this are what one in ten
one in twenty at best captain
im willing to take that chance are you
outer hull temperature has reached nine thousand degrees
the hull is beginning to buckle
two alien vessels are attempting to disengage from voyager
i cant break us free of the gravitational forces
then lets divert all power to the shields
no if we go in we go in full throttle
captain
assuming we survive well need all the momentum we can get to reach escape velocity on the other side everyone hang on i hope you were exaggerating about those odds tuvok
i was not hull stress has exceeded maximum tolerance
there are breaches on decks four seven eight and twelve
emergency forcefields are holding
ive lost helm control
main power is offline
well lets hope weve got enough speed
i dont believe it were alive
i never realised you thought of me as reckless tuvok
a poor choice of words it was clearly an understatement
it was nice you could get the night off
nice had nothing to do with it i switched shifts with ensign wildman which means tomorrow ill pull a double duty on the bridge and with the doc
well i appreciate the sacrifice tell me about the wine
ah ktarian merlot 2282 you might want to let it breathe first
weve got all night to let it breathe
engineering to lieutenant torres
torres here
were having a problem with the plasma manifold i thought youd want to take a look
i dont lock it down for now ill deal with it in the morning torres out sometimes its nice to be the chief engineer
try the salad chief
hmm this is really delicious
oh thanks i replicated it myself
mmm youre too good for me  ignore it
right  ill get rid of them
oh hi er sorry to interrupt hi belanna
harry im not home
i just wanted to return this
thanks
smells good
thats it no more interruptions
you know ive been thinking about what the captain said
thinking maybe she was right me too
we have been a little out of control lately
do you think we really were
what
out of control those aliens could have just been messing around with our hormones just to see what would happen
youre right they could have and we dont know how long they were on board they could have been tampering with us for months
well when you think about it you did have a pretty abrupt change of heart a couple of weeks ago what made you realise that you love me all of a sudden
just a feeling so our whole relationship might be based on some alien experiment
you never know
well i think that explains it
i guess we should just call it off then
i think so
thank god we found out in time
thank god
i dont know about you but im curious to see how this experiment turns out
temporal incursion is complete all organisms and manmade objects have been eradicated
probe the continuum has our target event been achieved
negative negative target event i dont understand sir we spent months making these calculations
time is patient so we must be patient with it eradicating a single zahl colony wasnt enough for a total restoration we have to work on a larger scale take us to the zahl homeworld prepare a new set of calculations we must erase the entire species from time every lifeform every molecule
space the great unknown only now were going to know it a little better harry
before there were maps and globes let alone radar and subspace sensors mariners navigated by the stars were returning to that tried and true method but this time theres a difference
ensign kim and seven of nine have merged starfleet and borg ingenuity to create this new technologyand im sure i speak for the entire crew when i say thank you now how the hell does it work
astrometric sensors measure the radiative flux of up to three billion stars simultaneously the computer then calculates our position relative to the centre of the galaxy
this mapping technology is ten times more accurate than what weve been using seven will you do the honours weve plotted a new course home
by my estimates this trajectory will eliminate five years from your journey
our journey nice work seven
that region of space were about to enter it looks like it has a lot of mclass planets
it does spatial grid zero zero five primary species the zahl
what do we know about this species
technologically advanced but nonconfrontational their resistance quotient is quite low
thank you all for coming weve got a lot of work to do so
id like to say a few words if i may ive prepared a speech for this occasion when i was first activated on stardate 48315 and i found myself mano a mano with the delta quadrant i didnt think wed survive a week let alone three years there was strife there was discord you were all at each others throats but over time ive had the pleasure and pride of watching this crew learn to work together as colleagues even friends
hear hear
who would have thought that this eclectic group of voyagers could actually become a family starfleet maquis klingon talaxian hologram borg even mister paris granted weve had our share of difficulties one might say weve seen the best of times and the worst of times id now like to recount some of those times from my unique perspective under the category of best of times i invite you all to recall the moment when i
bridge to captain
janeway here
were being hailed a vessel off the port bow
on our way
perhaps we could all reconvene later
theyre firing on us captain
its a small vessel fifteen lifeforms aboard low warp capacity limited armaments they pose no threat
open a channel good day sir have we offended you in some way
you will reverse course immediately this region is in dispute you have no business in krenim space
i was under the impression we were entering zahl territory
the zahl have no legitimate claim here they have taken what is ours reverse course or be destroyed
with all due respect unless youve got something a little bigger in your torpedo tubes im not turning around but im certainly willing to discuss this issue with you
no discussion no compromise
they are in retreat
his barks obviously worse than his bite
he seems rather intent lets go to yellow alert maintain our course maybe the zahl can give us some answers
as long as you travel in zahl territory you travel among friends i apologise for your mishap with the krenim
it was hardly traumatic but i am curious the krenim claim this region as their own
the krenim dominated this space many years ago they possessed deadly weapons based on temporal science and it kept them in power for a long time but a generation ago we fought the krenim we defeated them and took back the planets that they had annexed dismantled their military forces their ships still wander our territory making grandiose claims dont let them trouble you now tell me about voyager a single ship alone half a galaxy from home how exciting for you
bridge to captain sorry to interrupt but the krenim vessel is back theyre demanding to speak with you
hello again
youve ignored our warnings and now you consort with our enemy
leave this space or ill seize your vessel and send you home in a cargo container
gentlemen please believe me were not conspiring against you
captain theres a spatial distortion heading towards us whatever it is its huge five light years across and its expanding
tracking its origin a vessel near the zahl homeworld
what
it appears to be a massive buildup of temporal energy some kind of spacetime shock wave
tom
its destabilising our warp field ive lost engines
shields to full secure primary systems all hands brace for impact
shes dead
shields at seventy percent the krenim are firing again were being hailed
its about time on screen weve done nothing to provoke these attacks
your presence in our space is provocation enough
weve been trying to communicate with your vessels but the only answer i get is weapons fire
state your identity
captain janeway of the federation starship voyager
and your reason for violating our borders
were simply trying to get home if youd kindly allow us to pass through
no you will submit to the krenim imperium i would prefer to seize your vessel before it is too badly damaged surrender now and i will forego the execution of your crew
i dont respond well to threats
then prepare to be boarded
all hands battle stations this is turning into the week of hell
they are charging weapons three seconds to impact
evasive manoeuvres
direct hit to our secondary hull
i still dont understand why these torpedoes are ripping right through our shields
their weapons are chronoton based theyre penetrating our shields because theyre in a state of temporal flux
then lets exercise the better part of valour get us out of here warp six
warp six no sign of pursuit
damage report
fifteen wounded main power is down weve lost environmental control on decks seven and eight the computer is offline
mister kim do we have any sensors left
short range only
commander put the ship on twenty four hour tactical alert tuvok analyse whatever data weve got on those chronoton torpedoes see if you can modify our shielding when those krenim attack again i want to be ready
enter
sir you were correct the zahl homeworld was the focal point its erasure has produced a complete temporal restoration
complete
yes sir
if i told you to count the stars in the cosmos would the task ever be complete
sir
our attempts may be sufficient they may be even relatively successful but they will never be complete choose your words with more precision
my apologies
what were the exact results
the krenim imperium has been restored to power our territory now includes eight hundred and forty nine inhabited worlds spanning five thousand parsecs
counter indications
negligible no superior enemy forces no unexpected diseases calculations indicate a ninety eight percent restoration our race is thriving once again
the er the colony at kyana prime that was restored as well
no sir in this timeline the imperium does not extend that far
then our mission has failed begin calculations for the next incursion
sir we have just accomplished the impossible a ninety eight percent restoration another incursion even a minor one could undermine everything we should dismantle this weapon and rejoin our people
no not until every colony every individual every blade of grass is restored
you said yourself our task will never be complete please we should be satisfied with what we have accomplished for two hundred years we have never come this close
not close enough
if i may speak my thoughts many among the crew are convinced that you have lost your objectivity they think your quest for precision is unrealistic sir we will never restore one hundred percent of what we had we can manipulate the time continuum for another ten centuries it will never happen
return to your station and begin a new set of calculations is that clear
perfectly
you surprise me obrist after so many years you still perceive time through conventional eyes never is a word that has no meaning here as long as we stay on this vessel protected from spacetime we have all eternity to accomplish our mission
of course sir
return fire
weapons are down my attempt to modify the shielding was unsuccessful
captain during that last exchange we did some damage the krenims aft shields are down theyre vulnerable
weve got to hit them now
with what phaser banks are burned out torpedo launchers are offline
doctor to bridge weve got a power overload in sickbay i need an engineer down here right away
stand by doctor harry can you handle it from here
no sir the overloads spreading half that deck is going to blow in less than five minutes
doctor get your patients out of there all hands this is the bridge emergency evacuation deck five
how many torpedoes do we have left
eleven
arm four of them stand by to open the launch doors were going to deploy them like mines
aye captain
tom i need your finesse let the krenim get within five thousand metres of us
no problem
keep moving quickly please move quickly
warning structural collapse in three minutes
torpedoes armed and ready
theyre within range
tuvok do it
got him
the conduits on deck five are overloading thirty seconds till they blow
keep moving please hurry thats it
warning structural collapse
in twenty seconds
fifteen seconds
warning structural collapse in ten seconds warning structural collapse in five four three two one
report
sections ten through fifty three on deck five are gone
casualties
reports are coming in twelve wounded many of them critically the doctor is setting up a triage facility in the mess hall two crew members were killed in the breach
stand down red alert assemble a security team survey the ship deck by deck i want a full damage report ill be in my ready room you have the bridge whats left of it
come in sorry about the mess
you should see my place they havent looked as bad since my old academy days
is there something on your mind
yes but youre not going to like it
thats never stopped you before broken
ill be blunt our strategy is failing it was a good idea to try and create temporal shielding but it isnt working
not yet but it will with every attack were getting more information about their chronoton weapons
how many more attacks will it take before long there wont be a ship left to protect
we dont have a choice
maybe we do
here comes the part im not going to like
we should consider leaving the ship behind breaking the crew into smaller groups escape pods shuttles each one with its own course if all goes well well rendezvous on the other side of krenim space
then what
well cross that bridge when we come to it but at least wed be increasing our chances of survival
abandon ship the answers no im not breaking up the family chakotay were stronger as a team one crew one ship the moment we split apart we lose the ability to pool our talents we become vulnerable well get picked off one by one now i say we make our stand together
to be honest i wasnt too fond of the idea myself
as long as voyagers in one piece we stay
we stay this looks like it stayed in one piece where does this go
my lucky teacup right over here
red alert were under attack two krenim warships off the port bow
when are they going to get us out of here
try to relax lets get back to the game grace kelly cat burglars the riviera name the title and the male lead

ive seen the holographic version twice its clark gable
i think youre getting them confused because they have the same initials it was grant

impressive
youre looking at a true sports aficionado lets see how about interstellar history
oh great you pick the one subject i almost failed at the academy go ahead and ask ow
are you all right
it just hurts a little feels like weve been here for days
actually its been about six hours try to hang on belanna the emergency crews are going find us any minute come on hurry up
go ahead and ask your stupid question before i pass out and you dont have anybody to play with
okay er its a famous ship er prewarp civilisation er montana er second stage had chemical engines
another clue
vulcans er earth first contact
oh right right er er er zephram cochranes ship what was it called oh its on the tip of my tongue ow
okay here here youd better lie down now enough trivia for now
no no im going to get this one
lieutenant ensign
its about time what happened to the turbolift
during the last attack nineteen main power relays were severed the entire turbolift system is nonoperational
get me to the jefferies tube network on deck eleven the eps manifold must have taken a hit too
seven of nine can go take a look we have to get you to the doctor
all right
the phoenix
what
the correct response to your query the vessel ensign kim was describing it was designated the phoenix
not bad i didnt realise you knew so much about earth history
i dont but the borg were present during those events
really
its a complicated story perhaps another time
i think so
transverse bulkheads weve set up emergency forcefields between all decks and every section in the event of a cataclysmic breach most of us will be protected
ingenious
actually you can thank mister paris he came up with the idea
i was inspired by an ancient steamship the titanic the engineers of the day constructed a series of special bulkheads sort of like a honeycomb that would lower into place if they suffered a major hull breach in theory they could stay afloat even with half the ship filled with water
the titanic as i recall it sank
well lets just say ive made a few improvements
i knew your fixation with history would come in handy someday good work
doctor to lieutenant paris
go ahead doc
report to the mess hall at once more wounded are one the way
ill be right there im a popular guy today
seven of nine to tuvok
tuvok here
there is an undetonated chronoton torpedo lodged in the starboard jefferies tube on deck eleven section two the warhead is still active
do not attempt to disarm it hold your position and wait for my arrival is that clear
arrive quickly
ive stopped the internal bleeding youre going to be okay
is that your expert opinion
thats a promise i know it still hurts
its all right
youve got a ruptured vertebra ill see if i can repair it
mister paris your assistance please
give me a minute
now lieutenant
ill be right back dont go anywhere
in case you hadnt noticed belanna is not the only patient here
shes in pain
but no longer in danger of dying that is the first rule of medical triage make sure the patient will live then move on to the next one emotional detachment is essential otherwise you risk impairing your judgment
i understand
you could be seeing more of your friends in here soon if you cant handle itm ill find another assistant you can leave
physician heal thyself
whats that supposed to mean
it seems to me that youre the one whos getting emotional around here
several weeks ago just before the conduits on deck five breached i saw ensign strickler and crewman emmanuel at the end of a corridor they were trying to reach the jefferies tube i kept the hatch open waited for them as long as i could but time ran out i had no choice but to seal the hatch
it must have been very hard for you
my point is it could have been worse had i lost my objectivity i might have kept the hatch open and everyone would have perished this man has damaged lung tissue treat him with inaprovaline
if we attempt to dislodge the torpedo or move it with the transporters it will most likely detonate
can we disarm it
no the warhead is already destabilising i estimate it will explode in less than two minutes if we reroute emergency power to this junction and erect a level ten force field it should be enough to contain the explosion we must hurry
if i can determine the exact temporal variance of this torpedo it will help us perfect the temporal shielding
there is no time
we may never have this opportunity again
i am giving you an order now
the temporal variance is one point four seven microseconds
excellent work but if you disobey my orders again i will be forced to
happy birthday
happy what
today is may twentieth
is it i thought we were still in april guess ive lost track of the time
well this should help
its beautiful
nineteenth century mechanical movement its a replica of the chronometer worn by captain cray of the british navy his ship was hit by a typhoon in the pacific everyone back in england thought they were killed but eight months later cray sailed his ship into london harbour there wasnt much left of it a few planks half a sail but he got his crew home
i appreciate the sentiment but i cant keep this recycle it we cant afford to waste energy on nonessentials
kathryn i replicated this months ago ive been saving it i wanted you to have it
that watch represents a meal a hypospray or a pair of boots it could mean the difference between life and death one day
enter
reporting for duty lieutenant
what is our agenda
after we make your customary rounds id like to take you to deflector control i had an inspiration last night about the temporal shielding
excellent
youve been damaged
a minor laceration
i have offered to assist you with your personal grooming
there are some tasks i would rather perform myself
unacceptable youre risking further injury
shaving is hardly a lifethreatening activity tell me about your inspiration
weve been trying to match our shields to the temporal variance of their torpedoes but i believe we must also match the deflector array to the inverse of that variance
fascinating when will the deflectors be ready
theyre ready now but the modifications are untested
then our rounds can wait take me to deflector control
seven
ensign
a friend of yours
my cabin mate as a borg i was accustomed to cohabitating with thousands of other drones but i find it significantly more difficult to live with a single human
in what way
ensign brooks is negligent she leaves her equipment lying around the quarters and her clothing on the floor
indeed i have found that most humans are less than meticulous when it comes to their domestic habits
indeed
mister vulcan sir a tactical question if i may
you may
were just about done rebuilding the internal security sensors and were ready to programme the audio signal do you want it to say intruder alert or should we try something a little more dramatic like warning intruder alert or intruders among us danger danger intruders among us
intruder alert will suffice
yeah go with the classic understood sir
and you believe you have difficulties
all hands to battle stations krenim vessels approaching repeat all hands to battle stations
go to deflector control and bring the new shields online we will test them in battle
computer activate tactile interface
weapons status
phasers are still online torpedo launchers are still inoperative
the krenim are within visual range
on screen
sevens modified temporal shields should be online in a moment
its a warship
you know the routine
evasive manoeuvres
theyre matching course
hold them off as long as you can bridge to seven of nine
where are those shields
stand by
theyre charging weapons
seven we could a little of that borg efficiency right about now
i cant shake them
theyre targeting the bridge
temporal shielding is online
theyre firing
full port thrusters
temporal shields are holding no damage
hail them
channel open
krenim vessels this is the captain of voyager you may have noticed we have a defence against your torpedoes now i suggest you stand down
no response
their mistake bring the ship about were going through their space whether they like it or not
we are within range of the garenor homeworld
set temporal coordinates full power to the weapon prepare for total erasure of the species
targeting the focal point ready
fire
temporal incursion in progress
trace elements
diminishing
counter indications
none so far organisms and structures are being eradicated
track the temporal wavefront as it passes through the system i want to monitor every change in the timeline as it occurs
yes sir
captain the krenim warship is in pursuit but their weapons are not powered
they dont know what to do with us now that were shielded against their torpedoes
captain theres some kind of spatial distortion heading toward us sensor readings are erratic i cant identify the phenomenon
whats the source
unknown but it originated approximately twenty light years from our position it looks like a shockwave in the fabric of spacetime
tom get us out of here
well never outrun it captain
maybe our new shields will help all hands brace for impact
you were correct captain the temporal shielding has protected us the wave front has passed
captain
report
its definitely a krenim ship identical hull markings same biospectral frequency but its half the size limited fire power
what happened to the warship
im not picking it up on long range sensors
it looks like this entire part of space has changed somehow the last time i checked this region was filled with krenim colonies and vessels i just ran a scan and sensors show no colonies and just a handful of krenim ships
harry transfer all your sensor data about that shockwave to the astrometrics lab
yes maam
tell seven of nine to meet me there
captain astrometrics took heavy damage a few days go its offline
well lets get it back online it appears that the krenim imperium has vanished our troubles could be over and id like to find out why
something went wrong the entire krenim imperium its reverted to a prewarp state
not possible our calculations were perfect
i may have an explanation theres an anomalous temporal reading twenty light years from here its coming from a vessel
what vessel
component zero four nine beta a ship called voyager
that ship was classified as an inert component it shouldnt be generating a temporal field
but it is and it was enough to throw off our calculations
take me to them
sensors are online power levels are stable
is the astrometric database still intact
yes
display the scans we made of this region before the temporal shockwave hit
spatial grid zero zero five
the krenim imperium over two hundred star systems nine hundred planets thousands of warp capable vessels and now after the shockwave everything seems to have changed run a new scan
spatial grid zero zero five
same space different configuration exactly as chakotay said the imperium appears to have been reduced to a few planets and a smattering of vessels it appears that someone or something has altered history but why werent we affected
perhaps we were protected from the changes by our temporal shielding
so the question remains what caused that shockwave in the first place see if you can track it back to its origin
the shockwave emanated from a planet twenty light years away the garenor homeworld
the garenor we passed their planet three weeks ago
the planet is no longer populated
what
astrometric data indicate that the instant the shockwave appeared the garenor species vanished
erased from history
captain
im no authority on time travel in fact ive made it my goal in life to avoid it but this sounds to me like a causality paradox think about it a temporal shock wave eliminates a single species and all of history changes as a result
an intriguing theory perhaps the krenim are responsible they do possess temporal technology
but why would they alter history to undermine themselves no were still missing a big piece of the puzzle run another scan of the
scanning the vessel their defensive shielding is generating a level nine temporal disruption
collect samples two lifeforms ten square metres of the hull
yes sir
disable their shielding prepare to initiate a temporal incursion
that entire vessels in a state of temporal flux its like they exist outside spacetime
theyre scanning us
get a lock on them
im trying but i cant isolate their signals
were being hailed
on screen
state your identity
im captain janeway of the federation starship voyager who are you and where are my men
i am annorax of the krenim imperium weve transferred your crewmen to my vessel for further analysis your ship does not come from this quadrant
we come from earth a planet sixty five thousand light years from here were on our way home
i see
weve been observing some rather unusual events in the region it seems your imperium never existed perhaps you could shed some light on this
that doesnt concern you what is important is that you understand that i bear you no hostility but you have diverted me from my mission
your mission youre responsible for the changes in the timeline
youre a long way from your world in a manner of speaking so am i unfortunately only one of us can go home again your sacrifice will restore the lives of countless millions im sorry
im reading a massive energy buildup some kind of weapon
shields
temporal shields are weakening
captain that energy beam its pushing voyager out of the spacetime continuum
hes trying to erase us from history
ive scanned their propulsion system their vessels mass prevents them from exceeding warp six we can escape
captain i must remind you our structural integrity is still impaired if we go to warp now the damage to voyager will be extreme
what about tom and chakotay
well have to come back for them all hands clear the outer sections and prepare for widescale breaches tuvok activate the transverse bulkheads
temporal shields are failing
engage warp seven
theyre not in pursuit
were losing the outer hull transverse bulkheads are holding
each of you has done their best but determination alone isnt going to hold this ship together its time we faced reality weve lost nine decks more than half the ship has been destroyed life support is nearly gone voyager can no longer sustain its crew i promised myself that i would never give this order that i would never break up this family but asking you to stay would be asking you to die you will proceed to the escape pods and evacuate this vessel set your course for the alpha quadrant along the way try to find allies secure faster ships if you can anything to get home the senior staff and i will remain on board as long as possible we will try somehow to rescue tom and chakotay the escape pods are equipped with subspace beacons thats how well keep track of you when we find each other again  and we will we will find each other again i expect all of you to be in one piece with some interesting stories to tell good luck
come on dont do this to me now emergency forcefields are holding how the hell did all this gas get inside
looks like a malfunction in the ventilation system okay im going to try reversing the osmotic pressure on this deck whoa the gas corroded the circuit relays
lets bypass
weve got three minutes of air left
how long can you hold your breath
ensign kim found time to be treated so can you
how is harry
hell be fine but im surprised he didnt asphyxiate i told you eight minutes on that deck not eight and a half not nine and certainly not twelve
would you rather have an indoor nebula if we didnt stop it then and there it would have flooded another two decks belanna engines
not yet captain one of the warp nacelles is still offline the other ones a lost cause
route all available power to the good one
the alveoli in your lungs have been chemically burned i want you off your feet for the next forty eight hours
impossible ive got too much work to do
there are seven other crew members on board youre the captain delegate
inject me with trioxin that should help me breathe a little easier belanna stand by for the transfer
right
trioxin is used in emergency situations as a stopgap measure your lungs have suffered serious damage they need to be treated properly doctors orders
captains orders trioxin now
aye aye its your body who am i to judge im only the chief medical officer what do i know
thank you now where were we
well you look rested
wheres my crewmate
he should have been here by now no doubt hes making himself difficult ive never seen such an intransigent young man
youve had us in isolation for two months weve been scanned poked and prodded how do you expect us to act
with some degree of dignity and restraint your crewmate has none
what do you want from us
at the moment information
anything for such a charming host are you all right
the galley has prepared a selection of unique delicacies you wont find them anywhere else in the galaxy please join me
malkothian spirits an extremely rare vintage the only bottle known to exist your captain said that your vessel is trying to reach home i hadnt realised how far your home was youre an anomalous component alone disconnected impossible to predict you have no idea how youve complicated my mission
glad to hear it
when i first encountered your vessel it was badly damaged barely functioning what if i told you that in the blink of an eye i could restore voyager to its former condition that you and i would never have met that you might even find yourself closer to the alpha quadrant
by using the weapon on this ship to alter history
yes i can control the destiny of a single molecule or an entire civilisation hows the wine
excellent
this bottle is the only component left of the once powerful malkoth race everything else about them cities culture the very species itself never existed because of me every dish you see here comes from a civilisation that has been erased from time mister paris youre devouring the last remnants of the alsuran empire i have collected artefacts from hundreds of worlds this vessel is more than a weapon its a museum of lost histories you two gentlemen almost became artefacts yourselves but ive decided to spare your vessel
why
call it an act of compassion youre trying to reach home in a way so am i we can work together to achieve both our goals
what do you propose
in order to make the calculations required to restore voyager i need to know about some of your experiences in this quadrant what species you interacted with how other components were affected by your presence
you cant find her can you i think captain janeway has been eluding you for the past two months otherwise you wouldve destroyed voyager by now
im offering you a way out of this situation you accept my offer or when i do find voyager i will destroy it
and how many civilisations will you have to erase to send us merrily on our way no thanks we dont want that kind of blood on our hands
tom hold on you said you could control the destiny of a single molecule if you made a precise enough calculation could you restore voyager without harming anyone
it is possible but its extremely difficult thats why i need your cooperation
id rather spend a year in solitary confinement than listen to any of this
tom have a seat
chakotay we cant trust him
youre correct given the circumstances there is no reason to trust me but trust isnt necessary we need each other
obrist show our guest to his new quarters ill do everything in my power to make you comfortable here mister paris all i ask in return is that you keep an open mind
i was very impressed with your question you seem to understand the subtleties of time
professor vassbinder mightve disagreed with you i failed his course in temporal mechanics
beyond study and instrumentation there is instinct not everyone has the ability to truly perceive time its colours its moods perhaps you do
im certainly willing to give it a try
to distant friends
to friends
hear hear
cheers
yes
well
interesting
not bad not bad at all
what is it exactly
i call it the elixir of endurance its loaded with amino acids carbohydrates all the nutrients necessary for the crew to withstand these stressful conditions
ration cubes
well yes yes but this time pureed and mixed with water and enhanced with talaxian spices
it is offensive fortunately taste is irrelevant
well its been a few days since weve gathered in one place nows a good time to catch up how are the repairs proceeding
im happy to report that ive repaired the optronic error in my programme
and the power grid
were operating at thirty two percent efficiency i think i can bring it up to fifty but ill need a few more days
warp drive
im still having trouble with the starboard nacelle
how long
three weeks minimum
i thought this nebula would be a safe haven until we finished repairs but its turning into a permanent residence weve got to get back into open space find allies put together a fighting force to take on annorax were leaving this damn cloud first thing tomorrow morning
captain you are in error
really
at the moment this vessel is defenceless we should remain here until we are functioning at our peak efficiency
i appreciate your opinion seven but i disagree we leave tomorrow oh eight hundred hours
it is inappropriate to contradict the captain in front of the crew
that was not my intention i simply pointed out that her decision was wrong
in your view
and yours i know you well enough to say that
then you should also know that my trust in captain janeway is absolute the decision you or i might have made is irrelevant
as a borg i submitted to a single authority the collective over the past several months ive been encouraged to think and act as an individual it is difficult to know when to restrain myself
remember this guideline the captain is always right
even when you know her logic is flawed
perhaps
component 37329 a rogue comet about eight months ago voyager made a course correction to avoid the comet according to my calculations it led to our entering krenim space
the solution then would be to erase that comet from history
exactly voyager would have stayed on its course and bypassed krenim space altogether
sounds simple enough conduct a simulation
temporal incursion in progress what happened
had you actually eradicated that comet all life within fifty light years would never have existed congratulations you almost wiped out eight thousand civilisations
i didnt consider the entire history of the comet
four billion years ago fragments from that comet impacted a planet hydrocarbons from those fragments gave rise to several species of plant life which in turn sustained more complex organisms ultimately several spacefaring civilisations evolved and colonised the entire sector
by erasing the comet i altered all evolution in this region
past present and future they exist as one they breathe together youre not the only person to make this mistake when i first constructed this weapon ship i turned it against our greatest enemy the rilnar the result was miraculous with the rilnar gone from history my people in an instant became powerful again but there were problems a rare disease broke out among our colonies within a year fifty million were dead i had failed to realise that the rilnar had introduced a crucial antibody into the krenim genome and my weapon had eliminated that antibody as well
and youve been trying to undo that damage ever since but each time you pull out a new thread another one begins to unravel
you cant imagine the burden of memory that i carry thousands of worlds billions of lives gone brought back gone again i try to rationalise the loss theyre not really being destroyed because they never existed sometimes i can almost convince myself
youve been at this for two hundred years annorax what makes you think youre ever going to succeed
what makes you think voyager will ever reach earth the odds against you are astronomical yet you keep trying
youre right but we dont destroy everything that stands in our way
you can help me to change that chakotay together well restore the krenim and voyager and well undo the damage that ive caused
ive still got a lot to learn
come its time i show you the heart of this vessel the temporal core
engines
im doing my best
captain with the deflector down those micrometeoroids are beginning to erode the hull
emergency power to the deflector
none available
ill be in deflector control
captain that entire section has been designated hazard level four
i know
oh why do i get the feeling youre testing me voyager bridge theres a fire in deflector control any luck with the engines
the warp cores still offline
micrometeoroid density
is increasing the nacelle pylon is buckling
bridge im going in stand by to engage the deflector tell the doctor ill be coming
back with severe burns
captain
do it be kind
the captains accessed manual control shes stabilising the particle emitters shes got it deflectors online
activating deflector field bridge to janeway captain please respond
whats my condition
you suffered third degree burns to approximately sixty percent of your body ive healed most of them but without a dermal regenerator i couldnt repair all the damage to your skin youve been left with scars on your face and arms
ill consider them mementos
not so fast youre spending the next few days here with me
what for
observation
is there something else wrong with me
not physically
what are you suggesting
traumatic stress syndrome symptoms irritability sleeplessness obsessional thoughts reckless behaviour all of which youve demonstrated over the last few weeks
my only obsession is with saving my ship my people if ive been taking some reckless chances in order to do that its hardly a medical condition
im not going to stand here while you rationalise yet another brush with death
you dont have to
as chief medical officer i have the authority to relieve you of your command
youre not going to do that
if in my medical opinion your judgment has been impaired i can and i will
try it and ill shut down your programme
that threat in itself is evidence of your unstable condition
i am sorry doctor ive been operating on instinct for so long i did not think before i spoke i have no intention of deactivating you but i wont stay in this mess hall
is that final
final
then you leave me no choice captain kathryn janeway under starfleet medical regulation one twenty one section a i the chief medical officer do hereby relieve you of your active command effective immediately have a seat
how do you plan to implement this protocol doctor mister tuvok doesnt have a security team both the brigs have been destroyed and with the internal forcefields offline youll have a hell of a time keeping me confined youd better grab a phaser because before i give up command youll have to shoot me
you realise this incident will be noted in my official logs by refusing my orders you risk a general court martial
compared to what ive been through the past few months a court martial would be a small price to pay if we make it back home ill be happy to face the music
another ruptured eps conduit
thirty two so far
thirty three thirty four thirty five and that fluidic converter needs to be purged
right
the gravitational plating in this room has buckled
chakotays quarters
you disobeyed orders
captain
chakotay gave this to me five months ago a birthday gift i ordered him to
what do you think
handsome
come on
astounding
not really i get lucky now and again
your end game sequence it er it was the same one favoured by my brother
to quote a long lost friend of mine it seemed logical now what
i used to honour the day of his birth
who
my brother and my parents my closest friends every year at first then one day i realised a century had passed and for years i had been celebrating birthdays for the dead or for people whonever even existed
im sorry
you can put that thing down chakotay no need to strain your eyes anymore ive got a plan
lets hear it
this ships temporal core keeps the vessel out of phase with normal spacetime but its shields are incredibly weak you take that core offline and a photon grenade could penetrate the hull
how do you know all this
ive been spending time with our friend obrist who seems more than willing to share information and thats not all does the name captain bligh mean anything to you this is not a happy crew theyve been at this for two hundred years now theyre tired of it chakotay they want it to end
good work tom but im not quite ready to start a mutiny keep gathering information lie low im starting to make progress on the temporal calculations with a little time and luck i think we can get the krenim back on their feet and voyager back to the alpha quadrant
youre starting to sound like annorax always one more calculation this time its going to be perfect
this can work if youd take the time to listen youd understand what annorax is trying to do
what wipe out civilisations to help his own race i understand perfectly
its more complicated than that annorax is an enlightened man misguided but i think he wants this to end as much as anyone
i guess i dont have the instinct for time or whatever it is captain nemo out there calls it chakotay hes been flattering you and its gone to your head
youre out of line lieutenant
maybe i shouldnt start a mutiny but i might be able to get obrist to help us send a message to captain janeway
not yet if you get caught we lose everything i can get us out of this
not if i get us out of here first
youre not doing anything against annorax thats an order
what are you going to do take away my holodeck privileges
either we maintain our command structure or else we settle our differences the old fashioned way
whats happening
were preparing for a temporal incursion
what incursion you didnt say anything about
i had an inspiration last night by my calculations the eradication of the ram izad species will result in a fifty two percent restoration of the krenim timeline
i thought we were working to avoid more destruction
when time offers you an opportunity you dont ignore it
were within range of their homeworld
take us into orbit full power to the weapon prepare for total erasure
is this what you call enlightened
targeting the focal point locked
please this isnt necessary well find another way
fire trace elements
diminishing
counter indications
none so far
scan the continuum bring me the results once theyre complete
yes sir
ill be in my chambers
have you seen enough yet chakotay if you dont do something about this maniac i will
you didnt need to fire on that planet
im altering history on a massive scale the destinies of countless star systems are in my hands the fate of one species is insignificant
youre trying to rationalise genocide one species is significant a single life is significant
it seemed so easy the first time in the blink of an eye i had changed history itself allowed my people to thrive again but when i changed history a second time i lost more than you can imagine
the colony on kyana prime
how could you know that
ive been studying your previous incursions no matter how close you get to restoring the timeline one component is always missing kyana prime who was on that colony who did you lose
my wife and with her my future my children grandchildren all erased because of me this is all i have left of her
so many years i worked through the night while she was sleeping how could i have known i was calculating her fate i cant stop until ive restored kyana prime and forced time to give me back my wife
maybe it isnt possible
when i tell that time has moods a disposition to be intuited im not speaking metaphorically
what do you mean
anger is one of its moods anger and the desire for retribution vengeance time itself has tried to punish me for my arrogance it has kept me from my wife denied me my future
sir weve achieved a fifty two percent restoration
kyana prime
negative sir
resume scanning the continuum
yes sir
ive er ive studied your calculations chakotay theyre promising but premature well keep working on them in the meantime my mission must continue
you dont have the right
to fight for what is mine thats not for you to decide only time can pronounce judgment against me
if that little display doesnt convince you i dont know what will hes insane
no hes not wounded maybe even tortured but i can still reach him convince him to stop
not from what youve told me this guy thinks that time has a personal grudge against him thats called paranoia chakotay with a hint of megalomania
you dont know what hes been through
hes lost his family okay thats a terrible thing but so has everyone else on this ship and frankly so have we
what kind of progress have you made
obrist is coming around and i think we can trust him he says hell give me access to their communications array i can send a message to voyager from the comfort of my own quarters
and the temporal core
thats going to be a little trickier with obrists help im pretty sure i can disable it but not without setting off every alarm on the ship were only going to have one chance
itll require precise timing you and me working from within
and captain janeway attacking from voyager that is if the captains still alive
shes alive send the message transmit our coordinates
done
and give kathryn my best
ive analysed every carrier frequency of their transmission it contains a classified starfleet id code it could only have come from tom paris its real the coordinates he sent should lead us directly to the weapon ship
location
approximately fifty light years from here our new allies are assembling reinforcements once were in range tom says hell try to take the weapon ships temporal core offline when that happens theyll be vulnerable to conventional weapons tom will then transmit the exact location of the core our job will be to disable the ship and get our people out is everyone clear
yes maam
aye captain
belanna harry i want you to beam over to the nihydron vessel work with their engineers the entire fleet needs to be equipped with temporal shielding
aye captain
tuvok neelix seven youll be working on the mawasi ship
yes captain
doctor once the attack begins your skills will no doubt be required join tuvoks team
what about yourself
ill be piloting voyager coordinating the attack
captain theres barely enough of this ship left to get there much less wage a war
theres fight in voyager yet its still got temporal shields six photon torpedoes itll hold together besides you know the adage captain goes down with the ship right you have your orders dismissed tuvok i can hear your objections already i am not leaving
given voyagers damaged state the probability of your surviving an armed conflict is marginal
oh i know the odds but i have to stay voyagers done too much for us
curious i have never understood the human compulsion to emotionally bond with inanimate objects this vessel has done nothing it is an assemblage of bulkheads conduits tritanium nothing more
oh youre wrong its much more than that this ship has been our home its kept us together its been part of our family as illogical as this might sound i feel as close to voyager as i do to any other member of my crew its carried us tuvok even nurtured us and right now it needs one of us
i respect your decision live long and prosper captain
same to you old friend
voyager to mawasi vessel
go ahead captain
im picking up the weapon ship dead ahead
confirmed
temporal shields status
all vessels are bringing them online
this is captain janeway to the fleet plot an intercept course to the weapon ship
sir six vessels are approaching our position
identify
three nihydron warships two mawasi cruisers and voyager
were outside spacetime impervious to their weapons let them come
i know captain janeway she wouldnt be attacking unless she knew she could do some damage
good work obrist
if shes given the other ships temporal shielding theyve undoubtedly informed their home worlds theyll be able to protect their planets against your weapon
bring the weapon to full power stand by for multiple incursions well have to disable their temporal shields first make the necessary calculations
all vessels report ready
lets see if tom has done his part janeway to the fleet attack pattern omega engage
condition
no damage temporal core is stable
return fire
captain two nihydron vessels have been destroyed
janeway to the fleet evasive pattern delta were going to have to wait come on tom come on
target the other vessels obrist i said target the vessels youre deactivating the temporal core
im sorry sir its over
get back to your stations you will not disobey me were phasing back into normal spacetime reconfigure to conventional weapons
captain chakotay and paris were beamed aboard our vessel
everythings going as planned tom sent me the coordinates of their temporal core before he left im transmitting them to you now
conventional weapons are online and fully charged sir
fire at will
sir weapons are back to full capacity
target voyager put janeway out of her misery
all our ships have been disabled captain do you have weapons
negative torpedo launchers are down im setting a collision course janeway to the fleet take your temporal shields offline
captain we wont be protected
exactly if that ship is destroyed all of history might be restored and this is one year id like to forget times up
the core is destabilising its going to cause a temporal incursion within the ship
when can you bring it online
we just did
in fact were in the process of charting a new course home
well id say this is cause for celebration
a vessel is approaching off the port bow captain
on screen
theyre hailing us
open a channel
youve entered krenim space state your identity
captain janeway of the starship voyager were just passing through trying to get home
this region is in dispute i suggest you avoid our territory
thanks for the warning
good journey
tom plot a course around krenim space
aye sir
so what do you think how about a groundbreaking ceremony for our new lab
sounds great
i think ill replicate a bottle of saint emillion for the occasion 2370 i hear that was a good year
good morning
good morning
join me for breakfast
in a little while i still have a few more calculations
there are always a few more calculations its a beautiful day spend it with me
i suppose i can make the time
neelix
tom been doing a little shopping
its a present for belanna
what is it
well its sort of personal
of course say no more im on my way for a little romantic rendezvous myself
neelix are you wearing cologne
talchok musk very enticing scent dont you think
well it certainly is musky
im going to see talli again
ooo that was fast work where are you taking her
well actually i havent gotten that far yet im going to visit her shop under the pretext of buying some produce for the ship and then i thought id just sort of segue smoothly into some dinner and dancing
sounds like a good strategy
do you really think so i mean you used to be quite the ladys man
used to be
i mean of course youre involved now so you wont be availing yourself of all the beautiful fascinating and very openminded mari women
neelix are you trying to depress me
i just i havent been with anyone since kes and im feeling a little rusty i could use some advice
the best advice i can give you is to just be yourself
right be myself
actually thats the second best piece of advice
whats the first
go a little easier on the musk
im sorry mister guill but thats my final offer
actually captain i sense youd be willing to raise your price to three hundred renns lieutenant torres needs this resonator coil to upgrade voyagers communications systems
telepaths
wait a minute i sense youd be willing to settle for two fifty
you must have read my mind
ow ow hey
im sorry
are you hurt
no no im fine i just wish people would look where theyre going
its been a pleasure doing business with you
ill finish up here why dont you go get neelix
this is some of the loveliest fruit ive seen in a long time
actually its been one of our worst water plum seasons in years i dont think youll find them very sweet
oh how wonderfully tart theyll make excellent preserves
neelix why do you want me to tug on your whiskers
excuse me
that is what youre thinking isnt it that youd like me to tug on your whiskers
well as a matter of fact
id love to do you have time to wait until i close
yes i think i can rearrange my schedule
i guess you could say im becoming obsolete
in what sense
theres virtually no crime left in our society it took many years but just walk through our streets look around violence no longer exists
impressive
im one of the last officers still working for the constabulary
and no doubt one of the best im curious to know more about your crime prevention methods
under one condition i want to see voyager learn about your methods
i am about to perform my daily security rounds join me they are routine but informative
wonderful
the transport site is this way
you prefer speaking aloud why is that
ive grown accustomed to it over the years there are very few telepaths in starfleet
whatever you prefer
neelix ready to leave
ah no ah you go ahead we havent finished examining the produce
help somebody help me please stop him help me
this will teach you to watch where youre going you idiot you idiot
somebody get a doctor
why why were you beating that man
i dont know
your brig its a puzzling concept shutting someone away as punishment do you find that it rehabilitates the prisoner
the brig is primarily used as a means of ensuring the safety of others
in what sense
for example if we find ourselves with a hostile alien in our custody we may need to confine the individual until we can locate the proper authorities
i see
and on rare occasions we have been forced to incarcerate a crew member who has committed a serious infraction
im surprised that one of your people could be capable of doing something serious enough to warrant imprisonment
its extremely rare in any case the brig has been occupied for less than one percent of our journey
forgive me tuvok but it seems barbaric
if all species were as enlightened as yours and mine there would be no need for prisons
bridge to commander tuvok
go ahead ensign
chief examiner
nimiras been recalled to the surface theres been some sort of attack
in the marketplace
ive never seen so much blood before
its all right
i heard about someone getting beaten once when i was a little girl
its all over now
i had nightmares for weeks
its okay its all right
he was confused he said he didnt realise what hed done
i dont understand why nobody tried to help him
people were shocked violence is almost unheard of here but when it does occur we like to investigate thoroughly
can we help
yes i would like you mister neelix and lieutenant torres to answer some questions
you have our complete cooperation
chief examiner are you suspicious of my colleagues for some reason
no lieutenant im simply conducting an investigation please follow me
please have a seat
i will be monitoring your thoughts telepathically during the interview this transcription device will log your engrammatic activity so i can review your statement later
let me get this straight not only are you going to read my mind youre going to record my thoughts
yes
i guess itd be pretty tough to keep a secret from you hmm
how long had you been in the market place when the attack occurred
an hour maybe a little longer
and exactly where were you standing
directly across the square
from where you were did you have a clear view of the attack
not at first we just heard yelling then as we got closer we saw what was happening
what exactly brought you to the market in the first place
captain janeway and i had an appointment with mister guill
for what purpose
wed met him the day before hes said he could geta spare resonator coil for us
i see and the two men involved in the altercation had you seen either of them before
id never seen the victim but the attacker i think he was the same man who bumped into belanna
bumped into her are you certain
yes they collided accidentally
when exactly did this happen
just as wed settled on a price
he seemed to be in quite a hurry
do you recall what you were thinking at the time
what i was thinking what does it matter
please try to remember it may be important
i didnt think about it much and no one was hurt and i was busy trying to sort out the coins im not used to handling currency
what was i thinking i was thinking how i can make a delicious pie with those water plums
are you sure thats all mister neelix
yes of course what else would i be thinking about
i suppose i was a little annoyed
can you be more specific
all right i guess i was thinking my foot hurt i mean the idiot stepped right on it
did you call him an idiot
of course not
but you thought it
i guess so
did you also think about retaliating
it was an accident
but you said he hurt you it didnt occur to you to hurt him back
id never do that
but you thought about it
how am i supposed to remember
yes or no did you think about hurting him yes or no
well maybe for a split second
i mean he should have been watching where he was going but i realised that he didnt do it on purpose so i shook it off and i left why what does it matter what i was thinking
lieutenant belanna torres you are under arrest
on what charge
aggravated violent thought resulting in grave bodily harm
are you saying its a crime to think about violence
yes
thats ridiculous
i assure you its quite necessary we were once a society plagued by violence when we prohibited hostile thought crime began to drop immediately over the past three generations its all but disappeared
so you believe that its all right to tell people what they can and cannot think
its an irrefutable fact that violent thoughts from others can lead to violent actions
even if belanna had a violent thought it was frane who attacked that man
which he only did because he telepathically received that thought from belanna his mind was contaminated by the image and it resulted in a loss of control he may have committed the physical act but it was instigated by you
where we come from people are responsible for their own actions
and here people are responsible for their own thoughts im sure you can understand how thats necessary for a race of telepaths
yes i can
captain
ill accept that your people can be influenced by the thoughts of others but there were dozens of people in that square how can you be certain it came from belanna
the mari no longer have violent thoughts its unlikely any of them could have been responsible besides the evidence against belanna is clear she thought about committing a hostile act
id like to review that evidence myself if you dont mind
certainly but im afraid youll be disappointed
what happens to belanna now
we have an enlightened penal system here unlike some we dont lock people away to punish them youll be released once youve undergone the engrammatic purge
the what
its a medical procedure that will identify and remove the offending images from your mind
captain
once identified the images can be removed from franes mind as well
memory extraction thats a dangerous procedure
there is a risk of neurological damage but its necessary for us to treat frane
will you at least delay the procedure until ive had the time to review the evidence will you
itll take us about a day to reconfigure our instruments thats all the time i can give you
thats all the time ill need
captain weve got to get belanna out of there
you know the rules tom we cant pick and choose which laws well respect and which we wont
nobody can be expected to control their thoughts
tell that to the mari
are you just going to let them put her through this process
im doing everything i can to stop it neelix is going to file a diplomatic protest and tuvok and i will be going over the witness statements maybe we can poke a few holes in the chief examiners case
and if you cant
then lets hope the doctor can figure out how to reverse an engrammatic purge
all away personnel have been told to return to the ship as soon as possible
so much for r and r
chakotay weve got to talk
have a seat
here
im sure the captain wouldnt object whats on your mind
while tuvok and the captain are reviewing the evidence belannas sitting in a mari jail cell waiting for some sort of lobotomy we cant let that happen
what did you have in mind
break her out
and risk an allout confrontation with the mari
theyre a bunch of pacifists theyre no match for us
youre probably right but before we start resorting to extreme measures dont you think we should give the captain a chance to find a legal solution
by the time that happens it may be too late
ill tell you what why dont you come up with a rescue plan one that minimises the possibility of violence and ill review it
youre just trying to keep me busy arent you
can you blame me
im serious about this chakotay
so am i if your plan is sound and the captain doesnt have any luck on her end ill recommend we attempt the rescue
thanks ill get right on it
tom i may have let you sit in the captains chair but remember shes still the boss
then you dont accept the chief examiners conclusion
im not dismissing it but im not going to accept it blindly either
i have spent a great deal of time with nimira over the last few days she clearly is a very skilled investigator
im sure she is
and this isnt the first time lieutenant torres violent proclivities have created problems
no argument there but i have a hard time buying that one fleeting thought makes her responsible for a vicious attack
from what ive learned crime here is a result of exposure to violent thought much as it was on vulcan before my people learned to control their emotions in my opinion the mari should be applauded for their efforts
well im sure their intentions are admirable but im not about to let them scramble belannas brain without a fight
but we must prepare ourselves for the probability that she will turn out to be culpable for the crime
maybe so and then again maybe not take a look at this i dont mean to accuse your friend nimira of being less than thorough tuvok but dont you find that just the least bit curious
new evidence
it concerns the attacker mister frane according to your own security records he was arrested on four previous occasions for harbouring violent thoughts you classified him as an habitual perpetrator of hostile images
true but those thoughts were purged each time he spent years in neurogenic restructuring the records also say he was cured
still it is possible that frane had a relapse that he alone is responsible for his actions in the marketplace
possible but unlikely our engrammatic scans of frane show that lieutenant torres thought was prevalent in his mind during the attack
and you are certain no other violent thoughts were present
im beginning to feel like im the one being investigated
i am simply exploring all logical options as a fellow law enforcement officer you should understand that
i do and im willing to share my findings with you but if youre trying to prove your crewmates innocence youre too late the case is closed do you think that this is easy for me i dont want to harm belanna but i dont have a choice that thought has to be contained otherwise we risk further violence maybe even a city wide panic you told me your people spent centuries learning how to control their violent impulses i know we havent achieved your level of discipline but were trying i thought youd understand
i am not judging your culture in fact i admire it i have enjoyed your company in particular but i cannot abandon my responsibility to belanna i must continue my own investigation
go right ahead but i intend to proceed with the engrammatic purge
telepathy i dont like it never have its bad for negotiations its bad for relationships and its certainly been bad for belanna
the fault was her own
what are you talking about
she was careless with her thoughts the result was violence
belannas not used to being around telepaths that doesnt make her guilty
then her crime was ignorance a common affliction among your crew
whats that supposed to mean
you make contact with alien species without sufficient understanding of their nature as a result voyagers directive to seek out new civilisations often ends in conflict
what you call ignorance we call exploration and sometimes it means taking a few risks but its certainly better than assimilating everything in your path
your goal is to share knowledge assimilation is the perfect means of attaining that goal
perfect
good morning miss tembit your usual selection
yes please
okay
oh im so sorry
idiot watch what youre doing
shes dead
i cant believe shed dead
i know this is difficult for you mister neelix but try to recount for me everything that happened
seven and i were packing to return to the ship we heard a scream i went running the old lady was just standing over tallis body holding the bloody knife in her hand i didnt even get a chance to say goodbye
did the old woman say anything
not that i remember she was as shocked and confused as anyone else do you think this is somehow connected with the other attack
i am not certain but it strikes me as more than coincidence that two violent altercations have occurred within two days in a city which purports to have eliminated virtually all crime
 bridge to commander tuvok
tuvok here
chief examiner nimira wants to see you shes requesting permission to transport aboard
permission granted have her escorted to the briefing room tuvok out we will continue later
commander she was a wonderful young woman whoevers responsible for her death find them and see that theyre brought to justice
i will do my best mister neelix
thanks for seeing me
i heard what happened do you have any idea what caused this latest attack
i just finished interviewing the old woman
and
she attacked the victim in response to the same violent thought that motivated the previous beating
belannas thought but both she and frane are in custody how could the thought have been passed to anyone else
i dont know thats why im here i need your help
then you shall have it
thank you i dont know why that thought is still contaminating people but i have got to put a stop to it ive never dealt with a murder before but youve had experience with homicide investigations
i have
i thought i would start by tracing the old womans whereabouts for the past few days to see where she might have encountered the thought
a wise choice in the meantime i would like to interview belanna more extensively perhaps a fresh perspective might uncover facts you hadnt considered
ill arrange it immediately
im not sure i like the idea of a mind meld any better than an engrammatic purge
it will be a limited meld i will focus exclusively on your memories of the events surrounding the crime it poses no danger are you ready your mind to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts recall your encounter with mister frane he bumped into you what happened next
i guess thats when i had the thought about hitting him
and after that
guill came over and asked if i was hurt
and what were you thinking at that moment
why
im sensing something more to the encounter than what youve told me try to recall it may be important
well he was just holding me by the shoulders
you said hed been reading your mind during the negotiation was he still doing it
i dont know
you experienced negative feelings about him
he gave me the creeps
in what sense
he wanted something something terrible
what the hell why didnt i remember that before
you may be recalling an unconscious thought you had at the time or an intuition perhaps i should ask mister guill
mister guill im commander tuvok voyagers chief of security
my children get upset when im late for supper if youre here to do business we can make an appointment for tomorrow
im here to talk to you about the attack
why me
my crewmate lieutenant torres has been charged with the crime i believe youre acquainted with her
lieutenant torres yes she was arrested
the chief examiner believes it was her violent thought which prompted the beating
ah she seemed like such a pleasant young woman
apparently she was almost knocked over while doing business with you do you recall that
yes a man accidentally ran into her youre not like the others from your ship are you youre a telepath
that is correct
why are you so curious about what happened
i am conducting my own investigation of the crime
i see for a moment i thought you had another reason for asking you struggle with violent thoughts as well terrible images but theyre hidden deep within your mind
i am in control of those images all members of the vulcan race learn to inhibit emotions if my unconscious thoughts are disturbing you i will attempt to suppress them further
no please dont trouble yourself i cant see them clearly enough to be affected
i sense that you are fascinated with my unconscious thoughts that you would like to see more of them if you could
no i was just thinking maybe i could help you
help me
in learning how to deal with these dark impulses
no thank you i have sufficient means of controlling them
im sure you do any other questions
no
then if youll excuse me i really cant be late for the table
do you have the money
three thousand renns
i have something exciting for you tonight
why are you following us
i was thinking abut what you said your interest in my unconscious thoughts perhaps we could help each other
how would we do that
by telepathically exchanging violent images that is what you want isnt it to see whats buried in my unconscious
who is he
quiet why should i trust you
because you know we are very much alike perhaps i was mistaken
wait maybe we can be of use to each other but youll have to get rid of this
come back later malin if im right ill have thoughts to share that are darker than anything you could imagine
well
fascinating
now show me
ill need a few moments to recover
im surprised youre so easily tired your telepathic abilities are strong
it is not often that i exercise those skills
there must be violent thoughts to be had from your shipmates whether they want to share them or not after all they couldnt stop a telepath from probing their minds could they
is that how you acquire your merchandise
sometimes i buy sometimes i find a person like you whos willing to share and yes when the opportunity presents itself i take what i need
which is what you did to lieutenant torres
frane took her thought not me
so you know mister frane
only casually
well enough to be in business with him
why do you ask
i am interested in the thought he acquired from belanna her violent tendencies have always fascinated me yet ive never succeeded in probing her mind if you could help me purchase that thought
its impossible franes already had it purged
odd i was certain you possessed it
me
didnt you extract the thought from belanna as well just after she collided with frane
what
i reevaluated belannas memories of the incident she remembers that you probed her mind
she remembers incorrectly
perhaps or perhaps you did extract that image which would explain why that same thought is still in circulation why it prompted a murder this morning
enough its time you gave me what you promised
the only person youll be sharing thoughts with tonight is the chief examiner
where are you going
stand aside
tuvoks taking me into custody
no
still no sign of him
try a multiphasic bioscan
were being hailed captain its nimira
on screen chief examiner have you had any luck locating tuvok
im afraid not
id like to send a search party
i cant allow that
why not
we cant risk further violations of our laws
thats ridiculous
tom i really dont think we pose a serious threat
theres nothing more to discuss lieutenant torres will be purged then returned to you
captain you cant let them do that
the decisions been made im sorry
let go of me
belanna please try to relax
oh you have got to be kidding
sedate her
no wait
proceed
you wont escape punishment for your crimes
quiet
you are responsible for a death
i never meant that to happen the old woman begged me for that thought i had to help her here
youre justifying murder
enough malin hold him still now show me
youre holding back i havent seen the best of it yet have i
no
then show me
if i show you will you let me go
yes
come in closer
dont be alarmed this will allow you to see the deepest recesses of my mind my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts
yes good this is the side of you i wanted to know
whats happening
we are locked in a vulcan mind meld you dont understand the truth of violence its darkness its power
please stop
increase the electrochemical displacement but be very careful with the synaptic potentials one miscalculation and we could permanently damage her cerebral cortex
communications centre to chief examiner nimira
nimira
captain janeway insists on speaking with you she says its extremely urgent
relay her signal what is it captain
its imperative that you discontinue lieutenant torres engrammatic extraction immediately
commander tuvok has found new evidence which proves her innocence
i hope this interruption is justified suspending an engrammatic purge once its begun is highly irregular
then lets not waste any more time commander
i have discovered that guill and frane are responsible for the beating in the marketplace and consequently for tallis murder
guill the merchant
that is correct
what possible involvement could he have it was frane who acted on the violent thought
that is not in dispute however lieutenant torres thought was not transferred accidentally
i dont understand
when guill first met lieutenant torres he sensed strong violent tendencies within her a potential for mental imagery which interested him in order to exploit that potential he conspired with frane to provoke belanna they wanted to trigger a violent thought so they could telepathically draw it from her mind
i cant believe that
it is precisely what happened unfortunately they underestimated the intensity of the thought it was more powerful than anything either of them had ever experienced as a result frane lost control and attacked the victim
why would peaceful men like guill and frane want to subject themselves to such hostile images
my investigation has uncovered a rather disturbing side of mari society a black market if you will in which many of your citizens trade in illicit mental imagery guill is a very prominent figure in this underground or was until i brought him into custody
why would any of my people want to indulge in that kind of behaviour
apparently outlawing violent thought hasnt made it go away all youve done is force people to share it in back alleys
it seems you have a somewhat more serious problem than the random thoughts of a single alien
even if i believed you im not sure anyone else would
then i suggest you interrogate guill yourselves his engrammatic record will undoubtedly confirm what ive told you
where is he now
we have him confined in our brig
fortunately the mari didnt get very far with the procedure you can return to duty lieutenant though perhaps with one or two fewer violent engrams in that fiery head of yours
its all right doc there are plenty more where those came from
duly warned
thanks for getting me out of there
i was merely pursuing the truth
so if i was responsible for passing that thought you would have let them lobotomise me
it is incumbent upon us to respect the laws of the societies we visit
so you still a fan of the mari legal system
my views have been somewhat modified
then youre not going to lecture me about losing my temper
if you must know investigating this case has given me a new respect for your inner struggle
really
burdened as you are by your primitive klingon psyche it is a wonder you are able to keep your violent thoughts under control as much as you do
thanks i think
youre welcome of course there are various vulcan techniques which could help you increase your selfcontrol
you dont say
come in
i must speak with you
of course have a seat
i prefer to stand
i keep forgetting
you once encouraged me to express my opinions if i had something relevant to say
go right ahead
you wish to return this vessel to the alpha quadrant and yet you are following starfleet protocol regarding first contact the two objectives are incompatible
how so
your philosophy of exploration exposes voyager to constant risk if you maintain a direct course to earth and avoid all extraneous contact with alien species it will increase your chances of survival
well that would make a dull ride home
captain
we seek out new races because we want to not because were following protocols we have an insatiable curiosity about the universe
your chief engineer and security officer were nearly lost today that is unacceptable
to you maybe but not to me or my crew our experience with the mari gave us an insight into a culture weve never encountered
but that is irrelevant
no its how we gain knowledge
then we are in disagreement
good i dread the day when everyone on this ship agrees with me i thank you for your opinion but our mission is not going to change

maybe you underestimated the wingspan

not recently

youre giving up again your beautiful painting of the adoration  		the great bronze horse in milan the battle of anghiari unfinished  		all of them you were going to publish your notebooks you never did  		you have given up abandoned your most important works why
there is a tavern just outside paris catarina a charming bistro  		where the wine is
terremoto
janeway to the bridge
were under attack captain
im on my way
earthquakes and idiots florence be damned
who are they and why are they shooting at us
unknown captain theyre not responding to hails
damage
none
im reading a slight destabilisation along the shield perimeter
attempting to compensate
er torres to the bridge
go ahead
we just lost the warp diagnostic assembly
what do you mean lost
it disappeared
im picking up demterialisations on decks four through twelve
evasive manoeuvres
theyre matching our course changes
its definitely some kind of transporter beam
fire at will
i have the will but not the means captain targeting control is down
why
captain the main computer processor is gone weve lost weapons navigation and  		propulsion
backup systems are coming online
full phasers manual targeting keep firing until you hit something
the other ships are retreating
chakotay to all decks full damage reports
i feel like weve just been mugged
they were employing a highenergy transporter beam designed to locate objects of  		technological value and remove them
they removed a lot five tricorders three phaser rifles a couple of photon torpedo casings  		two antimatter injectors a months supply of emergency rations
no great loss there
excuse me youre forgetting the most important thing of all my mobile emitter  		without it im stuck in sickbay i cant go anywhere
well do the best we can doctor but our top priority is the main computer processor  		belanna i want a defence against another transporter attack harry do everything you can to  		track those ships
yes maam
dismissed
seven hey
if youre here to fraternise i do not have the time
actually the captain wanted me to locate the ships that attacked us  		ive pushed the long range sensors about as far as theyll go
and now you believe the sensors can be extended by using  		the deep space imaging system
well yes
ive been working on that exact procedure for the past two hours
really lets have a look
do you doubt my ability to finish the task
look i came here to work i realised youd already started the job so i  		offered to help thats all i offered to help
an algorithmic feedback is interfering with the resolution decompile data banks  		fifty nine through seventeen and attempt to isolate it now or you should leave
okay im a pretty easygoing person i mean it takes a lot to ruffle my feathers but thats not true of everybody youve got to learn how to phrase things a little more diplomatically
or not
im picking up starfleet signatures from two of the continents
can you find the main computer processor
its on the northern continent in what looks like a city but theres a  		lot of signal interference ill never be able to localise it from here
captain i have identified nearly twenty seven kinds of alien ships in orbit of this planet  		it appears to be an active centre of commerce  we should be able to place an undercover  		away team on either continent without attracting attention
thats good enough for now tuvok you and i are going after the processor tom neelix  		i want you on the other continent find out what you can at the very least  		try to get our emergency rations back chakotay you have the bridge
it never fails to impress me no matter how vast the differences may be between cultures  		people always have something that somebody else wants and trade is born
or more to the point theft
what have you got
the materials in the construction of this city and the technology  		in use appear to have originated from numerous sources
no doubt stolen
the myriad signatures have resulted in high interference levels i am unable to  		a moment i am picking up a starfleet signature
the computer processor
i dont believe so the signal magnitude is too low the signature is  		approaching
catarina che meraviglia out of my way out of my way scusi scusi catarina  		catarina welcome welcome to america
tell me catarina what do you think of the new world
how did you get here
a question i have asked myself many times one moment i was packing for my journey to france the next i was  		in this land of marvels possibly upon leaving my workshop i was accosted by  		spanish sailors rendered unconscious delivered to a galleon in the port of  		genoa and carried like a sack of grain across the vast atlantic curious ears
my travelling companion tuvok
ah what the old philosophers say is true  		monstrous and wonderful are the peoples of undiscovered lands  		but tell me catarina how did you come to the americas
oh its a long story a portuguese ship some turkish pirates  		a couple of hurricanes ill tell you about it some other time
excuse me there is the man i have been looking for he has an apparatus  		that i need for my next invention my patron is a demanding taskmaster
your patron
the prince of this city buon giorno signore
the da vinci character is interpreting this world through the  		limited capacity of his holodeck programme
he sees everything in sixteenth century terms
but what is he doing here
i was running the da vinci simulation when we were attacked his         programme must have been active in the computers memory when the processor was beamed off the ship
and then downloaded into the doctors mobile emitter but by whom
his patron the prince
marvellous no
a plasma injector conduit starfleet issue
call it what you will with this machine i can make mercury flow in three directions at once  		you must see my new workshop the prince has been very supportive andiamo
lets go
so catarina what do you think of this place my workshop  		in florence was but a cave of ignorance in comparison
your new patron gave you all this
he is the perfect prince intelligent but not overly so  		in awe of my talent but not threatened by it and above all and  		most importantly his purse is inexhaustible
and in return for all this support
i give him my ideas i have even resurrected my great bird like the  		phoenix of legend they have materials here catarina that are so strong and  		so light that surely my prototype will ascend to the heavens
be careful  		they have found a way to harness the energy of a  		thunderstorm and to expel it with great force a pistole that shoots  		not a lead ball but a bolt of lightning
id like to meet this patron you yours
and so you shall this very evening but i caution you he is as ruthless as a borgia
who sold you these things
i didnt come here to be interrogated you told me you  		have a warp coil to trade
i said you could talk with commander chakotay i didnt say hed  		necessarily do business with you
well this is a waste of my time
i agree theres the door
what
goodbye make sure he doesnt get lost on the way out
no no no wait wait his name is tau he controls the seventh province in the north
he sells weapons and technology
yes
which he confiscates from passing ships
yes using his translocator device which he also stole its made him a rich man
there are a few items id like to get back where can i find him
i deal with a gobetween ive answered enough of your questions lets talk about  		that warp coil im looking for something that
you can keep what youve got well call it even
this was a waste of my time
not really these colours look good on you
torpedoes plasma grenades particle beam rifles i can even get a ceremonial spear if youre interested
i am not interested
my point is no matter what the weaponry if you desire it chances are i have it or i can get it
your prices are said to be unreasonable
unreasonable is such a strong term but if i cant sell to you ill sell to  		one of the other colonies in your system a violent sort your neighbours arent they  		id hate to make your life difficult by offering my weapons to them but if you dont give me a choice
there can be no doubt our computer processor is not in the city
well that certainly makes things a little more difficult leonardos new patron is quite  		the business man
we may have no choice but to do business with him
catarina here are some friends i want you to meet
try to keep our hologram occupied
but captain
make small talk
vulcans do not make small talk
improvise
thank you that is very considerate
catarina wait a minute
mister da vinci how have you been
benissimo now if youll pardon me
i wish to speak with you
what about
about you you are most intriguing
ah grazie and you signore tuvok are equally provocative where exactly are you from
scandinavia
so what do the scandinavians think of this new world
it is fascinating and you are obviously enjoying it
beyond words yes italy is already a fading memory the city is  		full of mechanical marvels the countryside alive with creatures strange  		and wonderful
im curious how have you spent your time here
i work on my inventions and my art and i accompany the prince  		when he goes to visit his great fortresses well this er fascinating conversation has left me as dry as vulcan
vulcan
an island off sicily have you been there
no
pity
well talk later
good evening
and to you enjoying yourself
not yet
no how can i change that
by having exactly what i want and selling it to me at a low price
the formers quite likely but as for the latter i dont sell inexpensive merchandise
i have a client who runs a colony about twenty parsecs from here his  		computer is outmoded so im looking for a replacement
a computer that could coordinate the systems of an entire colony thats  		no small order but i think i might have something that will interest you
hello computer and how are you today
all systems are functioning  within normal parameters
verbal interface impressive
computer tell us your technical specifications
simultaneous access to forty seven million data channels transluminal processing at  		five hundred seventy five trillion calculations per nanosecond
interested
operational temperature margins from ten degrees kelvin to one thousand  		seven hundred ninety degrees kelvin
i could sell it to you but i could hardly let it go for anything less than a warship or  		we could find something else in your price range
we should be looking for a stronghold or storage facility any  		place tau might keep the stolen technology
there are several possibilities all within a ten kilometre radius of  		the city i must admit your mister da  		vinci is an astute observer of nature these maps couldnt be improved upon by  		voyagers topographical computer
he was a renaissance man tuvok interpreted reinterpreted deconstructed         fantasised about all through history vasari thought he was an angel freud thought  		he had a problem with his mother james t kirk claimed he met him although the  		evidence is less than conclusive
buongiorno amici
good morning maestro did you sleep well
too well im afraid my apologies catarina the morning is half gone  		nevertheless the images that come before the eyes upon awakening can be inspiring
indeed
catarina where did i leave my silver tipped pen i could swear it was  		here on the
captain we should return to voyager with my tricorder readings and  		leonardos maps we can use the ships sensors to triangulate the exact  		location of our processor
well work on two fronts you go back to the ship ill stay  		on the surface and keep working with leonardo he has access to tau and  		he knows the territory
inadvisable charming as your childhood hero may be the programme         was  		not designed for use outside the holodeck
this is leonardo da vinci were talking about simulation or not  		hes one of the greatest creative minds in earths history
the programme reproduces the entire range of da vincis behaviour  		his genius and his notorious unreliability
we have an opportunity here and i want to take advantage of it
tuvok to voyager one to beam up
table where did he go
back to the ship
the ship you mean the portuguese are still in the harbour
no not exactly but theyre nearby
ah mad sea dogs the portuguese
so whats new
new
whats been happening on the ship
nothing of consequence the captain and tuvok are still searching for the processor
whats the mood
if youre referring to the crew morale they seemed focused on their mission
hmm i heard there was something of a fuss in the mess hall last night
a trivial misunderstanding
oh you seen in excellent health most of your implants are stable but  		your optical interface is misaligned again i told you to come in for  		maintenance once a week now what happened in the mess hall
lieutenant torres and i were working on some astrometric data there was a disagreement
i understand things got a little heated
lieutenant torres became emotional she chose to display hostility rather than to counter my argument
what did she say exactly
it is irrelevant suffice it to say i was correct she was not
details seven i want specifics
i see no reason to discuss these trivialities
without my mobile emitter i am a prisoner in here i need to know what is going  		on beyond these walls trivial or not
torres referred to me as an automaton she also employed a series of profane  		klingon insults shall i translate them for you
by all means id very much
tuvok to seven of nine report to the astrometrics lab
you may go
ill be right there commander
come back whenever you feel like talking ill be right here all by myself
i am entering leonardos maps and my tricorder data into the imaging system
i will create a search pattern for our missing processor
da vinci has accurately rendered the topographical detail however his  		coordinate axes are precartesian you will have to convert them
understood it is puzzling that even a vulcan would refer to a holographic  		character by name as if it were alive it seems somehow illogical localising grid  		altitude twenty kilometres
one of these storage facilities undoubtedly contains the processor increase  		sensor resolution to maximum and scan the area
there our computer processor is inside this structure
unfortunately the building is surrounded by a dispersion field transport will be impossible
if the captain can get inside the facility and reach the processor itself she may be able to assist us
if she were to initiate a power surge in the processor it might produce a signal strong  		enough for us to lock onto
that is what i was referring to
i will inform the captain
its not too far across open country leonardo says hes been there  		and he can help me get inside
understood
stand by for my signal if i can find the processor be prepared  		to beam it back to voyager
aye captain tuvok out
so its captain i see you and my hologram are old friends
my engineers have developed a defence against your transporter so i  		suggest that you return what you took from us and let me go
or what youre in no position to bargain the only ones who will bargain will  		be your crew and it will cost them a great deal to get their captain back  		i wonder what youre worth to them
hell be fine lets move
im not going
you said youd help me
i have already gone too far he was threatening you i had no  		alternative but i must be here when he recovers his senses i will try to explain  		maybe if i am lucky he will not have me executed
we are leaving your time here is over
i will not leave this new world
your new world is a prison you are under his control
when are we not in prison hmm when are our lives free from the  		influence of those who have more power than us if this new world is a cage  		then it is a cage of gold of marvels of opportunities if this prince is violent violence can be tempered
you cant stay here forever leonardo europe is your home
europe is despicable here i am free to do what i wish free from judgment  		free to fail but without a sense of shame without without the taunts of the ignorant
leonardo whether you want to admit it or not they do need you back home  		in florence milan avignon they need your genius they need your heart and  		right now i need you too so come on
i will not go for florence or milan or avignon but for you catarina for you i will go
ive lost the captains comm badge signature
scan for the holoemitter
its four point seven kilometres outside the city
so leonardos on the move is the captain with him
her comm badge may have malfunctioned
or she may have been discovered
should i beam da vinci back to the ship
if the captain is with him and attempting to recover the processor she may need  		his assistance
keep a lock on the mobile emitter and stand by
aye sir
wheres the entrance
i cant recall
why not
these fortresses ive been to half a dozen of them all are similar  		but each is different
catarina observe the construction like the veins and arteries  		of a great animal now this is the way to build using nature as your guide
no more lessons i need to get into this building and i need to get into it now
that is not the way an apprentice should address her master
maestro your prince is going to come after us the only escape is inside
escape we will be trapped inside
no there is a wondrous invention inside this building its called a  		computer processor we can use it to send a beacon to the portuguese ship and  		theyll come and rescue us
computer this invention how does it work
well its complicated but trust me when i say it can send messages over  		great distances all we have to do is find it and we will be rescued but the  		question is how do we get inside
shadow and sunlight shadow and sunlight the prince like any other  		thief will fear theft above all else so this stronghold will have but one  		entryway on the side facing away from the sun
so the bright light will be in the eyes of anyone who might attack
esato
im no longer reading the mobile emitter
theyve gone inside the structure
commander theyre being pursued over thirty armed guards are  		converging on the storage facility
all available power to the transporters lets try to get them out  		of there
even theseus could not negotiate this labyrinth
not without a compass
your compass is speaking to you
this way
a trove of invention
the prince has done well for himself phasers warp plasma injectors a sitetosite transporter
your computer
yes computer do you recognise my voice
affirmative
well thats a start
che bella theres a mechanical woman inside
in a way yes initiate a level four induction relay overload
that procedure is not recommended
command override janeway pi one one zero
authorisation confirmed initiating overload
thats it
and now
we wait for the portuguese
commander im detecting a power surge in the subspace frequency range
could be the processor lock on increase power to the confinement beam with  		any luck we might be able to pull the captain out of there along with it
step close leonardo were going for a ride
i dont understand
trust me
the building is probably surrounded by now theres only one way out  		maestro come here
catarina what just happened to me i was shot yet i live such things are not possible
this is an invention from another land its called a site to site transporter  		in the blink of an eye it can move us out of this building and a few kilometres away  		from here
how
come on
i must have an explanation
leonardo youve always said that its a poor apprentice who cant surpass her master  		there are things in this world that i understand and you dont
madonna mia
the processor is on board
the captain
still on the planet
commander thirteen vessels are approaching voyager from the surface
tom take us into a higher orbit bridge to torres i want that processor back  		online weve still got a captain down there
acknowledged
i cannot believe it i will not believe it my mind cannot accept the evidence of my eyes  		is this sorcery are we in purgatory
neither you said yourself this place was full of marvels
marvels yes but this is magic enchantment not science and i refuse to believe in enchantment
ill explain later weve got to keep moving
no i must understand catarina to see objects disappear into thin air to see  		lightning pass through my body are we spirits catarina am i dead
let me ask you something if you were something other than a human being  		if you were a different kind of animal if you were a small bird a sparrow what would your world be like
i should make my home in a tree in the branch of an elm i should hunt insects for food  		straw for my nest and in the springtime i should sing for a companion
and you would know nothing of the politics of florence the cutting of marble or mathematics
of course not
but why not
my mind would be too small
as a sparrow your mind would be too small even with the best of teachers
if aristotle himself were to perch on my branch and lecture till he fell off from exhaustion  		still the limits of my mind would prevent me from understanding
and as a man can you accept that there may be certain realities beyond the limits of your comprehension
i could not accept that and i would be a fool
spread out
come on
catarina this way up the hill i know just the escape
torres to bridge were in business weve got full navigation full propulsion
and full transporters
good work belanna
sensors show the captain and da vinci have left the structure if we can dip into a  		lower orbit i should be able to lock onto the mobile emitter
set the confinement beam wide and prepare to beam both of them back to the ship 		how close do we have to be
at least five hundred kilometres from the surface
those ships will try to block our descent
ready for some fancy flying
you bet
momento catarina escape signorina is very near
im starting to wonder where are you chakotay
help me to the summit
were at one thousand kilometres nine fifty nine hundred
the ships are powering weapons
go to red alert
shields are holding
eight hundred and fifty kilometres
evasive manoeuvres
when petrarch climbed mount verdoun and saw all europe below him he knew  		he was witnessing the birth of a new age he was witnessing the renaissance  		the rebirth of our world so catarina at this summit here you and i will be reborn  		reborn with wings
this could be a problem
hurry theres not much time
sir they seem to be on the edge of a precipice but were still too  		high for transport
youve made some improvements
i took your advice after the last attempt and  		increased the reach of the wings
and the angle of attack
yes yes that too unfortunately the river arno is quite absent  		this time if we fail only the stones will  		break our fall
the wing is stationary thats good this looks like duranium alloy  		should be light enough
catarina this time it will work
lets find out
im reading weapons fire on the surface near the captains  		position were running out of time sir
seven hundred kilometres
hold on kathryn just a few more seconds
together up
andiamo
catarina were flying
like the birds
like the birds
i have a fix on the captain they are in midair on what  		appears to be a crude gliding apparatus
five hundred kilometres
im locking on broad confinement beam
energise
got them ive beamed the whole contraption into cargo bay one
get us out of here mister paris
leonardo where are you going
france these florentines do not deserve my genius i have  		written to the king of france telling  		him of my adventures in the new world and invited him to soar  		with me from the towers of his castle
are you sure thats a good idea
why not we ourselves have tested the design
but the materials youll never find those metals in france
no then others will suffice machines that fly through the air lightning flung from ones hands mechanical women who live in boxes these things i have seen and these things i must recreate and who knows possibly improve upon
leonardo i think that little flight of ours went to your head
and my heart my oldest memory catarina is of a  		great bird perched on my bed its feathers  		open towards me as if summoning me you yourself have  		accused me of giving up  		of failing to complete my projects
i was trying to encourage you
no you were right all my life i have wanted to fly  		perhaps my failure to do so has  		caused my heart to remain in flight leaping from one thing to  		another never satisfied never complete
and now that youve actually flown
now who knows what i cannot accomplish
id like to find out give my regards to the king of france
catarina will you walk with me to my carriage
it would be my pleasure
thank you
oh you look like a man who could use more coffee
keep it coming im working on my monthly ops report so much has happened in the last few weeks on this ship im going to be up all night
this firenut blend should keep you eyes open
potent stuff thanks
neelix
yes
i know you have your hands full this evening but i could use your help
at your service commander
were approaching a class one nebula sensors are picking up traces of protomatter inside i understand youve dealt with it before
absolutely when i was making my living as a trader protomatters one of the most soughtafter commodities its the best energy source in the quadrant
we could use your expertise in collecting a sample were leaving at fourteen hundred hours see you in the shuttlebay
ill be there sir
these nutritional supplements are unacceptable
whats wrong
they are pungent
thats the whole idea ive been adding talaxian spices to broaden your palette
my palette is sufficiently broad
why settle for sufficient the doctor tells me you have a full complement of taste buds youve hardly begun to use them come by the mess hall thursday night its the first day of prixin well have an impressive array of exotic cuisine
prixin
the talaxian celebration of family we observe it every year on voyager now that youre part of the family
what should i do to prepare
nothing its not a mission seven its a party
ensign wildman to neelix
neelix here
i hate to bother you but naomis having trouble getting to sleep again would you mind
no bother at all im on my way if youll excuse me duty calls
naomi i dont recall that designation on the crew manifest
thats because shes not a member of the crew naomi was the first child born on voyager im her godfather and the only one who can get her to sleep lately bon appétit
no monsters here
good check the replicator
nothing
naomi maybe neelix should check your room so you can go to bed
okay in there
nobody here
there
ah theres not a monster in sight
can you stay longer im afraid to go to sleep
honey neelix has to go to work
its all right you know what i think about when im afraid to go to sleep
no what
the great forest
whats that
its a place my people believe were all going to go to someday its a beautiful beautiful forest filled with sunlight and all the people who ever loved me are gathered there to watch over me as i sleep to protect me
really
when i think about that forest and those people im not afraid to sleep anymore
do you think those people watch over me too
i know they do now im going to be away for the next couple of days so if youre afraid to sleep i want you to think of that great forest
all right
pleasant dreams
night neelix
cylinder
oh sorry i didnt realise you were home
i was regenerating
i see
do you require assistance
no no no i have a small containment cylinder stored here ill just be a minute cylinder little cylinder where are you cylinder you were here a month ago now i know that you didnt just roll out of the airlock all by yourself now where are you oh im sorry im talking to myself its my way of remembering things
you are a peculiar creature neelix
thanks i think ah here it is oh this will be perfect for containing a small amount of protomatter last time i used this little wonder i nearly lost it to the kazon
the kazon species three two nine
youre familiar with them
the borg encountered a kazon colony in the gand sector grid six nine two zero
were they assimilated
their biological and technological distinctiveness was unremarkable they were unworthy of assimilation
i didnt realise the borg were so discriminating
why assimilate a species that would detract from perfection
good point well if youll excuse me im needed in the shuttlebay pleasant regenerating
one day a week thats all i ask how hard can it be
harder than you think
neelix its pizza bread tomatoes cheese
the cheese alone would take days separating curds and whey from synthesised milk its a delicate process
so replicate the cheese
since it means so much to you ill see what i can do
thanks theres a concentration of protomatter directly ahead
neelix
set the transporter for ten thousand amus not a particle more the containment field is standing by
were in range
energising
what happened
the transporter beam ignited the protomatter shields are weakening
disengage transport
shields are down
ive got the sample commander and its stable
were clear of the protomatter hows neelix
hes dead no heart beat no synaptic response extensive cell damage to his brain
try a cortical stimulator
it wont work his neural pathways were disrupted by the protomatter
set the stimulator for an autonomic bypass at least we can get his vitals going
its too late for that the damage was too severe
were running into more protomatter i need your help
captain im detecting the shuttle
hail them
no response
the shuttles primary systems are offline lifesigns only two
are they within transporter range
affirmative
beam them directly to sickbay harry put a tractor on the shuttlecraft tuvok youve got the bridge
i ran a complete postmortem analysis there was nothing you could have done
i knew we were too close to the protomatter i should have said something
nobody could have predicted this tom
how shall i proceed
the talaxians mourn their dead for a full week in a specific burial ceremony and thats just what were going to do
ill inform the crew
ill check neelixs personal database see what i can find out about the ceremony well have it in the mess hall somehow that feels appropriate
neelix is dead
im afraid so
his neural pathways are they intact
yes but theres no metabolic activity
how long has he been dead
seven i understand
how long
its been eighteen hours
then its not too late to reactivate him
what are you saying you can bring neelix back to life
thats precisely what im saying the borg have assimilated species with far greater medical knowledge than your own we are capable of reactivating drones as much as seventy three hours after what you would call death
neelix wasnt a borg drone
we will adapt
what does this procedure involve
nanoprobes are used to reverse cellular necrosis while the cerebral cortex is stimulated with a neuroelectric isopulse
but theres nothing left to stimulate his brain functions are gone
by your narrow definition perhaps but not by mine you will extract seventy micrograms of nanoprobes from my bloodstream i will modify them to match his talaxian physiology his function in this crew is diverse if you wish to salvage him we must proceed immediately
i say we let her try
hold on a minute tom please no ones ever been resuscitated after being dead for eighteen hours if this procedure does work what are the chances that neelix would come out of it unaffected
shes right the damage to his cerebral cortex was severe
the nanoprobes will compensate for any cellular degradation captain a decision has to be made quickly
doctor give seven whatever assistance she needs proceed
captain
do it if theres a chance we can revive neelix were got to take it keep me informed
the nanoprobes are ready we should begin
hold on i want to check his blood viscosity
the cadaver has been sufficiently prepared
and they say i have a lousy bedside manner
set neuroelectric isopulses for one second intervals
ready
now
neural activity at nine percent ten percent twelve percent
this is incredible his intracerebral blood pressure his synaptic responses theyre all returning to normal
the alveoli in his lung are regenerating they should be functional
now neural activity at fifty two percent and rising
his neurotransmitter levels are rising too fast
we must stabilise his motor neurones
im going to try reducing his acetocholine levels it might be enough to
doctor
neelix
what happened what happened why am why am i here
dead
for eighteen hours forty nine minutes thirteen seconds congratulations mister neelix youve just set a new world record
thats impossible you mean i lost consciousness i was i was in a coma
no you were dead
im stunned im amazed im grateful thank you doctor
actually you can thank seven of nine the procedure was her idea
yours
the borg have assimilated the technique from species one four nine i simply modified it but you are welcome
am i good as new
that remains to be seen theres no way to tell if your body will successfully take over the functions the nanoprobes are serving
nanoprobes
it was necessary to repair the necrotised tissue
until im certain the damaged tissue can function independently youll have to be injected with nanoprobes on a daily basis
well as long as i dont start assimilating the crew or sprouting borg implants im sure i can live with it
im releasing you to your quarters your bodys been through quite a shock so try to get some rest report to sickbay tomorrow at oh eight hundred hours for your next injection
the shuttle mission was it a success did we get the protomatter
im afraid not the sample you collected destabilised before it got back to voyager
the containment field needs to be reinforced next time
if there is a next time ive asked chakotay to find out exactly what caused the accident and unless we can take additional precautions im not sending another team into that nebula
i could help with that investigation
no you are taking some time off and thats an order
no captain please i dont need any special treatment
neelix youve just returned from the dead go easy on yourself
yes i suppose youre right oh but you cant ask me to cancel the first night of prixin the celebration is in three days
oh i almost forgot
ive been aging fruit compote in moolt nectar for weeks now i cant just let it go to waste
only if you feel up to it could you not ferment those compotes so long this time because last year i got a little lightheaded
ill make the necessary adjustments
its good to have you back
its good to be back captain
alixia why werent you there
human attitudes toward death are perplexing
how so
too much importance is placed on it there seem to be countless rituals and cultural beliefs designed to alleviate their fear of a simple biological truth all organisms eventually perish
i take it the borg have no fear of that biological truth
none when a drone is damaged beyond repair it is discarded but its memories continue to exist in the collective consciousness to use a human term the borg are immortal
you are no longer part of the collective you are mortal now like the rest of us does that disturb you
my connection to the borg has been severed but the collective still possesses my recollections my experiences in a sense i will always exist
fascinating that must be a great relief
yes it is
ive sealed the fractures in the shuttle nacelle the rest of the repairs should be completed by morning
good how are you coming
i found a small phase variance in the transporter logs i think it was responsible for igniting the protomatter ive remodulated the transporter beam to compensate
good work ill be in holodeck two ive created a simulation of the shuttle accident to see if theres anything weve overlooked
commander commander i thought you might need some assistance on the holodeck
if youre feeling up to it
well im up to anything at this point ive been resting for two days straight and resting makes me feel well restless
ive programmed the simulation to start when we found the protomatter why dont you monitor the containment field readings
gladly
computer display shuttle crew excluding myself and begin programme
theres a concentration of protomatter directly ahead
set the transporter for ten thousand amus not a particle more the containment field is standing by
were in range the transporter beam ignited the protomatter
computer freeze programme looks like there was a problem with the pattern buffer it might have created a feedback loop along the transporter beam
sounds right
lets keep an eye on it see what happened at the moment of impact computer resume programme
shields are weakening shields are down
ive got the sample commander and its stable lets get out of here
computer freeze programme
nothing
what
i died and there was nothing there was no one there no forest
forest
the great forest the afterlife i was taught that when i died my ancestors would be there waiting for me by the guiding tree my sisters my mother and father my cousings everyone who was killed in the war i took great comfort in knowing that wed all be together again one day but its not true
maybe we pulled you back before any of that could happen
no i was dead for eighteen hours i should have experienced something should remember something its just a story a myth there is no guiding tree no gathering of the ancestors
you cant be certain of that dont throw away a lifetime of faith because of one anomalous incident death is still the greatest mystery there is
i was there i experienced it there was nothing
computer delete characters
thats whats going to happen to all of us like a hologram we just disappear into nothing
attention attention if i may have everyones attention
you might want to try the old glass and spoon approach
glass and spoon
excuse me
thank you welcome to the first night of prixin the talaxian observance of familial allegiance this year mister neelix has requested that i commence the celebration with the traditional salutation we do not stand alone we are in the arms of family father mother sister brother fathers father fathers mother fathers brother mothers brother suffice to say the list is extensive we gather on this day to extol the warmth and joy of those unshakable bonds without them we could not call ourselves complete on this day we are thankful to be together we do not stand alone
indeed we do not
a few days ago we almost lost a member of our family i dont know about how the rest of you feel but it scared the hell out of me neelix you still dont know how to make a pizza but im glad youre here
so am i heres to you neelix
speech speech speech
thank you everyone well er enjoy computer music
you all right
fine commander fine i apologise for the other day on the holodeck i guess this whole back from the dead thing is hard to get used to im fine now
if you ever want to talk you know where to find me
having fun
no
thats probably because youve been standing here by yourself
i dont understand the rules and procedures for this type of social occasion
the rules are simple choose a group of people listen to their conversation then when you feel you have something to contribute chime in
chime in
say something join the discussion
i will try captain
the early stages of ktarian development are astounding naomi has grown five centimetres since her last physical and that was only three weeks ago
it seems like every time i turn around im recycling her clothes back into the replicator
children assimilated by the borg are placed in maturation chambers for seventeen cycles
interesting well if youll excuse me i need to go talk to neelix
in these maturation chambers the development of conversational skills is i suppose a low priority
neelix
oh im sorry
no no no its all right
we havent seen you in a few days
ive been a little preoccupied
i understand naomis been asking about you
really
she misses you frankly so do i shes had trouble sleeping every night this week only neelix can tuck me in i want neelix
sounds familiar
maybe you could stop by later just to say hello
why dont why dont i go now its close to naomis bedtime
are you sure prixins your favourite holiday
yes but duty calls
attention all monsters get out of this room
my bed
oh theres no monsters here
ah its a monster
scared you
you certainly did pleasant dreams sweeting
can you stay longer i want to hear about the great forest again
the great forest
the special place the place you think about when you cant sleep
are you sure you want to hear about that its just a silly old story
please
well its a beautiful place filled with sunlight
and all the people who ever loved me
yes theyve all gathered there to watch over you to protect you while you sleep
i had a dream about the great forest last night
you did
there was trees and grass and animals and i saw you and mommy and we were all happy
sounds like a nice dream
it was beautiful
the doctor asked me to run a haemotological scan
why
to regulate the dosage of nanoprobes for your next injection
go ahead how much longer will i be needing these injections
till your damaged cells can function on their own
i dont really like the idea of borg technology swimming around inside me
that is irrelevant you need the nanoprobes to live
live oh is that what i am doing right now living im beginning to wonder
by most definitions you are alive
well part of me isnt alive
which part are you referring to
i dont know but something is missing i dont feel like neelix anymore maybe neelix is gone maybe he died and im all thats left
stop moving and allow me to complete the scan
i didnt ask to be bought back
you were dead at the time
well what right did you have to violate me you borg think you can fix anything but you didnt fix me
there was no alternative
get out just leave me alone i said get out
i would be negligent in my duties if i did that
i dont care about your duties i dont care
whats whats happening to me
your cells are returning to a necrotic state we must get you to sickbay
his tissue began rejecting the nanoprobes causing spontaneous necrosis throughout his body
we modified the nanoprobes to compensate and it appears to be working neelix is stable for now
how do we know this wont happen again
we dont ive designed a monitor for neelix to wear that will alert us at the first sign of necrosis and well continue with the daily injections beyond that im afraid its a matter of maintenance he may have to live with this condition for the rest of his life he wants to speak with you commander
commander you said if i ever needed anything you once told me your people have technology that can induce a deep meditation an altered state of consciousness
the akoonah
that this device allows you to look inside yourself ask questions that you might otherwise be afraid to ask
thats right
thats what i need i need to look inside myself figure out whats happening to me i need answers will you help me commander
all right but i want you to understand the vision quest isnt a quick fix itll take time to interpret the images and theres no guarantee youll find what youre looking for
i understand what should i do to prepare
youll need a medicine bundle items that define you things that will ground you allow you to take the journey into yourself
ill get ready
this belonged to my sister alixia she made it during her expedition to the dunes of talmouth a flower from kes garden and last but not least the guiding tree it stands at the centre of talaxian afterlife deep inside the great forest its there to help us find our way when we first arrive at least thats what i used to believe not a very impressive medicine bundle is it
itll do fine now place your hand on the akoonah
am i doing this right
try to relax clear your mind of everything but the objects before you focus on them nothing else exists akoocheemoya we are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers we are far from the bones of our people we come here seeking guidance its time neelix try to leave this room this ship and go to a place where you were the most peaceful and content you have ever been thats where your journey will begin
neelix good to have you back
its good to be back lieutenant
alixia alixia its me neelix over here
captain my sister she was just standing here talking to you
the dead girl oh yes very charming i can see the family resemblance
alixia
you will be assimilated
no time for that now maybe later
potent stuff
the lights its beautiful
yes its just like you always imagined it would be the trees the sunlight and everyone who ever loved you
when i died i looked for you but you werent there why werent you there
because its all a lie
what do you mean
youve wasted your entire life believing lies the great forest the afterlife its all created out of your fear of death none of its real
if thats true whats the point of living
there isnt any thats what youre finally starting to realise  im afraid to go to sleep tell me about the great forest neelix tell me about the trees and the grass and all the people who loved you
why are you saying these things
scared you
you died on that shuttlecraft neelix they never should have brought you back it was a mistake and you know it now accept it you know what you have to do
no
its all a lie they lied to you
you know what you have to do
we gather on this day to tell neelix what he must do
you stand alone
life is irrelevant
let go
its pointless
its a lie
you know what you have to do
no
neelix
oh there you are i didnt see you
are you looking for me
yes as a matter of fact i am i hope im not disturbing you
you are not
i i want to apologise for my outburst the other day in the mess hall
no apology is necessary
no no please my behaviour was uncalled for i didnt mean the things i said i wasnt myself but i feel much better now commander chakotay has helped me to understand a few things i want you to know that i dont blame you for bringing me back to life i mean in fact what you did was very thoughtful
i would have done the same for any member of this crew
yes im sure you would have
is there something else
no yes seven i think youve made a wonderful addition to this crew i know its been difficult for you making the transition from borg back to human or half human or whatever it is youve become actually youre just plain seven to me
your point mister neelix
i guess i just want to say youre surrounded by people who care about you and whether you know it or not voyager is going to be a very good home to you it certainly was to me
was do you intend to leave
leave no ill be around well goodbye
goodbye
what happened to you this morning
im sorry i had to cancel our little chat but i was needed in the mess hall ive been so busy the last few days ive let things slip around here
youre not holding up your end of the bargain
what do you mean
when you asked me to guide you on a vision quest i agreed but i also told you it was part of an ongoing process were supposed to be discussing your progress
whats left to say ive told you i saw my sister the great forest i feel a sense of peace ive never felt in my entire life it worked
youve only lived with the visions for a couple of days thats not enough time to draw any conclusions youve got to reflect on the images examine them allow them to stay alive in your mind a vision quest isnt just a dream you dismiss after your first cup of coffee
i understand
good i get off duty at fourteen hundred hours meet me in my quarters and well begin thats an order
yes sir
computer lights off
and finally mister tuvok im grateful for the opportunity i had to win your respect your strength and your wisdom were an inspiration to me and i can only hope that your memory of me will serve to inspire you in some way it was an honour to spend my last years on voyager with this crew i want to thank all of you for your kindness and your companionship goodbye computer end log encode for delivery to captain janeway in one hour
captain someones trying to initiate an unauthorised transport its neelix
wheres he going
looks like hes trying to beam into the nebula
stop him
janeway to neelix neelix respond
neelix i order you to disengage transport
hes found a way to block the abort sequence transports in progress
override it get him back
bridge to chakotay weve blocked his transporter signal
you can slow me down but you cant stop me
what are you trying to do
im going back where i belong
you belong here neelix
not anymore i died in that nebula you should have left me
neelix
no closer ive created a site to site transport no one can override the signal
you told me you were at peace
i will be as soon as i tap this control
what really happened in your vision quest what did you see
my sister the crew myself they all told me the same thing theres no point in living and i agree with them
im sure those were powerful images but there are many ways to interpret them you may be coming face to face with your own fear of death or the manifestation of your emotional crisis your deepest beliefs have been thrown into doubt its only natural the vision quest would reflect that
eleven years ago i saw my world in ruins my family murdered all thats kept me going is knowing that one day wed be together again that id see them again but its not true and i cant live without that hope
i understand that this can change how you look at things but it can also lead to an even stronger faith you dont know youre not there yet
ensign wildman to neelix
answer her
neelix please respond
no
youre being called back to your life again neelix dont turn your back on it were your family now
its not enough
it is for us his function on this crew is diverse thats what seven of nine said about you even our borg understands how important you are on this ship its not just the duties you perform its the way you make people feel when youre around
that neelix is gone
i dont think he is
why didnt you answer me i had to have the computer track you down naomi thought she saw a monster in the replicator neelix whats going on
im trying to decide some things
that little girl needs you neelix monsters in the replicator who else on this ship can handle that
duty calls
goodnight sir
he says goodnight
goodnight naomi
goodnight
whats the matter
mummy says you were sick
i was but im okay now
did a monster get you
yes i suppose so but i chased him away pleasant dreams
ensign kim i require your assistance in jefferies tube thirty seven alpha
well can it wait i just got off duty
it is urgent
bridge to commander tuvok
tuvok here
youre needed on the bridge sir
on my way
computer lights on
neelix is anybody here
voyager to lieutenant paris
paris here
hows it going out there tom
one more orbit and i should have all the data we need
good work see you when you get back chakotay out
crewman ensign
sir
hello sir
it looks to me like you aligned the power couplings perfectly
i did
if youre so sure then whyd you need me to look at them
i did not
then whats this all about
ive learned from observing lieutenants torres and paris that humans sometimes require a pretext for being intimate with one another
intimate
resistance is futile
paris to voyager
voyager here
my primary warp manifold just ruptured ive lost helm control auxiliary power is offline thrusters wont respond
say again tom your signals breaking up
my orbits decaying i dont think i can hold it
repeat that tom
i need an emergency beamout
voyager to lieutenant paris come in
neelix
what can i do for you captain
where is everybody
didnt you see them when you came in
no
take a look computer activate lights
lieutenant commander tuvok reporting for duty
is something wrong
i think you forgot something tuvok
it appears that in my haste to report to the bridge i neglected to put on my uniform
what happened to them
they died
why
you didnt get them home in time
hello
good morning sleep well
not really what are you doing here
i just thought id stop by and ask you why you didnt meet me for breakfast
breakfast what time is it
seven forty
and we were supposed to meet at oh seven hundred
i was there right after i got off the night shift i waited and i waited and i called you on the comm
i er i didnt hear you i was having this wild nightmare i was out like a light im sorry ill get dressed right now
you dont have time youre due on the bridge at oh eight hundred and ive got to get some sleep
i hate this we never see each other
im off friday night
great lets go skiing how about saint moritz
we went skiing last time
and you loved it youre getting really good you know
i just thought maybe we could run a programme where the wind chill factor wasnt thirty below zero like fiji or samoa
theres nothing to do there
and you can be warm while youre not doing it
how about a compromise er spring skiing in chile much warmer
a compromise how about tahiti
tahiti as long as i can go waterskiing fine
youre on  now go get dressed so youll still have some time to stop for some coffee
ill see you friday night
morning tom whatll it be scrambled sunny side up over easy
just a cup of coffee
are you sure breakfast is the most important meal of the day you know
neelix
right
neelix did you have a rough night or something
why do you ask
because you just poured me a steaming cup of cooking oil
actually i did have a little trouble sleeping last night nightmares
oh me too
must have been those three full moons we passed yesterday well a few sips of my coffee should clear the fuzz out of your brain
maybe you should pour yourself a cup while youre at it
we seem to be a little shorthanded today
tom and harry are both late i was going to give them another five minutes but ill call them now if youd like
thats all right im a little late myself arent i
i wasnt going to mention it burning the midnight oil
actually i went to bed early for a change but i had a nightmare and i could not get back to sleep
i had a bad dream last night too
you tell me yours and ill tell you mine
sorry im late captain
well
i was in the forest with my father we were hunting deer which was odd because that was something i always refused to do we cornered the animal i looked to my father to see if he was going to kill it but he wasnt my father anymore he was a vicious looking alien
there was an alien in my dream too and it wasnt from any race ive seen before he had sharp ridges on his forehead and on the front of his neck
thats what mine looked like
i dont mean to be eavesdropping but i had a nightmare last night too and im pretty sure i saw the same guy
tuvok by any chance did you have a bad dream last night
i did have a somewhat unsettling dream yes it involved a alien with ridges on his face and neck
id say this sounds like more than a coincidence lets get the rest of the senior staff together and come up with some answers which reminds me wheres harry
bridge to ensign kim
computer locate ensign kim
ensign kim is in his quarters
tuvok
deck six ive got a hunch harrys dreaming about our new alien friend
that would be consistent with the experience the rest of us have had
tell me more about your dream where exactly did you see the alien
as a matter of fact it was here in the turbolift
what happened
the alien simply stared at me as if scrutinising my appearance
thats what happened in my dream what did you do
i returned to my quarters
did the alien follow you
he did
and then
he watched me
doing what
getting dressed
getting dressed
yes
i dont suppose i should ask why you were undressed
i would prefer that you didnt
harry harry
computer open door one zero five dash two security clearance tuvok zeta nine
harry harry wake up
are they comatose
not exactly they all appear to be in a hyper rem state ive tried every conventional method of waking them from drugs to direct cortical stimulation but nothing works
do you have any idea whats causing this
scans havent detected any viral or bacterial agents no cranial trauma no neural disorders theyre simply asleep
id say its a pretty good bet that this is somehow related to the alien from our dreams
any progress in identifying him
not yet but ive got everyone working on it in the meantime whats your recommendation
large doses of animazine
i thought you said drugs werent working
not for them for everybody else until i can determine whats happening id suggest the rest of you avoid going to sleep
id say his ridges were a little more pronounced
computer increase facial ridge height by four centimetres
thats closer
i think his eyes were wider apart
computer increase the space between the eyes by three centimetres increase skin colour and texture
thats him
has anybody seen this species before while you were awake i mean seven
he doesnt resemble any species assimilated by the borg
so is he just a figment of our imagination
if he is weve all been imagining the exact same thing
one possible explanation is that hes attempting to make telepathic contact
hes doing more than making contact weve got six crewmembers who cant wake up for all we know its some sort of attack
from where astrometric scans havent revealed any ships in this vicinity or planets capable of sustaining humanoid life
so where do we look
in our dreams thats the only place any of us have seen him right so if we want to communicate with him find out what he wants well have to do it on his terms
how do you propose we do that
lucid dreaming
whats that
its a technique which allows you to take control of your dream
that happened to me once i dreamt i was falling and suddenly i realised that i was dreaming and i could fly land do whatever i wanted i was in complete control of the dream
what happened to you by accident is something some people can do by design ive been able to have a lucid dream by using the same technology i use for a vision quest i may be able to use it to communicate with this alien
maybe so but how do we know youd be able to wake up again
its kind of like selfhypnosis before i go to sleep i choose a visual cue something to let me know im dreaming earths moon say once i see it i can wake myself by tapping the back of my hand three times
perhaps you are capable of doing this under normal circumstances but these were hardly conventional dreams we experienced
i dont see any other way of finding out what our friend here is after or how we can wake up harry and the others besides we cant stay awake forever
youll do this in sickbay under the doctors supervision the rest of you keep scanning the region analyse this ship from stem to stern wherever he is find him
normally i consider a good nights sleep an important part of any health regimen but in this case i cant recommend it
i respect your medical opinion doctor but at this point were out of options
this will regulate your hypothalamus but in all probability i wont be able to wake you youll be on your own
i understand
ready pleasant dreams
ahkoocheemoya far from the sacred places of my grandfathers far from the bones of my people i seek to sleep to meet the one who has visited us in our dreams
i know this is a dream my dream im in control
youre mistaken
am i
this is more than a dream its my reality and youre no different than the others
the others
the waking species for centuries youve come and found us in a state that you call sleep and tried to destroy us but not anymore now we are in control one by one you will fall asleep and enter our reality where it is you who will be destroyed
we didnt attack you we didnt even know you existed until we started seeing you in our dreams tell me how i can wake my crew and i promise well leave
as long as youre asleep youre no threat to us
i can wake myself anytime i want and if i do im going to start looking for you in the waking world find where youre sleeping you wouldnt want that
leave our space once youre beyond it your people will awaken
just tell me how far we need to go
theres a six planet system less than a parsec away it marks the nearest border of our space
we can be past it in one day
then wake yourself and pray you never dream of us again
congratulations commander youre awake
chakotay
im fine
the alien did you see him and
well it was certainly one of the most interesting away missions ive ever been on ill tell you about it on the way to the bridge
tuvok scan for a six planet system it should be less than a parsec from here
i have it captain at coordinates one three nine mark four two
tom lay in a course
aye captain course laid it do you mind if i ask where were heading
past the aliens territory once were clear of it harry and the others should wake up
and the rest of us can finally get some sleep
one step at a time tom
from what the alien told me it sounds like they have corporeal form but they communicate through their dreams for them its as real as the waking world
extraordinary
it reminds me of the australian aborigines they believed the dream world was no more or less real than the waking world in fact their creation mythology says their ancestors actually dreamed the universe into existence
thats mythology this seems to be fact
i wonder do they ever wake up how did they evolve this way
we may never know sometimes first contact is last contact
were approaching the border of the aliens space
commander tuvok inform the doctor
aye captain
wake up ensign
whats going on
you were napping
in sickbay
we had to move you here when we couldnt wake you
how long
seventeen hours i take it you experienced nightmares like the rest of the crew
oh i had nightmares all right
tell me about them
well i was in the corridor
captain janeway asked me to bring you the results of our astrometric scans she thought they might be helpful in determining the precise cause of the crews somnolence
thank you
ensign kim now that youre awake i require your assistance in jefferies tube twenty one beta is something wrong
no i er im still feeling a little groggy
then ill wait until you are fully recovered
now then ensign you were telling me about your nightmare
you know what doc im famished havent eaten in at least seventeen hours right
very well go eat get some clothes on and report back in an hour
ill see you later you too seven
and the next thing i knew i was being boiled alive in a pot of my own leola root stew
talk about a nightmare
it was perfectly seasoned
well if it isnt sleeping beauty
i do look wellrested dont i
is everyone awake now
the doc checked us all out he says were fine
have a seat we were just trading dream stories
tell us yours
oh it was nothing very interesting just the usual you know
who was she harry
the woman of my dreams what id like to know is what tuvok dreamt about
yes commander tell us what do vulcans dream
arent you supposed to have horrible nightmares
i wonder what a vulcan nightmare would be like
alone exiled on a planet where the only form of communication is laughter
oh come on tuvok
i wont dignify this inquisition with a response
red alert all hands to battle stations
theyre coming around for another pass
auxiliary power to the shields return fire
no damage to the alien ship our phasers cant penetrate their shields
arm photon torpedoes we seem to have a knack for provoking strangers these days
shields are offline
fire
ive lost power to the torpedo launchers
whats happening
powers being drained from all systems
were being hailed
on screen
captain ensign kim commander chakotay im glad to see you all up and about
janeway to engineering we need auxiliary power to the engines now
i think youll find that impossible
belanna report
theres a localised
dampening field around the ship captain
i cant give you engines weapons shields
everything you told me was a lie this was all an elaborate trap to get voyager here
it appears youre learning more about my people after all prepare to surrender your ship
captain three more alien vessels are approaching they are powering weapons
youve gone to so much trouble to commandeer this ship i dont think youre going to destroy it
i wont need to
janeway to the crew were under attack implement defence procedure omega
its no use weve taken every deck the ship is ours
captain
all the time i thought i was negotiating they were just setting us up to fly right into their web
you couldnt have known it was a trick
i dont understand they exist in dreams and reality
apparently entering our dreams was their way to learn about us perhaps to probe our weaknesses
not to mention lure us into an ambush
we need to retake the ship
that means getting out of this cargo bay
i checked the jefferies tubes theyresealed
maybe we can open them manually
thats not going to be easy theyve got people everywhere
well have to create a diversion
any ideas
i have one captain
what the hell are you doing
creating a diversion  ensign kim it is your fault we have been captured
i suggest you fight back
tom try to get into a jefferies tube you two work on the power grid ill deal with this
stop stop
whats going on here these are my people ill handle them ensign thats enough move
whats wrong
im still asleep
what are you talking about
chakotay
commander chakotay youre awake
am i are you sure
of course you are
what are you looking for
the moon
what
i dont see it
wheres the captain
asleep along with the rest of the crew
all of them
except me no rest for the never weary
what happened
as soon as you entered your lucid dream they all began falling asleep one by one ive been trying every method i can think of to revive them but nothing works its been thirty nine hours
ive been asleep for almost two days
if i cant wake them soon im going to have to start feeding them intravenously
they let me think i was awake but i was still dreaming
you werent the only one look at this
what is it
a neurogenic field created by heightened electrical activity in the brain its been occurring in all the sleeping crew members and thats not all this is ensign kims brain wave pattern indicating that hes dreaming in a hyper rem state this is crewman fosters pattern
theyre identical
lieutenant torres captain janeway commander tuvok i dont know what it means
i think i do not only are they dreaming theyre all having the same dream it wasnt just my dream it was a communal dream
everyones rem patterns are identical theyre experiencing the same images each from his or her own point of view
yes i saw the rest of the crew interacted with them we were all working together to fight off an alien attack
which wasnt real
oh were under attack all right
commander
maybe this is the way these aliens fight their enemies they exist somewhere in our reality as physical beings but they must be asleep unable to defend themselves against what they call waking species well never defeat them in their dream reality but if we can find them find where theyre sleeping well have the advantage
but weve been scanning for lifeforms since this started and we havent found anything
maybe weve been looking in the wrong place im betting a species that spends its time sleeping isnt going to be hanging around where conventional scans can locate them
so how do we find them
this neurogenic field you mentioned anyone in a hyper rem state would be producing one
in theory yes so if we scan for other neurogenic fields it might lead us to the sleeping aliens
if you need me ill be on the bridge
time for a little energy boost commander we dont want you drifting back to sleep sorry about the mess but this is what happens when my repeated requests for a larger sickbay fall on deaf ears what is it
scanners have detected a neurogenic field emanating from beneath the surface of a planet less than a light year from here excuse me tom but ive got to change our course
still dreaming how is that possible
i dont know but thats what chakotay said right before he vanished
that doesnt make any sense he was wide awake right here with us
he said something about still being asleep and then he started tapping the back of his hand like he said he would to wake up from his lucid dream and then he disappeared the question is where did he go
the aliens must have transported him somewhere
or perhaps he did wake up
tuvok
its possible he was dreaming all of this
wait a minute if chakotay was dreaming and he woke up what are we doing here
perhaps were dreaming as well
now im lost
youre not the only one
consider then that we all experienced nightmares about an alien whose people apparently live out their lives in a dream state perhaps were in that state at this very moment
thats ridiculous were not asleep
wait
when you dream youre rarely aware that youre sleeping
i can understand how we can mistake dreaming for reality but that doesnt explain how were all interacting with one another
maybe were not
not what
interacting with one another maybe this is all one persons dream for example mine and none of you are really here
trust me neelix i wish i werent but im here
collective unconsciousness
seven come here
the borg share a collective consciousness these aliens may have somehow inducted a state of collective unconsciousness
you mean were all sharing the same dream
it is possible
this is all fascinating speculation but unless we have proof to the contrary we have to treat this like an invasion
i managed to open a jefferies tube hatch
good work neelix seven kim do what you can to distract the guards were going to find a way to retake the ship
looks like a complete power drain
their dampening field has shut down the warp core
which begs the question of what they intend to do with an unpowered ship
tuvok grab some phaser rifles from the weapons locker something tells me that when we try to disable the dampening field were going to get the aliens attention
it looks like theyre using harmonic inversion technology if i can isolate the containment frequency i may be able to get main power back online
that was easy
warning warp core breach in sixty seconds
maybe a little too easy
i dont understand
can you eject the core
im trying its not working
warp core breach in fifty seconds
weve got to get out of here im trying to put a containment field around engineering
warp core breach in forty seconds
got it lets move
i dont understand why you couldnt eject the core
warp core breach in thirty seconds
somethings not right
captain we must hurry
im going back in there
youll be killed
i think im on to something you two go
captain
thats an order
warp core breach in ten seconds nine eight seven
six five four three two one
either ive become impervious to antimatter explosions or were still dreaming
a warp core explosion should have destroyed the ship
if i were awake or if any of this were real which it obviously isnt things just werent adding up chakotays disappearance the warp core failing to eject and as chakotay said lucid dreaming is about taking control so i took a chance
surely there must have been a less extreme method of testing your assumptions as captain you shouldnt be taking chances with your life
im touched by your concern tuvok
now that we know this is a dream what do we do
i suggest we find a way to regain consciousness
captain how did you wake yourself
the same way you did
the others
they should all be starting to wake up
rise and shine mister paris
we need to get as far away from that planet as possible
agreed
ill make the necessary course correction
what is it
this isnt real
of course it is
see
no
doctor
hes paranoid disoriented i suspect much of the crew will suffer similar symptoms when they awake try to relax commander im going to sedate you
no i need to wake not sleep
im here to help you
no
its all right commander youre awake again
what happened
you dozed off
i couldnt wake myself like i did before
our proximity to the neurogenic field is making it more difficult to stay conscious
i need to get down there and find a way to neutralise it
not so fast this is a highly potent animazine derivative if you feel yourself falling asleep again you must use it and commander i suggest we keep an open comm line i may need to provide you with a verbal splash of cold water every now and then
its not working
its safe to assume that chakotay and the doctor are making every effort to wake us from our sleep
we have to let the rest of the crew know whats happening that as long as they know theyre in a dream they cant be harmed
and if the aliens try to stop us
then we turn this dream world of theirs into a nightmare
okay doctor im in
acknowledged commander
stand aside
your weapons are useless against us
youre not fooling anyone we know this is a dream
youre confused
actually im finally seeing things clearly
shoot them
now stand aside
all of you listen closely what we have to do is stay in control of the dream if we can do that the aliens shouldnt be able to hurt us
you sound very sure of yourself captain
why shouldnt i be
have you thought about whats happening to your bodies in the waking world how long do you think theyll survive without nourishment without physical activity your bodies are withering away as we speak you cant stop it
dont be so sure
its some kind of transmitter it looks like they use it to amplify the
neurogenic field
can you turn it off
i tried knocking it out with my phaser but theres some kind of forcefield
commander
sorry im having trouble concentrating
time for your medicine
doctor this animazine its pretty powerful
yes and i suggest you take it immediately
these aliens they look pretty frail
thats fascinating commander now please inject yourself
they probably wouldnt have the same tolerance for stimulants that we do
what are you getting at
the animazine might be capable of waking up one of these aliens
commander id be happy to discuss comparative pharmacology with you after you administer your injection
actually i think im going to give it to one of my sleepy friends here
what would that accomplish
if i can wake him up
i might be able to get him to deactivate this generator
theres not enough
animazine for two doses if you fall asleep again theres no way i can revive you
doctor i want you to go to the bridge
commander
im giving you an order
go to the bridge and target my comm signal with a photon torpedo
youre delirious youre asking me to incinerate you
not just me these aliens and their transmitter too but only if you dont hear from me
in five minutes understood
commander
understood
aye sir
tell me how to deactivate this transmitter or i start shooting
what happened
looks like he woke up
ill give you five seconds four three two
chakotay
whos going to help you now captain
i found the cavern and your people im there right now in the waking world and its all going to be destroyed in less than two minutes unless you deactivate that transmitter
if you are there youll be killed too i think youre lying
oh believe me if i dont contact my ship you and i are both going to die in our sleep
computer lights on
sorry commander i didnt mean to frighten you
youre not starting breakfast this early are you
just rearranging the supply cabinets i couldnt sleep
neither could i
how about a soothing cup of tea
sounds good
i know its silly but every time im about to doze off im terrified that i wont be able to wake again
you too
we just finished a little late night hoverball on the holodeck
three games in a row we were hoping it would wear us out
you know i could learn to enjoy these late night gettogethers
speak for yourself i would kill for a good nights sleep
neelix i think its time for breakfast
cold patronising arrogant
i know she can be difficult
difficult shes impossible
im getting tired of playing referee every time you two have a disagreement if you have a problem talk to her yourself
does the word irrelevant mean anything to you she wont listen she may look human and she may sound human but shes all borg
part of the problem is your attitude youve never tried to accept seven as part of the crew
and with good reason guess what she did this morning she took an isolinear processor out of engineering without asking and when i went to astrometrics to get it back she had locked the door like that lab is her own private domain
what do you want me to do throw her in the brig for the rest of the trip home
ive heard worse ideas
seven of nine to chakotay
chakotay here
report to the astrometrics lab at once
on my way
did you hear that shes giving orders now im telling you chakotay if she gets in my way again i am not responsible for what happens
youre a senior officer on this ship act like one find a way to deal with her
astrometrics
ive been summoned any guesses what this is about
none
your call sounded urgent
it was ive been working to increase the range of the astrometric sensors and i have detected something that you should find of particular interest
a ship whats special about it
ive analysed the warp signature its a starfleet vessel the ship were seeing is in the alpha quadrant
you couldnt have extended the astrometric sensors that far
no but i increased the range far enough to detect a large network of relay stations theyre alien in origin abandoned but still functioning by establishing a sensor link with the nearest station im getting readings from the entire network the starfleet ship is within range of one of the farthest sensors near the outer edges of the alpha quadrant
it must be on a deep space mission
ive extrapolated its course
it doesnt look like well be able to keep track of it very long
the ship should move out of range in forty one minutes
can we use the network to transmit a message
yes but well have to remodulate our signal to match the networks interlink frequency
we dont have much time get it done chakotay
seven of nine to ensign kim
kim here
im sending you the interlink frequencies
got it
seven how much longer do we have
sixteen minutes
that should do it the subspace transceiver is at two hundred percent output and online were ready
open a channel
open
starfleet vessel this is captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager we are in the delta quadrant at coordinates one eight mark two oh five mark four seven remodulate your signal to match our interlink frequency
were receiving a transmission
lets hear it
starship voyager were in the
bridge to seven what went wrong
i dont understand my readings show that the station picked up our message and relayed it across the entire network
we should try widening the subspace bandwidth and sending the message again
do it
transmitting
the signal is being relayed no sign of interference
wait its being deflected back again
this is captain kathryn janeway starship voyager the delta quadrant
i have a possible explanation captain
as our carrier wave moves along the network it may be degrading
can we try a different kind of signal something stronger
a holographic datastream might work it wouldnt degrade so quickly
it would take too long to reconfigure the message unless
the doctor
exactly
bring him to astrometrics and ill meet you there we dont have much time
doctor you have to come with me quickly
would you mind at least telling me what all this is about
when i requested more away missions this isnt exactly what i had in mind
you may be our only chance to communicate with that ship
when you get there youll be downloaded into their emh system im sending an initiation code along with your programme so youll be activated immediately
we have less than ninety seconds before that ship moves out of range
how am i supposed to get back here
when youve completed your mission instruct them to move within range of the sensor network with any luck they can send you back the same way you came
luck
i wont lie to you doctor a lot of things could go wrong were relying on an alien technology to send you across thousands of light years
so theres a chance my programme could be lost
yes im asking you to take that chance
thirty five seconds
doctor
far be it from me to turn down an opportunity to become a hero im ready
torres to bridge
standing by
im downloading him into the transceiver array
ten seconds
good luck doctor
theres that word again
hello is anyone here computer identify this ship
this is the federation starship prometheus
are we in the alpha quadrant
affirmative
ah sickbay to bridge
all right this is sickbay calling any crew member please respond computer is the comm system malfunctioning
negative
then why cant i reach anyone
access to the communications system has been restricted
restricted but this is important isnt there some sort of emergency comm channel available
try to lie still you have severe phaser burns what happened here
romulans theyve taken over the ship
commander theres a vessel approaching on an intercept course its starfleet
i told you to mask our warp trail
ive been trying these new systems are unfamiliar we should have left some of the crew alive
youd be surprised how stubborn humans can be
the starfleet ship is closing
raise shields and prepare to fire phasers
computer how may romulans are on board
twenty seven
are there any starfleet crewmembers
none alive
computer display the design schematic of this ship and list general specifications
uss prometheus experimental prototype designed for deep space tactical assignments primary battle systems include regenerative shielding ablative hull armour multivector assault mode
multivector assault mode describe
access to tactical data requires level four clearance
what can you show me at my clearance level
shields are holding
engage the multivector assault mode
that system has never been tested
then well test it now i gave you an order and i expect you to follow it multivector assault mode now
yes commander
initiating decoupling sequence
autoseparation in ten seconds nine eight seven six
computer whats happening computer
five four three
two one separation sequence in progress
were in attack formation each section is armed and responding to our command
attack pattern beta four seven
specify target
the starfleet vessel bearing one six two mark seven
pattern and target confirmed
i think we should consider that a successful test begin the reintegration sequence then get me a full damage report
yes commander
hes hurt
take him to the medical bay
reintegration sequence complete
computer is there any way for me to gain access to the communication system to send a message to another ship
negative communications access requires level four clearance or above
please state the nature of the medical emergency
who activated you
you did automatically when you entered sickbay
can you treat him
of course thats my function third degree burns hairline jaw fracture and a ruptured blood vessel in his brain ill have to operate
youre a starfleet programme why should i trust you
im a doctor whether my patient is human or romulan ill do everything in my power to save him youre welcome to assist me if you like or maybe youd just prefer to supervise
report to me when youre finished
mmm hmm
computer can i access this ships emh programme or do i need some kind of clearance for that too
access to that programme is unrestricted
activate it
please state the nature of the medical emergency what the hell are you doing in my sickbay ive been programmed to identify every member of this crew you arent one of them
thats because im
state your rank and security clearance
i dont have clearance im an emergency medical hologram ive been sent here to
oh yes yes yes yes youre the mark one emh the inferior programme
inferior
beady eyes terrible bedside manner i recognise you but youre not part of this database what are you doing here
if youd disengage your vocal subroutines for one second id explain i was transmitted onto this ship by a starfleet vessel over sixty thousand light years from here
sixty thousand light years we dont have ships that far out
its the starship voyager we were taken into the delta quadrant four years ago by an alien force what are you doing
activating intruder alert
thats the last thing you want to do
security
listen to me this vessel has been taken over by romulans the crew is dead you and i are the only starfleet officers on board do you understand
i understand
computer deactivate emh
computer activate emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency now what
i need your help
starfleet security protocol twenty eight subsection d in the event of hostile alien takeover the emh is to deactivate and wait for rescue
im afraid you dont have that luxury there are two ships at stake here yours and mine now i need to know more about whats happening is the federation at war with the romulans
no the romulans havent gotten involved in our fight with the dominion
the who
long story
in any case we need to take control of this situation
im a doctor not a commando
its time you became a little of both
you dont understand the prometheus is an experimental prototype and so am i i i i havent even been field tested yet im not designed for this kind of duty
try to calm down youll do fine as long as im here i have plenty of expertise in this area now first things first weve got a patient you treat his burns ill repair the bone fracture
youre not serious
i certainly am
hes the enemy
he needs our help i assume youre familiar with the hippocratic oath
you see you see whats happening the romulans are using you
hmm
hmm what
your holomatrix is unstable it may explain your erratic behaviour
i told you im a work in progress i was only installed six weeks ago
stable or not i need you and so does he
hell live i say we leave him and deactivate ourselves
no youre free to do as you please go cower inside the data processor if youd like ill work alone
were medical holograms what can we expect to do against a ship full of romulans
im not sure not yet but ive faced my share of challenges alien invasions macroviral infestations ive crossed borg space travelled through time
have you run a selfdiagnostic lately the emh mark one is designed to function in sickbay only
voyager lost its chief medical officer four years ago ive been active ever since
four years no wonder youre delusional your programmes degrading after being active for so long
i assure you i am in perfect health i was saving voyager from annihilation when you were only a gleam in your programmers eye now are you going to help me take back this ship or not
get me the thrombic modulator
its the cone shaped device hand it to me please medical science has made a few advances while youve been off in the delta quadrant did you say
thats right
we dont use scalpels or leeches anymore i suggest you let me handle the medical side of things as for retaking the ship ill leave that in your experienced hands
no word our link to the sensor net is stable seven of nine is standing watch in astrometrics i tried to relieve her but she doesnt want to leave her post she says she doesnt need to regenerate for the next few days what are you doing
letters home i started them a year ago one to my family one to mark im making a few updates just in case i know its premature
youre right its probably a mistake for us to get our hopes up at all weve been through this before all right ill admit it i just finished a letter to my cousin in ohio
the doctor is in
lieutenant thank god youre here
what seems to be the trouble
well one minute they were eating lunch and the next they started perspiring and complaining of chest pain
hmm no wonder acute functional dyspepsia
whats that
heartburn
oh im terribly sorry i dont know how this could have happened
ill replicate some antacid
well have you feeling better in no time
theyre going to be all right arent they
its heartburn neelix not the terrillian plague what did you feed them anyway
rodeo reds red hot rootin tootin chili
where did you find that recipe
ive been brushing up on classic american cuisine when we get back to earth i want to make sure i have marketable job skills
dont you think youre jumping the gun a little bit
the doctor is going to make it back and hes going to bring a plan for starfleet to rescue us i have complete confidence in him
i hope youre right if not im going to spend the rest of this trip treating upset stomachs
oh believe me this is never going to happen again its just a matter of perfecting the recipe next time ill use a few less jalapenos
ive accessed the navigational logs were at warp nine point nine heading straight for romulan space
this vessel was designed to go faster than anything in the fleet so well never be rescued
weve got to find a way to turn this ship around
how waltz on to the bridge and take over the helm
refresh my memory which of us has the terrible bedside manner
youre not my patient
my first bit of good news we have to incapacitate the romulans somehow what kind of anaesthetics do you have handy
only the best axonol neurozine anaesthazine
neurozine will do nicely it can be distributed in gaseous form show me a schematic of the ships ventilation system please
all primary systems have been rerouted to the bridge including environmental control
it looks like there are holoemitters on every deck
there are unlike you im not condemned to a sickbay
get three canisters of neurozine as a matter of record i have free reign on voyager and i can even leave the ship as well
leave your ship how
my mobile emitter a little piece of twenty ninth century technology we obtained
really
im as close to a sentient life form as any hologram could hope to be i socialise with the crew fraternise with aliens ive even had sexual relations
sex hows that possible were not equipped
lets just say i made an addition to my programme
before you leave maybe you could download those subroutines into my database
well see it looks like the only place i can access environmental control is from the ops console on the bridge
the bridge is swarming with romulans
thats the first thing you learn in the real world think on your feet
well good luck then computer deactivate
not so fast youre going to jefferies tube seventeen the moment i unlock the controls you release the gas into the ventilation system
jefferies tube seventeen thats five decks up what if i run into romulans
improvise your journey begins here
traditionally one crawls in headfirst
thanks
there you are doctor have you completed the surgery
yes your friend is recovering nicely however i found something disturbing in his blood work it seems that hes been exposed to a nasty strain of the torothka virus and if he was you may all have been ive come to run some scans
no one here is sick
not yet i understand the stomach cramps are unbearable although some say the rash is worse
conduct your scans how far are we from our border
at our present velocity forty minutes
alter our heading to one one eight mark two six
that will take us off our course to romulus
theres been a change of plans were giving this ship to someone wholl make full use of its potential the talshiar ive made arrangements to rendezvous with their fleet within the hour
but commander theyre expecting us to be
you have your orders what are you doing
im checking the biofilters for evidence of the virus
you havent taken any readings at all
hmm
next time order the chicken salad
oh am i glad to see you
whats the emergency
take a look around you harry what do you see
sickbay
exactly
so
so its not the helm of a starship is it
did you accidentally inject yourself with some kind of psychotropic agent
i am a pilot harry not a doctor
this is a temporary assignment just till the doc gets back
what if he doesnt get back
hell be back
i need your help harry rescue me from medical exile
how
youre an expert in holotechnology you have got to design a new doctor
you really are delirious it took the greatest holoengineers in starfleet years to develop the emh i cant just design a new doctor
think of it as a challenge harry a chance to make history and save your best friend all at the same time
lieutenant torres you are recalibrating the relay interface
thats right
state your reasons for making these modifications
state your reasons please its not what you say seven its how you say it
i dont understand
you may have noticed that some of the crew seem a bit on edge when youre around
i was borg i elicit apprehension
no thats not what i mean were not afraid that youre going to assimilate us were just not used to you just youre rude
i am rude
yes yes you order people around you do things without permission and whether you realise it or not you come off as a little insulting you dont even say please or thank you look i dont expect you to change overnight but try to remember that we are not just a bunch of drones
your attempt to recalibrate the interface is illadvised the risk of disrupting our link is too great
in your opinion that is exactly what im talking about you havent even been listening to me i dont know why i try to talk to you if you dont even are we losing the link
no were receiving a transmission from the relay station
the doctor
what are you
im lieutenant torres of the starship voyager
you are using our technology
you mean the sensor network we thought that it was abandoned
it belongs to the hirogen terminate your link
no no wait please we just
the link has been severed
what else have you done to this ship i will deactivate you unless you start answering my questions
if i answer them youll very likely deactivate me anyway so i fail to see the point
you are nothing but a computer generated projection i find it hard to believe youre capable of taking these actions independently
how flattering
tell me who is operating your programme is it someone on this ship a starfleet crew member we missed or one of my own men
paranoia is a way of life for you isnt it
the computer log shows the ship received an optronic datastream transmission approximately six hours ago it contained a holographic subroutine
who sent it
unknown the data pattern had a starfleet signature
so starfleet has managed to sneak a holographic operative aboard very clever
were you only sent to spy on us or does your mission include sabotage
the datastream you detected came from an alien sensor network it transferred me from a starfleet ship in the delta quadrant
the delta quadrant thats absurd
this is pointless
i couldnt agree more
maybe theres a better way to retrieve information from a hologram i suggest a complete algorithm extraction we can analyse his subroutines one by one
proceed
isnt there some kind of convention regarding the treatment of prisoners
did it work  sorry to interrupt
did you anaesthetise the entire ship
i did i did
how did you manage to release the neurozine i never opened the ventilation system
trapped in the jefferies tube alone nowhere to run his smug comrade captured by romulans emh mark two had to improvise inspiration he accessed the main computer and simulated a ship wide biohazard making the computer think there was a microbiotic contamination on all decks
and the ventilation system opened automatically
presto he then crawled back out of the tube accessed the holoemitters transferred here excused the romulan saw the dumbfounded look on his comrades face
the end you know you really should keep a personal log why bore others needlessly we have to get to the bridge this ship needs a crew and were it
oh trouble the prometheus is a prototype top secret only four people in all of starfleet trained to operate it i hope your myriad adventures included piloting lessons
because theres nothing in my programme that will help us fly this thing
ive had my share of piloting experience actually only two lessons and they were in a shuttlecraft on the holodeck but i showed great intuition wheres the helm
youd better intuit it fast were only about eight minutes from the romulan border
ah there it is
this is all very complicated
stop breathing down my neck
my breathing is merely a simulation
so is my neck stop it anyway
is this a thruster control
dont touch that we dont know what it does it could be the selfdestruct
you look worried
im just concentrating
you dont know what youre doing do you this is not a shuttle and we are not on a holodeck
shush
mister i can leave my ship the voice of experience
let me think ah here it is this looks like the nacelle power control
so so
theres a little trick i saw mister paris do once if i can generate a slight overload to the nacelle coils itll collapse the warp field
what happened
i did it weve stopped ah all we have to do now is find a way to send starfleet a distress signal and
beep beep beep beep beep beep ive never heard that one before
oh no
what
im not sure but i think whatever i did initiated a warp core overload
you mean the ships going to explode youve got to stop it
no problem
what now
unless im mistaken and for once i sincerely hope i am there are three romulan warbirds on an intercept course
were boosting the signal gain as high as itll go i think we can cut through the aliens jamming signal
i warned you
i apologise for our intrusion allow me to explain
no explanations
your relay network gave us the unique opportunity to communicate with our people they are very far away and were expecting a message back from them
all messages will be intercepted
hes trying to jam the link again
there must be some room for negotiation isnt there anything you might accept in exchange for
what happened
i generated a feedback surge along our sensor link
you killed him
it was a mild shock he will recover
and when he does
he wasnt responding to diplomacy
is the sensor link stable
yes captain
keep watching for the doctor let me know if our friend gives us any more trouble
mild shock not bad
thank you
there ive finished inputting the doctors physical characteristics
lets have a look
computer activate the emergency medical hologram replacement programme
do you think we should give him a little more hair
what do you say we try to get him working firstthen we can worry about personal grooming
right youre the boss what do we do next
ive downloaded the ships entire medical library and compressed it into a single data file its got all the classics from grays anatomy to leonard mccoys comparative alien physiology
and once we transfer all the data into stonefaces matrix well have ourselves a brand new medical expert
thats what im hoping
harry you are a genius
dont congratulate me yet this is only the first step
yeah but its a step in the right direction
im telling you this probably isnt going to work
what happened to all that youthful optimism
being a doctor is a lot more than knowing facts we still have to create analytical subroutines to help him diagnose patients tactile protocols so he can perform surgery not to mention a personality profile
oh you know ive been thinking about that maybe we should make this one a little more pleasant than the old doc
all right ready to transfer the data computer transfer medical library master file to emergency medical replacement hologram
transfer complete
chapter one the animal cell all the tissues of the body originate from a microscopic structure the fertilised ovum which consists of a soft jellylike material enclosed in a membrane and containing a ves
whats he doing
i think hes reciting grays anatomy
this may be regarded as a complete cell
can you stop him
im trying
similar to it in nature but differing in external form paragraph
listen this is all very fascinating
in a higher organism a cell is
but would you please be quiet for a minute
he doesnt have speech recognition protocols yet
well give him some would you
material similar to that in the ovum and usually called cytoplasm and a small spherical
whats happening
its an overload his matrix cant accommodate all the data
contain no nuclei
what are you doing
im downloading grays anatomy chapter by chapter
i thought you said it was too much data for his holomatrix to handle
its not for the emh its for you
the romulan vessels are closing in two minutes to intercept get us our of here
i cant get this ship moving try rerouting power to the impulse engines
reroute power reroute power here we go i think ive found the relay controls hey im finally getting the hang of this
whats happening
sorry i must have transferred power from the holoemitters
well be more careful if im deactivated this shipll never get back to starfleet
okay im taking power from life support we dont need that try the engines now
nothing why isnt this working
thirty seconds to intercept theyre right on top of us
hold it i see the problem the thrust initiator is offline stand by
fifteen seconds theyre charging weapons
see if you can access the shields
i said i said shields
already done shields up
this is the warbird tmet calling the prometheus commander rekar respond commander
this is the prometheus
activate your viewscreen
our viewscreen is not operational weve had some trouble with starfleet commandos
wheres rekar
in the medical bay hes suffered minor injuries
identify yourself
you first
you first
repeat your last statement i dont understand
state your identity
this is subcommander almak lower your shields and prepare to be boarded
theyre already down maybe theres something wrong with your sensor readings youd better not try to transport until we can be sure its safe
lower your shields immediately or ill open fire
immediately yes prometheus out
direct hit shields down to twenty percent
three more ships are approaching
were doomed
no theyre starfleet
what are they doing
firing on us
they must think romulans are on board
theyre right
prometheus to any starfleet vessel respond prometheus
its no use they cant hear us the romulans have scrambled the comm frequencies
doctor something just went offline
specifically
the secondary gyrodyne relays and the propulsion field intermatrix have depolarised
in english
ill try to stabilise the ship transfer auxiliary power to the manoeuvring thrusters
transferring auxiliary power now
good work mark two
thanks
youd better get to tactical were going to have to defend ourselves
tactical right
what are you waiting for shoot shoot
there are so many controls
find the one that says fire and push it
its not working it says here the phasers are offline
well then fire a torpedo
you hit the wrong ship
it wasnt my fault
whose fault was it the torpedos youre supposed to tell it what to do
navigational control is offline
everythings offline weapons shields
it gets worse there are two warbirds coming right at us
my brilliant existence cut short no time to explore the universe no time to smell the roses no time for sex
initiating decoupling sequence
whats that what have i done now
autoseparation in ten seconds
autoseparation i think the romulans did this before
how do we turn it off
i dont think we can
five four three two
if i recall correctly this next part gets a little bumpy
separation sequence in progress
hold on
specify attack pattern
attack pattern alpha
specify target
romulans
romulans
bullseye the warbirds are in retreat doctor weve done it two holograms alone romulans on one side starfleet on the other alarms beeping everywhere
emh mark two newborn but filled with courage
emh mark one armed with years of experience
together they emerged triumphant
the end  or not
welcome to the prometheus gentlemen its about time
im receiving a transmission through the sensor network origin the alpha quadrant
does it contain a holographic subroutine
yes
transfer it to sickbay torres to bridge captain i think hes back
doctor report
i i did it
you completed the mission
yes once the romulans were out of the way
romulans
theyd taken over the prometheushe ship i was on but i managed to turn the tables on them with help from a fellow emh
you got through to starfleet
i spoke directly with headquarters apparently voyager was declared officially lost fourteen months ago i set the record straight i told them everything thats happened to this crew they said they would contact your families to tell them the news and promised that they wont stop until theyve found a way to get voyager back home and they asked me to relay a message they wanted you to know youre no longer alone
sixty thousand light years seems a little closer today
uss voyager if you are receiving this message please study it carefully we have information
what happened
im not sure the transmission just stopped
locate the source see if you can get it back
it looks like captain the transmission was sent along the same network of alien relay stations we used to send the doctor to the alpha quadrant
starfleet command must be using them just like we did
harry can you clear the interference from that message
yes maam
they said they wouldnt stop until they found a way to get us home
nonetheless we cant assume theyve been able to devise a plan this quickly
theyre communicating with us thats a big step
okay ive reprocessed everything weve received ive cleared out most of the interference here it is
thats all we got it looks like the bulk of the transmission is lodged in one of the relay stations
can you tell which one
set a course tom
last time we used one of those stations the people who build it werent too happy
well deal with that if we have to but im not going to lose this opportunity were going to find out what the rest of that message says
who sent this message
unknown it comes from across the galaxy
locate the ship receiving it
its on a course to one of our modules
intercept
maybe theyve figured out a way to get us home
how can they get us home from sixty thousand light years away
who knows what technological advances starfleet has come up with since weve been gone they might have developed a whole new way of travelling through space
since it was technology that brought us to the delta quadrant in the first place its a reasonable assumption technology could bring us back again
starfleet found a stable wormhole to the gamma quadrant maybe theyve discovered one that leads here
this kind of speculation can be intriguing but be careful about setting yourselves up to be disappointed
im just happy my folks know im alive
i imagine there were quite a few celebrations when people got the news
probably but i can see where it might make things more difficult for some id guess a lot of people had given up on us done their mourning gone on with their lives found some kind of resolution now they get word that were alive but so far away that we might as well be dead
some people might feel that way but not my mom and dad
at the very least we know the relay stations extend almost all the way to the alpha quadrant if starfleet has found a way to use them to transmit messages well be able to stay in constant contact with people at home that has to be comforting
im sure it is but i think its more comforting to think that starfleet is going to get us home if no one objects thats what im going to do
you were supposed to report to sickbay this morning for your weekly checkup where have you been
here doing my job
and just what is this pressing task
im trying to retrieve more of the message transmitted from starfleet command
your devotion to duty is admirable but you must remember that your implants have to be monitored regularly
im fine
no youre not im detecting reduced levels of erythrocytes in your blood how long has it been since you regenerated
fifty eight hours
well that explains it weve discussed this before seven you must regenerate in your alcove for at least three hours a day
i have gone as long as two hundred hours without regenerating
that was when you were a borg you seem to forget youre a good deal more human now
i assure you i have not forgotten another one
i beg your pardon
i have retrieved another word of text that makes six
six words in fifty eight hours wouldnt it be more efficient just to wait until we arrive at the relay station
this message is important to the captain
im aware of that in fact if it werent for me this transmission wouldnt have been possible in the first place i was the one who risked my matrix in order to go to the alpha quadrant if we ever get home i expect ill become quite the hero emergency medical hologram instrumental in the return of voyager crew has a nice ring to it dont you think
on the other hand it is entirely possible that your programme will be deleted and youll be upgraded to conform to the most recent standards
unlikely ive accomplished things no emh ever has in fact most likely ill become an object of intense study and discussion possibly even veneration whats that
report
were encountering some kind of gravimetric forces
source
looks like its coming from the relay station were heading for
that station is still two light years away how could it project a gravimetric field this far
it would have to have an incredibly powerful energy source
ive compensated for the disturbance we should be all right at least until we get closer
im detecting a ship captain eight hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow
on screen
its adrift no propulsion systems no weapons no life support
im picking up one male humanoid aboard hes dead
as soon as were close enough beam the body to sickbay i want to know how he died
whats happened to him
he appears to have suffered a complete osteotomy hes been gutted apparently some kind of surgical procedure was used to remove the entire skeleton as well as the musculature the ligaments and tendons and the internal organs
how long ago did this happen
its difficult to say somewhere between a week and a month
ive seen this before the borg encountered a small ship of species five one seven four they were also destroyed in this fashion
did you ever determine who did it and why
no it was irrelevant
return the body to his ship his people may be able to retrieve him
very well
when we get closer to the station we can use the data processors in astrometrics to download the message
yes captain
not exactly what i expected it looks ancient
radiometric decay rations indicate its at least one hundred thousand years old
scan for lifeforms
negative sir looks like theres nobody home
oh thats good news
here we go again
the gravimetric field
commander if my sensors are right that station is using a quantum singularity as a power source
a black hole
its a tiny one probably about a centimetre in diameter but its putting out almost four terawatts of energy
that someones managed to contain a singularity and construct a space station around it and tap its power thats fascinating
can we take the ship any closer
i wouldnt recommend it voyager would take a beating from the gravimetric eddies
all right tom back us off
aye sir
bridge to janeway
go ahead
were as close as were going to be able to get
okay
well see if we can download the message from here
the datastream degraded during transmission elements have been dislocated rearranged its going to require some time to decompress the message and rearrange it in the proper sequence
dont worry about the sequence get it out in bits and pieces if you have to we can put it together later
ive accessed a block of data im downloading the text
how much we miss you we talk about you often wondering about your day sounds awfully personal from starfleet command the children have grown so much you wouldnt these are letters these are letters from home
youll be the official mail carrier neelix well get you the letters as quickly as we can download them
a task im happy to perform captain i can tell you ive never seen the crew this excited
this is the closest theyve come to their families in almost four years
i promise to treat these like gemstones
by the time youve delivered them we should have more
captain ive discovered something odd there seems to be more here than just letters
what do you mean
theres a latent datastream buried under the message its heavily encrypted
encrypted
it appears to contain a large block of text and what may be maps
can you retrieve any of it
not immediately when more of the letters have been cleared out i should be able to access the coded message
well i might just hope that it contains a plan for bringing us back to the alpha quadrant im curious seven what do you think about all this messages the possibility of getting home
it lacks any emotional resonance for me ive never even been to earth
you realise you may have family there
that had not occurred to me
you could have cousins grandparents there might be more emotional resonance than you think
ahem i am happy to announce that i have the first letters from home
who are they for neelix
ah this one is addressed to commander chakotay whos it from commander
an old friend the person who recruited me into the maquis maybe ill read this in private tom you have the bridge
neelix wait a minute arent there any more
no no more for the bridge crew not yet be patient
come in
good news mister vulcan this ones for you
thank you mister neelix you can put it on the desk was there something more
arent you going to read it
of course
i i mean arent you going to read it now
im finishing my weekly tactical review when its completed ill read the message
youre going to wait until you finish the tactical review
do you have any reason to believe the content of the message will change during that time
thats not the point its a letter from your family dont you want to know what it says
i fully intend to find out what it says
it has some important news
you mean youve read it
well only the first few lines when i was seeing who it was addressed to i i couldnt help it would you like me to read it to you
very well
my husband we have been given the news that you are alive your children and i have asked the priests at the temple of aymonk to say prayers for your safe return thats very sweet
amonak
pardon
the temple of amonak one of the most sacred on vulcan
amonak of course the most significant news is the fact that your first son sek has gone through the pon farr he mated and has become a father you are now the grandfather of a healthy female who they have named tmeni after your mother youre a grandfather isnt that wonderful congratulations what should we call you now grandpa gramps
i think commander tuvok will suffice thank you mister neelix ill read the rest to myself
just so long as you read it right away no procrastinating who knows what else might be in that letter
is that a letter to you captain
yes seven just downloaded it ill be in my ready room
yes maam
have you gotten a letter yet
dont expect one
do you remember sveta
of course
i got one from her
why would she be writing you chakotay what is it
something terrible has happened i read that letter for an hour before i could accept it now i have to tell everyone else and im not sure how to do it its over belanna there are no more maquis
what are you saying there are thousands of us
all wiped out it seems the cardassians have an ally a species from the gamma quadrant who supplied them with ships and weapons
ktarra roberto everyone except us is dead
just about sveta and a few lucky ones are in prison
no
belanna
dont dont try to console me i dont want to be comforted those were our friends good people willing to put their lives on the line for something they believed in and now youre telling me that they are gone that they are slaughtered
those are the risks we all took we all knew where it could lead
its not right and you know it i will make someone pay i swear i will if we ever get back
tom i heard there are at least thirty more letters that have been downloaded
oh yeah
neelix is supposed to on his way here now
what do you suppose this is anyway
what was is
this mystery dish it tastes vaguely like chicken but it has the consistency of corn husks
is that all you can think about what youre eating
well i dont like guessing at what i put in my stomach
tom were getting letters from home doesnt that mean anything to you
not particularly
i dont believe you
you know its really not that bad
here he comes
good news seven has been able to download some more letters this one is for susan nicoletti is she here
oh yeah
fitzpatrick
right here
thank you
kyoto golwat  ashmore dorado
im here
theres not going to be one for me
hes not done yet hang on
and finally parsons im sorry if your name hasnt come up but seven is still working
neelix i thought you had over thirty letters
thirty where did you hear that
thats what was going around
dont pay any attention to rumours
right
arent you going to eat your lunch
im not hungry
you shouldnt get your hopes up harry no hopes no disappointments
im not you
come in
captain im beginning to have trouble accessing the datastream the longer it remains lodged in the relay station the more it degrades
if we could get near enough we could try to stabilise the containment field but i cant risk taking the ship in any closer
a shuttle could withstand the gravimetric eddies more easily than voyager id like to try it
id want commander tuvok to go with you
for what reason
it isnt my custom to send an away team of one
as you wish
hi
hi i thought seven was working in here
shes gone with tuvok to shore up the stations confinement field ive taken over for her disappointed
of course not would you stop that ive told you theres nothing between us
i know theres nothing between you its purely a one way attraction
very funny
harry you might as well wear a big sign that says im in love everyone sees it
look ill admit that for a while well shes a very attractive woman but ive gotten over that
okay
fine believe whatever you want
if you didnt come down here to see her why did you
i wanted to know if id gotten a letter yet
sorry i havent seen anything so far
do you think theres going to be one for everybody
im sure that starfleet contacted the families and friends of everyone on the ship they know how important that would be
i hope so
harry youll get one try to be patient
commander am i correct in assuming that vulcans are incapable of lying
we are capable of telling lies however i have never found it prudent or necessary to do so
you have never lied
only under orders from a superior officer
then i must ask you something is it the captains custom to send at least two people on an away mission
its not only her custom its recommended starfleet protocol
i see
is there a purpose to your question
i am wondering if the captain still doesnt trust me if she feels i require supervision
i am not certain how the captain regards you but her decision to have me accompany you on this mission shouldnt be taken as evidence of any particular attitude
i believe we are close enough to emit a polaron pulse
bring the main deflector online
ready
the variance in the containment field is now at point two nine
that should prevent further degradation of the signal
let me ask you a question seven is the captains opinion important to you
my understanding of the hierarchy on voyager is that the captains opinion is important to every member of the crew
whats happened
we have just been scanned by a subneucleonic beam of some kind
the navigational sensors have been disrupted
we must get voyager to send out a directional beacon to guide us back tuvok to voyager voyager please respond
commander weve lost other systems as well we have no communications no warp engines and no weapons
i suspect this was done intentionally by the ship thats approaching rapidly off out port stern
theyre at fifty thousand kilometres and closing
our shields are losing integrity
ill try to get at least one phaser array back online commander one more hit and well be susceptible to a hull breach
that ship is larger than ours if we lure it closer to the station it will be far more vulnerable to the gravitational eddies than we are a tractor beam we are being pulled toward the ship
ill try to disrupt it unsuccessful
launching a distress beacon
torres to the bridge
go ahead
captain could lieutenant paris come
down here i think ive got something hed want to see
hes on his way
its a letter for you its coming through right now
for me
its right here
whos it from
i cant tell yet
maybe its from the rehab colony telling me ive violated probation
why are you acting like this
i just want to know who the letters from okay
you should know in a minute
ill be on the bridge
what youre not going to wait
im on duty
voyager is hanging in space theres not a lot to do at the helm
i just thought that i should be at my post
you may be able to fool someone else with that ploy but youre talking to me tom
just download the letter okay
a little more has come in its from starfleet from an admiral owen do you know him
admiral owen paris its my father
thats wonderful
yeah maybe i dont know exactly why but the more everybody gets excited about these letters from home the more i dont want any part of it maybe because what i have on voyager is so much better than anything i ever had back there i just dont want the reminder
youre not the same person you were four years ago what makes you think he is
no you dont know him
at least give him a chance hes obviously reaching out
when he forms an opinion about something nothing can change his mind
fine excuse me if i cant feel terribly sorry for you i learned this morning that a lot of my friends are dead and ive gone from being so angry that i wanted to kill someone to crying for an hour and now im just trying to to accept it and move on
belanna thats awful i am so sorry and here i am going on about something that doesnt even matter anymore
no im sorry it obviously does you care what he thinks about you
yeah yeah i guess i still do
ill let you know when i get the whole letter
come in
looks like tuvok and seven pulled it off the containment field has stabilised quite a bit belanna says shed downloading the letters much more easily now
thats good news
we dont have the shuttle on sensors yet but they should be back soon
ive learned a few interesting things about that relay station its generating as much energy every minute as a typical star puts out in a year
its amazing to me is that someone a hundred thousand years ago was harvesting microsingularities
if nobody shows up to protest id like to stay here for a while try to find the answers to some of these questions this is the kind of archaeological puzzle thats always fascinated me want a cup
no thanks you havent mentioned your letter who was it from
it was from mark the man i was engaged to he told me about the litter of puppies my dog had and how he found homes for them how devastated he was when voyager was lost how he held out hopes we were alive longer than most people did until he realised that he was clinging to a fantasy so he began living his life again meeting people letting go of the past about four months ago he married a woman who works with him hes very happy
how do you feel about that
well i knew hed eventually move on with his life but there was such a finality to that letter
kim to the captain can you come to the bridge
what is it
weve picked up an automated distress signal from tuvoks shuttle sensors show theres no one on board
seven seven of nine
where are we
i assume were on the alien ship
this is most uncomfortable have you seen anyone
no if we can reach one of those blades perhaps we can cut through these bindings
you were pathetic prey easily taken
the hunt was not satisfying i want information why do you violate our property i could snap your puny neck with one twist hardly worth taking answer me why do you use our modules
were trying to retrieve important messages from our home return us to our ship and well be on our way without trespassing again
i took you in a fair hunt i claim the relics of the chase
are the others on your ship able to put up more of a fight than you
you will find our captain a formidable opponent and our ship heavily armed
good strong prey makes for a better hunt
release us now and youll be safe otherwise we will destroy you
pitiful relics
they are the first of their kind i will be envied
ive located their ship its four thousand ketriks from the module
well be there within the hour go to stalking mode why do you hesitate
the rest of the group is on its way
i wanted to claim this prey for myself
we may not be able to take them alone we need the strength of the others
i wont share prey with the others these two must be the only relics prepare them
captain its tricky to scan through the interference but i think im detecting a ship
what kind of ship
let me reconfigure the sensor array its hirogen and tuvok and seven are on it
hail them
on screen
im captain janeway of the starship voyager you have two of my crew on board
disconnect your link with our module and leave this space
not without my people
they are my relics
im prepared to offer you something for their safe return surely we can come to an agreement
if the rest of my group arrives you will be taken as well im giving you a chance to run
we dont run
captain ive got three more ships on sensors coming towards us at high warp
dont be foolish leave now and save yourselves
give me my people and well do just that
theyre mine
then get ready for a fight red alert
are they prepared
yes but now is not the time for it we should wait until the others arrive and take the ship
i want to make the first kill you will verify it
if theres a battle we must join it
the others can wage the battle
perhaps you are more interested in collecting relics perhaps your judgment is clouded
dont question me again we do it now
i suggest you think carefully about your decision if you kill us our captain will hunt you down and show no mercy
im not concerned lower the harness a long coiled intestine an interesting trophy
what possible use could you make of my intestines
unusual relics are prized yours will make me envied by men and pursued by women
you are a crude species only your size makes you formidable
your insults are as pitiful as your efforts to escape this one first i want the female to witness what will happen to her their bone structure makes cutting through the back difficult this will take time
bridge to torres
torres here captain
how much longer
im getting out piece by piece at least another half hour
how are you coming
the ship has some kind of monotanium armour plating its scattering the targeting beam
the other three ships are closing theyre within six thousand kilometres
captain those ships have massive weapons theyve definitely got us outgunned
harry let me see those ships in relation to the relay station
yes maam
maybe we can use that quantum singularity to our advantage
how
if we can boost the effect of the singularity increase the gravitational pull we might be able to stop them
the pull would increase if we could weaken the stations containment field an antithoron burst might do it
if were not careful we might be pulled in as well
dont worry were going to be ready for it harry create a low level warp field around voyager sublight energy level that should help counteract the gravitational pull
if the field is too strong we wont be able to beam tuvok and seven aboard
then youll have to find the right balance wont you harry
yes maam
on my mark direct a level eight antithoron burst towards the station have thrusters ready for full reverse mister paris
understood
ive established a low level warp field captain
antithoron system is online
im ready with thrusters
do it
its working
try the transporter lock again harry
stabilise the ship
i cant the gravity well is pulling us in
that vessel is weakening the modules containment field
ready weapons signal the others to attack
torres to the bridge
go ahead
the antithoron burst collapsed
the signal ive gotten as much of the message as im going to get
acknowledged hail those ships
channel open
this is captain janeway agree to retreat and well restore the containment field
captain theyre firing
their weapons are destabilising the containment field
this is janeway stop firing youre putting yourselves in grave danger
the field is going the singularity is about to be exposed
captain the ship with tuvok and seven is still being pulled in
get a tractor beam on it
i have tuvok and seven targeted but if we try to transport them now the gravity well could scatter their patterns
the tractor beam is weakening were going to lose them
harry we have to risk it
activating the transporter
full reverse increase power to the engine
no response
do you have them
not yet their patterns are distorting
narrow the annular confinement beam
tractor beams almost gone captain were losing this tug of war
reroute all secondary power to the tractor emitters
the tractor beam collapsed that ship is headed into the black hole
im realigning the pattern buffer ive got one more shot at it i got them theyre in transporter room two
i need more power were being pulled in
transfer all available power to the engines
its not enough
shut down life support
structural integritys failing the hull is starting to buckle
were going in
open the antimatter injectors to one hundred twenty percent
captain that could breach the core
so will that black hole now just do it
yes maam
were free
resume course ill be in astrometrics
captain look at this the energy released from the singularity created a massive discharge along the relay network it disabled every one of the stations
how much of the message were you able to get
i got most of the encrypted starfleet text and a few more personal letters
how soon can we see what starfleet had to say
itll take some time to decode harry should probably work on it if youll excuse me i have a few letters to deliver
neelix can do that
no need anyway theres one that i want to do personally
good news harry i got this at the last minute
its from my folks thanks
im sorry tom i wasnt able to download yours in time
just when i was getting eager to read it
you could assume that he said he loves you and that hes proud of you
i think i will
i learned very little about them but i believe we should consider them extremely dangerous they seem to lack any moral centre
do you know why the relay network was so important to them
no i assume they used it for communications as we did
well they wont be using it any more
they wont be pleased about that captain i doubt weve seen the last of them
come in
if youll excuse me commander
repair teams have inspected the ship from stem to stern except for some maintenance thats needed on the warp coils everything seems fine
i suppose so want some coffee
thanks
cream and sugar huh
two sugars
oh two sugars
you know you drink too much of that stuff
really
if im not mistaken thats your third cup this morning
fourth and on a day like today it wont be my last coffee  the finest organic suspension ever devised its got me through the worst of the last three years i beat the borg with it oh im sure voyager will be fine but im worried that the crew might be a different story i think they were hoping mail call would become a regular part of their day
neelix is putting together an impromptu party he thought it might cheer them up
good idea when will it be
as soon as he can get people together
leave it to neelix to come up with the right idea at the right time
how are you doing
me im fine
youd say that if youd just had your legs torn off by a traykan beast look what youve been through in the last few days we finally make a connection with home and then its ripped away from us we manage to make another enemy whos going to try and hunt us down and destroy us and on top of that
its all right you can say it on top of all that i got a dear john letter it wasnt really a surprise i guess i didnt really expect him to wait for me considering the circumstances it made me realise that i was using him as a safety net you know as a way to avoid becoming involved with someone else
you dont have that safety net any more
thats right then again my life is far from uneventful here in the delta quadrant its not like i would have had a chance to pursue a relationship even if i had realised i was alone
youre hardly alone and to my way of thinking theres still plenty of time
plenty of time
neelix to the ready room the partys about to begin and there are only two people missing
were on our way
the preys course has become erratic i will intercept to kill
no maintain distance his ship is damaged hes injured let him bleed
this prey is resilient we will lose the moment
the way a creature behaves when it is wounded is the key to its destruction maintain distance
direct hit our hull armour is stable
his weapons must be weakening
the prey is heading for an asteroid belt vector one six eight point nine we are losing him
he hasnt come here to hide hes come to make a final stand
tracking hes holding position above an asteroid and hes left his ship
follow him
the prey is scattering our sensors
impressive he counters out pursuit to the final moment
compensating
no disengage sensors
for what reason
i want to take him with my own eyes follow ill draw his attack prepare to target his thoracic crest
a flawless kill
please remain still so that i can treat your injuries thank you im sorry did that hurt ill try to be more careful thanks for being a patient patient have a pleasant afternoon this is absurd
not at all keep going youre doing fine
this vernacular is not applicable to my duties on voyager
we can tailor the vocabulary to your specific situations a little later right now its the sentiment that counts
i dont see the relevance
i created these exercises three years ago to familiarise myself with the social graces i found that if i repeated them several times each day the words became almost second nature lets continue exercise two the workplace encounter kes used to help me with this one now ill be the nurse you be the doctor
please hand me the hypospray
of course doctor immediately
thank you looks at instrument
no no dont read that part only the dialogue
excuse me nurse this is the wrong hypospray would you mind finding the correct one
not at all
thank you did i mention you look lovely today
oh doctor youre so charming
this lesson is terminated
i know its awkward for me it was even painful but youll find the rewards are well worth the effort
rewards
the ability to put others at ease make them feel more comfortable around you youre a lot like me when i was first activated if id had a mentor things would have gone a lot more smoothly im willing to share my wisdom but if youre not interested fine ill stick to your physiological maintenance
i will examine your data
oh good pay special attention to exercise seventeen bridge banter for beginners
have a pleasant day
verify
monotanium hull plating dicyclic warp signature the vessel is definitely hirogen
theyre moving to intercept
evasive manoeuvres
no we need to settle our differences here and now hard about full impulse
red alert
theyre in visual range
on screen hail them
no response
theyre closing fifty thousand kilometres forty five forty
maintain course mister paris
curious they are not charging weapons
theyre slowing sir
lifesigns
only one and its erratic
theyve stopped captain their engines just went offline
this could be a trap
harry run a long range scan are there any other hirogen ships out there
none
take us within transporter range
you intend to board their ship
yes
the hirogen vessel is a potential threat we should destroy it
seven what you call a threat i call an opportunity to gain knowledge about this species and in this case maybe even show some compassion there seems to be a wounded pilot over there
our experience with the hirogen indicates that compassion would not be reciprocated
and all of my experience says weve got to take that chance anyway commander
tuvok paris youre with me
looks like there was a fight
search for the lifesigns
commander
im reading bones muscle tissue from at least nine different species its all being broken down by some sort of enzyme
perhaps this is their method of denaturating their prey
either that or its dinner
looks like somebody lost their helmet urgh
commander im not picking up any weapon residuals id say he was physically torn apart
im picking up the lifesigns this way
massive internal bleeding lets get him to sickbay
the data we downloaded from the ships computer included navigational records can you give us a map of this region
the is the hirogen vessels flightpath over the past five years
theyve certainly covered a lot of space
this ship alone has visited over ninety star systems in the last year
i analysed some of their logs from what i can tell this is a hunting species we saw the skeletal remains from dozens of alien races displayed like trophies there was also evidence they may be using some of their victims for food the entire culture seems to be based on the hunt social rituals art religious beliefs theyre nomadic their existence is driven by the pursuit of prey and its carried them across huge distances
there is no evidence of a home planet their ships travel alone or in small groups on occasion several will join forces in a multipronged attack
like wolves
hows our wolf in sickbay
still unconscious behind a level five forcefield
you were right seven this species is a threat but despite the risk of sending an away team we know a lot more about who were dealing with now
you were correct captain it was worth the risk this time
so theres one question remaining whos hunting the hunters
i was trying to remove his body armour to treat the internal injuries when he suddenly regained consciousness needless to say hes not happy to be here
can you sedate him
ive already tried his immune system neutralises everything i could synthesise a more potent compound but that would take hours he could be dead by then his wounds are severe
your crewmate is dead and your ship has been damaged beyond repair i brought you here to treat your injuries what happened to your ship who attacked you the first time i met your species it wasnt on the best of terms but that doesnt mean you and i cant find a way to change that
our prey
you were on a hunt
yes a formidable alien we captured it two days ago but it broke free of its restraints attacked us release me i must continue the hunt
not without your ship and not in this condition youll die without treatment let us help you
doctor
all right im going to enter the forcefield now and start with a few scans of your midsection you should know im a hologram and cant be bent spindled or mutilated so dont bother trying please lie down or remain standing
captain weve detected six more hirogen ships theyre converging on us from all directions
the one in sickbay may have sent a distress call from his vessel
how long do we have
the nearest ship is half a light year away four hours at most
tom analyse their approach pattern evade them as long as you can
yes maam
i want to buy the doctor enough time to treat our hunter if i gain his confidence he might call off his friends good oldfashioned diplomacy could get us out of this yet
dont count on it from what i found in their database diplomacy isnt a part of their lifestyle they dont see us as equals to them were simply game
its time we convince them otherwise or like any other cornered animal well show our teeth
theres been a hull rupture on deck eleven section three damage is minor it appears a plasma conduit overloaded
increase power to the structural integrity field
a bulkhead has collapsed in jefferies tube eighty four
another overload
negative the plasma network is stable this wasnt caused by any power surge or system failure
harry tuvok get to deck eleven and check it out
this was no overload
indeed
commander
its a dense mixture of dna and polyfluidic compounds tuvok to bridge
go ahead
we may have an intruder aboard
im analysing what could be a sample of its blood the readings are consistent with species 8472
intruder alert bridge to security seal off decks ten through twelve
internal sensors arent detecting any intruders
the last time we ran into this species it was impervious to our scanners well have to track it visually
how did it get past our shields
well worry about that later you have the bridge commander ill be on deck eleven
ive erected a level ten forcefield around engineering
good  set up secondary forcefields around every hatch jefferies tube and conduit leading into this room i want every one of these consoles secured authorised command codes only im going to lock down the warp core ensign realign the dilithium matrix to a frequency of three point six nine
report
four crewmembers are wounded two seriously
get them to sickbay
species 8472 accessed engineering through the antimatter injector port our phaser fire was insufficient it attacked us then escaped through jefferies tube seventeen alpha
janeway to tuvok
tuvok here
the intruder just left engineering seal off the area
understood
secure the warp core
yes captain
seven
it would seem that the hirogen underestimated their latest prey
you believe they were hunting the creature
yes when the borg were fighting species 8472 did they ever engage in physical combat
on many occasions
can you recall anything that might help us here
each time they boarded a borg vessel they went directly to the central power matrix and disabled it
the creature was just in engineering didnt touch any of our power systems
its obviously adjusted its strategy species 8472 is devious and highly intelligent it will seek the most efficient means of destroying us
lets get to sickbay
shes going to be just fine captain
is it alone have you seen any others like it
why
six months ago this species invaded our galaxy with thousands of ships we were barely able to fight them off
your prey could indicate another invasion if it does were all in trouble how many ships have you seen
only one damaged we tracked it across fifty light years we thought that we had killed the creature but this prey is unlike any other it has many lives lower the forcefield and i will finish the hunt
your attempt to destroy it will fail species 8472 is highly resistant to all technology all but one borg nanoprobes
nanoprobes
microscopic weapons that can attack the species on a cellular level weve tried it before and it worked
ill modify the phaser rifles to fire nanoprobe discharges
i want you to incapacitate the creature not kill it can you make that modification
yes but it would require additional time we must stop it as soon as possible
shes right
not until we know why it returned
you will be exposing this crew to unnecessary risk
i disagree
captain
you have your orders seven six of your vessels will be here in under four hours i hope youll let them know that we saved your life and that we want to avoid any further conflict with your people
let me resume the hunt and i will grant your request
we have enough problems on this ship as it is without him running around
i spent six months studying this preys behaviour i know how to track him let me continue or i will have the others destroy you
tuvok to janeway
go ahead
were holding position in section ninety four but the creature has accessed the environmental controls deck eleven is losing life support artificial gravity has also been compromised
evacuate the deck
regroup on deck ten
aye captain
hes trying to barricade himself he did the same thing to us
you want to be part of the hunt nows your chance hell be under your supervision commander if he steps out of line shoot him
my weapon
temperature gradient
affirmative
atmospheric recyclers
engaged
is your body armour designed to handle rapid pressure fluctuations
it can defeat most hostile environments i once tracked a siliconbased lifeform through the neutronium mantle of a collapsed star
i once tracked a mouse through jefferies tube thirty two
chakotay to tuvok were ready to go
as are we
proceed to deck eleven keep you comm links open
understood activate the nanoprobe charges
level five should be sufficient to stun the creature
depressurising hatch magnetise
maintain your position
hes here
i said maintain your position this is my hunt im at point
my knowledge of this prey is superior you yours
but youre on unfamiliar terrain i know this ship you dont
the prey will likely attack the man at point you would not survive
ill take that chance now fall back
no problem ill take up the rear
you missed since species 8472 invaded the ship youve become increasingly agitated
they were the only species to offer true resistance to the borg they destroyed millions of drones hundreds of our worlds i have reason to be agitated
what is it
its blood the prey is wounded
this corridor ends about twenty metres ahead
the only thing down there is deflector control its got nowhere to run
hes not planning to run hes waiting hell attempt to slip around us attack from behind
chakotay to tuvok
tuvok here
weve cornered the intruderin section fifty nine
on our way
its hurt
this prey is resilient he will strike with his dying breath we must kill him now
that may not be necessary hold your fire i said lower your weapon
mister neelix i must ask you to exchange your spatula for a phaser rifle
sure
we have two intruders on board and six hirogen vessels on the way i need additional security personnel
right away sir whats my assignment
join the security detail on deck ten section twelve youll receive further instructions then ill expect tactical updates every twenty minutes
lieutenant are you all right
you have your orders
report
the hirogens back in sickbay within a forcefield
and species 8472
weve established a security perimeter basically weve turned this entire section into a brig
as an added precaution have belanna start working on a way to lock onto the creature in case we have to beam it off the ship you mentioned it was injured in what way
i wish i could tell you for certain its body is generating some sort of bioelectric field making it impossible to scan so i could only make a visual diagnosis its conscious but immobile its epidermis displays any number of injuries punctures energy burns and its demeanour is that of a wounded animal
the hirogen said theyve been chasing it for several months is there anything you can do
i dont know enough about its physiognomy to treat its surface wounds let alone any internal damage frankly im at a loss
captain just before we cornered it species 8472 accessed deflector control from this panel
ive analysed the transmission protocols it was attempting to open a singularity into its realm but it failed
it was trying to get home
thats what it looks like
tuvok
the creature initiated telepathic contact with me
whats it saying
its ship was damaged during the conflict with the borg when the other members of its species retreated into fluidic space it was left behind it has been trapped in the delta quadrant ever since alone pursued by hirogen hunting parties it has no desire for further conflict it only wants to return to its domain it is dying captain
you have nothing to be afraid of were going to help you get back to your realm does it understand
it does
it will take time to open a singularity and we have no way of treating your injuries but if theres anything you can tell us about your
it has lost consciousness our telepathic link has been severed
where is my prey
lying at the end of a corridor on deck eleven nearly dead thanks to you
take me to it
no
take me to it
in less than three hours your ships will arrive by that time species 8472 will no longer be on voyager
what do you mean
im sending it back where it came from
surrender the creature to me and you will not be harmed
this isnt a hunt its a slaughter and im calling it off right now
we will not be denied our prey give us the creature or your crew will take its place
tuvok
have seven of nine report to my ready room
you intend to ask her to open a rift into 8472s realm
shes the only one on board who knows how
given her feelings towards the species she may not want to cooperate
well see
you wish to see me captain
ive made a decision about species 8472 im going to return it to fluidic space in order to do that i need you to open a quantum singularity
i dont believe that is a prudent course of action
i realise it may be difficult for you to help save this creatures life but part of becoming human is learning to have compassion for those who are suffering even when theyre your bitter enemies
why
i remember when i was a lieutenant it was during a cardassian border conflict my away team was cut off while we were defending a federation outpost wed been exchanging phaser fire with a group of cardassians for about three days a stalemate one night during a break in the fighting we could hear this low moaning sound coming from somewhere in the brush we knew that none of our people were out there so it had to be a wounded cardassian you have to understand wed been killing each other for weeks on this planet it was brutal but our commanding officer decided that we couldnt just sit there and listen to that poor man suffer so he ordered me and an ensign to crawl out there and bring that cardassian back to our camp i thought he was crazy he was risking our lives for someone who would have shot us without hesitation but we did it and the cardassian lived three days later we secured the outpost it was a major victory we were all decorated by starfleet command but in retrospect the thing im most proud of was the night we saved that mans life
explain
a single act of compassion can put you in touch with your own humanity
you are trying to justify your present decision
no im trying to help you see this as an opportunity to grow i know you dont want to do it seven but im telling you as your captain and as your friend you wont regret it
no your decision is tactically unsound we will be surrounded by hirogen ships in approximately two hours if we do not surrender the creature they will destroy us a lesson in compassion will do me little good if i am dead
it is wrong to sacrifice another being to save our own lives
i have observed that you have been willing to sacrifice your own life to save the lives of your crew
yes but thats different that was my choice this creature does not have a choice
it invaded our ship put our lives at risk to save its own in my view it has already forfeited its freedom
im giving you an order report to deflector control and begin working on creating a singularity
i will not comply i have agreed to remain on voyager i have agreed to function as a member of your crew but i will not be a willing participant in my own destruction or the destruction of this ship
objection noted well do this without you
you will fail
and you have just crossed the line end of debate report to the cargo bay and remain there until this is over is that understood
shields down to eighty four percent
return fire
three more ships are closing from port and starboard all escape trajectories have been cut off
our weapons are having little effect on their hull plating im scanning for weaknesses in the molecular structure
shields at seventy nine percent
they are hailing us
better late than never open a channel
youve taken our prey and one of our hunters surrender them
call off your attack and well return your crewman as for your prey its under our protection now
it belongs to us
it belongs to no one now order your ships to withdraw and this can end peacefully
all vessels are firing
any luck finding a crack in their armour
not yet
doctor to bridge species 8472 appears to be regenerating im no exobiologist but id say this fellow is becoming highly agitated
it could be sensing the hirogen attack
doctor can you sedate it
i believe so but ill need another dose of borg nanoprobes
stand by bridge to seven of nine
yes
report to deck eleven immediately with a supply of nanoprobes
understood
belanna hows it going down there
transporters are ready i can establish a lock on the creature at any time but i still havent duplicated the deflector protocols to open a singularity
how long
i need another hour maybe two
captain we can outmanoeuvre the hirogen ships for a few more minutes but beyond that
direct hit to the eps manifold main power just went down
forcefields on all decks are offline
switch to auxiliary power
done forcefields have been restored but i dont know how long theyll hold
bridge to doctor report
its all right captain the creature is contained
bridge to sickbay security respond
security dispatch teams to deck five the hirogen may be loose
direct hit to our port nacelle now theyve taken out our starboard nacelle
theyve crippled us tuvok divert warp power to the phaser banks maybe thatll help us penetrate their hull plating
the nanoprobes
armed and ready
not a moment too soon
give me the prey
lower your weapon or i will destroy you
i dont think you will you want me to destroy this creature i saw it on your face earlier in the medical bay its a look ive seen a thousand times stand aside
what are you doing
captain someones accessing the transporter system from deck five
lock them out
i cant theyre overriding my commands with borg encryption codes
report mister kim
8472 and the hirogen theyve been beamed to one of the attacking ships
all six vessels are moving away at high warp
tom can we pursue
im sorry captain warp engines are still offline
resume our previous course full impulse
seven of nine
seven of nine
captain
step down please seven you disobeyed my direct orders and as a result you condemned a sentient being to its death
by doing so i also diverted the hirogen attack an attack which would have destroyed us
maybe not in any case the decision wasnt yours to make
the creature broke through the forcefield i had no choice
i didnt come here to debate your decision i came here to inform you of the consequences when you first came to voyager i decided to grant you the same liberties and freedoms of any crew member because i wanted you to be a part of this family and ive been willing to accommodate your unique way of doing things even when you rubbed somebody the wrong way or violated protocol but this time i cant accommodate you from this point forward you will no longer have access to any primary systems on this ship not without my direct authorisation if you attempt to circumvent me ill throw you in the brig i still need your expertise in the astrometrics lab if youre willing if not you can spend your time here in the cargo bay is that understood
yes
it is puzzling
whats that
you made me into an individual you encouraged me to stop thinking like a member of the collective to cultivate my independence and my humanity but when i try to assert that independence i am punished
individuality has its limits especially on a starship where theres a command structure
i believe that you are punishing me because i do not think the way you do because i am not becoming more like you you claim to respect my individuality but in fact you are frightened by it
as you were
direct hit
the target buoy is solid monotanium ten metres thick shielded by a chromoelectric forcefield
impressive
im glad you agree its not wise to travel this region without adequate defences ive seen scuttled ships with more firepower than voyager
im sure you have
imagine what youll be capable of once the isokinetic cannon is integrated into your defensive systems one projectile can penetrate the shields of any heavily armoured vessel hostile species will know to avoid voyager by reputation alone
youve made your point mister kovin i want the cannon and im prepared to give you astrometrics charts spanning twelve sectors youll find them unusually precise
even the most sophisticated charts become obsolete one random anomaly and theyre no longer accurate however i could be persuaded if you were to include the mapping technology that created them
sorry our astrometrics sensors were designed specifically for this ship theyd be of no use to you what i can offer you is a generous supply of isolinear processing chips well even show you how to integrate them into your existing sensor technology
how generous a supply
one hundred chips
one hundred and fifty
one fifteen
one twenty five
done escort our guest to engineering youll be supervising the installation of the cannon
of course for a modest fee
five additional chips no more
its good to see the art of negotiation isnt lost on you captain
that guy is worse than a ferengi
assign seven of nine to work on this shes got a knack for adapting alien technology
should i give her complete access to the engineering control systems
im ready to give her some latitude shes been behaving herself lately
what are you working on
im trying to decode the message starfleet command sent us several weeks ago
any progress
none im working on a new decryption algorithm
id like you to set it aside for a while i have another assignment for you
what is it
the captain wants you to help kovin integrate the new weapon system
id rather not i find him inefficient
maybe so but you seem to work well with him youve been asking for more responsibilities i thought youd be pleased
the captain gives me greater liberty only when she needs my expertise
you violated her trust and if you want it back youre going to have to earn it one step at a time
i will report to engineering
youll need to install isolinear buffer circuits here and here
the main power relay should be protected by a containment field
unnecessary all the buffer circuits would have to fail simultaneously for there to be any danger
we prefer to play it safe ill check the inventory logs to see if we have a field generator available
what are you doing
im reconfiguring the tactical control systems
the isokinetic circuit requires a specialised protocol let me take care of it
that wont be necessary
no no the subroutines need to be arranged in cascading sequence let me show you
seven stop
theres a hairline fracture of the premaxilla bone
do you see this captain she shattered it
its easily repaired
do you have any idea why seven attacked you
it was unprovoked she came at me like an animal
oh i wouldnt put it like that i was at another console about ten metres away i heard kovin raise his voice and when i looked around i saw that he was holding her arm
i barely touched her a gentle gesture to move her out of my way so i could get to the console then she turned on me attacked me
what did you say to her
i told her how to reconfigure the tactical control systems properly
is that all
thats all
and thats when she knocked him down ashmore and i had to hold her back
she would have killed me that woman is dangerous
its a miracle you survived now hold still or this wont heal properly
why are you questioning me on this you should be disciplining your crew member
believe me ill deal with it please accept my sincere apology now if youll excuse me
good as new
come in
here we are again oh im tired of having this conversation you know what im going to say i know how youre going to respond so it seems pointless to say anything
shall i consider my privileges restricted and confine myself to the cargo bay
i think weve established that traditional disciplinary actions dont work with you the question is what will
are you asking for my opinion
i suppose i am because frankly im running out of options throwing you in the brig isnt going to solve anything neither is slapping you on the wrist and its not as though i dont understand your feelings about kovin there have been a few times when id have liked to pop him on the nose myself but you have to start learning the difference between having an impulse and acting on it does that make any sense to you
i believe so i will give it more thought
well thats a start
i hear there was some excitement this morning when i started helping you improve your social skills im fairly certain i didnt include a boxing lesson you werent hurt were you
no
still a bit tense
perhaps
i understand the burden you carry constantly being obligated to deal with those who fall short of excellence i often find my own patience being tested by someone like mister kovin of course i generally respond with a devastating quip rather than a left hook we must both accept the fact that very few lifeforms will ever meet our high standards so when you get irritated just try to be tolerant and remember they cant help being what they are hmm im reading some increased engrammatic activity and your adrenalin levels are slightly elevated
what does that indicate
its consistent with a state of heightened tension lie down and ill run some scans in a typical human i would consider this a mood swing but with your unique physiology id like to rule out the possibility of a chemical imbalance
have you been experiencing any other symptoms headaches disorientation
no
physiological scans seem normal im going to check your borg implants now
seven whats wrong
let me out
i will stay calm
no more procedures
all right
stay away you mustnt do this
do what seven what are you so afraid of
i dont know
she experienced an episode of acute anxiety with all the trimmings intense apprehension shortness of breath dizziness i finally managed to sedate her
could this have been caused by her cortical implants
i dont think so i think the problem has to do with memory suppression ive detected a high concentration of biogenic amines in sevens hippocampus a substance i havent noticed before its blocking portions of her memory centre
do you know where it came from
no but it seems to be dissipating
sevens unusual behaviour may be the result of the blocked memories beginning to surface memories which she cant identify yet
can you treat her
treatment would involve integrating the repressed memories into sevens consciousness i may be able to use a standard therapeutic regression technique
i wasnt aware that you were programmed for psychotherapeutic capabilities
i wasnt but in the absence of a ships counsellor ive been developing a psychiatric subroutine to add to my programme ill be even more valuable to you than i am now
keep me informed doctor
a jungian therapist would attempt to retrieve unconscious memories by exploring synchronicities in recent events on the other hand amanin of betazed would argue that a combination of sensory isolation and focused breathing techniques would be more effective ive integrated the finer points of both to create my own approach to memory reconstruction
what does this approach involve
first putting you at ease by performing the treatment here in your own environment once the cortical probes have reinforced the neural pathways ill use a directed imagery technique to guide you through the regression
you may proceed
please close your eyes clear your mind try not to think or to analyse
my mind is now clear
seven this isnt an exercise in efficiency close your eyes breathe deeply now concentrate on the sound of my voice let go of the present leave the cargo bay behind allow yourself to drift describe the first image that enters your mind
a medical tricorder duritanium casing seven point six centimetres by nine point eight centimetres by three point two centimetres alphanumeric display
thats enough so youre in sickbay how does the tricorder make you feel
it disturbs me
why does it disturb you
im afraid it will hurt me
is there anything else there that causes you to anticipate pain
the diagnostic bed its closing around me
you feel restrained confined
about what
its kovin
what is he doing
hes restraining me i want to get away from him but i cant kovins using some kind of instrument on me
seven
i didnt recall this before
recall what
kovin he performed a surgical procedure on me he extracted borg technology from my body he violated me
were making progress now tell me this surgical procedure when did it happen
i dont know the details are vague there are only images
and youre sure it was kovin did you see kovin
yes
you said he was restraining you using an instrument of some sort
he was
were you on voyager when this happened
no it must have been when we were testing the weapons on the surface
then concentrate on that away mission focus on the first image that enters your mind describe it for me
a large granitic stone approximately one half metre high
now allow that memory to develop beyond the image integrate it into your consciousness let the memory take shape
im at the weapons range kovin had taken us there to evaluate various hand held firearms he wished to offer in trade
he attempted to impress us with a demonstration of the weapons destructive capabilities my role was to provide a more objective analysis
terawatt powered particle beam rifle four microsecond recharge cycle ten kilometre range
definitely not standard starfleet issue what do you think
seventy two percent fragmentation twenty eight percent vaporisation crude but efficient
its not as accurate as our compression rifles but its a lot easier to handle i wouldnt mind carrying one of these the next time we run into the hirogen
targeting mechanism could be augmented with a thermal guidance sensor that would improve accuracy by twenty four percent
i can do that now care to join me you can make sure the adjustments perform to your specifications
if you dont mind id like to test some of the other firearms
go right ahead this way
kovin took me to a small laboratory
describe it
it was poorly illuminated i saw various instruments technology unfamiliar to me i assumed this was where he developed new weapon designs
this weapon is thoron based
most of these handheld disrupters are
thoron can be unstable in weapons
not if you polarise the emitter matrix that compensates for any instabilities watch
what are you doing
he turned the weapon on me
he fired
yes i remember it now
what happened next
im not sure
concentrate see the laboratory in your mind
there was a light in my eyes
was kovin still in the room with you
yes
restrain her quickly
and another entharan was assisting him
this is borg technology
thats what ive been telling you
let me go
they bound me to an examination table
what did they do to you did they scan you
the bioablation pump is engaged and pressurised
the growth medium is activating the implants the nanoprobes are multiplying
they put a device near my head
they removed my ocular implant
then some of the implants in my arm were activated
which ones can you be more specific
use the maximum setting of the metagenic pulse to stimulate the implants
the assimilation tubules are ready
prepare to harvest the nanoprobes
they extracted nanoprobes through my assimilation tubules i was powerless unable to stop them
you couldnt be expected to you were restrained then what happened
they took the nanoprobes to another subject also restrained then they they assimilated him
well done
the next thing i remember i was back in kovins lab he claimed the particle beam rifle overloaded that it had burned my hand but it was a lie they had attacked me
im sorry i should have been more careful
do you have a dermal regenerator
of course
ill inform the captain
theres no doubt that seven was the victim of a brutal assault
how is she
as well as can be expected shes regenerating in her alcove i predict her emotional recovery will take some time i certainly hope you intend to hold kovin responsible for what hes done
first i want to know how much of her story we can corroborate tom you were with her on the planet how long was she alone with kovin
at least two hours
and when she came back did she say anything about what happened
only that theyd finished their work on the rifle she seemed fine
clearly mister kovin used some artificial means to suppress her memory of the event that would explain the unusual engrammatic activity i found in her neurological scans
did you find any other physical evidence of the medical procedures she described
no i suspect mister kovin used sevens own nanoprobes to repair any cellular damage she distinctly remembers kovin extracting them
you seem to be accepting sevens recovered memories as fact
are you suggesting otherwise
historically recovered memories have often proven unreliable
yes in cases where a traumatic experience has been repressed for years but were dealing with a very recent memory here that was blocked by artificial means when i removed that mechanism seven remembered everything that happened
human memory is rarely perfect
what are you saying tuvok that seven is making this up
no but we must remember that shes experienced hallucinatory images before
that was in direct response to a signal from the ship where she was assimilated shes not having hallucinations now shes remembering what happened to her ive confirmed this by analysing the specific engrammatic activity in her hippocampus were not talking about conjecture were talking about science
lets not get bogged down sevens made serious accusations and i wont dismiss them if kovin assaulted her took a sample of her borg technology we cant stand by and do nothing in the wrong hands a single nanoprobe could lead to disaster doctor i want you to keep searching for any physical evidence to back up sevens claim i will talk to kovin dismissed
this is offensive and absurd shes obviously lying
why would she do that
maybe you can answer that shes your crewmember first she attacks me then she invents these ridiculous stories and you try to place the blame on me is this some kind of negotiating tactic
i have no hidden agenda im simply trying to clarify what happened
i told you already we went to my laboratory to adjust the guidance system on the particle beam rifle
and that took two hours
she insisted absolute precision
weve confirmed that seven was exposed to an intense thoron discharge
she was after the rifles power cell overloaded we reported the accident immediately
she now remembers that you fired the weapon at her deliberately
thats preposterous
the doctor now tells me the blast could have been enough to render her unconscious
but it didnt we were both startled for a moment and after i apologised for the accident she asked if i had a dermal regenerator which i did and i used on her arm the one with the mechanical implants
which you recognised as borg
i was aware shed been a borg she told me herself
did you ever express curiosity in that technology or try to examine it more closely
no
you never considered the potential value it might have as a weapon
is that what you think ive done
you may not realise how dangerous borg technology can be if youve taken even a single nanoprobe i need to know about it right now
i havent taken anything
id like to examine your laboratory to be absolutely sure
no this has already gone too far
then ill have to contact the authorities maybe theyll be more helpful
are you willing to risk our trade agreement all on the basis of one crew members delusions
yes now are you going to cooperate with our investigation
i dont seem to have much choice
you stated that the rifles power cell overloaded as a result of a faulty oscillator adjustment
thats right
can you describe in more detail how that occurred
i was showing her how to polarise the emitter matrix i must have tuned the induction frequency too high
were you unfamiliar with that procedure
no i have done it a hundred times it was a careless mistake how many times do i need to apologise
i am not seeking a statement of remorse
then what do you want are you trying to catch me in a lie trick me into confessing you cant because theres nothing for me to confess i havent done anything wrong
one of our crew members claims that you have
your crewmember seven of nine shes very fortunate
how so
she has an entire crew leaping to her defence i have no one
the entharan representative will be here shortly
you mean the magistrate he wont help me hes more interested in protecting diplomatic relations with people like you
surely hell want to know the truth thats all were seeking
you dont understand on my world we depend on trade with alien species there are strict protocols about those relationships even being accused of violating them is a serious offence
you will have the opportunity to refute any charges
it wont matter once theyre made the damage is done i wont be trusted any longer ill be ruined please i never hurt your crew member dont do this
im afraid i have no choice but i assure you our investigation will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner
you strike me as a man of your word if you tell me i wont be prejudged then i believe you
how are you feeling
i am undamaged
but how do you feel seven your physical scars have healed but the psychological effects are still there youll have to deal with them
for what purpose
in order to heal kovin attacked you violated your rights as an individual its important that you recognise that so you can understand any hostility or resentment you might be feeling
resentment is a human trait it has no structure no function i want no part of it
youre going to have to begin accepting the fact that your human feelings exist and that suppressing them can damage you
if i am not aware of these feelings how can i express them
let me ask you this what would have happened if kovin had tried to take borg technology directly from the collective
he would have been assimilated
precisely which is why he chose you he could get what he wanted without running any risks
it was my individuality which made me vulnerable
exactly he violated that individuality what he did is an affront to everything you are borg and human
it was the act of a coward
yes someone who was willing to use you in the cruellest way so that he could create new weapons and sell them
i believe im beginning to experience anger anger toward kovin
good thats a perfectly healthy normal response and when kovin gets what he deserves youre going to feel much better
right this way magistrate my laboratory
there are no examination tables
i told you just work benches
is this the entire facility
yes
we should scan for signs that the room may have been altered recently during her regression seven described instruments similar to these
of course she did she was here
she said a device like this was used to remove her optic implant
thats a microcalliper i used it to remove the casing over the guidance system on the particle beam rifle
and isnt this an electrodynamic probe
yes
hmm its equipped with a monofilament stimulator could it be used to manipulate the neurotransmitter levels in a human brain
not as it is
but with the proper modifications
with the proper modifications i could reconfigure your comm badge to manipulate neurotransmitters whats your point
i believe youve just made it there is cellular residue on many of these instruments it matches sevens genome with your permission sir id like to take these tools back to voyager where i can run more conclusive scans
take whatever you need
doctor there are a number of borg nanoprobes on the surface of this table
ill just collect a sample hmm
thats where her arm was hit when the rifle overloaded
the dispersal pattern is consistent with a dermal rupture
these nanoprobes were recently regenerated if this were nothing more than cellular residue from sevens injury the nanoprobes would be dormant but these have been activated in a very specific pattern
ive seen enough kovin there is sufficient evidence here to detain you pending official proceedings
no please no
stay where you are
kovin dont
i trusted you you said it would be an impartial investigation but youre all determined to find what you want to find well im not going to let this happen
tuvok to voyager
janeway here
mister kovin has transported out of the laboratory
can you track his present position
stand by
im picking up a transporter signature three hundred kilometres above the surface
captain theres a ship powering its engines at those coordinates
magistrate do you want us to follow him
yes but id like to join you
very well well beam you to voyager stand by
kovins ship is on a heading of one eight mark two five
set an intercept course get ready to lock on a tractor beam
hes only at half impulse his ship may not have warp engines
were at nine thousand kilometres and closing
im engaging the tractor beam
i cant find him all of my sensor readings have disappeared
he generated a photonic pulse it took them offline well have to reinitialise the entire sensor array
do it our investigation has suddenly turned into a manhunt
the fact that hes running shows that hes got something to hide until we find out what that is we cant risk letting him go
this isnt getting us anywhere sevens cellular residue is on everyone of these but that would be true if she simply handled them
my examination of the rifle is equally inconclusive it may have overloaded accidentally or not
im getting a bad feeling about this tuvok we arent finding anything that implicates kovin
i told him our investigation would be impartial i believe it has been
it has but ill admit i had some preconceptions about him they may have influenced my judgment the strongest evidence so far is the batch of nanoprobes the doctor found the fact that they were regenerated suggests that kovin was experimenting with them
we dont know a great deal about the interaction between nanoprobes and borg physiology it might be worthwhile to simulate the effect of the rifle blast on sevens arm and see what happens to the nanoprobes
good maybe thatll give us some answers
is this really necessary captain shes suffered enough trauma already
we dont want to make accusations against an innocent man we have to do everything we can to find some concrete evidence
hes not an innocent man i know what he did to me
but we must have proof and this experiment may provide us with it weve configured this hypospray to simulate the energy of a thoron blast well collect thin layers of your skin tissue and examine the effects it wont be painful
im not afraid i am angry
i know try to be patient we may have some answers soon
all right lets see what weve got
i think youd better take a look
what do you see
the nanoprobes are regenerating in exactly the same pattern we saw in kovins laboratory it appears to be a spontaneous response which could have been caused by the energy released from the thoron weapon
it doesnt matter kovin is guilty
seven theres no doubt in my mind that you believe what youre saying but is it possible just possible that the memories you and the doctor recovered arent accurate
how could that be
during your time with the borg you were subjected to invasive medical procedures you undoubtedly witnessed other victims being assimilated could that be what youre remembering
you know thats not right tell them
everything led me to believe that you were a victim your extreme response to kovin in engineering your irrational fear when i was examining you something prompted that behaviour and i believed it was a repressed memory of your ordeal with kovin
that is what it was
but if im to be impartial i have to acknowledge that your neurology is still something of a mystery to me i cant be certain what triggered those memories and we cant ignore the fact that this evidence supports kovins story and not yours
you were the one who helped me to understand what happened and now youre denying it
seven no ones abandoning you but we have to do whats right we have to find kovin and tell him what weve learned
the doctor told me i would feel better when kovin gets what he deserves i want him to be punished i wont settle for anything less
mister paris
hes in range
visual hail him
no response hes charging weapons
open a channel all frequencies mister kovin this is captain janeway we believe weve made a mistake in accusing you we only want to correct the situation stand down your weapons
hes responding
stop your pursuit i can damage your ship
were not here to take you by force
then let me go
kovin listen to me the proceedings must be resolved
this is a trap
no weve discovered information that supports your story
i dont believe you
weve reexamined the evidence finding the nanoprobes led us to the wrong conclusion we know now that your thoron rifle did overload please
hes firing a spread of photon pulses
shields down to eighty two percent
back off give him some breathing room
hes coming about heading right for us
direct hit to the power grid
innocent or not hes going to destroy your vessel
captain
hes come under enough fire from us already harry try to beam him off his ship
hes thrown up a scattering field i cant get a lock
keep trying
shields are down
hes shunting all power to his photonic emitters
we must protect ourselves disable his ship
no evasive manoeuvres hard to port full thrusters
aye
ive almost got a lock on him a few more seconds
hes charging weapons again captain his emitters are overloading all his systems are destabilising
open a channel kovin shut down your scattering field let us beam you aboard kovin
hes firing
harry
i cant find anything to lock onto captain
theres nothing more we could have done
stand down red alert mister paris set a course back to the entharan colony
doctor
yes
im here for my weekly maintenance
oh of course this way please
metabolic rate is stable electrooptic implant is aligned your blood pressure is slightly off but within tolerance youre in perfect health see you next week
i do not feel perfect
what do you mean
i am preoccupied by kovins death
join the club its all i can think about
as a borg i was responsible for the destruction of countless millions and i felt nothing but now i regret the destruction of this single being
its called remorse seven it comes into play when you make a mistake and you feel guilt about what youve done another new emotion for you to experience
i do not enjoy this remorse any more than i enjoyed anger will the feeling subside
yes but not quickly
i would rather not have to wait
im afraid you dont have much choice
but maybe i do
ive isolated the algorithms responsible for my desire to expand beyond my original programming i want to delete them
why
it was my urge to experiment my infatuation with improving myself that led to this tragedy i fancied myself a psychologist a ships counsellor but i wasnt prepared for the complexities that come with such a responsibility in my enthusiasm to help seven of nine i lost my medical objectivity i became a selfrighteous advocate i didnt stop to think for one second that i might be wrong that mustnt happen again
you want to go back to the state you were in when we first activated you
ill still be capable of treating any and all medical conditions but without the risk of overstepping my bounds its for the best captain
oh im not so sure this crew has benefited greatly from your improvements over the years request denied
captain
i wont turn back the clock because of one mistake no matter how serious and no matter how you might feel
im a physician im supposed to preserve life not destroy it i cant live with the thought that i might do it again
with any luck that knowledge will prevent it from happening again we all rallied around seven doctor myself included i wanted her to know she was part of this family that we would support her fight for her no matter what we let our good intentions blind us we all bear responsibility for kovins death and we all have to live with it but to delete that burden would be the last thing any of us should do
ptahk prepare to meet your ancestors
this battle is yours today but the house of mokai will never yield
dohcha scree move away coward i want to make this kill
you should have killed me when my back was turned
i want to see the fear in your eyes
look closely and youll see your own destruction
you are resilient prey
im no ones prey
you are mine now and after death sickbay this is holodeck two janeway requires medical assistance
shell survive
what about her neural interface
stable
are you sure there were times when she seemed aware of who she is
impossible i was monitoring the crew during the entire simulation she believes shes whoever we programme her to be shall i return her to the klingon simulation
no bring her to holodeck one ive found another programme i want to try a conflict that took place on her own planet it should prove stimulating
wrong would it be wrong to kiss seeing i feel like this would it be wrong to try wrong would it be wrong to stay here in your arms this way under this starry sky if it is wrong
welcome to le coeur de lion im katrine the first round is with my compliments on one condition you leave the war outside more escargot for table nine jacques no lady tonight oh well have to see what we can do about that
forgive my neglecting you now where were we ah yes my latest adventure in paris
im afraid ill have to neglect you again excuse me
thats him
our new kommandant
british intelligence believes hes been sent here to oversee the occupation of the city
whats his history
he served with rommel in north africa and schmidt in poland he is a formidable military strategist notorious for his cruelty
ah lets make him feel at home send him a bottle of chateau latour my compliments
the 29
i hate to waste good wine give him the 36
as you wish
and i have waited so long it must be right it cant be wrong
merci be generous to claude this evening without him my voice is empty good evening
sing
tonights performance is over return tomorrow
now
remove your hand
obey me or i will hunt you down and your bones will adorn the bulkhead of my ship
sit down and play the game in this setting we have no ships we are an ancient race of soldiers intent upon conquering this world play the game
now now whats this mademoiselle leneuf will be happy to sing another song just give her a few minutes to freshen up
its late
freshen up
very well
kommandant karr
you know me
your reputation precedes you im katrine le coeur de lion is my establishment the first round is with my compliments on one condition you leave the war outside
i wish to speak with her alone
charming gentleman
he is disoriented your world is unfamiliar to him
hell be comfortable soon enough the arms of france are open to all
ive heard otherwise
what do you mean
i understand there is opposition to our presence here among your citizens
the resistance in paris perhaps but this is a small city defenceless weve learned to be a little more diplomatic when this war is over we want to remain on good terms with the victor
whoever that may be
whoever that may be
your city may be defenceless but its crucial to the war any ground assault into germany must pass through this province the resistance will come here
if they do ill tell them what i tell everyone leave the war outside
excellent
kommandant ive been informed theres a problem in the engineering section the warp plasma network has become unstable
whats he talking about
it need not concern you to the hunt
the hunt
for the resistance i shall take great pleasure in tracking them down and making the kill
au revoir
howd we do
insufficient for a saturday night twelve hundred forty seven francs and eighty one reichmarks
well it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the range of our radio first thing tomorrow morning i want you to take a little trip to the countryside theres a monsieur groleau who has a cottage just past the third bridge hes got a wine cellar full of vacuum tubes tell him we need a high frequency oscillator offer him three hundred francs but dont go any higher than five hundred
we have more pressing needs
such as
explosives we need a launcher that can fire armour piercing grenades
planning on blowing up a german tank
if necessary
were not trying to build an army here
thenmaybe its time we did three more german battalions have occupied the city and a panzer division is holding position eleven kilometres away when the americans arrive and the fighting begins i dont intend to be standing next to a piano singing moonlight becomes you
the americans wont even be able to approach this city without our help and if they cant liberate sainte claire the assault into germany could fail we need to be gathering information about german troop movements and relaying it to allied command
im tired of lighting the nazis cigarettes and laughing at their jokes we should be helping the allies by assassinating these pigs
the moment we start shooting we expose ourselves right now no one suspects us and i am not about to risk our entire operation because youve suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger
that is your opinion madame
im the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion is the only one that counts so get the oscillator i think were all feeling the strain its been a hard four years but believe me the third reich is feeling it too we just have to hang on a little while longer word from the americans is going to come any day
perhaps
again
again why is she so adamant what shes proposing would put us all at risk
maybe thats her intention
if you have suspicions my old friend lets hear them
from the beginning shes been argumentative and on more than a few occasions shes disobeyed your direct orders
shes headstrong typical of the underground
nevertheless her behaviour has threatened our identities
shes the only munitions expert we have and she can carry a tune we need her lets keep our eye on her have her followed for the next few days if she is a nazi infiltrator well have to eliminate her
bonjour madame
bonjour
put it on my account guten tag
you halt
get off your vehicle what are you transporting
nothing but the very essentials of life
proceed to your destination
that i will that i most certainly will
if the choice were mine you would already be dead
more report rain its currently fifty nine degrees in dover with low fog across the channel temperatures are expected to range from a low of forty five degrees to
damn im missing it
our most recent intelligence shows two german divisions here and here
how recent is this intelligence
forty eight hours
old news
im reginald smith and youre listening to the british radio network this report will repeat in
forty five seconds
forty five seconds
heres to english precision
were closed
morning delivery
youre late what happened
oh just a t�teàt�te with a member of the master race
thats the second time this week sounds like theyre increasing their patrols
perhaps its time we chose another courier our baker is arousing suspicion
theres no need to worry i change my route every day and ive become quite friendly with most of the gestapo they just love my strudel
a kind thank you to jazzy mcnulty and his band now the weather for today september the twenty second nineteen forty four in london skies are grey with a strong chance of afternoon rain temperatures will range from a low of fifty two degrees to a high of seventy one the northern coast reports heavy rain and strong windsocean swells reaching four feet devonshire hertfordshire and summershire all report rain its currently fifty nine degrees in dover with low fog across the channel temperatures are expected to range from a low of forty five degrees to a high of sixty three i am reginald smith and you are listening
got it lets see the code key
every fifth letter every third vowel use the sunday decryption sequence a h c straight from allied high command
it must be important
all messages regarding the war are important its only a matter of degree
i suppose youre right but do you have to be so logical about everything
in any covert battle logic is a potent weapon you might try it sometime
american fourth infantry to invade sainte claire tuesday dawn
thats two days from now
require assistance disable enemy communications end message
the german radio transmitter is housed at their headquarters
that building is surrounded by guards we cant just waltz in there and plant a bomb
maybe i can help
how
im upset i need to see my special friend even if it means bothering him at the office
a reconnaissance mission
ill try to locate the radio see where the guards are posted examine the locks gather enough information to get us inside
its too dangerous if youre caught youll be tortured for information
you dont know my friend he would never do anything to harm his own child
encode a response to allied command confirm that weve received their message tell them were proceeding according to plan
was es ist fräulein
ich muß mit ihrem hauptmann sprechen
kommen hier
ever since my days at the university ive admired this painting and now its mine our fellow officers might prefer gold or land but for me the greatest prize of war is art
trophies of the hunt but was the hunt fair
sir
we entered this city with superior firepower against a weakened prey do you really deserve these prizes
we are german the german people deserve europe and everything in it
why
sir you question our destiny
of course not but i want to hear it in your own words tell me why are we the master race
our blood is pure our people lived and hunted on this land for a thousand years before the degenerate races brought their corruption europe must be purified
you yourself are you stronger than these degenerate races more cunning
yes of course
and if you were alone without an army supporting you would you continue the hunt if your prey were armed instead of defenceless what then
i colonel i i dont know what youre trying
you are superior to no one never underestimate your prey or disrespect its abilities if you do you will become the hunted when the opposing army invades this city remember my words
enter
brigitte
im sorry i know im not supposed to come here dont blame him i told him that i was ill and i had to see you
i will leave you two alone
heil hitler
its all right the colonel is in a strange mood today
whats wrong is it our child
i dont know i was dizzy
ill call the doctor
no i feel better now maybe i just needed to see you why havent you shown me this place before
i didnt want your neighbours to see you coming here they make it difficult enough knowing were together
i dont care what they think its beautiful
praxiteles master sculptor of ancient greece there are only three like this in all of europe
so many wonderful things
the kommandant would have us continue this simulation until we rot its pointless we should begin the hunt he believes we must learn more about our prey but i have learned enough ready your weapon avoid the cranium
this way
but the message
theres no time
computer exit holodeck well take them to the medical bay
this neural interface has been damaged
thats because it took a direct hit when one of your bullets grazed the base of her skull
ill provide you with another install it
not until ive repaired her injuries
how long
she has two fractured vertebrae and a punctured lung another hour at least
him
ive stabilised his vital systems but he still has bullet fragments lodged in his shoulder
i will treat him
this time you might do a better job repairing the muscle lacerations the last crewmember you treated was brought back in with internal bleeding
your crew is fragile they fall too easily
what do you expect theyve been stabbed shot beaten phasered and batlethed over the past three weeks their bodies werent designed for this kind of punishment
what happened
these prey were hunted by turanj their injuries are severe
you assured me that your people would avoid causing serious head injuries another centimetre and the bullet would have penetrated her brain if you cant keep your people under control then you should put an end to this blood sport
the simulations will continue
at least activate the holodeck safety protocols
no
itll prevent lifethreatening injuries for your people as well
it will also eliminate the challenge
i have had twenty eight wounded and one fatality in the past twelve hours even i cant keep up with that level of triage
you will keep up or they will die their lives are in your hands doctor dont fail them when that one is ready place him in holodeck two lets see how he fares with the klingons
what about her
send her back to holodeck one i like her voice
progress
by cutting through the bulkheads on decks four five and six weve been able to expand both holodeck grids by five thousand square metres
more
i cant give you any more not without compromising voyagers primary systems
then compromise them
look holodecks require a tremendous amount of energy ive already rerouted power from all nonessential systems anything more and well start losing propulsion deflectors even life support
ill transfer a supply of power nodules from my vessel integrate them into your systems i want to expand the holoprojectors into all surrounding sections replicate enough emitters for the task
yes sir
the holoemitters in this corridor are stable lets start working on section nineteen  but first tell the guard to escort you to engineering that we need more equipment specifically a type three isolinear emitter if he gives you any trouble say i cant complete the assignment without it
we need an isolinear emitter from engineering
ensign how did i get here
i transferred you here using the new emitters in this section
i assume youve got a plan
half a plan
lets hear it
before we can retake the ship weve got to get the crew back that means disabling the neural interfaces
easier said than done the great hunters are everywhere you turn
dont worry i think ive found a way to tap into the sickbay diagnostic console the only catch is
standby with the emitter im almost done here
the catch ensign
somebodys got to be inside the holodeck to engage the bridge control relays
were shorthanded
i know
well weve got a borg on board dont we maybe we can put her to good use
ive been studying voyagers database looking for our next simulation there are many to choose from these people have a violent history i believe ive found a worthy prey the borg when world war two is over we will recreate a notorious battle known as wolf 359
i look forward to it
i thought you might but if you continue to disobey me this is one hunt you will never see you nearly destroyed two of my favourite prey you were careless
ive become impatient we penetrated this vessel overcame their defences and in the moment of the kill you forced us to stop now we play these incessant games its time we took our trophies and moved on
your lust for the kill has blinded you like many young hunters if you took the time to study your prey to understand its behaviour you might learn something
there is nothing to be learned
youre wrong each prey exposes us to another way of life and makes us reevaluate our own have you considered our future what would become of us when we have hunted this territory to exhaustion
we will travel to another part of space search for new prey as we have always done
a way of life that hasnt changed for a thousand years
why should it
species that dont change die weve lost our way weve allowed our predatory instincts to dominate us we disperse ourselves throughout the quadrant sending ships in all directions weve become a solitary race isolated weve spread ourselves too thin were no longer a culture we have no identity in another thousand years no one will remember the name hirogen our people must come back together combine forces rebuild our civilisation
what of the hunt
the hunt will always continue but in a new way i intend to transform this ship into a vast simulation populated with a varied and endless supply of prey in time this technology can be duplicated for other hirogen these holodecks will allow us to hold onto our past while we face the future
even if i were persuaded others wouldnt be
then you are with me i must continue my research ill see you tomorrow on holodeck one the americans are due to invade
remain calm and stay quiet theres a hirogen working in the biolab he might hear us whats the last thing you remember
an attack hirogen vessels they breached our hull and boarded the ship i was in a phaser fight on deck three i was struck several times thats all i remember
then you have no memory of the simulations in the holodeck
none
the neural interface must be circumventing your memory centres
neural interface
its a subdermal transmitter that links your neocortex to the holodeck in essence it makes you believe youre a character within the programme
why am i in sickbay
you were wounded in a simulation its my job to patch you all up and send you back in half the crew is under lock and key the rest are fighting for their lives on the holodeck this has been going on for nineteen days dozens of battle scenarios one more brutal than the last you should see what a mess you were after the crusades
will i be sent into another simulation
yes but this time with an advantage i have found a way to disable the interface by remodulating one of your borg implants to emit a jamming signal once the hirogen have brought you back to the holodeck the jamming signal will activate within seconds
my objective
you mind a control panel inside the holodeck and engage the bridge access relays that will enable ensign kim and me to deactivate all the neural interfaces after captain janeway and the crew regain awareness you can work with them to mount a resistance against the hirogen
what simulation will i be entering
world war two a twentieth century earth conflict do you know anything about it
nothing
that could be a problem once the interface is disabled you wont remember anything about your role in the simulation think of it as a new social setting do your best to fit in
this is the last neural interface when youve finished with her youll help me replicate more
i have to sedate you now
that old black magic has me in its spell that old black magic that you weave so well those icy fingers up and down my spine the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet
i must discontinue this activity i am not well
if the entertainment is over ill be going
stay right there kommandant im sure shes fine let me talk to her
whats wrong
i require a glass of water
make it a quick one i promised the kommandant youd be singing till midnight i want to get a lot of information out of him tonight
i am ill
look i dont care if youre dying get back out there
i wont
maybe youre right about her
the evidence is increasing she was present today when our courier was shot down in the street yet somehow she was unharmed and now on the eve of our liberation she becomes uncooperative
leave this to me
captain
at ease whats the word
there is no word at least not from the resistance in sainte claire
then we wont get any support from inside the city
you may be underestimating the good citizens of sainte claire i spent a summer there when i was eighteen
let me guess you ate a few snails fell in love with a local girl and became an expert on the city
ah well yeah pretty much like that
i see
but believe me captain those people love their town theyll fight for it and die for it dont count them out yet
all right but i wont count them in either we continue as planned an assault from the north at first light so who was the mademoiselle
her name was brigitte great gams one hell of a temper
sounds like your kind of girl
august 29 1936 1217 pm thats when my train pulled out of sainte claire thats the last time i saw her we wrote to each other every week for three years then the war broke out and i never heard from her again
sainte claires not a big place she shouldnt be too hard to find
im counting on it
youll maintain position here twenty metres from the front doors arm yourself with a submachine gun and watch for any sign of trouble
understood
now weve observed a twenty second break in the guard rotation at four fifteen am that should you and me enough time to enter the building through the storm window on the eastern wall
when i was there yesterday i saw guards posted at all three stairways youll have to reach the second floor through the elevator shaft the command post is in the main gallery at the end of the hall
once inside we plant the charges blow the transmitter youll remain here if something goes wrong and were caught destroy all evidence of the underground our contact list decryption codes everything
right
we leave in one hour
this wont make much of a bang you forgot to connect the detonator
i will correct the error
its lucky i found your little error it might have undermined our mission are you having second thoughts about tonight
no
good because i dont want any more mistakes
there wont be any
lets hope not
weve got to stop meeting like this
i managed to grab a quick scan of holodeck one and it looks like seven of nine is on the move are you ready in sickbay
my hirogen taskmaster is working in the biolab ill have access to the medical console for another twenty minutes at least
thatll give me enough time to get to the bridge
good afternoon
what are you doing in here
trying to get the replicator system back online unless you prefer the emergency rations personally im getting tired of synthetic protein youre supposed to be the finest hunters in the quadrant why dont you find us something a little more tasty is something wrong
an unauthorised transmission was sent from this room
what kind of transmission
i dont know maybe you can tell me
well i was trying to reroute power from the main computer to the replicators of course i must have tripped a communications subroutine sorry about that didnt mean to worry you your people have damaged just about every system on this vessel accidents are bound to happen now if you dont mind im due on the bridge
show it to me
what
i want to see this subroutine show me what you were doing when the accident occurred
forget it i dont have time
do as i say
all right but youd better call the bridge tell your superior im going to be late that im working under your orders now not his go ahead make the call i dont want to take the blame for this
report to the bridge
thanks
set the charges herehere and there this looks like a message from one of their reconnaissance teams
these must be instructions for troop deployments the germans must be taking up new positions outside the city it looks like theyre mobilising more troops than our sources originally expected
theyre moving armoured units into the valley they must know the americans are coming weve got to warn them somehow what are you doing you havent set the charges what is that
i believe it is a transmitter im attempting to disable it
youre sending a message to the nazis
no
step away or ill kill you
what are you doing
er nothing just running a diagnostic
youve accessed the neural interface controls stop it immediately
i told you no more mistakes youve just made your last one
ow seven
captain
listen a targ just beyond that ridge
you would hunt down a simple beast even in the midst of our enemies
there is no enemy as great as hunger
why am i being interrupted
the holographic doctor hes disabled their captains interface
how
i dont know but i cant reestablish the link
send a team
to holodeck one remove her from the simulation
hirogen hunters
internal scans show thirteen of them on this holodeck
need a hand buddy captain miller fifth armoured infantry
welcome to sainte claire
get me artillery unit charlie one take up positions along this street and start laying down fire
the americans have arrived
you circumvented our control how
go to hell
bobby
you owe me a postcard
distance eight hundred yards correct for crosswinds fire at will take cover boys charlie one isnt known for accuracy
i cant access the ships systems didnt you say this was nazi headquarters
i did
then it would stand to reason this building is being targeted lets get out of here
what happened
there was a simulated explosion on holodeck one somehow it blew out the hologrid across three decks
is the programme still running
yes
what is it
it looks like a bunker
all units listen up weve just blown the lid off of some kind of secret nazi compound converge on my position were going in
the breach opened the simulation into the surrounding sections im picking up holographic soldiers moving into deck five
shut down the holoemitters until we can regain control
i cant the programme controls are offline you wanted a war looks like youve got one
move out
looks like the hirogen have been busy this entire section has been equipped with holoemitters lets get to astrometrics
there are eighty five hirogen on board concentrated on decks two through nine
what about the bridge
four hirogen and ensign kim
at least hes alive the neural interfaces you said theyre controlled through sickbay
yes theres only one hirogen in sickbay with the doctor but the corridors outside are heavily guarded
thats our first objective disable the interfaces but well need help
we did have allies in the world war two simulation the french resistance
its time we mount a resistance of our own
the battle was concentrated here on holodeck one but the fighting has spilled out onto decks five and six and it looks like a group of holographic americans is invading deck seven
show me the breach in the hologrid
ive lost the visual link it was the last active circuit connecting the bridge to the holodecks theres only one way to stop this i need to go to engineering and initiate a power surge across the holoemitter network itll blow out the entire system
no that would destroy both the holodecks
look simulation or not if this battle keeps going we could all be killed
i want that technology preserved
commander
status
i was able to reach deck five but holographic forces are massing near the breach if im to get into the holodeck ill need help
take the hunters from the klingon simulation
when i find captain janeway should i kill her
no bring her to me
this is no longer a game this hunt is real we should kill the prey
the voyager crew must remain alive to make repairs or we could lose everything this vessel its technology you said that you understood the importance of what were doing here
ill get the hunters
we think its a secret compound the nazis built after they took over the city what i dont understand is how they managed to camouflage it so well
indeed weve been scrutinising german troop movements since the occupation we knew nothing of this installation
dont sweat it our recon planes missed it too any idea what theyre hiding in there captain
we saw all sorts of scientific equipment strange metals instruments we cant identify ive relayed the findings to military intelligence they believe this could be an advanced munitions laboratory designed to build some kind of superweapon
weve got to put it out of business
ive already sent three squads in but the nazis are putting up one hell of a fight ive requested additional troops lieutenant this restaurant will serve as our command post set up the transmitter and post guards around the perimeter
yes sir
youve done a bangup job but well take it from here tell your people to lie low and that the americans said thanks
this is our city we have no intention of lying low
listen honey the time for sneaking messages back and forth is over this is war and you arent soldiers
hes right we have weapons hidden throughout the city brigitte will tell you where they are
sounds good lieutenant take care of it
i can see you havent changed
bring me one of those street maps most of the guns we stole from the german army the explosives we bought on the black market
we could use both
our biggest stockpile is buried here two metres below the last row of seats of the cinéma mystère you remember it dont you
hmm im no angel with mae west theres heavy fighting in that area whats the best way in
we dug a tunnel that leads directly to the stockpile here ill show you incidentally we saw death takes a holiday
it was the mae west movie im sure of it she was singing sister honky tonk and i put my arm around you and during the courtroom scene i kissed you
you know i think youre right
i guess the experience wasnt exactly burned into your memory
not the movie but i do remember the kiss
so did you get my last letter
you mean the one asking me to leave france
germany was about to invade i thought youd be safer back in the states with me but i guess you found someone else to take care of you
theres never been anybody else
then who
hes second in command of the sainte claire occupation the first time he saw me he said i was pretty i took advantage of his interest he doesnt know im in the resistance the child is his
im sorry
so am i
hold your fire
katrine you survived
are you surprised
very nazi headquarters was destroyed we assumed you were killed in the explosion
what is that some kind of an escape tunnel
thats precisely what it is
youre the leader of the local resistance
thats right
captain miller fifth armoured infantry this is lieutenant davis i take it youve seen the german bunker we uncovered
i just came from there
we suspect its a munitions lab can you confirm that
yes a munitions lab
then this is it were calling in an air strike contact the raf
hold on captain theres an easier way to do this with the minimum of casualties
lets hear it
ive located the generator that powers the entire complex its heavily guarded but with your help i can get close enough to set off some explosives
my orders are to blow the entire compound before the germans send in reinforcements
i saw technology in there you cant begin to imagine warheads powerful enough to destroy this entire valley if theyre accidentally detonated call for an air strike it may be the last call you make
how can you get close enough
this tunnel ive been watching this compound for several months and ive got a man inside
the place is crawling with krauts
yhats why i need your help if your men can clear these two corridors itll give us access to this entryway get me there and i can take care of the rest
c company whats there status
theyre holding position about two hundred yards from here
get them on the horn youll lead us into the compound but im coming with you
i work better alone
this isnt a request its an order
order do i look like im wearing one of your uniforms i go alone
i thought you needed our help ill be right behind you
even if i manage to disrupt the neural interfaces weve still got a war to fight were going to need something a lot more effective than these old firearms
i believe i can enhance these weapons using borg technology but ill have to access cargo bay two
if something goes wrong and i dont succeed youll be the only one left who knows whats really going on
understood
have our suspicions been confirmed
suspicions
is she a collaborator
i think we can trust her
are you certain three hours ago you were prepared to put a bullet in her head
shes on our side
in your absence i may be forced to make that determination for myself
ive already made it youre not to harm her is that understood
german forces are advancing on our position
lets give them a warm welcome mademoiselle after you
punctured lung arterial rupture fracture of the thirteenth vertebra he needs surgery
first and second degree burns to the face and neck treat him
his injuries are minor he can wait
i said treat him
this man has massive internal injuries if i dont operate now hell die
treat the burns or ill deactivate your programme
what kind of physician are you the first rule of triage states that the critical injuries take priority
youre rules not mine
from now on leave the wounded prey where they fall tend only to our own
im as dry as the crater at tarpahk in the middle of the dry season when its dry
no im not done
share with your brothers its the eve of battle i may be drunk but i can still send your soul to the next world and leave your body here to rot though from the stench of it id say its begun to already
tom
wrong guy you speak english
yeah i speak english
american
i didnt see him coming you saved my life
why are you out of uniform what company are you with
well er im a civilian
in the middle of a battle zone in france the hell you are
go one im right behind you look i dont have time for twenty questions you say youre an american all right then if betty grable came around that corner what part of her would you be staring at sorry times up
her legs id be staring at her legs
bullseye lucky for you
youre a gungho kind of gal arent ya
does that bother you
nope just not used to it thats all the girls back home are a little different
i guess when it comes to my peoples safety this girl tends to get a little gungho
nothing to apologise for im the same way with my men theres not a day goes by when i dont think to myself im going to get em back safely even if i die trying
i know the feeling were about to enter some caves that run under the town
caves
were going to meet our contact there i should warn you there are eccentric people who live in the caves but dont be alarmed
good evening gentlemen
who are you how did you get past our battle lines
were friends allies
sent by what house
the house of ktohmaag
ktohmaag i never heard of it
im not surprised its a long way from here
this battle doesnt concern you
maybe not but wed be honoured to fight alongside such great warriors if you prefer well take our weapons elsewhere
wait ill consider your request but first prove your fortitude drink sanroh tpatoh cha
i guess my french is a little rusty
dont drink it its twice as strong as whisky ill be right back
prove your fortitude warrior drink
captain is is it you
yes weve got to disable the rest of those interfaces
the controls are routed through the surgical console in sickbay but it will take time to disable all of them
we dont have time ill access the jefferies tube that runs under that deck plate set a few charges and blow out the console
charges the hirogen have seized the armoury
no problem ive got all the ammo i need right here
holographic explosives
with the safety protocols offline theyre as good as the real thing
another of your warriors
yes
hes a frail looking thing
ill contact you when ive disabled the rest of the interfaces in the meantime stay here
with the klingons
believe me its peaceful compared to sainte claire captain
ha
please dont do that
theyve got us outnumbered
and outgunned theyre setting up a machine gun emplacement across the street
where have you been
obtaining supplies
what is this
german technology taken from their compound i can use them to enhance our weapons
ive cornered several voyager crewmen theyve taken refuge in a guarded building i need three nucleonic charges to penetrate the structure
nucleonic charges could damage the holodeck further use your hand weapons
then ill need more hunters
theyre on the way
damn theres a level nine forcefield around the surgical console well have to go in and shut it down
forcefield
ill explain later set the detonator for five minutes
five hunters have been killed in the last hour you must engage the safety protocols
those protocols arent functioning
then ill need assistance to
stand by
you
get him out of here
there are ten pounds of dynamite under the floor set to blow in less than three minutes move
bridge to sickbay sickbay respond bridge to deck five converge on the sickbay
we are on the holodeck under attack you must
bridge this is holodeck one i have seized the building and i have found another access to this holodeck
seal it how many captives
four their neural interfaces have been disabled i will make the kill
no
they are not prey they are hostages ill need them
as you wish you help me seal this hatch
what do you think a boy or a girl
its a holographic projection
unfortunately its a very good projection i feel twenty kilos heavier it even kicks
i dont recognise this programme
i do hes wearing a nazi uniform were on earth during the second world war
nazi
totalitarian fanatics bent on world conquest the borg of their day no offence
none taken
what are you staring at
get up you deceived me
really
i shouldve seen through your flirtations
if you say so
the thought of you carrying my child disgusts me
youre not the only one
look i dont know what went on between the two of you but its obviously over now
i see youre acquainted do you find her as attractive as i once did ill miss our nights together
pig
put the weapon away now
funny he doesnt seem like your type
doctor trouble
now what
the klingons are starting to wake up from their nap
all right all right hold on
what are you doing
ive established an interface with holodeck one i want to monitor whats going on over there in case the crew needs my help
qapla
uhoh what should we do
not having a cure for klingon hangovers i couldnt tell you
the battle has begun our plan is to penetrate the enemys position cut his forces in half
and a very good plan it is best of luck with it
you will lead us into battle great warrior
maybe ill just watch from here try to offer up some pointers as things develop
stokar lead the attack or die here by my hand
you heard him dont argue with the man run along ill reattach any severed limbs just dont misplace them
you cover our flank
qapla
qapla
tallyho
enter leave her
i see youve done some redecorating
your attempt to retake this vessel was inventive from the day i seized voyager you put up a dauntless fight but your fight is over now youre going to help me shut down these simulations and repair the holodecks
no well destroy this ship before we surrender it
dont threaten me captain ive faced far more intimidating prey than you if this fight continues i promise you i will hunt down and kill every member of your crew
well by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there wont be much of a trophy left will there
perhaps i should kill you and find someone who will cooperate
good luck youll get the same response from all of them
you dont realise whats at stake
i know whats at stake your sick little game
this is not a game
then what is it
im trying to create a future for my people
future
i dont expect you to understand you are prey
you underestimate us
yes perhaps i do
im listening
my people are hunting themselves into extinction your holodeck technology might offer us an alternative a new way of life instead of scattering ourselves across the quadrant in pursuit of prey we could simulate the hunt and give ourselves a chance to rebuild our civilisation
and confine your killing to holograms
with the safety protocols offline the pursuit is just as challenging
oh i understand what youre trying to do but then why have you been torturing us why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation after another
ive been studying your behaviour as i do with all my prey but your holodecks allowed me to go further to explore your culture your history i must admit ive learned a great deal
how so
your people have faced extinction many times but youve always managed to avoid it you seem to recognise the need for change
yes youve got one of those moments running right now on the holodeck we called it world war two
one of your most difficult eras and yet you survived
it wasnt easy
you are a resilient species i admire your cunning
lets end this ill call a ceasefire and we can try to contain the damage i want my ship back but in return i will give you what you need to create the holodeck technology it would be cunning for you to agree
synthetic and undrinkable i am tired of this simulation
mein herr a word with you
and these holograms are becoming annoying as well
what are we waiting for why dont we execute these prisoners
orders from the kommandant
if i may speak freely the kommandant has been acting strangely the past few days hes been questioning german superiority perhaps we shouldnt follow his orders so blindly
you will do as he says as long as i tell you to
i dont know how much longer i can stand being trapped in here
perhaps you would enjoy some entertainment sing
i will not
sing or you will die
then ill die
seven you are a valued member of this crew the logical response would be to grant his request
logic is irrelevant one day the borg will assimilate your species despite your arrogance when that moment arrives remember me
bridge to holodeck one
yes
ive come to an agreement with captain janeway call a ceasefire
what
captain
its true tuvok
our first order of business is to call off the troops i want you to find chakotay
and have him convince his soldiers to pull out of the city
aye captain
turanj
order our hunters to end the fighting
this is madness were winning this battle
our civilisation depends on this agreement
acknowledged you heard him release the captives ill tell the others order all units to withdraw to these positions
i have always thought highly of you
have you
yes but the kommandant is a fool he doesnt understand hes never embraced the fuhrer or his vision one does not cooperate with decadent forms of life one hunts them down and eliminates them the kommandant speaks of civilisation the ancient romans were civilised the jews are civilised but in all its moral decay rome fell to the spears of our ancestors as the jews are falling now look at our destiny  the field of red the purity of german blood the blazing white circle of the sun that sanctified that blood no one can deny us no power on earth or beyond not the christian saviour not the god of the jews we are driven by the very force that gives life to the universe itself we must countermand the kommandants orders stay and fight we must be faithful to who we are
you two follow me
all units clear the valley return to your previous positions were calling a ceasefire repeat cease fire well the word is out
whether it will be acted upon is another question
oh theyll follow orders im their commanding officer remember
keep it moving keep it moving get the lead out of your pants
midtwentieth century american slang
you got a problem with that sister
youre enjoying this simulation i find that peculiar given the circumstances
loosen up baby doll the wars almost over
so much for the ceasefire
fire fire
ive been monitoring the other simulation and the fightings getting worse the crew is taking heavy casualties
how can we help
ill transfer my programme to holodeck one you take the jefferies tube and meet me there
theres only the two of us
nevertheless we have to try and even half drunk klingons are among the best warriors in the galaxy
but theyre already in the middle of a war with the house of whatever it is
then youll just have to convince them that theres a more important battle to be waged
me
you are their great warrior lead them
pardon me gentlemen i wonder if i might have a word with you
theyre klingons not kittens
you will listen
these sensors indicate youve placed holoemitters on decks five through twelve no wonder the system breached youve turned voyager into one big holodeck
can you shut it down
yes but im going to have to initiate an overload well worry about making repairs later right now weve got to put an end to those simulations janeway to ensign kim
yes captain
harry im going to need your help overloading the holoemitter network
im transferring optical processor control to you now start charging the secondary power relays
well use them to trigger the overload
im on it
its going to take some time there are over eight hundred emitters that we have to
move away from the controls
why havent you ordered the ceasefire
move away from the controls
listen to me
no
what are you waiting for
i am a hunter you are my prey run
acknowledged out our holographic allies are losing ground the german troops are surrounding the city
i dont know how much longer we can hold them off these weapons are pretty crude theyre not much help
maybe we should fall back
where to theyre coming in from all sides tuvok any chance we can get through that breach in the hologrid
unlikely twenty more hirogen have taken up position near the opening we are outnumbered
hows it going
im modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst it will be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all holographic activity within twenty metres
well try to buy you some time
ill be in sickbay
schnell schell
theyre closing in seven
surrender
verdamt bring that one to me i will spare your life for now but only because you are carrying a german child
please dont do this i can be of use to you i can help you repair the ship dont kill me
against the wall your deaths will serve the glory of the reich prepare to fire
fight on warriors this way
qapla gentlemen qapla
this hunt is over tell your hunters to stand down ill use this if you force me to
its over lets go
what is this
an optronic datacore you can use it to create holodeck technology on your own vessels i made a promise with your leader before he died that i would give this knowledge to the hirogen take it
his ideas were unconventional i do not share them
was he any more unconventional than you are calling a ceasefire with your prey only a few days ago the thought of speaking with us on equal terms wouldve been inconceivable but here we are accept this trophy you can use it to create a new future for your people at the very least you can hang it on your bulkhead
ow ow what do you think youre doing doc
an impromptu auditory exam
did i pass
with flying colours which leads me to believe you did hear me when i requested you meet me this morning
youre right i forgot
i see i realise your sickbay training is purely voluntary but you havent spent any time there in several weeks and when i try to find you youre always in the holodeck
correct me if im wrong doc but we havent been treating anything more serious than an ingrown toenail
thats beside the point if an emergency were to happen you must be prepared youre too far behind in your medical texts to be wasting your time in the holodeck
if its any consolation i have spent most of the morning immersed in a complicated surgical procedure
really
a classic case of atrophied shocks they needed to be extracted to prevent chrome abrasion it was touch and go for a while but the prognosis is excellent
youll be ready for neurosurgery in no time
take a look at this doc this is a fully stock 1969 chevy camaro one of the earliest muscle cars ever made
imagine northern california late twentieth century youre cruising up highway one the woofers are pounding the wind is whipping through your hair
medieval safety constraints internal combustion system producing lethal levels of carbon monoxide hmm i stand corrected this may be just what you need to get you back to sickbay
i guess i should have known this wouldnt interest you its too much fun
this isnt about fun mister paris serving in sickbay is a privilege id expect you to realise that
oh i do ill be there soon
lieutenant paris report to the bridge immediately
im on my way
somebody call for a driver
take your station tom anything on scans harry
im picking up another spatial disturbance two thousand kilometres away
source
i have no idea it looks like space is folding in on itself
shields to full
its an alien vessel one occupant aboard
captain it looks like that ship is being powered by a coaxial warp drive
coaxial what
its a hypothetical propulsion system starfleet engineers have been dreaming about it for years in theory it can literally fold the fabric of space allowing a ship to travel instantaneously across huge distances
the alien warp drive is overloading
in theory a coaxial drive explosion could collapse space within a radius of a billion kilometres in theory
lets keep theory from becoming reality red alert
scan the vessel can we beam the pilot out
too much interference
that ships about had it captain the coaxial core is breaching
we should vacant this area of space at once
we cant just leave him like this
try one more hail
nothing maybe hes ignoring us
or maybe hes unconscious weve got to do something
suggestions
a symmetric warp field that should contain any instabilities in his spacefolding core
how can you be sure
advanced subspace geometry its the one course at the academy where i actually paid attention well tractor him in to kill his momentum generate a warp field around his ship
his flightpath is erratic wed be risking collision
captain i can make this work
do it
passing through the residual folds in space steady got him
ive extended our warp field around his vessel his core is powering down
nice flying tom
my pleasure
were finally receiving a hail
open a channel
captain janeway of the federation starship voyager do you need medical attention
im fine captain unfortunately my ship is not
if you need to make repairs we might be able to help
thats very generous
well beam you aboard in a few minutes stand by
thank you
tuvok
energise
welcome
captain i know you put yourselves in danger to rescue me i want to thank you
im glad we could help
i was so eager to test my new engine i pushed it beyond its limits
coaxial warp doesnt seem to be the smoothest way to travel
its a violent procedure but it allows a ship to travel through space at incredible speeds
considering the dangers this method of travel hardly seems logical
thats probably true but if i were worrying about danger i wouldnt have become a test pilot
where are you from
the fourth planet of the benthan system thats about twenty light years from here
ill speak to my engineers about helping you with repairs without your coaxial drive its a long way home
come in
id like to ask you a favour i need a change of pace id like to help steth repair his ship
this isnt a good time to ask
what do you mean
ive been reading a report from the doctor you didnt show up today
i was a little busy this morning saving someones life as i recall
is there something wrong tom anything bothering you
nothing is wrong since when is not wanting to spend time with the doctor a capital offence youd have to throw the whole crew in the brig for that one
maybe i was wondering if theres something on your mind youre showing up for your duty shifts you do whats required but your heart doesnt seem to be in it you seem preoccupied
like i said i think i need a change of pace
youre a different man from the one that came on board four years ago youve taken charge of your life turned yourself around id hate to see you ruin it
i wont with your permission ill report to sickbay
permission denied report to steths ship instead assist in the repairs we need our best man on the job
and on my way back i made the mistake of flying the prototype through restricted entaban territory
and
and the entabans werent too pleased to see me i limped back to the engineers on benthos with phaser holes through their brand new extanium fuselage i think they would have been happy to see phaser holes through me
when i was sixteen i followed an ancient human custom i took my fathers shuttle out for a joy ride and proceeded to fry all the relays
im guessing he wasnt happy about getting it back
actually he didnt as far as i know its still at the bottom of lake tahoe
here it is the coaxial induction drive it draws in subatomic particles and reconfigures their internal geometries
and this is what makes folding space possible
at least in spurts unfortunately particle instabilities keep overloading my engines but im going to make it work i have to keep in motion i dont like the thought of settling down too many new ships to drive too many intriguing women
yeah i guess so
when i get this ship back im going to be doing the first test on a new mithran class flyer im told its more advanced than any warship in the quadrant why dont you come with me wed have a great time you could meet up with voyager afterwards
id love to do that it sounds very exciting but i have responsibilities here people who count on me belanna would be furious belanna i have to go
so you started without me
i finished without you youre a little late
sorry i was helping steth repair his ship
hows it going
pretty slow were both stuck on how to prevent the particle overloads in his propulsion system
have you tried an isokinetic containment field
yeah thats the first thing we tried
how long do you think repairs are going to take
i dont know
i was just hoping that maybe you could help me recalibrate the plasma manifolds tonight
ah i er i probably should go help steth
tom is there something wrong
why are you interrogating me
i didnt think i was
it sounds more like you want me to account for every minute that im not with you
thats ridiculous
cant i have some time to myself cant i do what i want without having to report every detail of it to you
tom you can do whatever you want i just wanted to know if there was something wrong i mean lately youve been cancelling dates you hide out for hours in the holodeck
i am not hiding anything that is ridiculous
is it you havent even told me what holodeck programme this is that has you so fascinated
the dancing girls of ninipia prime its very entertaining
very funny
youre overreacting
i am not overreacting theres obviously something going on and youre refusing to admit it
good evening lieutenants i see you dont have your dinner yet tom can i get you something
im really not hungry
excuse me are you going to talk about this because if youre not i dont want to sit here anymore
if you can carry on an adult conversation without all the histrionics
good night tom
computer run a dna stability analysis how long before my genome reverts to its previous form
time to reversion three hours thirteen minutes complete genome recovery is imminent
so i was lying in bed last night when it hit me what you need is a carburettor
a carburettor
yes its a device thats hundreds of years old i cant believe i didnt think of it yesterday
wait hundreds of years old surely that couldnt be of any use to us now
it all goes back to basics you would be surprised at how often i find solutions to twenty fourth century problems in twentieth century technology computer access paris programme alpha one grease monkey
grease monkey
mechanic lingo
a cars engine cant run on pure fuel so the carburettor supplies it with a mixture of vaporised fuel and air
and you think we need a device like that to dilute the particle stream as it enters the coaxial drive
exactly and a spare polaric modulator from voyagers impulse drive should do the trick
subatomic dilution it never would have occurred to me i think youve solved it
well we can run a few simulations on the holodeck before we actually try it
i owe you a lot
you can thank my lucky toolbox its gotten me out of hot water more than once
youre lucky to be stationed on a ship like this replicators to feed and clothe you holotechnology to cater to every whim hallways filled with women
yeah its great
you dont sound convinced arent you happy here
of course im happy im very happy i mean i pilot one of the most advanced ships in starfleet i have a beautiful girlfriend im respected i have everything that ive ever wanted
youre lucky youre part of a family part of a structure you have rules to guide you you dont have to worry about making a lot of choices i usually go to bed at night not knowing what the next day has in store what trouble i might get into you dont have to worry about those things youre very settled
i remember those days i used to be a lot like you going anywhere doing whatever i wanted making my own rules
well then theres hope for me yet maybe someday ill settle down too but for now i prefer to stay on the move
sometimes i wish thats what i was doing
thingsll turn around for you ive always found that change is inevitable it comes when you least expect it
yeah i suppose
now are we ready to try this carburettor idea on my ship
just give me five more minutes to finish up here and ill be right with you
five minutes and tom dont dismiss the suggestion i made about coming with me to fly the new ship it might be fun to escape the shackles for a while
hmm
computer access all files pertaining to lieutenant tom paris download into memory core alpha
please enter authorisation code
access granted commencing download
hello im steth a guest of your captain
i have been appraised of your presence on voyager you are not authorised to access the ships computers
you must be seven of nine
that is correct
tom mentioned you he thinks youre extremely intelligent
lieutenant paris opinion of me is irrelevant to your being in this room
well er tom felt we needed some files for polaric modulators but he was called away before we could access them i thought id find them myself and help out
you were mistaken he must be present to download these files
oh im about to meet him at the holodeck we can find the files there
voyagers hierarchy is complex see that you familiarise yourself with it
good advice ill do that
everything here looks good just give me one more second to check the flow field parameters
go ahead
its my box wrench ive been looking all over for this
i know i should have asked you tom but i needed it for an experiment
to check your new carburettor
not quite youre the first humans ive met and that wrench had enough cellular residue on it for me to check your dna i have good news were compatible
consider this a favour i know how unhappy youve been with this dreary settled life so im taking it off your hands im betting theres still some fun to be had here voyager is a great ship tom ill take good care of it
sorry im late
we were beginning to wonder if you were ever coming back
his ship is powering engines
something wrong tom
its nothing
im just really going to miss that guy
mind if i join you
not at all commander
chakotay will do tom you dont carry this rules thing too far ive been discussing your engineering report with the captain she was wondering if we could implement some of steths technology here on voyager
really
we thought maybe you could start on a shuttle do you think you can do it
im sure i can
great you can start right after you finish with the doctor
the doctor
he needs your help in sickbay i told him youd be there
of course
lieutenant
hi
i know youve been avoiding the doctor but dont tell me youve forgotten where sickbay is
oh not yet i was just trying to figure out if theres a more efficient route between sickbay and my quarters
i didnt realise you were that eager to get there so tell me are they ready yet
ah not yet but they will be soon
great hey let me know if you have any problems polyduranide can be tough to replicate
oh sure can be
i cant wait to get my hands around one of those clubs ensign kaplan wont know what hit her
what
were going to play golf with her we scheduled a rematch remember
oh of course i cant wait
have you been working on your putting you missed both those twofooters last time
i wont let it happen again
all right give the doc my best
i will
if i ever find him
youre early mister paris i see some good came from my report to commander chakotay lets put these extra few minutes to good use begin with a thorough biobed diagnostic i want you to recalibrate each physiosensor making sure to enter each metabolic referent precisely
okay
when youre through with that run a protein structure analysis and then continue your review of the thirty seven steps of a cardiopulmonary reconstruction procedure ill leave you to your biobeds
did you forget to disengage the scan emitters
sorry
mister paris
i dont know whats wrong
i realise its complicated but you must try again
actually im not feeling so well
how fortunate youre already in sickbay ill run a few scans
no no doc thats all right to be perfectly honest with you this is so frustrating for me i usually pick things up a lot faster than this
youre here to learn mister paris it will get easier with time
thats easy for you to say
excuse me
well no offence doctor but you were programmed to be a medical genius things always come easy to you me im just a pilot a grease monkey and as hard as i might try to become a better assistant its clear to me now that ill never be half the healer that you are
do you mean to tell me youve been trying to live up to my standards
im afraid i have
it all makes sense now the misplaced aggression the shirking of responsibilities all classic signs of an inferiority complex i had no idea my superior abilities were affecting your psyche so strongly take the rest of the day off reflect on your strengths realise your worth
ill do that doctor thank you
belanna
what do you think youre doing
putting
in my quarters
i cant putt in your quarters
no
since when
tom what is this
that is a sand wedge its used for getting out of traps
why is it here
i replicated it for you i thought we could play a little game of golf on the holodeck before dinner
so this is your idea of an adult conversation i dont know what you are trying to accomplish with this little stunt but let me assure you it is not working i am sorry if you are bored because steth is gone but that doesnt mean that you can just walk in here and pretend like you havent been shutting me out
youre being a little hard on steth if it wasnt for him i wouldnt be here right now
really
i mentioned to him we were having some problems and he urged me to come and talk to you to try to work things out to admit i was wrong i made a mistake belanna and im sorry i wont shut you out anymore in fact i went to the doctor and begged to be excused from my duties i realise its only a few extra hours but theyre hours i want to spend with you
steth turned out to be a positive influence on you
computer wh
computer where are we
navigation matrix one seven one one the kotaba expanse coaxial leap complete
how far are we from voyager computer lock in voyagers last known coordinates and activate differential induction drive
unable to execute command
why not
the differential induction drive has been secured the security access code is required to implement the coaxial leap
this is commander avek of the benthan guard were taking you into custody prepare to surrender the vessel to us at once
benthan i need a second to explain commander im not who you think
we do not negotiate with thieves
no you dont understand i i need the ship to get back to voyager
surrender the vessel peacefully or we will use force
why is everybody trying to shoot me today
you know what im here for
i dont know what youre talking about who are you
im steth
what
look at me you did wear this body for nearly a year before you switched it with mine thats my body youre in now i want it back
bear with me for a second we have more in common than you might think
this better be good tom i left vorik right in the middle of an eps recalibration
you can thank me later
so whats my big surprise
what would you say to twenty four glorious hours on the famed fourth planet of the kendren system
you mean the planet where neelix is gathering food samples
i ran a few scans and found the most incredible beach on one of the smaller continents i replicated a picnic lunch for us voyager isnt leaving orbit until tomorrow wed have an entire day
only a day oh i think that we would need at least a week
i wish we could weve only got a day
youre serious arent you
completely
do you know how much trouble we would be in
what could janeway do execute us
tom i am swamped i cant get away for an hour let alone twenty four
belanna
i have responsibilities here we both do
responsibilities i dont care
tom youre hurting me
youre a real disappointment to me do you know that i dont know what i ever saw in you
seven what brings you here at this hour
we were supposed to meet in the shuttlebay at twenty one hundred hours did you forget
i did i got so caught up with my reading i guess it slipped my mind sorry
the capillaries in your eyes are swollen lieutenant and i see signs of vascular congestion in your cheeks are you intoxicated
no not at all i was just exploring the replicator trying some alien beverages only a few were alcoholic
you are not officially offduty for another seventy eight minutes
im on break would you like to join me i could replicate another trakian ale for you
that will not be necessary
relax seven youre not on the borg cube any more we could finish our work on the shuttle tomorrow
that would be an inefficient use of our time i will complete the work myself
fine
before i leave i would like to know why you were reading the captains personal logs
i wasnt
i saw the padd it was unmistakably the captains logs
youre wrong youre confused you couldnt possibly have seen anything
you know i possess an eidetic memory i require only seconds to commit what i see to memory would you like me to quote the passage you were reading
im warning you stay out of my way dont interfere in things that dont concern you if you bother me again i will make things very unpleasant for you
remove your hand from my arm
dont be foolish youll regret it
enter
you wanted to see me captain
yes i received a rather disturbing report from seven of nine regarding your conduct last night she claims you were drinking on duty
shes mistaken captain
dont lie to me tom i checked the computers you replicated five alcoholic beverages in the mess hall she also said you threatened her
im sorry captain belanna and i had an argument i was upset
and is that why you were reading my personal logs
i wasnt
seven recited a passage which id written word for word
she probably accessed those files herself captain you cant take the word of a borg over mine
this has to stop tom your conduct lately has been bizarre and ive heard far too many complaints from far too many people to dismiss it chakotay the doctor seven of nine theyre all worried about you and so am i
youre right captain i need some rest ill go right to my quarters
tom as your captain and as your friend i want you to report to sickbay for some tests we have to find out if theres something physical thats causing this behaviour
this is crazy i dont need any help
thats an order
security i need you in the ready room now
are you hurt captain
no take him to sickbay keep security with him
the coaxial drive will be online in a few minutes
good ive just about overridden all the lockout commands no offence but id like to get out of your body as soon as possible
the alien seems capable of some sort of selective dna exchange he absorbs new dna while depositing his current genetic material into his victims lets hope he can reverse that process
thats the last lockout command were set for coaxial warp lets find voyager
neurological scans yielded very little but i did find something very interesting in his blood analysis there are traces of a second dna pattern in his nucleotide structure possibly the result of a genetic virus
could this be the cause of his recent behaviour
i dont know but im running more scans to see how this might have affected his neurological functions
captain a vessel just emerged from coaxial space off our starboard bow
keep me informed doctor
hail them
captain janeway
welcome back mister steth
i know this sounds crazy captain but im not steth im tom paris
i beg your pardon
were dealing with an alien whos some sort of identity thief he traded places with me please beam us aboard
maintain your position while we consider your request end transmission hold them in a tractor beam until you hear from me
aye captain
i have a feeling steth and his new friend are behind whatevers happened to tom
captain
no time to explain ill be in sickbay
captain
commander im reading an unauthorised shuttle launch its the captain shes in the shuttle toms been working on
try hailing her
shes not responding
hail steths ship look i dont know who you are but i want to know whats happening here
whos on that shuttle
captain janeway
no im betting the alien switched my body er toms body for hers youve got to let us out of this tractor beam we can catch her with this ship chakotay its me
how do i know that
the other day in your office you told me id turned my life around well give me the chance to prove it let me go after the shuttle it is the only way we can get everybody back into the right body
harry disengage the tractor beam
twenty thousand kilometres and closing
has he detected us yet
id say he has
gentlemen id advise you to reconsider this pursuit killing me will only keep you trapped in those bodies
hes right we cant risk killing him
yeah but nothings keeping him from killing us damn the ships not nearly as manoeuverable as a shuttle
shields are down
im surprised youre so eager to
reclaim your life on voyager tom i was just as disappointed with it as you were
then i guess we were both wrong
its time to move on again oh tom be sure to send my best regards to belanna hmm
hes charging the coaxial drive
set the sensors to track him
i cant hes blocking us we wont be able to follow him once he goes into coaxial warp were losing him
the carburettor we added a polaric modulator to the coaxial drive if i can target the modulator hit it with a chromoelectric pulse thatll disrupt his engines here goes
i hope you still have my box wrench faulty carburettors can be a pain to fix
doctor i cant thank you enough youve given me my life back
all in a days work
there were times when i thought i would be stuck in that body forever
believe me im just as happy to be back to the old tom paris
what do you plan to do now
im going to take her back to bentha i hope to find the person who belongs to that body
but who knows if thats the end of it we have no idea how long she or he has been switching identities
it may take a while but i will do whatever i can to find everyone youve violated
a security team will escort you to your ship and erect a forcefield to contain her
so this is where youve been hiding a garage
its more than just a garage this is a monument to hundreds and hundreds of hours that i probably should have spent with you
probably
definitely
its a lovely garage tom but i still dont understand why you brought me here
well consider it a symbolic gesture its my less than subtle attempt to let you in
i see to make it clear that i mean almost as much to you as a camaro
its a mint condition 1969 camaro and yes you mean a lot more to me
oh six hundred hours regeneration cycle complete
daily log seven of nine stardate157812 today ensign kim and  		i will conduct a comprehensive diagnostic of the aft  		sensor array i have allocated three hours twenty minutes for the task  		and an additional seventeen minutes for ensign kims usual  		conversational digressions i am scheduled to take a nutritional  		supplement at fifteen hundred hours engage in one hour of  		cardiovascular activity then i intend to review a text the doctor  		recommended entitled a christmas carol he believes it will have educational value end 		log
ill get this dont give me any hints
i have no intention of doing so
ensign
hi seven
are you ready to begin our sensor diagnostic
is it oh six hundred already weve been playing all night
vulcan kaltoh
for a game of logic youd be surprised at how addictive it is give  		me a few more minutes to figure this out
you should attend to your duties ensign ill accept your forfeit
no way this is the closest ive ever come to beating you im not giving up now
impressive
elementary spatial harmonics are you ready now
yeah sure i wouldve gotten that
is there anything you dont know
i was borg
i was borg thats what you always say but what does it mean youve got the  		knowledge of ten thousand species in your head
not exactly each drones experiences are processed by the collective  		only useful information is retained
still that probably makes you the most intelligent human being alive
probably
so what do you need the rest of us for forget i asked
what was that
we just dropped out of warp
whats the problem
we were hit by some kind of shockwave
source
checking
hold on i just lost all my sensor readings the computers  		bringing up some kind of message but i cant access it youd better take a look at this
i see it
what is it
i have no idea my command codes arent working the computer says i have 		insufficient clearance to access the message we cant function like this  		im going to get harry up here to trace the source
dont do anything ill take care of this
send all sensor data  		about the particle wave to my ready room tom disengage engines and hold position here
captain whats going on
i cant explain right now dont discuss any of this with the rest of the crew  		ill have further instructions for you soon
computer seal the doors to this room no entry without my authorisation
doors are sealed
access secured datafile omega one
voiceprint confirmed state clearance code
janeway one one five three red clearance level ten
confirmed sensors have detected the omega phenomenon within  		one point two light years of this vessel implement the omega  		directive immediately all other priorities have been rescinded
display sensor data
ive been informed this is a highly classified mission  		information will be provided on a needtoknow basis captains orders
classified by who were sixty thousand light years from starfleet
like i said need to know belanna she wants you to install multiphasic 		shielding around the warp core
ive never seen this shield configuration id like to run a couple of  		computer simulations to make sure its stable
no time she needs this done by eleven hundred hours
eleven hundred i dont think thats possible
make it possible
are we attempting to protect the core from some form of subspace radiation
i dont know any more than you do
it will be difficult to complete the task without more data
the data youve got will have to do tom start modifying a  		shuttlecraft to withstand extreme thermal stress twelve thousand kelvins at least
aye sir
does all this have anything to do with that secret message the captain received
what have you heard
rumours mainly janeways been locked in her ready room for the  		past sixteen hours something about an omega directive
omega
ring a bell
look the speculation ends right here now i expect you to  		carry out your assignments with a minimum of gossip understood  		i know its hard not to wonder frankly im curious myself but  		the captain was very adamant about this get going  the captain wants to see you
i thought she might
come in what do you know about the omega directive
everything you do most likely
i thought as much the borg assimilated starfleet captains  		you would possess all of their knowledge
thats correct do you intend to carry out the directive
yes
then sensors have detected the molecule
so it would appear but we have to confirm it
we
youre going to help me carry out the directive protocol  		forbids me from discussing this mission with any of my crew but  		since you already know about it my choice is to either work with  		you or confine you to quarters
perhaps you should do the latter i will not help you destroy omega it should be harnessed
thats impossible
the borg believe otherwise
explain
on one occasion we were able to create a single omega molecule we kept it  		stable for one trillionth of a nanosecond before it destabilised we didnt  		have enough boronite ore left to synthesise more but the knowledge we gained allowed us to  		refine our theories
the borg have been waiting for the chance to test them out
yes but we never found another source of the ore until now
sorry but if someone out there is experimenting with omega im under  		orders to stop them otherwise this entire quadrant would be at risk
those orders were issued as a result of starfleets ignorance and fear  		i can alleviate your ignorance as for your fear
sometimes fear should be respected seven tell me how many borg were sacrificed during this experiment
twenty nine vessels six hundred thousand drones but that is irrelevant
not to me not to my crew and not to the people who live in this  		quadrant im going to neutralise this threat seven with or without your help
i will assist you
you will
i have waited many years to observe this molecule firsthand  		i will not deny myself this experience
all right go back to your cargo bay assemble all the data you have about  		omega ill expect a report within the hour i didnt realise you had such a strong scientific curiosity
not curiosity desire
desire
omega is infinitely complex yet harmonious  		to the borg it represents perfection i wish to understand that perfection
the borgs holy grail
captain
never mind ill see you in an hour
arithrazine what for
im going on an away mission
what are you planning to do stroll through a supernova
something like that twenty milligrams when can you have it ready
captain arithrazine is used for the most severe cases of theta radiation  		poisoning a physician must be present to monitor the treatment
that wont be possible
then im afraid i cant accommodate you id be in violation of  		starfleet medical protocols
well im overriding those protocols
dont tell me the omega directive whatever that might be
the arithrazine doctor
itll be ready in the morning
have it sent to the shuttlebay
captain i dont know whats going on here but id hate this  		to be the last time i ever see you please be careful
i will
ive analysed the sensor logs using borg algorithms the shockwave  		we detected indicates not one but possibly hundreds of omega molecules
location
within ten light years im having difficulty isolating the exact star system
hundreds of molecules that changes everything
a shuttle mission may be insufficient we require the resources of this entire crew
were going to need more firepower more protection transfer your data to the astrometrics lab  		ill work on it there
calibration complete phase modulator detonator circuits
on standby
were ready to load the gravimetric charge
this looks like enough for a fifty isoton explosion
fifty four to be exact
what are we planning to do blow up a small planet
i dont know
this warhead isnt standard issue who designed it the captain
mister kim you ask too many questions change of plans gentlemen increase the charge to eighty isotons
aye captain
harry when youre done here give belanna a hand with the shuttlecraft  		shes reinforcing the hull
right
ensign hickman thinks its species eight four seven two
pardon me
thats his theory theres an opening in fluidic space and captain janeway  		has to shut it down want to know what i think
no
i think theres a type six protostar out there and the captains planning on detonating it and opening up a wormhole to the alpha quadrant in theory its possible and because she doesnt want to get our hopes up shes not telling anybody
then i wouldnt suggest getting your hopes up
then what do you think it is
i do not engage in idle speculation
oh come on tuvok arent you curious
yes but we have a task at hand the phase modulator
come in status report
everythings going according to schedule
good the omega directive doesnt allow me to say much but i want  		you to know what to expect at oh six hundred hours ill be leaving in a shuttle with seven of nine
would it be out of line to ask where youre going
i can tell you this one of two things is going to happen  		either seven and i will succeed on our mission and return within a few  		days or your long range sensors will detect a large explosion in subspace  		if that occurs youll have less than ten seconds to jump to warp  		and get the hell out of here head for the alpha quadrant and dont look back understood
i always thought starfleet was run by dutycrazed bureaucrats but  		i find it hard to believe that even they would order a captain to go on a suicide  		mission this shuttle excursion is your idea isnt it
lets just say ive had to amend the directive given the circumstances  		but you have your orders and i expect you to follow them
thats expecting a lot youre asking me to abandon my captain and closest  		friend without even telling me why
if it were a simple matter of trust i wouldnt hesitate to tell you but weve  		encountered situations where information was taken from us by force i cant allow  		knowledge of omega to go beyond voyager
thats a reasonable argument but youre not always a reasonable woman  		youre determined to protect this crew and this time youve taken it too far  		a dangerous mission fine ill acknowledge that but isnt it more likely to  		succeed with everyone behind you working together
ordinarily id agree but this directive was issued many years ago  		and starfleet didnt exactly have our predicament in mind lost in the delta  		quadrant with no backup i cant ignore the orders but i wont ask the crew to risk  		their lives because of my obligation
my obligation thats where youre wrong voyager may be alone out here  		but youre not let us help you well keep classified information limited to the  		senior staff well take every security precaution just dont try to do this alone
assemble the troops
if we were in the alpha quadrant right now we wouldnt be having  		this conversation id be in contact with starfleet  		command and theyd send in a specialised team to deal with the crisis  		in their absence were going to have to make do with the training ive received  		and the knowledge seven of nine has retained from the borg youve all  		seen this symbol omega the last letter of the greek alphabet  		chosen by starfleet to represent a  		threat not only to the federation but to the entire galaxy  		only starship captains and federation flag officers have been  		briefed on the nature of this threat what youre about to hear  		will not go beyond these bulkheads is that clear good
this is omega
a molecule
not just any molecule the most powerful substance known to exist  		a single omega molecule contains the same energy as a warp core  		in theory a small chain of them could sustain a civilisation the  		molecule was first synthesised over a hundred years ago by a starfleet  		physicist named ketteract i think he was hoping to develop an inexhaustible power source
or a weapon
ketteract managed to synthesise a single molecule particle of omega  		but it only existed for a fraction of a second before it destabilised
this was  		a classified research station in the lantaru sector ketteract and one hundred  		twenty six of the federations leading scientists were lost in the accident  		rescue teams attempting to reach the site  		discovered an unexpected secondary effect there were subspace  		ruptures extending out several light years
the lantaru sector its impossible to create a stable warp field there  		you can only fly through it at sublight speeds i was always told that  		was a natural phenomenon youre saying it was caused by a single molecule of this stuff
omega destroys subspace a chain reaction involving a handful of molecules  		could devastate subspace throughout an entire quadrant if that were to happen  		warp travel would become impossible spacefaring civilisation as we know it would  		cease to exist when starfleet realised omegas power they suppressed all knowledge of it
have you detected omega here in the delta quadrant
im afraid so ive been authorised to use whatever means necessary to destroy it tom  		ive calculated the location of the molecules ill transfer the coordinates  		to the helm take us there at full impulse
aye captain
i dont have to tell you whats at stake if a largescale omega  		explosion occurs we will lose the ability to go to warp forever weve got our work cut out for us
status report
this is a harmonic resonance chamber the borg designed it to contain and stabilise omega
i thought i asked you to work on the photon torpedo
the torpedo may be insufficient i can modify this chamber to emit an inverse frequency  		it will be enough to dissolve omegas interatomic bonds
heres to borg ingenuity this is excellent work seven we may need this
the modifications require several complex calculations assist me
i guess i will im curious when did the borg discover omega
two hundred twenty nine years ago
assimilation
yes of thirteen different species
thirteen
it began with species two six two they were primitive but their  		oral history referred to a powerful substance which could burn the sky  		the borg were intrigued which led them to species two six three they too  		were primitive and believed it was a drop of blood from their creator
fascinating
yes but irrelevant we followed this trail of myth for many years until  		finally assimilating a species with useful scientific data we then created the molecule ourselves
omega caused quite a stir among my own species federation cosmologists  		had a theory that the molecule once existed in nature for an infinitesimal period  		of time at the exact moment of the big bang some claimed omega was the primal source of  		energy for the explosion that began our universe
a creation myth like any other
perhaps what is it the borg say that omega is perfect
yes
is that a theory or a belief
bridge to captain
go ahead
were approaching the coordinates
im on my way im leaving this project in your hands use whatever resources and personnel you need
understood
weve entered a planetary system
inhabited
theres a prewarp civilisation on the outermost planet the  		source of omega seems to be further in
the damage to subspace in this region is extreme we wont  		be able to go to warp
were encountering distortions
track their origin
an m class moon were in visual range
on screen
theres a subnucleonic reaction occurring in the upper atmosphere  		it is apparently emanating from a structure on the moons surface
can your sensors penetrate the atmosphere
stand by
my god
over three hundred thousand square kilometres destroyed
scan the structure are there any omega molecules remaining
i cant tell several sections of the outpost are still shielded
im detecting lifesigns
how many
a few dozen maybe its hard to get a clear reading
harry can we transport to the surface
i can get you there but conditions in the structure arent good  		there are high levels of radiation
tuvok assemble a rescue team and have them report to sickbay for arithrazine  		inoculations tell the doctor to prepare for casualties tom move voyager into a high orbit  		and then join the away team well need a field medic
yes maam
youre going with them
if omegas still down there i have to find it ill keep an  		open comm link with the ship you have the bridge
im picking up omegas resonance frequency its here but i cant pinpoint a  		location
i need to ask you questions about the experiments youve been conducting here
there was an accident we lost containment
the substance you were trying to create did any of it survive the explosion
yes
where
inside the primary test chamber who are you
captain janeway of the starship voyager were here to help you  		away team to voyager two to beam directly to sickbay
aye captain
this door is solid duritanium thirteen centimetres thick
can we get it open
the duritanium has melted into the door frame well need to  		cut through the metal with phasers
do it
captain id be negligent if i didnt point out that were  		about to violate the prime directive
for the duration of this mission the prime directive has been  		rescinded lets get this over with
crewman dell im assigning you a task more suited to your abilities 		calibrate the ionic pressure seals on the observation ports  		your new designation is three of ten
yes maam
ive got more isolinear processors for you to install
thanks but i need to get the power relays online first
are you sure thats a good idea ensign wildman was assigned to that
this is ridiculous im not going to waste time just because seven wants to  		turn this team into her own private collective
she says its more efficient
maybe for a bunch of drones
six of ten this is not your assignment
please stop calling me that
you are compromising our productivity im reassigning you to  		chamber maintenance your new designation is two of ten
wait a minute youre demoting me since when do the borg pull rank
a starfleet protocol i adapted i find it most useful
im glad youre not the captain
hows it coming
the crew can be quite efficient when properly organised  		the harmonic chamber will be completed within the hour
good ill let the captain know
has she retrieved any new data from the surface
not yet theyre still trying to access the primary test chamber
were there survivors
a few the doctors treating them in sickbay
commander sevens taking this hive mentality just a little too far  		designated functions numbered drones i wouldnt be surprised if she  		started plugging us into alcoves
when in the collective harry adapt
which of them is the senior researcher
this gentleman why do you ask
he has knowledge i require
he also happens to be barely conscious come back in an hour
unacceptable
unavoidable this is my sickbay the man needs to recover
the captain left me in charge of our efforts on voyager i would be negligent  		if i ignored a source of new information
our next social skills seminar is entitled adding diplomatic flair to  		future negotiations how are you feeling sir
better thank you
are you comfortable enough to speak with this individual
keep it brief
how many of the molecules were you able to synthesise
two hundred million im not certain
what is the isofrequency of your containment field
one point six eight terahertz we used the molecules  		own resonance to calculate the field
that should have been enough to stabilise them
obviously it wasnt
obviously but your approach is innovative perhaps i can adapt your  		technique and improve upon it you will assist me
our equipment was destroyed if you can transfer the molecules to your  		ship maybe they can be saved
i have no intention of saving them
what
my orders are to destroy the omega molecules
this is my lifes work the salvation of my people
will you assist me or not
our resources are nearly gone the future of my people depends on this discovery
then your answer is no
smallminded creatures you destroy whatever you dont understand  		rescue ships are on the way they wont let you do it
please try to be calm seven youll have to leave
you dont realise what youre doing you dont know what this is what this means
on the contrary i understand perfectly
weve disabled the locking mechanism
narrow your phaser beams to cut through the inner seal
inadvisable wed risk penetrating the containment field
then well have to use some elbow grease give me a hand right
theres enough here to wipe out subspace across half the quadrant
ill order the away teams back to voyager and target this  		facility with the gravimetric charge
it wont be enough well have to go with our borg option ensign
yes captain
return to the ship tell commander chakotay to help seven complete the harmonic chamber  		well have to transport omega directly to the ship that means finding  		a way to shut down this containment field
its unfortunate we cant study this phenomenon in more detail  		we may not have the opportunity again
lets hope we never do
a curious statement from a woman of science
im also a woman who occasionally knows when to quit take  		another look at your tricorder omegas too dangerous i wont risk half  		the quadrant to satisfy our curiosity its arrogant and its irresponsible  		the final frontier has some boundaries that shouldnt be crossed and were looking at one
we dont need to destroy the molecules i believe ive found a way to stabilise them  		the alien in sickbay calibrated his containment field using omegas own resonance  		an approach unknown to the borg i have modified this chamber
those werent your orders the captain wants omega eliminated
that is still an option if she insists on yielding to her fear
show me what youve done
this simulation shows the molecules in their free state highly unstable  		ive modified the chamber to emit a harmonic waveform that will dampen the molecules
looks great in theory but this is only a simulation how are you going to test it
on omega
bad idea one mistake and no one will be around for a second try
it will work
someday maybe hang on to your research for now we stick to the plan  		stand by to transport the molecules into this chamber and neutralise them as ordered
i have been a member of this crew for nine months in all of that time  		i have never made a personal request i am making one now allow me to proceed please
why is this so important to you
particle zero one zero the borg designation for what you call omega  		every drone is aware of its existence we were instructed to assimilate it  		at all costs it is perfection the molecules exist in a flawless state  		infinite parts functioning as one
like the borg
precisely i am no longer borg but i still need to understand that  		perfection without it my existence will never be complete  		commander you are a spiritual man
thats right
if you had the chance to see your god your great spirit  		what would you do
id pursue it with all my heart
then you understand
i think i do ill inform thecaptain of your discovery  		for now her orders stand
thank you
set the confinement beam to its narrowest dispersion
understood
well target this facility with the gravimetric torpedo  		if anything goes wrong during transport thatll be our only hope
bridge to janeway weve detected two ships on an intercept course  		theyre not responding to hails
how long until they get here
less than four minutes captain
standby to transport the
molecules directly to the harmonic chamber
understood bridge to
cargo bay
yes commander
seven get ready
well have to do this quickly
thats not advisable
we dont have a choice
the alien ships are on their way
then i recommend moving the ship within five thousand kilometres of the surface
thatll take us right into the atmosphere
with our shields down we wont withstand the thermal reaction for more than a few seconds
then well only get one shot at this take us in
aye sir
transporter status
targeting scanners are locked
captain are you ready
pattern enhancers are active
do it
were eleven thousand kilometres from the surface if we get much closer well incinerate
were losing structural integrity
nine thousand kilometres
were close enough energise
initiating transport
the omega molecules are stable
transport was successful
ive got the away team in transporter room two
get us out of here maximum impulse
already on it
how far away are those ships
theyre right on our tail
were heading into an area of open space no indications of life or  		any kind of technology we can carry out the procedure with no risk to anyone else
except those two ships behind us
can we stay ahead of them
not for long
how soon can we clear the subspace ruptures and go to warp
ten maybe fifteen minutes but those ships will catch up to us before then
well we have one advantage weve got omega they wont risk firing at us  		at least not until they run out of options  		that should give us a chance to neutralise the molecules
captain we might have another problem
seven of nine
shes convinced she can stabilise omega
i thought wed settled that question
while you were on the surface she showed me a pretty  		convincing simulation of how it could be done
i should have known she wouldnt just let this go ill be in cargo bay two
seven the procedure
its working eleven percent of the molecules have already been neutralised
lets see if we can speed up the process a little
did chakotay tell you about my idea
yes
then you will allow me to stabilise the remaining molecules
you know i cant do that
your starfleet directive is no longer relevant i have found a way to control omega
i dont care if you can make it sing and dance were getting rid of it
a foolish decision
yes but its mine to make now step aside
i could have done this without your permission but i chose to  		follow your command structure i should have made the attempt i still can
but you wont you know im not trying to stop you from finding  		perfection but i cant risk the safety of this quadrant  		omega must end here we both know that status
eighteen percent
this could take hours can you increase the harmonic resonance
yes but it would rupture the chamber
how many molecules would we neutralise
forty fifty percent at best
thats good enough our torpedo can take care of the rest janeway to bridge
chakotay here
chakotay i want you to clear deck four put emergency forcefields  		around this section prepare to decompress cargo bay two on my command
understood
tuvok load the gravimetric torpedo once weve jettisoned the chamber fire
aye captain
harmonic resonance to maximum
commander theyre closing on us
theyre attempting to stop us with a tractor beam
adjust shields to compensate
theyre hailing us
on screen
disengage your engines and prepare to be boarded
i cant do that
youve stolen our technology abducted our people
your people are safe theyre receiving medical care  		ill be glad to get them back to you when this is over but were keeping the molecules
i wont allow this substance to fall into enemy hands ill destroy it first
theyre charging weapons
youll destabilise the molecules well both be destroyed
then return our technology now
im sorry thats not possible
direct hit shields down ten percent
evasive manoeuvres try to shake them off
harmonic resonance at maximum captain
the molecules
eighty percent remaining
we need to get that down to sixty
any damage to our power grid could overload the chamber omega would chain react
the same thought crossed my mind where are we now
seventy two percent
thats close enough bridge start the decompression sequence
acknowledged
whats wrong whats happening
the molecules are stabilising
what
ive done nothing its occurring spontaneously
thats impossible
decompression in thirty seconds decompression in twenty five seconds
seven lets move
decompression in twenty seconds
seven
decompression in fifteen seconds
decompression in ten seconds
tom are we clear of the subspace ruptures
almost
i need maximum warp within ten seconds or well be stuck at ground zero
yes sir
decompression is complete the harmonic chamber has been jettisoned
fire
we made it were at warp one
the alien ships
out of range
tuvok
sensors show no traces of omega molecules
mission accomplished
i wondered who was running my programme master da vinci doesnt like visitors after midnight
he protested i deactivated him
what are you doing here seven
this simulation contains many religious components i was studying them to  		help me understand what i saw in cargo bay two
the data isnt clear why omega stabilised in the last few seconds  		the chances are it was simply a chaotic anomaly nothing more
for three point two seconds i saw perfection when omega stabilised  		i felt a curious sensation as i was watching it it seemed to be watching me  		the borg have assimilated many species with mythologies to explain such moments of  		clarity ive always dismissed them as trivial perhaps i was wrong
if i didnt know you better id say you just had your first spiritual experience
when the captain told us to start collecting deuterium seven suggested a series of modifications to the bussard collectors the problem is i didnt realise the extent of the modifications until after wed begun the sweep i mean not that there was anything wrong with them in fact efficiency is up twenty three percent
in a nutshell harry
the collectors are almost full but i cant tell exactly how full until i realign my sensors with sevens
why didnt you just say so next time work closer with her from the start
closer right
so youre going to realign your sensors with sevens sounds like fun
very funny
what was that
are you getting feedback from sevens modifications
negative
report
i am picking up proton surges just outside the ship the first was off the port beam and the second two were off the starboard bow
on screen theres nothing out there
whatever it is its getting closer
red alert janeway to astrometrics
yes captain
use the astrometrics sensors to scan for the disturbance
im detecting close range weapons fire
source
proton surges suggest two cloaked ships engaged in battle
with us caught in the middle
evasive manoeuvres
aye sir
theres a massive power surge like one of the ships is exploding
captain there is one life sign aboard that vessel
it is no longer on our sensors
were being hailed audio only
lets hear it
chakotay please i need your help
chakotay are you reading me please answer
this is commander chakotay who are you
please anyone on voyager if you can hear me i need help
there has been an explosion on the vessel
the hull is destabilising life support is offline
beam her directly to sickbay
targeting her coordinates ive lost her trying again i dont understand i get a clear lock then it drops out
if we can get an away team over there we could stabilise her ship and tractor it in
do it
tom tuvok lets find out whats going on
environmental systems are not functioning oxygen levels are dangerously low
tom try to get life support online
no lifesigns
see if you can stabilise the hull ill look for the pilot hello can you hear me
chakotay is it you
yes im going to get this bulkhead off you
but the beam will fall
im going to pry the bulkhead off you when i say now get ready to roll out of there like your life depended on it
all right
ready
yes
now
i knew youd come
do i know you chakotay to voyager two to beam directly to sickbay
how is she
im not certain when i scan her the readings wont stay in the database luckily im a master of visual diagnosis she has a minor concussion and a compound tibular fracture nothing lifethreatening i can repair the damage
did you find out how she knows you
not yet
no i cant
shes coming around dont be frightened youre quite safe here
captain please i need asylum you must let me stay on your ship and weve got to get away from here theyll be coming after me
slow down a minute i have a few questions first who are you and how do you know my first officer
its a complicated story im not im not sure quite how to begin but if you dont give me asylum theyre going to track me down and theyre going to take me back and i dont want to go
we wont turn you over to anyone without knowing the whole story
thank you
chakotay i want you to stay with her she seems to trust you maybe youll be able to find out what this is all about
i hope so
keep me informed
once ive repaired the fracture shell need some bed rest
will you stay with me
of course
then ill be fine
there that should do it id ask you to monitor her vital signs but since they arent registering i suppose theres no point well i have several days worth of inoculation records to catalogue i suppose ill get to it
is he gone
yes
then were alone
in a manner of speaking can you start clearing up a few things now
ill try its complicated you see weve met before
if that were true im sure id remember
no you wouldnt you couldnt you see the memories of my people cant be held in the minds of other races when we encounter others which we do infrequently they remember us for a few hours but then the memories fade away were completely forgotten by the next day
is this done through technology telepathy
its a factor of our biology you see our bodies produce a sort of pheromone which blocks the longterm memory engrams of others
is that why the tricorder cant scan you why we couldnt get a transporter lock
were impervious to those sort of devices
your ships are cloaked as well
when you live a covert existence you develop technology to enhance it
but you say weve met before
about a month ago i spent several weeks here
several weeks
you and i worked closely together you helped me a great deal then i left knowing that you would forget everything about me
then why did you come back why the battle why ask us for asylum
i know you want everything in a nutshell thats the way you work but i have to tell you the whole story before it will make sense
fine im listening
i came back because i fell in love with you
she comes from ramura its a closed society that wont tolerate anybody trying to leave apparently she was disenchanted with that and wanted out theyre trying to bring her back thats why shes asking for asylum
but you say that she claims she was on voyager before this
about a month ago she says shes a tracer a kind of bounty hunter who tracks down people who try to leave their world she found a runaway hiding on voyager
she was here but nobody remembers it
thats what she says but i think we have to find a way to verify her story
i was looking at her ship it uses a sophisticated polarisation technique that causes our sensor scans to pass right through it she could have been shadowing us for quite a while
and learnt enough about us to convince us shes been here before
but why why go to that trouble and what about the battle with that other cloaked ship she put herself in danger when it would have been a lot easier simply to ask for asylum
i agree but i think we have to make sure she doesnt have some hidden agenda if she was here there should be some evidence of it she said a computer virus was planted to wipe all references to her being here but i have to believe we can at least turn up some evidence of tampering harry tuvok tom do the same with her ship see if the navigational logs support what shes saying
gentlemen i agree we should take precautions but you seem very suspicious of her
i want to make sure were not being manipulated
i agree if we grant her asylum well be in the position of having to protect her if were going to commit to that we should certainly find out if shes telling the truth id appreciate your thoughts on that
aye captain
i have successfully downloaded the navigational logs from your vessel
good now compare them with your own logs over the last two months
display voyagers route towards the alpha quadrant
now overlay my route there you see our ships travelled together for at least two weeks
you could have falsified your navigational logs
theres no proof that you ever came aboard voyager
thats what i always liked about you two such unyielding logic such refreshing scepticism run a diagnostic on my logs youll find they havent been altered
hows it going
her story seems to be legitimate but there are further steps to take
then take them i thought you might like to get something to eat unless your memories of our mess hall arent good
as a matter of fact i was quite fond of neelixs food
now thats something thats hard to believe
commander chakotays face became flushed as he spoke with her what does that signify
id rather not engage in speculation it is a dangerous pastime
i think our guest will enjoy this commander fried soy meal buttered carrots and a delightful almond pudding
sounds wonderful
very nice thanks neelix
you were very diplomatic
why do you say that
you hate carrots fried food upsets your stomach and you refuse to eat pudding because you think its slimy right
im curious when you were here before you said we worked together but you also said you were here to retrieve a runaway how was i involved
arent you more curious to hear about how we fell in love
we you said you were in love with me you didnt say i felt the same way
if you hadnt returned the feelings do you really think i would have taken such a terrible risk to get back to you
lets take it one step at a time how did you get on our ship
that was easy the hard part was looking for the runaway without anyone finding me i managed two days on the ship before i triggered an intruder alert and lost my cloak
and then what happened
and then i met you
wrong direction
i dont want to hurt you put your weapon down
on my ship i give the orders put yours down
i dont mean you any harm you have a stowaway on board ill retrieve him and well be on our way
thats not the way we do things here chakotay to tuvok im in cargo bay two i have our intruder
understood commander
youre about to find yourself outnumbered if you want to give me your weapon and explain whats going on ill listen
i felt an attraction right away but i couldnt afford to get distracted i had work to do and i didnt know if you felt it too
what happened next
you took me to captain janeway i explained the situation she didnt like the idea of a stowaway on her ship so she told you and tuvok to work with me to flush him out
and did we
you keep trying to jump to the end youre skipping all the parts about us
and you keep trying to talk about your feelings id rather you stick to the events not the emotions surrounding them
why does it make you uncomfortable
i dont want to play this game ive been assigned to talk to you to figure out whether or not youre telling the truth even if you are i have no memory of meeting you and i certainly have no memory of feeling anything for you you might remember a relationship between us but as far as im concerned it didnt exist
i see
im sorry i just want to make it clear how i feel
of course
is there anything i can do for you
can i have your pudding
gladly
then youre forgiven
chakotay and kellin report to the bridge immediately
its the tracers theyve found me
we dont detect any ships im assuming these are your people in cloaked vessels
theyve come to take me back
harry hail them
they wont answer
shes right captain no response their weapons are going through our shields as if they werent there
match shields to the frequency of their particle beams
no effect
shield strength down to twenty nine percent
theyll keep firing until you surrender or until i contact them and agree to come back
do you still want to stay with us
yes
all right tom get us our of here
that last volley damaged our propulsion systems we have thrusters only
captain if youll let me have access to your sensor systems i can modify then to detect the ships
do it this is the moment chakotay either we give her up or we fire back which one is it
fire
i think you might be able to detect them now but only for a minute or two
harry
affirmative two heavily armed ships off the port bow
can we get them on screen
thats the best i can do
tuvok target their weapons systems
firing
well done stand down red alert well it seems weve granted you asylum now youll have to give some thought to what you want to do
id prefer to remain on board
consider that carefully were headed for the alpha quadrant before long we will be so far from your world that if you change your mind you wouldnt be able to get back
i wont change my mind but i must warn you the tracers wont give up that easily your ship is still at risk
nothing we havent faced before
i was only able to make a temporary modification to your sensors if you let me access your astrometrics processors i could make that modification permanent
youll need a command officer with you to override the security lockouts
i can do that captain
go ahead tom coordinate with engineering to get the propulsion systems back online
im on it captain
well have to climb up to deck ten is something wrong
i cant relax until were far enough away that they realise they cant get me back and to my knowledge thats never happened before
theres always a first time
i have a high security clearance theyll be afraid im going to do exactly what im about to do show you how to detect them
look at it this way if they do figure out we can spot them they might realise they arent going to be able to take you back
youre such a kind person thats what i remembered most its what made me turn around and come back and sometime you might be interested in hearing about our last night together
evening commander craving a late night snack
no something to help me sleep got any ideas
i know humans think warm milk will do it frankly i find it repulsive
i agree whats available in the tea area
herbal is best i have several terran varieties as well as some more exotic blends
just mix me up whatever you think is the most relaxing
problems forgive me i wasnt trying to pry
i know that im just not sure how to answer you
hows our guest adapting to life on voyager
quite well i think
she must be happy to be here
im sure she is
forgive me commander but sometimes its best to be straightforward its obvious how she feels about you to me at least i see how she looks at you might that be the source of your consternation
she says she or rather we fell in love when she was here before since i cant remember any of that i dont know if its true but somehow its hard to believe
why is that
i dont know it just doesnt seem like me im still suspicious of her i dont know if shes using me in some way just for her own purposes
you dont trust her
not really
may i suggest that maybe its yourself you dont trust your own feelings that youre afraid of sweet dreams
i couldnt sleep i need to talk to you may i come in i was just wondering if you still had doubts about me or if you believe what i told you about us
your story seems to have been verified i believe youre telling the truth
and the rest of it what about us im not one to hold back as you may have noticed so ill get to the point i came here because of you i knew you wouldnt remember me but i was sure we could regain the feelings we had before they were there they were real but now im not so sure my being here puts this ship at risk its better for everyone if i go back to ramura so please be honest if you feel nothing for me just tell me and ill leave
dont go
its called ice cream
im surprised you didnt have any the last time you were here
i could eat this every day
then you should
voyagers a very powerful ship and very fast
weve met people with ships that are faster and more powerful but voyagers always managed to be a match for the best of them
ramuran vessels are fast they could stay up with this ship
kellin well keep you safe thats a promise
a tracer never goes home emptyhanded the disgrace would be too great when i was here before id been tracking that man for almost a year
but you know all the tricks you can use them against anyone who tries to come after you you said you were going to tell me about our last night together
let me show you you were sitting here in this chair and i was here and we were drinking something with bubbles
champagne
yes i wanted to celebrate id caught my runaway that day with your help
how was that
you came up with the idea of using a magneton sweep to disrupt his polarisation cloak we knew hed be watching me closely so we tricked him
im sorry you didnt get your fugitive
he must have jumped to another ship while voyager was in orbit of mikah last week ill find him eventually
if you think we can be of any more help let me know
thank you commander this is my problem ill handle it from now on just beam me back to my ship and ill backtrack to mikah goodbye and thank you again
ready to energise
hello resket you were a real challenge
i havent had the chance to welcome you to voyager too bad youll be leaving so soon
we put him in the brig once i used the neurolytic emitter on him he was only too happy to be going home again
neurolytic emitter
we use it on runaways it wipes their memories of the outside world
so we were celebrating
youd become much more than a friend to me but i knew i had to go home and youd forget about me within hours so i took the initiative
more than usual
oh yes i moved closer to you i thanked you profusely for all your help told you that i couldnt have done it without you and i touched you i told you i i cared very much for you and that i wanted something to remember you by and then i did this
thats when i knew you felt the same way but it didnt matter because i still had to go
but now you dont
if kellins going to be with us the captain wants her to serve a function to contribute in some way
a reasonable expectation what are her skills
basically she was a security operative for her people shes a trained expert in weaponry surveillance fighting skills any idea where she might fit in
mister neelix could use an assistant in the mess hall
tuvok that was a joke dont deny it you were trying to be funny
if you choose to interpret my remark as humorous that is your decision
i do and it was
its perfectly logical all the qualities you mentioned would help in defending neelix against the periodic wrath of the crew
maybe so but dont you think shed be better off as a member of your security detail
perhaps ill assign her to a team and let her observe for a week at the end of that time ill evaluate her situation
good enough
commander ive been giving some thought to the fact that the ramuran ships might be in pursuit and could attack us again
ive given that some thought myself
their proton weapons were particularly effective against us if kellin would work with seven and ensign kim perhaps we could devise a strategy to defend ourselves
im sure shell be happy to do that
have her report to astrometrics at thirteen hundred hours
ive downloaded data from our tactical logs you can access it from this console
our weapons are proton based particle beams very tightly focused
its like being hit with thousands of needles
they can penetrate any shield even if the modulations are changed
very clever
no defence has ever stopped these weapons
then maybe were about to make history
youve found a way to counteract them
i think so the trick is to scatter those beams a little make it harder for them to penetrate the shields i think we could do that by tying the baryon sensors into deflector control heres what i have in mind why dont you look this over and let me know what you think
ill do it right away
by the way i hear chakotay recommended you to tuvok to serve on a security detail
i want to help out in some way
a word of advice volunteer for beta squad theyre the best team youll learn a lot from them
i will thank you
when you mentioned commander chakotays name she flushed he did the same when he saw her
what are you saying
i suspect the commander and kellin are engaged in a courtship ritual it seems an unnecessary and complicated precursor to the act of procreation
i know you think so but trust me some people need those rituals
explain
its its usually considered a good idea if two people get to know each other a little before they become intimate
why is that
because its more comfortable you spend some time together you laugh you talk that makes it easier to to get closer
but the end result is the same is it not
well i guess so
then i fail to see what is accomplished by all the talk
seven if you dont get it then i cant explain it to you
obviously
i should have known they must have gotten somebody on board during the battle
youre jumping to conclusions
no theres a tracer hes here hes come for me that broken vase was a warning
well protect you im not going to let anything happen to you
its too late
no we can use the same magneton sweep we used to flush out resket well find this one and send him on his way
im afraid i cant let that happen
curneth dont
chakotay to security intruder alert my quarters
please i beg you dont do this
you know better than to ask that kellin
no
drop it drop it
youre too late shes already beginning to forget everything thats happened here
the doctor says theres nothing he can do your recent memories have already begun to fade
dont let this happen please dont let this happen
do you have any idea how we can reverse the effect
promise me if i forget why im here if i forget you do what i did and you tell me all about us and youll help me to remember
i will but im going to try to do more than that
can the effects of the neurolytic emitter be reversed
reversed i have no idea as far as i know no ones ever tried
then ill be the first tell me how the emitter works how it affects the memory centres
you sound desperate commander does kellin mean that much to you
what youre doing is wrong she wants to stay here
this is futile even if i knew how the emitter works i wouldnt tell you
you have no right to do this
i have every right the laws on our world are very specific about that no one may leave no one may reveal anything about us to the outside world kellin has violated both of those edicts returning her will serve as a deterrent to others who might think of leaving
did it ever occur to you that the fact that so many people want to leave might mean that theres something wrong with your society
we have a strong and cohesive society because of our efforts to keep it that way a few runaways among millions hardly indicates a problem
if there are so few why not let them go
that would suggest that we dont care about them what a terrible message
you may have wiped her memory but kellins not going back
maybe we should wait and see if thats what happens
she made it clear to me that she wants to stay here so maybe you should start practising what youre going to tell your superiors
yes
the doctor told me hed released you how are you feeling
im fine do i know you
yes at least you did
youll have to forgive me but i dont remember how i got here or anything else thats happened in at least the past few weeks
i know
i hope i wasnt throwing things in a fit of rage
no
i assume a tracer is here to take me back
thats right but what im going to say will sound strange but its what you asked me to do before you lost your memories you came here about a month ago looking for a runaway after you left with him you decided to come back
but if i finished my assignment why would i come back here
because youd fallen in love with me
forgive me youre certainly attractive but what youre telling me seems very unlikely
but its what happened we started to work together and i began to realise how unique you are before long i couldnt get you out of my mind
are you saying that you fell in love with me as well
yes and then we realisedthe tracer was on board after he used the emitter on you you made me promise to tell you all of this so you would know what happened between us
this is a little unsettling what is it you want from me
kellin dont go back with the tracer stay here for a while at least for a few days we can get to know each other again
i honestly cant imagine what would be served by that i have to go home
if you stayed you might change your mind
then thats all the more reason that i should leave now ive violated one of our most important edicts and i wouldnt want to make that mistake again i wish i wish we had met under different circumstances
your ships ready
thank you commander
ive implanted a computer virus to eliminate any reference to our being here by tomorrow afternoon youll have forgotten everything it will be as though we never existed its better that way
youre such a kind person i wont forget that
i wish you both the best
energise
more coffee commander
no thanks im almost done
strange to see you using those ancient writing implements
its the only way i could get a permanent record of whats happened in the last few days i want to get it down before i forget it all
im sorry things didnt work out for you
ive been trying to make sense of it i fell in love with her twice i thought she could do the same we were the same two people on the same ship why didnt it happen again i keep going over and over our last conversation trying to think if there was something i could have said could have done but nothing comes to mind
commander i dont think you can analyse love its the greatest mystery of all no one knows why it happens or doesnt love is a chance combination of elements any one thing might be enough to keep it from igniting a mood a glance a remark and if we could define love predict it it would probably lose its power ill let you finish
good night
then our philosophies are in agreement will you help us
im asking you to intimidate the kyrians with your technology help me capture their leader this ship has superior firepower he wont risk a conflict with you
a way home
your reputation in this quadrant precedes you thats why we sought you out
theres a cyclic wormhole five days journey from here we know where it is and we can help you stabilise it
how far do you have to go sixty thousand light years
youll have it within the hour
what do you suggest
our conflict is with tedran himself not his people theyre innocent
captain
the warship voyager one of the most powerful vessels of its time armed with photonic torpedoes and particle weapons this ship of destruction could wipe out an entire civilisation within hours on this particular day in history we were lucky the death toll could have been much worse by the time voyager targeted our major cities tedran had already begun an evacuation thousands of lives were saved unfortunately it was only the beginning of captain janeways onslaught as youll see her actions would have a lasting effect on our world even today seven hundred years later we are still feeling the impact of the voyager encounter before we continue the simulation id like to answer any questions you might have
im curious about voyager itself how many people were on board
we believe they had a complement of over three hundred soldiers
did they attack other worlds as well
well we arent certain records of voyagers travels through our quadrant are incomplete but its safe to assume that they interfered with many other cultures yes
tell us more about the borg drones they kept on the ship
voyager had many weapons at their disposal including species theyd assimilated along the way borg talaxian kazon they were captured and made to work as part of voyagers fighting force lets resume the simulation and you can see for yourself its a few hours after the initial bombardment janeway and her squadron are on the bridge mounting their assault now what you are about to see is graphic and unsettling
captain dont you think thats excessive
i want them defeated but but this is genocide
this wasnt our agreement
sequence in progress
i appreciate your hospitality are all your guests treated so well
state your demands
i understand what the vaskans want more of our territory more resources but what do you want captain why are you doing this to us
to reach your home you would destroy ours
no i would not
you have shamed us all we couldve ended this on our own peacefully without her
no
we will prevail
the ensuing conflict was brief but brutal two million kyrians slaughtered within days the warship voyager continued on its way leaving the kyrian dynasty in ruins the vaskan leaders proceeded to occupy our lands forcing my people into subservience it took centuries for us to undo the damage that captain janeway had done and the kyrian struggle for equality is far from over this simulation and this museum are a testament to that struggle i hope you found your experience here worthwhile if youd like to learn more about voyager and its role in the history of our planet i suggest you explore the rest of this exhibit thank you for your time
please feel free to test the simulators i wouldnt touch that if i were you one of the voyagers torpedoes twenty five isoton yield it could destroy an entire city within seconds its been inactive for centuries but you never know im only teasing but please be careful if we damage any of these relics they can never be replaced the history of our people should be respected
i have a question about that history
please
how can you prove that its true
take a closer look the evidence is all around you
some musty fossils and a recreation that doesnt prove anything
i disagree
youre trying to blame the vaskans for all your troubles the way you always do i dont have a problem with your species i have kyrian friends but i dont appreciate seeing my people being portrayed as villains in your little simulation and i certainly dont want your history taught to my children
youd better get used to the idea because weve just uncovered an artefact thats going to confirm everything youve seen here three weeks ago our research team found a data storage device buried nine metres beneath the ruins at kesef ive confirmed that it came from voyager
another fossil
the device contains active data possibly crew logs even captain janeways personal almanac in the next few days we could be hearing voyagers version of these events in their own words
and what if those words tell a different story what then
we will change our views accordingly
im sure you will
i apologise please enjoy the rest of your visit
activate recreation the voyager encounter display engine room
begin dictation im resuming work on artefact two seven one the voyager data storage device ive decided to try using period tools from the simulation itself with any luck theyll be more compatible hmm theres far more data here than i expected seems more like a programme of some sort yes yes its an optronic datastream a hologram
please state the nature of the medical emergency please state the nature of the medical emergency
i recognise you youre voyagers doctor
what am i doing in engineering wheres my mobile emitter
youre not an android
of course not what are you talking about a kyrian doctor to the bridge intruder alert security to engineering
you wont have much luck with that nothing in here is real its a simulation
a holodeck
no youre in the museum of kyrian heritage
youve stolen my programme how
please let me try to explain
try quickly
you are a hologram
that i know
i just discovered your programme inside this data storage device
thats the emh backup module one of your attack parties must have taken it from sickbay
actually we found it at the ruins at kesef i know this will be difficult for you to accept but a great deal of time has passed since voyager encountered the kyrians
how much time
seven hundred years give or take a decade were not certain
i dont believe you
think about it when your programme is inactive a moment or a millennium are the same to you
seven hundred years what about my ship what happened to my crew
no one knows its safe to say theyre long dead
and im some sort of fossil
no not a fossil a witness a living witness to history theres so much we dont know about what happened but you saw it you lived through those times you helped to shape them doctor you could be the most important discovery of all time
no this is impossible
doctor
i dont believe you
doctor
whats going to happen to me now will you put me on display the holographic rip van winkle
im not sure
i want to try to contact starfleet if there still is a starfleet
that will have to wait
wait for what
there are other issues to be resolved
what kind of issues
youre the voyager doctor a lot of people are going to have questions on our world artificial lifeforms are considered sentient and responsible for their actions you might have to face charges
charges
for your crimes you designed the bioweapons that killed eight million kyrians
i did nothing of the sort
all of our evidence shows that you were a war criminal
evidence what evidence like this for example triplearmoured hull thirty torpedo tubes twenty five phaser banks this isnt what our ship looked like
we reconstructed it from a partial schematic found in the cyrik ocean which was badly damaged by corrosion we were bound to get a few details wrong
voyager wasnt a warship we were explorers
yes i know trying to get home to mars
earth you see you couldnt even get that right this is a nightmare what if im found guilty whats going to happen to me
thats up to the arbiters but i imagine the penalty would be severe your programme could be decompiled
youve got to believe me to you this may be ancient history to me its yesterday you called me a living witness well at least give me the chance to set the record straight i want to see your version of what happened
pure fiction this is absurd
halt recreation this is a reasonable extrapolation from historic record but if youd like to point out any inconsistencies
inconsistencies i dont know where to begin granted this looks like the briefing room but these arent the people i knew no one behaved like this well aside from mister paris we werent at each others throats we didnt talk about how to destroy planets we helped people we were an enlightened crew
are you denying these events took place
yes
are you saying you never got involved with the conflict between my people and the vaskans
yes well no we did get involved but it was nothing like this
elaborate
there was a meeting in this room but it wasnt about battle tactics it was about a dilemma we were facing we had negotiated a trade agreement with the vaskans we were dealing with a representative ambassador
ambassador daleth
daleth exactly everything was going according to plan until we were attacked by your people the kyrians theyd picked that moment to start a war and we were caught in the middle
the kyrians were the aggressors no no that cant be right
captain janeway called this meeting to figure out how we could extricate ourselves from the conflict and still maintain the trade agreement with the vaskans but we werent on their side and we certainly never attacked you
save your objections until you see the entire recreation lets continue
somewhere halfway across the galaxy i hope captain janeway is spinning in her grave youve portrayed us as monsters the captains a coldblooded killer the crews a gang of thugs and im a mass murderer
calm yourself
why should i im about to be hanged for crimes i didnt commit
tell me your version of events
i remember this man
tedran he was a martyr to our people
some martyr he led the kyrian attack against voyager
youre lying
i was there
youre trying to protect yourself
and so are you from the truth isnt it a coincidence that the kyrians are being portrayed in the best possible light martyrs heroes saviours obviously events have been reinterpreted to make your people feel better about themselves revisionist history its such a comfort
we were not the aggressors in the great war we were the victims the proof can be found anywhere on this world the kyrian people are being oppressed to this day
the problems in your society are none of my business im just telling you what i saw seven hundred years ago
i dont believe you and neither will anyone else
what are you doing
shutting down your programme
wait please i can prove to you im right the medical tricorder the artefact you have on display if you just let me
lies
begin dictation ive reexamined the data module from what i can tell the doctor was telling the truth at least about one thing he is a hologram a backup programme we always knew he was an artificial lifeform but we thought he was an android if we were mistaken about that i wonder if we might also be wrong about voyager itself another question why would a hologram designed for medical purposes be programmed to lie so readily from the moment i activated him this doctor has insisted that hes innocent at first i didnt believe him end dictation
activate recreation the voyager encounter display medical chamber
please state the nature of the medical oh its you
youve given me a lot to think about
really i thought youd heard enough of my lies
i judged you too quickly im sorry
what changed your mind
time to think
for your information i dont appreciate being deactivated in the middle of a sentence it brings back unpleasant memories
it wont happen again
good because if you dont stop treating me like a secondclass hologram i wont cooperate with your investigation im perfectly happy to lie dormant in that module for a few eons
i didnt come here to argue
then what do you want
i dont know to talk i guess about what really happened seven hundred years ago
are you sure youre willing to listen to a massmurderer like me
im willing to keep an open mind thats the most i can promise try to understand my point of view all my life i thought i knew the truth there was never any doubt
i never meant to throw your beliefs into doubt but i cant deny what i know to be true
i realise that now and i want to know the truth and i want the arbiters to know it too
well the stage is certainly set but ill have to rewrite the characters and revise the plot a little im quite adept in the art of holographic programming if youll give me access to your technology maybe i can create a simulation of own show you what happened
then we agree in exchange well provide you with as much dilithium as you need
ill transport the canisters immediately it would be in your best interest to make this exchange quickly
weve been conflict with a neighbouring species the kyrians theyve been threatening to attack us war could break out any day weve tried every diplomatic option but the kyrians are a violent stubborn people
i wish i could make you one of our diplomats you might have better luck resolving this situation
the kyrians
id advise you to retreat captain
take as much of their technology as you can
back away
how typical of the kyrians
they fight the same way they live deviously
your crew is heroic captain
tedran this is between us leave these people out of it
i know what youre doing an alliance with these aliens
you expect me to believe that you plan to use this ship to destroy us
we wouldnt need help if we wanted to destroy you
computer freeze programme a tragic needless death but as you can see voyager was not responsible after tedran was killed voyager was attacked by nine kyrian ships my programme was disabled most likely when they stole my backup module the next thing i knew i was standing next to this gentleman seven centuries later
very entertaining
ill admit your holotechnology is new to me i had to extrapolate in a few places but i assure you this is an accurate recreation
perhaps or perhaps its the fabrication of a war criminal whos afraid for his life
do you have any evidence to support your explanation
in fact i do ive confirmed that this is the same tricorder i used to scan tedran at the moment of his death if i can access the bioreadings inside i can prove he was killed by a vaskan weapon not by captain janeway
can this be done
ive been trying to decipher the instrument for years but with the doctors help
i fail to see what this would prove tedran died on voyager a victim of a conspiracy to oppress my people the weapon used who fired it this is all beside the point
was there a conspiracy did voyager really help my ancestors to start the great war or were kyrians the aggressors as my people have always believed now this casts doubt on everything
but it doesnt change the fact my children cant attend the same academies as yours or that we are forced to live outside of the city centre
todays problems are not at issue here this is about history
look i dont know who started your war all im saying is that voyager wasnt responsible
i cant believe that you would cooperate with this murderer you of all people you built this museum
the facts are turning out to be more complex than i expected
we shouldnt be listening to this hologram i want him arrested and charged for the crimes we know he committed
thats not your decision to make
no its not is it im only on this commission because you needed a token kyrian
please this isnt about race
its always about race you seize every opportunity to keep yourselves in power
im sorry you see it that way i think we are obligated to hear what the doctor has to say proceed with your investigation
yes arbiter
youll pay for your crimes
seven hundred years and im still caught in the middle of your little dispute one might have hoped for a bit of social progress in the interim
change never comes easily for us
hmm thats an understatement
ive entered the specifications that you gave me
lets give it a try  hmm close enough this diagnostic tool should help me get past the initial encryption sequences too bad we cant recreate belanna torres
torres the chief transporter operator
chief engineer you might want to make the correction in your history books
what was she like torres i suppose weve gotten her personality wrong too
starting to believe me are you
well lets just say im trying to keep an open mind
belanna torres intelligent beautiful and with a chip on her shoulder the size of the horsehead nebula she also had a kind of vulnerability that made her quite endearing
you miss her and the others
from my perspective i saw them all only a few days ago but in fact its been centuries and ill never see them again did they ever reach home i wonder
ive always wondered that too from as far back as i can remember
really
ever since i was a small child the first time i heard the name voyager it conjured up my imagination
even though we were the bad guys
that didnt matter i was too young to understand the implications the fact you were so far from home travelling across the stars ah i found it all very heroic i suppose voyager is what made me fall in love with history
if it means anything to you you would have made a fine member of our crew
i hope thats part of the simulation
no it isnt
everything goes the days of lies are over destroy it all
no stop this
we know about the hologram this museums filled with lies
stop listen to me
weve listened long enough
theyre using photon grenades weve got to take cover this way
whats happening ive been hearing weapons
its getting worse protests vandalism two people have been killed dont worry theyve cordoned off the museum were safe for now
thats not what im concerned about two deaths a race riot all because of me
you were only the catalyst the pressures been building for years it was only a matter of time before something set it off have you found the tricorder
not yet
its crucial that we do the kyrians are demanding you be punished for your crimes but the vaskans want to hear your version of events again they want to continue the investigation
whats going to happen
i dont know the vaskans are more powerful but the kyrians are very angry theyre talking about another war
then theres only one solution delete my programme ive become a kind of symbol for this conflict as long as im around your people are going to keep on fighting ill show you how to decompile my programme you can say i was damaged in the attack last night no one will hold you responsible
i cant do that to you
then ill do it myself
no
im a medical hologram programmed to do no harm but im doing harm on a global scale ever since you reactivated me ive been concerned with clearing voyagers good name but thats not important now theres more at stake
a few days ago i might have agreed with you but what about the facts
facts be damned names dates places its all open to interpretation whos to say what really happened and ultimately what difference does it make what matters is today and the future of your people
doctor you were there you cant deny what happened
i can and i will tedran was a martyr for your people a hero a symbol of your struggle for freedom who am i to wander in seven hundred years later and take that away from you
history has been abused we keep blaming each other for what happened in the past if you dont help us now it could be another seven hundred years
lets find that tricorder
it was a pivotal moment in our history as a result of the doctors testimony a dialogue was opened between our peoples eventually we found a new respect for our divergent cultures and traditions the efforts of people like quarren and the doctor paved the way for unity quarren died six years later but he lived long enough to witness the dawn of harmony
and the doctor
well he served as our surgical chancellor for many years until he decided to leave he took a small craft and set a course for the alpha quadrant attempting to trace the path of voyager he said he had a longing for home this way
the ship is grey captain weve cut power to decks four through nine replicators holodecks and all other nonessentials are offline remaining systems are operating at twenty percent capacity
tom how long can you keep us flying
with the deuterium supply this low even at one quarter impulse well be out of gas inside a week
everyone redouble your efforts keep your eyes open for new sources of deuterium tuvok chakotay i want recommendations for further methods of conservation harry you and i will give them a hand in geophysics see if we cant synthesise a substitute fuel in the meantime we stay in grey mode if anybodys got any other ideas im listening
we could set up a bicycle in the mess hall attach a generator pedal home
now why didnt i think of that
and i volunteer harry to take the first shift
living space will be extremely limited take only those personal items which are absolutely essential
hello there
what may i ask is this
that mister vulcan is the selected works of jirex
only essential items mister neelix
oh jirex is essential hes the greatest writer in the talaxian canon i never go to sleep without reading at least one of his parables
a habit you will have to break until were able to restore power to crew quarters
i suppose i can try
and these
i get terrible neck pains without them
i suggest you ask the doctor to prescribe an antiinflammatory
fine i dont mind roughing it
mister neelix the blankets
no no thats where i draw the line my mother knitted these herself ive slept with them since i was a child
youll have to make do with standard issue bedding
those starfleet blankets give me a rash
i suggest you ask the doctor
for some antiitch cream i might as well sleep in sickbay thank you mister vulcan youve just given me an idea
whats going on here
im working
you were ordered to shut down astrometrics an hour ago we cant afford the power seven its inefficient
efficiency is relative commander if i shut down astrometrics i wont be able to scan for new fuel sources
i appreciate your efforts but well have to use conventional scanners until
conventional scanners would not have found this
what
highly concentrated deuterium
where
computer display source a planetoid point four lightyears from our present position there are dense pockets of deuterium just beneath the surface
maybe so but thats a demon class planet
demon class
thats what starfleet calls it also known as class y its got a toxic atmosphere filled with thermionic radiation surface temperatures are in excess of five hundred kelvins just entering a standard orbit would be suicide
our situation is desperate
true
when faced with desperate circumstances we must adapt
narrow the annular confinement beam to point four seven terahertz ready here captain
stand by harry shunt whatever additional power you can to the containment field i dont want any of those atmospheric gasses seeping in
aye captain
a thermionic discharge has struck the forward shields theyre holding
lets get this over with before you tell me otherwise seven do it
energise transport in progress
shields are weakening
im reading an overload in the pattern buffers
abort transport
controls not responding
get out of there now
computer seal off the transporter room and erect a level ten containment field
containment field established
the good news is nozawa and seven of nine have both been treated and released from sickbay and the planetary gases have been expelled from the transporter room
and the bad news
the transporters are offline itll take days before theyre back again
great we use valuable energy on a course change and all we get for our trouble is another downed system can we send a probe to collect the deuterium
it would incinerate within seconds of entering the upper atmosphere
then i dont see any other options tom put us back on our original course one quarter impulse
captain maybe i can help
harry the bicycle thing was just a joke
ive been thinking with tuvoks shield modifications and a few tweaks to an environmental suit i could take a shuttle to the surface and mine the deuterium from there
need i remind you ensign that there is no environment less hospitable to humanoid life than a class y
actually tuvok no you neednt remind me whats the alternative resume course creep along at quarter impulse hoping we find fuel before we end up dead in the water weve got deuterium within arms reach we cant let the opportunity slip away without at least trying
hes got a point
you wouldnt be able to communicate with us if you got in trouble and until we get transporters back we couldnt beam you out
even with modifications it wouldnt be long before your suit began to corrode exposure to that atmosphere could kill you within minutes
i know the risks
even if i agreed id never let you go alone
of course not thats why im volunteering my good buddy tom here to go with me
you were pretty forceful in there
so
so i dont think ive ever seen you that assertive in a staff meeting before you must be bucking for a promotion
i had an idea and i spoke up thats all
oh no no no it was more than that you put tuvok in his place right in front of everybody
he was stating the obvious again talking down to me like i didnt know anything about demon class planets
i am not criticising you believe me nobody enjoys seeing the vulcan master put down a peg more than i do i was just surprised thats all
why
it didnt seem like you
good
cargo bay two
you trying to change your squeaky clean image or something
not exactly
what then
how do i explain this when i first came on board voyager i was pretty green right
a deep almost fluorescent green if i remember correctly
i was young inexperienced and i acted like it nervous about giving my opinion hesitant to make suggestions so i usually just kept my mouth shut and i behaved that way for so long it became a habit but in the last four years a lot has happened ive fought the borg been transformed into an alien helped defeat the hirogen hell ive even come back from the dead
its been a wild ride
i woke up the other morning and it suddenly hit me ive got a lot of experience now so why should i be afraid to take the initiative or voice my ideas
good for you harry
but do me a favour the next time you try to assert yourself leave me out of it i hate hot weather
dont worry we can cut some holes in the environmental suits get some ventilation going
harry while youre busy improving yourself you might try working on your sense of humour
my sense of humour what about that stupid gag about the bicycle
oh ho ho that was funny
no that was not funny
i cant thank you enough for getting me in on this mission harry
dont mention it
remind me to volunteer you to help the next time i have to clean the warp plasma manifolds
really tom you dont owe me anything
oh but i do weve lost attitude control
time to show off your piloting skills think you can handle it
watch me
oh ill be watching you all right switching to manual control
just sit back relax and enjoy the ride
were entering the lower atmosphere approaching the landing coordinates
all right im going to set us down on my mark
mark
you did that on purpose didnt you
its almost five hundred degrees kelvin
dont worry the suits can handle it
if not well be human barbecue
im picking up traces of deuterium fifty metres that way lets move
no sweat
lame
its coming from inside here
what is it
some kind of metallic compound highly viscous and if these readings are right its temperature is only twelve degrees
in this environment
whatever this stuff is its packed with liquefied deuterium
jackpot
theres another pool twenty metres that way why dont you go check it out while i collect a few samples here
right i dont know harry a couple of lounge chairs a big beach umbrella maybe some dermalplast to counteract the chemical burns and i think weve found ourselves a new vacation spot oh come on that was a little funny let me hear you do better harry harry
oh my god
i know its hot out harry but you picked a lousy time to go for a swim
i dont know what happened i leaned over to collect a sample and it was like i was pulled in
warning ensign kim an environmental seal has been compromised oxygen depletion in thirty seconds
hang in there buddy and ill get you back to the shuttle have you put on weight
youre just out of shape
warning oxygen depletion in fifteen seconds
ill make you a deal you hold your breath till we get back to the shuttle and i promise ill start exercising every day
maybe you should start with the bicycle
i thought i told you to hold your breath
warning oxygen depletion in five seconds
hang in there harry well make it
warning lieutenant paris an environmental seal has been compromised oxygen depletion in thirty seconds
youve got to be kidding me were in the same boat now buddy but ill get us out of this
warning oxygen depletion in fifteen seconds
youre right i definitely need to get back in shape
warning oxygen depletion in five seconds
out of the question
be reasonable doctor
take it up with commander chakotay hes on his way here right now
but its only for a couple of days just until we get power back in the crew quarters
i suggest you set up camp in the mess hall
the mess hall is full where are we supposed to sleep
anywhere but here this is a sickbay not a dormitory
but you have four empty beds
biobeds reserved for patients
you dont have any patients
i may have one in a moment if you and your fellow squatters dont go elsewhere
you wanted to see me doctor
oh its about time mister neelix is attempting to turn my sickbay into a flophouse
we are short on beds right now weve got to adapt
ah ha
but what if theres a medical emergency
then neelix and the others will get out of the way
absolutely
but this isnt just sickbay its my residence
and we promise to be the most perfect houseguests
what more can you ask for
but i have a routine im a night owl what if one of them should snore while im listening to puccini
well if you feel that strongly about it doc i suppose well have to consider other options
thank you commander
for example we could shut down your programme until youre needed the captain asked me to look for ways to conserve power and it would spare you from having to listen to them snore
commander chakotay to the bridge
on my way
but
make yourselves at home
try scanning for infrared signatures
theres too much interference
whats up
tom and harry still arent back
you want me to take another shuttle down and look for them
and risk losing you too either we keep waiting until we run out of deuterium and we get trapped in orbit or
or
we land the ship
as you know captain the landing procedure requires a significant output of energy with shield strength as low as it is we cant even be certain the ship will survive the descent
whats the alternative were up here the deuteriums down there and were stuck without it weve come this far janeway to engineering vent all plasma from the nacelles transfer any available power to atmospheric thrusters and stand by to commence landing sequence
acknowledged captain
commander chakotay take the conn
toms going to be sorry he missed this
code blue
commander tuvok to all hands go to blue alert and report to code blue stations
atmospheric controls at standby landing struts online inertial dampers at maximum
all operative decks report condition blue
let us down easy commander
were on a declining glide trajectory altitude one hundred and fifty kilometres
a thermionic discharge shields down to eighty one percent shields at forty three percent
chakotay
i think were through the worst of it almost
shields at twenty two percent and falling
can you shore them up
negative theres no more available power
engaging landing struts brace for impact
status
i could give you a litany of damaged systems captain but suffice it to say now that were down we wont go up again soon
start organising repair crews that was very good commander take an away team and find harry and tom
chakotay youre going out to look for them arent you
thats right
take me with you
i cant do that belanna youre needed here to complete repairs
ive already handed out assignments voriks on top of it i want to help you find them
look i know youre concerned about tom and harry we all are ill have them back safe and sound in no time
dont patronise me we both know how dangerous that environment is they could be in serious trouble
youre right i dont know what were going to find thats why i need cool heads
you think i cant control myself
i think youre a little too close to this
youre damn right i am if someone you loved was missing on this planet you would be the first one out that door and you know it
belanna the clock is ticking go back to engineering do your job and let me do mine
do me a favour
what
take seven of nine with you
youre recommending her
you said you needed cool heads didnt you nobodys head is cooler than hers
all right
and bring them back safe
i will
excuse me doctor
yes mister neelix
wed like to sleep now if you dont mind
not at all make yourselves comfortable
but you seem busy
oh dont mind me just going about my routine sleep away
what about the lights
what about them
could we turn them off
you dont expect me to work in the dark do you
well no but ill never be able to fall asleep
thats not my problem is it
ive got a very very busy day tomorrow and my next shift is just four hours away
perhaps you should have thought of that when choosing your accommodations
well if we cant sleep i guess well just have to find some other way to pass the time how about a singalong i could teach you all some talaxian rondos and i know a vulcan funeral dirge not to mention the classics of klingon opera
very well mister neelix you win pleasant dreams
computer lights off
youre a little jumpy arent you
i thought i heard something
now you know why they call it demon class
demon implies a presence this planetoid is unoccupied
im picking up the shuttlecraft
nobody home
its unlikely their environmental suits were able to survive the elements for this long
i hope youre wrong
looks like they went this way
my tricorder isnt picking up any lifesigns how did you reach that conclusion
footprints i guess you never assimilated any indian scouts
high concentrations of deuterium coming from this fluid ill collect a sample
lets find tom and harry first well collect the deuterium later
as you wish
maybe they found some shelter inside
commander
good to see you guys welcome to the demon planet our suits were corroding our lungs were burning we were suffocating you know what they say about your life passing before your eyes well its true i was finally getting past puberty when suddenly i lost consciousness i dont know how long i was out but the next thing i knew i was awake and i was breathing normally and i looked over at harry he was breathing normally too with his helmet off and and we just looked at each other and we just started laughing i know it sounds crazy but it was an exhilarating experience
his vital signs are normal apparently he has adapted
just the same wed better let the doctor take a look at you chakotay to voyager
ive already tried that the comm signal cant get out of the caves
then well call again when we get back outside
im telling you chakotay it was an amazing experience it its like when youre a kid whos afraid of the water and you suddenly realise that you can swim go ahead take your helmets off try it
im glad youre feeling all right but none of us should be taking any risks until we know exactly whats going on
dont tell me that a big tough guy like you is afraid of a little poisoned atmosphere
wheres harry
hes further inside the cave we found a huge cache of deuterium
lets find him and get you two back to the ship
whatever you say boss but im telling you we could breathe this air forever
lieutenant
yes
we should have transporters back online within the hour
well thats great but right now im more concerned with little things like oh i dont know say life support
indeed according to my calculations environmental systems will cease to function in two hours
you say that like youre giving me the weather report
i agree the situation is dire but losing our cool will not help matters
losing our cool where did you pick up that expression
mister paris
well theres hope for you yet now how about giving me a hand
harry
commander isnt it incredible
thats what ive been trying to tell them
are you feeling okay harry
never better if we could get mobile transporters down here we could mine enough deuterium to get us all the way to the alpha quadrant and back again
tom tells me youve already picked up twenty kilos that should be enough to get the main systems back online lets get back to the ship have the doctor take a look at you
id rather stay here and keep working if its all the same to you
its not
really commander im fine you should send some more personnel out to help they wont even need environmental suits
i appreciate your enthusiasm but were going back to voyager now
its all right harry once the doc takes a look at us and sees were fine well get right back to work
status mister tuvok
ive shut down life support everywhere but decks one and five it should provide us with an extra hour of breathable air
chakotay to voyager
janeway here
weve found tom and harry
first good news ive had all day what about the deuterium
weve got
a few kilos were on our way back to voyager now
whats your position
about two kilometres from the ship
captain
transporters are coming back online we should be able to beam you back from that distance but it may take a few minutes
have the doctor standing by i think hes going to want to look at tom and harry
computer lights maximum illumination everybody up rise and shine mister neelix
whats going on
its checkout time
its the middle of the night
medicine knows no time clock ive got patients on the way and theres no more room at the inn
patients is somebody sick
i cant answer that until ive examined them now can i
examine who
ensign kim and lieutenant paris
is there anything i can do to help
yes you and your friends can vacate the premises
right move you heard the doctor this is an emergency evacuation move move move doctor
yes
thanks for your hospitality and if you ever need a place to stay my doors always open
energising
beam tom and harry to sickbay
what happened to them
as soon as we beamed aboard they started suffocating
computer erect a level seven forcefield around biobeds one and two
forcefield established
what are you doing
filling the area inside the forcefield with the atmospheric gases from the planet try to breathe normally now easy or youll hyperventilate slowly in and out in and out
that stuff is in our blood
im afraid so from what i can tell youve been bioformed
bioformed
think of it as the opposite of terraforming in the same way we adapt the environment of a planet to suit our needs this planet has adapted you
how is that possible
this fluid somehow entered your bloodstream and began altering your physiology at the cellular level i havent had the time to analyse this substance but i hope to have answers soon
id like to run a few tests of my own if you dont mind
of course
so whats our prognosis doc
well youll be fine as long as you keep breathing the planets gases
you mean we have to stay inside this forcefield
im afraid its worse than that the atmosphere of this planet cant be replicated safely
which means if we leave well have nothing to breathe
exactly either we find a way to treat your condition or youll have to be left behind
can the bioforming process be reversed
as it stands i dont know enough about the phenomenon to undo it
ill send chakotay and seven back to the surface theyll gather as much information as they can belanna and i will start running tests on this
let me go with the away team captain i know the terrain i can help
doctor
right now theyre better off out there than they are in here but one of you will have to remain so i can monitor your condition
no problem i volunteer tom to stay here and play guinea pig
each square kilometre of this planetoid is less appealing than the last
i think its breathtaking
breathtaking
yes
perhaps your recent experience has impaired your perceptions
no i dont think so i wasnt really seeing it before
seeing what
the beauty
would you care to point out an example
look over there what do you see
i see monochromatic geological formations dust haze
what do you see harry
to me those geological formations are a dozen shades of red and gold that dust its glowing and the haze it seems to intensify the colours im sorry i know its weird but i feel connected to this place
connected how
im picking up humanoid lifesigns
location
one hundred metres this way
magnify factor ten deuterium hydrogen sulphate dichromates
add a little sodium chloride and it would probably taste a lot like neelixs soup
we should be so lucky oh whats this magnify factor twenty
captain thats a protein molecule
this fluid has organic properties let me see the sample thats been treated with the reagents
captain
lets get you to sickbay
wait that might not be necessary
commander
janeway to bridge report
a large pool of the metallic compound is forming beneath the ship we are sinking captain
on my way get down to engineering get thrusters online were getting off this planet
im not sure how but theyre still alive
just barely
tuvok to chakotay
go ahead
the captain has ordered an emergency ascent
we must bring you back to the ship
understood ive got five to beam back
five
we found another paris and kim
i cant explain it
i think i can prepare for transport
beam us directly to sickbay
no i dont want to go back
transporters are still acting up we cant get individual locks were going to have to grab you in a wide beam and bring you in as a group
acknowledged
i belong here
maybe so but until we know whats going on youve got to come back with us to the ship harry no
four of the away team are in sickbay captain im trying to get a lock on the fifth it is ensign kim or rather one of the ensigns kim the ship is continuing to sink
then theres no time weve got to get back into orbit well worry about harry or whoever he is once were up bring antigrav thrusters online
thrusters enabled
inertial dampers to flight configuration
dampers reconfigured all stations report ready
initiating ascent i need power to the thrusters
we are being restrained by an electromagnetic force
compensate
no effect decks fourteen and fifteen are submerged the ship is continuing to sink
report
thrusters are offline due to an overload decks thirteen through fifteen are submerged if we dont lift off soon the hull will begin to corrode
bridge to engineering
ensign vorik here
i need thrusters back online
lieutenant torres has already sent a team to the thruster control junction
how long
at least a half an hour
even if thrusters are repaired they wont be of much use if we sink any deeper
there must be some way to disperse it try a nadion burst from the phaser emitters it may weaken the electromagnetic properties of the fluid
aye captain
im on my way to sickbay to check on harry and tom youve got the bridge
how are they
lucky the backup systems in their environmental suits kept their vital functions going itll take time but theyll recover
and him
aside from his ability to breathe the rarified air on this planet hes the exact duplicate of mister paris he even seems to share his memories not to mention his winning personality
belanna and i discovered that the fluid has mimetic properties somehow it reads the dna of whatever it comes in contact with and recreates it
fascinating
can you tell me who you are
please just let me go back
not until i find out why two of my crew have been duplicated
captain you have to believe me i dont know any more than you do about this until he showed up i thought i was tom paris a little changed by my experience on the planet maybe but now i dont know who or what i am all i know is that i have to get off this ship and go back down to the surface
were ready to try the nadion burst captain
do it
ow what are you doing
captain were receiving an urgent hail its from ensign kim the one on the surface
put him through
captain please stop what youre doing
if you really do have harry kims memories you know that im going to do whatever it takes to get this ship back in orbit
you cant do that
why not
i im not sure i understand it myself
well then youre going to have to help me figure it out mister tuvok im on my way to transporter room one erect a level seven forcefield around the platform fill it with atmosphere from the planet and then beam mister kim or rather his duplicate aboard
aye captain
do you have a lock on him
yes maam
energise
release my vessel
we cant do that
we
the planet and i were connected somehow i cant explain it captain i only know that youve got to stop
and im willing to stop but ill say it again release the ship
no we need you
janeway to tuvok fire
what are you
stop no
ill fire again
youre killing us
you leave me no choice
its not fair its wrong
janeway to tuvok
no no no no please no more
hold your fire tuvok
captain we are continuing to submerge
hold your fire
acknowledged
i want some answers
im trying to understand this is hard for me as well
you said you have a connection to this planet you talk about it like its alive
alive yes but not the planet the silver blood
the compound that sampled harrys dna and created you
yes but its never been conscious never sentient before now before me and the other
tom paris
were the first dont you see you came here you showed us when the compound came in contact with tom and harry it experienced awareness for the first time before it was only instinct sound and light and heat but those two showed us thought
im beginning to understand this silver blood experienced sentience and now you want more you want to duplicate the rest of this crew and populate this planet
youre trying so hard to reach home but this can be home
not for me and not for my people do you understand why we cant stay here
i think so
well then release us
wed rather die than be alone we deserve life
this silver blood that created you it duplicated harry without killing him so you dont need our bodies only samples ofdna release voyager and ill speak to my crew and if theyre willing ill let you duplicate the rest of us
bridge to janeway weve stopped captain were no longer submerging
understood were getting out of here tuvok but first assemble the crew in cargo bay one
and have the doctor meet me there
captain
ill explain later
its time to meet your new family
all stations report ready for lift off
code blue status confirmed
take us up mister paris
aye captain
lieutenant ensign
hey seven
have some dinner the potato salad isnt half bad
i do not require nutrition at this time i would like to talk with you
okay
ensign kim what is your place of origin
you mean where am i from well i was born in south carolina but i grew up in
lieutenant torres explain why you became a member of the maquis
it was through chakotay i met him well actually he saved my life
list the sports you play
ive dabbled in quite a few tennis pareses squares but my favourite is volleyball
specify the foods you find enjoyable
seven what is this
describe the nature of your sexual relationship with lieutenant paris
okay thats it
computer freeze programme would you care to explain what youre doing
im doing exactly what you instructed me to do
i hardly think so i created this programme to help you become more comfortable in social situations not to practice alienating people
you made recommendations about how to carry on a conversation
thats true
you said its helpful if people feel youre interested in them
correct
and that drawing them out by asking them about themselves is one way to demonstrate that interest
that doesnt mean subjecting them to an interrogation you have to let them answer listen to what theyre saying ask another question on the same subject take your time shall we try again
i believe i am overdue for my weekly medical maintenance we should go
seven youve never volunteered for a checkup before
it is preferable to remaining here
what have we got here
looks like a mutara class nebula with a few trace constituents that arent in our database but theyre showing up in minute quantities
the nebula is vast captain it extends beyond the reach of our sensors
oh then i guess we wont try to go around it tom take us in at one half impulse
yes maam
im detecting a slight radioactive field its oh oh
harry
nothing its just a headache coming on
maybe you should go to sickbay
yeah maybe so
captain
oh god
tom turn us around get us out of here
janeway to sickbay
yes captain
we need help
what happened
im being inundated with calls
hurry
seven go to the bridge use the dermal regenerator to treat the burns
course laid in
weve cleared the nebula
all stop
hes dead
the nebula extends for at least one hundred ten light years possibly more
at the least it would take us well over a month to get through it and more than a year to get around it
the crew was unable to tolerate the nebula for even a few minutes they certainly could not survive a month
weve come fifteen thousand light years we havent been stopped by temporal anomalies warp core breaches or hostile aliens and i am damned if im going to be stopped by a nebula ill be in sickbay
ive analysed a sample of the gases from the nebula i think the damage came from subnucleonic radiation even the briefest exposure is devastating to organic tissue
can you give us any protection against the effects
yes stasis chambers independent life support for each unit
are you suggesting that the entire crew be put in suspended animation
yes i of course would stay online in order to monitor everyone
this is a drastic step doctor are there any other options adjusting the shields inoculations
i assure you ive considered all possibilities this is the only way
theres more to getting through the nebula than monitoring the crew who would regulate ships systems make course adjustments
i think ive demonstrated that i have a command of the rudimentary aspects of piloting
of course you have and i know you could do it but youll need backup we have no idea what effect the nebular radiation might have on your holomatrix what if you went offline
there was only one crewmember besides myself that seemed unaffected by the nebula
i want you to understand the seriousness of this responsibility the lives of the entire crew will be on your shoulders
you doubt my ability to fulfil this task
ordinarily not at all but this is an unusual situation after being in the collective it wasnt easy for you to adjust to a ship with only a hundred and fifty people on it was it seven how would you feel with only the doctor for company
i will adapt
most humans dont react particularly well to long periods of isolation borg drones have even more difficulty
as you pointed out i am neither borg nor human i can do this captain
all right ill work with the senior staff to draw up a list of duties but let me make it clear the doctor will be in command you will follow his instructions just as you would follow mine
follow the orders of a hologram
hes our chief medical officer and he is thoroughly grounded in starfleet protocols you will report to him
i understand
the doctors preparing the stasis units now they should be ready by seventeen hundred hours
and how long will this be for
we dont know for certain at least a month maybe longer if the nebula is larger than we estimate
ive never been in long term stasis are there any side effects
the doctor assures me itll be just like taking a nap well go into the units our cardiopulmonary systems will be slowed neural activity suspended and well wake up feeling as though wed had a good nights sleep
there are things that can go wrong at least thats what ive read
we will be carefully monitored by seven and the doctor who will check our vital signs four times a day and take care of any other problems
i assume that weve explored all the alternatives
i think were all feeling uneasy about this and id be lying if i said i dont have concerns myself and i think its about loss of control we always feel better if we think were in charge of our own circumstances in stasis were giving up that control and no starfleet officer likes to do that but crews have been in stasis much longer than a month i think we can handle this all right youre free until seventeen hundred hours ill make a shipwide announcement when the doctors ready dismissed
something else
i want you to tell me that this isnt a mistake
your turn to get reassurance
maybe but my concern isnt about going into stasis its about who youre leaving in charge
youre worried about seven
maybe you need to step outside yourself for a minute look at the fact that heres someone whos butted horns with you from the moment she came on board who disregards authority and actively disobeys orders when she doesnt agree with them
and this is the person im giving responsibility for the lives of this entire crew i suppose you want me to tell you im not crazy
in a nutshell i know your bond with seven is unique different from everyone elses from the beginning youve seen things in her that no one else could but maybe you could help me understand some of those things
i dont know if i can its just instinct theres something inside me that says she can be redeemed in spite of her insolent attitude i honestly believe she wants to do well by us
thats good enough for me
see you at seventeen hundred hours
if i have to take a nap for a month i really would rather do it in my quarters
everyones being relocated here to deck fourteen so we can monitor you more easily hop in
come on tom sleepy time
what if we had to get out in a hurry
you can unlock the unit from inside tom
do i detect a hint of claustrophobia lieutenant
why do they have to design these things like coffins
should we replicate you a teddy bear
sleep tight
have no worries captain youll go to sleep and the next thing you know ill be standing over you telling you were through the nebula
im leaving the ship in good hands i have every confidence in both of you see you in a month
its just the two of us now
nutritional supplement fourteen beta seven
computer adjust heading by point three four seven degrees starboard
course adjusted
seven of nine to the doctor
go ahead
lieutenant paris has left his stasis unit and is unconscious
ill be right there
apparently hes more claustrophobic than i thought but he doesnt seem to have suffered any ill effects
is this likely to happen again
its not unheard of for people to come out of stasis and start wandering leave it to mister paris to be just as much trouble now as when hes awake
you knew this might happen why complain about it
if you had even the slightest sense of humour youd realise i was making a small joke
very small
give me his vital signs please
pulse forty two body temperature ninety seven point six blood pressure one hundred over fifty
good
i will continue on my rounds
i think not were paying a visit to the holodeck
i have no time for frivolous pursuits
this isnt frivolous its essential youve been getting more irritable and shorttempered with each passing day
so have you
only because im having to put up with you i think you need a little brushup course in getting along with people
there is no one here to get along with
im here this isnt a suggestion and its not a request its an order
try one commander
thank you neelix
captain
ooo what have we here delicious
join the party seven its no fun to stand there by yourself
i have no desire to have fun
no
i am attempting to recalibrate the warp field in order to resist the nebulas radiation i understand you have some knowledge of warp field theory perhaps you could assist me
id be happy to give it a try lets see the subspace field matrix looks right
captain
excuse me
perhaps you could help as well were attempting to find a stronger warp field calibration
how interesting maybe if we vary the em stress parameters the warp field dynamic would increase
excellent idea captain and if the warp coils were rephased it would increase power to the nacelles
there is an additional problem we must compensate for a subspace induction drag on the engines
pardon me captain mister neelix computer freeze programme youre completely missing the point of this exercise youre supposed to be mixing and mingling not working on engineering problems
you ordered me to participate in this programme you did not specify topics of conversation
youre splitting hairs you know very well what purpose this programme is supposed to serve
i find that it serves no purpose whatsoever
because youre being intentionally perverse
holodecks are a pointless endeavour fulfilling some human need to fantasise i have no such need
what you need is some editorial skill in your selfexpression between impulse and action there is a realm of good taste begging for your acquaintance
i find your selfexpression ponderous
and i cant put up with this for another month
we can arrange to avoid one another
i wish it were that simple unfortunately you have to report to me four times a day to keep me informed about the crew
we can minimise those reports
warning emergency procedures in effect
computer what is the nature of the emergency
the antimatterstorage tanks are failing
a cascade effect is in progress the warp field coils are compromised primary deuterium tank is rupturing and plasma conduits are ready to breach
this is awful
we have to eject the antimatter tanks
weve got to coordinate the effort you go to engineering ill go to the bridge
doctor to seven
yes doctor
its worse than we thought
engineering is flooded with plasma youll never get in
i believe i can survive long enough to eject the assembly
its too late
sensors show plasma conduits rupturing on decks seven and thirteen
i can do it
seven theres been another plasma discharge in engineering the hull is breaching get out
seven do you hear me
its all right doctor false alarm
look here i think ive found the problem there are malfunctions in a number of neural gel packs as a result false readings were fed to the sensors which detected an emergency when there was none
we must repair them
they seem to be in sequence six theta nine well need replacement packs and a repair
repair kit
these tubes certainly werent designed with creature comfort in mind it seems to me the shipbuilders shouldve created a space in which one can walk upright
but they did not it doesnt help to complain about it now
ill complain if i want to its comforting
we can access sequence six theta nine from this junction
odd ive never seen this kind of neural activity in the gel packs
in what sense
the neurodes are discharging in random bursts i would imagine the nebula activity is causing it ill this back to sickbay for further study
i will reroute the command processors to bypass this series
this journey certainly hasnt lacked excitement i cant complain about being bored
since you find it comforting youll undoubtedly find something else to complain about
no doubt you really should try it
whats happening
my programme is degrading
the mobile emitter
i dont know i have to get back to sickbay hurry
i am hurrying
if the mobile emitter goes offline while im out of sickbay my programme may be irretrievable
dont panic its counterproductive
thats easy for you to say youre not facing cybernetic oblivion
doctor
if that happens again im a goner
ah home sweet sickbay i never thought id be so glad to see these walls
give me the emitter the electrooptic modulator is damaged
youre right its worthless theres no way i can risk using it now im stuck here

and we still have weeks to go its up to you to keep the ship running we cant afford to break down in this nebula

this is the federation starship voyager state your identity
im trajis lotarik im in need of a microfusion chamber would you consider a trade
why are you in this nebula
trying to get through it as i imagine you are
do you have liquid helium
youre fortunate i have an ample supply
ill beam you directly to our cargo bay
seven of nine thats an unusual name how did you get it
it was my borg designation
borg never heard of them are you alone on this ship
no the entire crew is here in stasis and our doctor is in sickbay
im both pilot and crew on my ship fortunately i happen to be resistant to the effects of the nebula
what about your technology the radiation is causing damage to ours
ive had to rebuild my engines twice already if youve been in the nebula for three weeks youre doing well
i am hopeful our propulsion system will remain operational for the next six days
ill admit i was surprised to find another ship headed toward me no one has ever managed to cross the nebula
if it werent necessary we wouldnt be attempting it
im here by choice im determined to be the first to get through ive tried five times before and failed but this time im sure ill make it i want to see whats on the other side
it is nothing remarkable
but ill be the first of my kind to see it tell me how are you handling the loneliness
what do you mean
you know what i mean no matter what you say youre all alone here
the microfusion chamber you requested
ive heard that drones cant stand being alone theyre too used to the collective
how could you know that
its true isnt it
you said youd never heard of the borg
dont be offended ive got no grudge with them
you have what you asked for now leave
i thought we could keep each other company for a while maybe have something to eat
no
and if i want to stay longer
you will not be accommodated
theres no need for this you know i mean you no harm i think maybe youre a little paranoid thats what loneliness can do to you youd be a lot better off to spend some time with me we could get to know each other
quiet
seven help me seven
seven of nine to the doctor we have an intruder on board
he must have a cloaking device sensors show no alien lifesigns and no evidence of a ship ive been working on my mobile emitter i think im making progress but i still cant leave sickbay youll have to try to track him down arm yourself and use extreme caution
warning deuterium tank levels are fluctuating beyond acceptable tolerances
the computer sounds like it needs a stimulant
it has been experiencing relay failures i have not been performing my maintenance duties
do what you have to but keep an eye out for the alien we have to assume hes up to no good seven are you frightened
i am borg
whos there
seven help me seven
im dying seven dont let me die
the lives of the crew are on your shoulders
seven help me
help seven i need help
we need you seven
assist us
im dying seven
seven of nine thats an unusual name how did you get it dont want to answer me thats all right i dont mind i know youre not yourself today but you might be interested in what im doing now i know your sensors cant detect me so if you want to know where i am youll have to ask playing stubborn thats a mistake it could lead to an unfortunate accident just to prove im willing to give you a fair chance ill ask you what would happen if the structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed you wouldnt have much time to keep them from rupturing
i couldnt bring myself to destroy your ship i hope youre not afraid of the dark
where are you
finally im glad youre responding its going to be much more interesting if we play this game together
your location
a long way from you on the bridge command centre of your ship i believe i can do just about anything from here
seven help
seven to trajis are you still there
of course do you think id leave now
im enjoying this game whats next
thats better well lets just imagine that one of the photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected
i would have to get to the torpedo bay quickly
even then you might be too late but of course you have to try
lets play another game lets imagine that the oxygen on the bridge has been depleted
what
what do you suppose the results might be computer seal the bridge with a level three forcefield
bridge sealed
seven of nine to the doctor
im here
i have incapacitated the alien he will not trouble us again
good work i have my mobile emitter back online
where are you now
in engineering
ill be right there i have interesting news about the neural gel packs
acknowledged
in your heart you knew youd see me again
you cant defeat me youre too weak
dont come any closer
you couldnt stand being alone could you you felt vulnerable afraid because you know what you are
stop
at first you thought you could become human but now you know thats impossible dont you youre borg thats what you were meant to be
one of many but your days of power are gone youre alone now weak pathetic
dont come any closer or ill kill you
seven
be careful doctor hes dangerous
who are you talking to
where did he go
theres no one else here
he was he was right here
seven youre hallucinating
no i saw him
there was no one else in this room
you mean i imagined him
yes
i heard lieutenant paris call for help i saw him and the others did i imagine them as well
i believe so when i studied the gel pack i discovered the radiation was producing a degradation in the synaptic relays im guessing theres been a similar effect on your borg implants the radiation could be altering the neurotransmitter levels in your sensory nodes that would explain why youre hearing voices seeing images
they seemed real
hallucinations usually are thats what makes them so frightening
once when i was a drone i was separated from the collective for two hours i experienced panic and apprehension i am feeling that way now
ill do everything i can to help you well get you to sickbay an antipsychotic may help at least until i determine just what neural functions are being affected
what was that

humans do not have our strength they are imperfect now you are imperfect as well
no
you will not survive you cannot survive without the collective
i will adapt
by becoming weaker less perfect
i will adapt as an individual
one one alone a borg cannot be one
i will become stronger
a borg cannot be one she will die as one weak detached isolated one borg cannot survive
i am an individual i will survive alone
no you are weak you will die alone
hes right youre in pain seven i can help you

you dont have to beg me you dont even have to ask all you have to do is make a choice
i can survive alone
thats home thats where you belong
no
end your pain just walk through that door and youll never be alone again
its not real

seven of nine you look a little worse for wear
i didnt know she was still on board
i never wanted her here in the first place
she wont be here long she cant survive alone
im taking bets on how long shell last
shell fall apart before we leave the nebula
and then everybody will die
well blame me i put my trust in her i should have known better

shes trying to keep the engines online
place your bets anyone think she can do it
ill lay odds she cant

shes got herself a real problem now
ill say shes taken power from every available system and its still not enough
but if she fails to get this ship moving everyone on board will die
what do you think shell do
i know what shes thinking shes thinking if she could take power from the stasis units on deck fourteen she might be able to get those engines back online
but that would mean sacrificing some of the crew
i dont think that would bother her too much
what matters to seven is efficiency sacrificing a few to save many would be an efficient plan
shes already killed millions would a few more matter
computer divert power from stasis units one through ten and reroute to the propulsion systems

look at that she did it
but those people she disconnected are going to die

i am seven of nine i am alone but i will adapt i will
shes coming to
not so fast get your bearings first
the crew
we came through the nebula in fine shape thanks to you
you were the one we almost lost when the ship cleared the nebula the doctor came back online and found you unconscious he reinitiated life support and woke the crew
he tells us youve had quite an adventure
it was interesting
well when youre rested id like to hear about it
im proud of you seven you performed admirably
i am glad i was able to help
neelix this soup is great what is it
its my secret recipe ive never told anyone whats in it
why does that make me nervous
oh come on tom wheres your spirit of adventure
not in my stomach food and mystery dont go together i like to know what im eating
coward
lieutenants paris and torres ensign kim
seven im surprised to see you here
may i join you
sure have a seat
have some soup its actually edible
i dont require nourishment at this time i felt the need for companionship
well after a month with only the doc for company i can understand it
yeah what was that like anyway just the two of you
the doctor was quite helpful i cannot fault him
well we all owe you
yeah just think we couldve died in those coffins
i suspect you wouldve found a way out before that lieutenant
what do you mean
lieutenant paris refused to stay confined on four separate occasions the doctor and i had to put him back into his stasis unit
were you locked in dark closets or something as a child
i just dont like closed places i never have i dont know why
perhaps you dislike being alone
full impact final round to janeway winner janeway
good game
for you
oh come on seven you won four out of ten rounds nothing to be ashamed of
on the contrary i have superior visual acuity and stamina i should have won every round
well velocity is more than a test of stamina its a game of wits
you are a frustrating opponent during the final round after you dropped your phaser you did not look at the disk and yet you were able to acquire the target
intuition
intuition is a human fallacy the belief that you can predict random events
oh belief had nothing to do with it at some level conscious or otherwise i was aware of several factors the trajectory of the disk after i hit the wall the sound it made on its return and the shadow it cast on the hologrid
intriguing but implausible
i won didnt i thanks for the match
i wish to play again
not today
you are fatigued and concerned that i will defeat you
tired yes concerned no
computer begin first round
belay that command seven try to be a sport games over
good morning
what time is it
oh five hundred
oh well then good morning
i just heard from tom and neelix theyre about to leave the trading colony
any luck
according to tom the shuttles so loaded down with supplies he wont make half impulse neelix is asking permission to bring one of the locals on board hes been very helpful and neelix wants to repay him by giving him passage to the next system
permission granted
you might want to grab some sleep weve got a big day ahead
i will in a while
still hunting for buried treasure
weve found the treasure i just cant pick the lock ive tried over fifty decryption algorithms every time i piece together a datablock ten more come unravelled what did starfleet send us a map the location of a wormhole if i could decode this today chakotay we could be home tomorrow then again it could be admiral chapmans recipe for the perfect pound cake ive been pinning our hopes on this message but im starting to wonder
one way or another weve got to find out ill talk to belanna you could enlist seven of nine
she should have a few borg algorithms up her sleeve if shes in the mood
problems
i dont know if shes getting restless or if its just me but were butting heads more than usual lately she seems to challenge everything i say
shes learned a lot from you over the last year maybe the pupil thinks shes outgrowing the mentor
maybe well this mentor would like another cup of coffee will you join me
love to
this goes to engineering sickbay storage
i hope thats not going to the mess hall
i dont remember what this is neelix
captain this man is a genius i was trying to negotiate with a xenonbased lifeform when the universal translator went offline arturis here stepped in and acted as a perfect gobetween and hed never heard either of our languages
oh they were simple no insult intended
neelix
on my way if you two will excuse me
well welcome to voyager we may be a linguistically simple folk but were happy to give you a ride lets see if we can find you some quarters
neelix was right voyager is a welcoming place
well we do our best
i cant say ive ever met a living universal translator
my people have a way with languages i myself know over four thousand
and to think i still struggle with basic klingon you couldnt have heard neelix say more than a few phrases
it was all i needed it was enough to grasp the grammar and syntax
impressive
not really its a natural ability some species are born with great physical prowess others like yours with a generosity of spirit my people can see patterns where others see only confusion is something wrong
no tell me how are you at computational languages algorithms trinary syntax
its all the same to me
i was wondering if you might do us another favour
you werent exaggerating captain this datastream is badly damaged id like to see the entire transmission again are you borg
yes
youre much more attractive than the average drone
i am no longer part of the collective
i see i see i think i see the problem may i
please
have you encountered his people before
species one one six
is that what you call us
yes the borg has never been able to assimilate them not yet
seven
oh its all right captain the borg collective is like a force of nature you dont feel anger toward a storm on the horizon you just avoid it ah here it is its a simple matter of extracting the iconometric elements and triaxilating a recursion matrix
now why didnt i think of that
theres a great deal of information here captain i think it might be useful to utilise the other monitors
youve done it
almost ive reconstructed over sixty eight kiloquads of information but a lot of it is still garbled
what about that datablock fourteen beta
that part of the message is too degraded to recover
captain ive found a spatial grid
theyve marked a set of coordinates its less than ten light years from here
maybe starfleet wants us to proceed to that location
maybe theres only one way to find out
were approaching the coordinates
take us out of warp scan the vicinity
i am picking up a vessel
on screen
identify
unless i am mistaken captain the warp signature is starfleet
ill be damned they came through
tuvok
hailing them no response
lifesigns
there is no organic matter of any kind
no sign of damage to the outer hull primary systems are online including life support something must have happened to the crew
the answer is somewhere in that starfleet transmission we need to finish decoding it may i call on your talents again
of course
take an away team secure the vessel
tom tuvok
captain i wont pretend to know you well but i am surprised youre not more encouraged by this discovery
ive learned to walk the line between hope and caution weve had other opportunities that didnt work out but i will admit im leaning toward hope this time
wow
wow indeed
ive never seen this kind of hull geometry looks like theyve taken a whole new approach to starship design
uss dauntless registry nx01a launch date 51472
sixty thousand light years in three months
im trying to access the crew logs but there are none
i dont think there was a crew this helm was set for autonavigation to these coordinates
it appears that starfleet has provided us with a new ship
lets not pack our bags just yet id like to know how they
im reading power fluctuations in the warp core if you can call it a warp core i dont recognise this engine configuration
lets go take a look
i think weve found our engine core
some kind of new warp drive
its not antimatter its i dont know what it is
they call this thing a quantum slipstream drive
quantum slipstream
ive never seen that in the engineering manuals
the ships powering up autonavigation is kicking in
bridge to janeway the vessels moving away at high impulse
i cant raise the away team
pursuit course ensign
i cant shut down the drive
computer disable propulsion
unable to comply
hang on
bridge to janeway theyre gone
look at this energy from the quantum drive is being routed through the main deflector
is that whats creating the slipstream
it looks that way
fascinating can you make it stop
ill try accessing helm controls were back in normal space
scan for voyager
no sign of them commander weve travelled over fifteen light years
slipstream technology is experimental and high risk but its come a long way in the past year weve conducted forty seven trial runs all of them successful but each flight lasted only five days in order to reach earth youd have to remain at slipstream velocities for a full three months can your crew survive that long we believe they can and we encourage you to try everything youll need is on the dauntless power cells supplies living quarters safe journey we hope to see you soon
admiral hayes good man fine officer bit of a windbag lets talk about the risk doctor
ive examined the away team for signs of cell damage or physiological stress nothing their little joyride didnt harm them in the slightest
long term effects
im running medical projections right now so far the results are encouraging
and the dauntless itself
id say its in pretty good shape considering
ive been looking over the primary systems helm ops tactical theyre comparable to voyagers but its a lean ship captain no shuttlecraft only one transporter no holodecks no replicators
well mister neelix you may have your work cut out for you
ready and willing captain
so what are we waiting for
your enthusiasm is premature voyager is a proven vessel it would be reckless to abandon it so quickly
come on wheres that borg spirit well adapt
my borg spirit gives me an objectivity you lack
she has a point this would mean leaving voyager behind
is there any way we could modify voyager to create a slipstream
in theory but i dont think the ship would hold up very long under the quantum stresses
try to make the modifications if theres a way we can bring voyager along for the ride im all for it harry belanna i want you to take an engineering team down to the dauntless start working on a way to shut down the slipstream drive at a moments notice
aye captain
once we have that safeguard in place we can start making the test flights i want this entire crew to familiarise themselves with that ship see to it dismissed tuvok big day
indeed
a way home wevewaited for this moment for years why dont i feel more enthusiastic
perhaps my mental discipline is rubbing off on you
perhaps what do you think about this little miracle of ours
i share your concern about the crews safety we must take every precaution
somehow i dont think standard diagnostics and security protocols are going to make me feel any better
captain
all of this is just a little too perfect the alien genius with the answers to all our problems a message from starfleet telling us everything we want to hear a starship delivered right to our doorstep what more could we ask for they even turned down the beds the only thing missing was chocolates on the pillows
it does seem convenient
i cant put my finger on it but from the moment this all started i sensed something was wrong
it started when arturis boarded voyager
exactly well proceed as planned but i want you to investigate that ship from stem to stern keep an eye on our guest see if you can find out more about him
understood
lets hope were just suffering from some good oldfashioned paranoia keep me posted
initiate emergency shutdown on my mark now
quantum field strength down to ninety percent eighty percent its levelling off at seventyfive
we need to dampen the field by at least fifty percent
try reversing the quantum field polarities
seventy percent fifty five forty nine percent
we did it weve got our safety net
one step closer to home
tuvok wants us to run a metallurgical analysis of the bulkheads to look for anything unusual
thank you you two run the analysis ill be on the bridge with arturis our resident genius said hed help me figure out how to use the control sequencers
lieutenant you seem eager to return to earth
eager i wouldnt go that far
you were a member of the maquis starfleet command will no doubt hold you responsible for a multitude of crimes you will find nothing on earth but adversity
thats looking on the bright side lets put it this way id rather face the music back home than spend the rest of my life in the delta quadrant what about you looking forward to seeing earth
no
im not surprised you think people are going to resent an exmaquis what about an exdrone well be outcasts together im kidding seven its a joke work on that sense of humour itll help you make friends on earth
seven can you give me a hand down here im picking up an anomalous energy surge
there are no power conduits running through this section
believe me seven one look at that big blue marble and youll fall in love its got just about every ecosystem you can think of and hundreds of different humanoid species live there bolians vulcans ktarians if you like ktarians and there are several other planets to choose from
if you will excuse me ensign i must speak to the captain
seven for whats it worth it wont be the same without you
kim to tuvok
tuvok here
im on the dauntless in the engine room andive found something
that qualifies as unusual
ill be right there
computer display datablock fourteen beta auxiliary display
seven i could use your help im trying to reconstruct the last fragment of the starfleet message
arturis said it was irreparably damaged
i know but i think he gave up too easily
intuition
its intuition if im right ive designed a new decryption algorithm lets give it a try
captain i will not be going with you to the alpha quadrant
i can understand your reluctance its been hard enough dealing with a crew of a hundred and fifty individual humans the prospect of an entire planet must be overwhelming
i am not overwhelmed i simply do not wish to live among humans
well whether you like it or not youre one of us youve come a long way from that drone who stepped out of a borg alcove nine months ago dont turn your back on humanity now not when youre about to take your biggest step earth your home
i may have come a long way but not in the direction you think youve attempted to influence my development you exposed me to your culture you ideals you hoped to shape me in your own image but you have failed you may have noticed our tendency to disagree
oh ive noticed
then you must also recognise that i do not share your values your desire to explore space is inefficient your need for familial connections is a weakness your infatuation with this planet is irrational
i wont argue that youve turned out differently than i expected and that we often have conflicting points of view but right now the stakes are higher this crew needs your expertise abandon them and you diminish their chances of getting home
irrelevant
no its not weve given you a lot seven its time you gave something in return
i have on many occasions now i refuse
what would you do go back to the collective
i dont know
then what exactly do you have in mind
i dont know
thats my point youre asking me to cast you adrift in the delta quadrant alone and without support i wouldnt grant that request to any member of this crew because its too dangerous
i will survive
on what borg perfection
precisely
i dont buy it this isnt about your independence or your superiority this is about your fear youre not making this choice because youve outgrown humanity i think youre afraid to go back to earth
the algorithms working its reconstructing the datablock thats strange i thought we already recovered this part of the message
perhaps it is an addendum from the admiral you did designate him a windbag
oh i dont think so the data index doesnt match this is a completely different message
apologies from everyone at starfleet command weve had our best people working around the clock trying to find a wormhole a new means of propulsion anything to get you home but despite our best efforts i know its not what you were hoping but weve sent you all the data weve collected on the delta quadrant with any luck youll find at least some part of it useful maybe enough to shave a few years off your journey safe journey we hope to see you soon
your intuition was correct
unfortunately
arturis must have created a false message
it sure as hell looks that way janeway to tuvok
yes captain
my suspicions have been confirmed
arturis tampered with starfleets message
the dauntless isnt what it appears to be
i agree weve discovered alien technologybehind a bulkhead
in engineering i cant identify it
wheres arturis now
on the dauntless bridge working with lieutenant torres
go to the bridge but dont tip our hand
ill be there with a full security team within minutes
understood
lets get weapons
dont touch that you almost kicked us into slipstream drive
oh i wouldnt want to do that kucha merah
no problem you speak klingon
i do now your captain was kind enough to let me review your linguistic database
i only know speak a few phrases myself
oh shame its a robust language
a little too robust for me
evacuate the repair teams
captain
do it explain yourself
i dont know what youre talking about
you fabricated the message from starfleet i recovered the real transmission the one you said was irreparably damaged
thats absurd
starfleet didnt send us this vessel and youre not here to help is this your ship
please stay calm there must be an explanation
i tried to ignore my gut feelings because i got carried away by the excitement of getting home but you preyed on that didnt you you took advantage of our hopes and now i want to know why
i believe that there is a threat here captain but not from me i didnt feel it was my place to make accusations but i saw her reconfigure several key algorithms two days ago in your astrometrics lab and it seemed obvious she must have been tampering with the starfleet message
you are lying
shes been sabotaging your every effort to reach earth you dont have to believe me captain you can find all the evidence you need in her personal database
evidence you undoubtedly put there yourself just in case you got caught take him to voyager throw him the brig
janeway to voyager beam us out of here
hes trying to deflect our transporters stand by
ive got everyone but seven and the captain hes found a way to block their transport
the ships going into slipstream mode
pursuit course
we lost them commander
tom bring the warp core modifications online were going after them
sir we havent even had a trial run yet
theres no time like the present
where are you taking us
home
howd you create the starfleet bridge holograms
particle synthesis beyond your understanding
is this what your people do prey on innocent ships
innocent typical of captain janeway selfrighteous
if ive offended you or your people in some way please tell me
diplomacy captain your diplomacy destroyed my world
what what are you saying
you negotiated an agreement with the borg collective safe passage through their space and in return you helped them defeat one of their enemies
species eight four seven two
in your colourful language yes species eight four seven two did it ever occur to you that there were those of us in the delta quadrant who had a vested interest in that war victory would have meant the annihilation of the borg but you couldnt see beyond the bow of your own ship
in my estimation species eight four seven two posed a greater threat than the borg
who are you to make that decision a stranger to this quadrant
there wasnt exactly time to take a poll i had to act quickly
my people managed to elude the borg for centuries outwitting them always one step ahead but in recent years the borg began to weaken our defences they were closing in and species eight four seven two was our last hope to defeat them you took that away from us the outer colonies were the first to fall twenty three in a matter of hours our sentry vessels tossed aside no defence against the storm by the time theyd surrounded our star system hundreds of cubes we had already surrendered to our own terror a few of us managed to survive ten twenty thousand i was fortunate i escaped with a vessel alone but alive i dont blame them they were just drones acting with their collective instinct you you had a choice
im sorry for what happened to your people but try to understand i couldnt have known
it took me months to find you i watched and waited for my opportunity to make you pay for what youd done then the starfleet message and i knew that your selfish desire to get home would surface again that i could lure you to this vessel that i could see to it that youd all be assimilated and spend the rest of eternity as borg i was hoping to get your entire crew but ill settle for the two of you in a matter of hours this ship will return to my homeworld inside borg space
when that happens you will be assimilated as well
thats irrelevant this is what you wanted all along isnt it to go back to your collective you should thank me
report
were at full impulse but were not breaking through the quantum barrier
im having trouble controlling the field parameters i need more power to the deflector
bridge to torres
im already on it commander
stand by reroute auxiliary power to deflector control make sure that quantum warp field is stable
aye lieutenant
deflector at maximum im focusing the quantum field
make it quick hull temperatures at critical
were at slipstream velocity
structural integritys down by nine percent weve got less than an hour before the hull starts to buckle
ive located their slipstream im aligning ours to match were right behind them
how far behind
just a few minutes
is there any way to increase our speed
none were at maximum
maintain course if i know the captain shes already got a plan
any ideas
not presently
wed better think of something we come face to face with your former family in less than an hour and thats one reunion id like to miss unless of course youre looking forward to rejoining the collective
i do not believe i am
not the ringing opposition i was hoping for but ill take it a drone could walk through this forcefield like it was thin air is there enough borg technology left in your body to let it adapt
if i activate the appropriate nanoprobes i could alter my bioelectric field however i would need to adjust my cranial implant
would a microfilament do the trick
it might
then lets get you one once you get outside access that control panel and disable the forcefield then well try to reach the engine room
and employ the emergency shutdown procedure
sufficient you will need to crosslink the third and sixth nodules
déjàvu
captain
as i recall this is where our relationship began in a brig nine months ago i severed you from the collective and you werent exactly happy about it
no i was not
in case i never get a chance to say this i realise that ive been hard on you at times but it was never out of anger or regret that i brought you on board im your captain that means i cant always be your friend understand
no however if we are assimilated our thoughts will become one and im sure i will understand perfectly a joke captain you yourself have encouraged me to use my sense of humour
its nice to know youve taken some of my advice to heart
you were correct my desire to remain in the delta quadrant was based on fear i am no longer borg but the prospect of becoming human is unsettling i dont know where i belong
you belong with us
the adaptations are complete
were in business
i cant initiate the emergency shutdown
our commands are being blocked from the bridge hes detected us
the ships velocity has just increased at our present speed we will enter borg space in less than twelve minutes
do we still have access to the power distribution grid
yes
if we cant throw on the brakes lets swerve the wheel send a power surge into the starboard thrusters
the torsional stress at these speeds could tear the ship apart
its either that or join the hive do it if were still in one piece try to gain control of navigation ill be on the bridge we have a game of velocity scheduled for tomorrow holodeck one i expect you to keep the appointment
aye captain
sorry about the bumpy ride
you can slow this ship down but you cant stop it in four minutes captain janeway will be gone and a new drone will be born
dont count on it seven of nine has accessed your navigational systems you taught us how to use this ship a little too well i cant begin to imagine your loss but try to see beyond your desire for revenge
revenge is all i have left
no as long youre alive theres hope your peoples accomplishments their knowledge their dignity can survive in you end this
ive just destroyed the navigational controls no one can stop this ship now not even me two minutes to borg space
direct hit the vessels shields are down transporters standing by
get a lock on our people
voyager
come with me its not too late
it is for you
ive got them commander transporter room two
alter our slipstream hard starboard take us back the way we came
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
full impact final round to janeway winner janeway
nice play you almost had me
almost
go again
i must report to the astrometrics lab there is work to be done
work i gave the crew strict orders to take some r and r over the next few days and that includes you
there are more pressing needs i am attempting to design another method of travelling at slipstream velocities without damaging voyager
i thought that was impossible
impossible is a word that humans use far too often i wish to continue my efforts
a few days ago you were ready to abandon ship and here you are practically laying in a course to earth
as we approached borg space i began to reevaluate my future the prospect of becoming a drone was unappealing
sometimes youve got to look back in order to move forward sounds to me like youre starting to embrace your humanity
no but as i said nothing is impossible
computer one more game
citizens of earth your destiny is in my hands those of you who acquiesce to my demands will be treated fairly oppose me and you face a dire fate indeed as my slaves in the mines of mercury you have one hour
youll never get away with this
oh but i shall your once proud country will fall to its knees how ironic that i am using your rocket ship to lead my space force into battle
youre wrong chaotica before you came on board someone pushed the selfdestruct button in three minutes well all be dead
no
the jig is up your majesty
captain proton
spaceman first class protector of earth scourge of intergalactic evil at your service
but i saw you fall into the fiery mouth of that volcano
it takes more than a little lava to stop captain proton now i want you to call off your invasion and give me back my rocket ship
there is one force in this universe that even you cannot defeat
the same to you
doc
mister paris i should have known it was you monopolising the holodeck
who is this insolent fool
hes one of our men computer adjust the doctors spectral frequency
i have no interest in your frivolous fantasy im here to rehearse a duet from don carlo and youve already gone three minutes into my scheduled
enough robot attack
destroy them start with him
computer freeze programme
doc this is the final chapter satans robot conquers the world we cant stop now
does the phrase to be continued mean anything to you
your opera can wait
this programme is a waste of photonic energy
oh really take a look around you this is how the twentieth century saw the future we are studying sociology
perhaps you can teach a course at starfleet academy satans robot  an historical overview
bridge to holodeck one whats going on down there
oh nothing commander just a little power surge
says here the hologrid just blew out
were fixing it now sir
well make it quick the last thing we need is a broken holodeck
seven i want good news thats an order
then i must disobey i have no good news to report ive completed an astrometric scan of the entire region there are no star systems within twenty five hundred light years
nothing
nothing
why cant we see stars beyond that
there are heavy concentrations of theta radiation it has occluded our sensors
any other ships out there
none we are alone
every sailors nightmare
commander
its like being becalmed in the middle of the ocean if it werent for sensors we wouldnt even know we were at warp weve only been crossing this expanse for two months and were already feeling the strain how do we last another two years
we will adapt
easier said than done
shall i inform the captain of my findings
no ill tell her
this wont be much of a briefing theres nothing new to report
humour me
all right lets see warp cores at peak efficiency just like last week and the week before that and my engineering staff is going stir crazy
thanks ensign
nada
can you be more specific
all systems are operating within normal parameters
anything new on sensors
ive detected a sudden increase in theta radiation in the vicinity
source
unknown
could be worth a look
finally some excitement radiation
next piece of business crew morale
deteriorating obviously
i have a few suggestions that might boost peoples spirits
please
rotate crew assignments add variety to the daily routine i myself wouldnt mind squeezing in a little tactical training
noted
and the holodecks have been in high demand i was thinking we could install a few emitters in cargo bay two turn it into a third holodeck
hear hear
see to it harry
one other item sir a point of er concern among some of the crew its well its the captain shes been a bit elusive lately
whats your point
people take comfort in talking to her when they see that the captains happy theyre happy
rumour has it she never leaves her quarters
captains privilege shell come to the bridge if and when shes needed
spare us the protocol chakotay its pretty odd youve got to admit it
its her choice she can run this ship from wherever the hell she wants to understood
yeah sure
were all feeling the pressure including me
listen maybe weve got the wrong attitude lets think of this as a two year vacation
dismissed
thats a great idea harry
wow harry youre a real genius how do you come up with these brilliant ideas
youre such an optimistic guy
computer lights maximum level bergamot tea hot first thing in the morning i replicate some curtains
predictable the novokavich gambit you always use that opening move
thats because you always fall for it
i feel like weve played this match a hundred times
derada is a game of subtlety
too subtle for me
hmm ill bet
whats that supposed to mean
well if it doesnt involve klingon pain sticks
good night
there you go just when im winning whos predictable
you dont want to start a fight with me now not at three am
three in the morning four in the afternoon whats the difference youre angry twenty four hours a day
everything is a joke to you
good evening or should i say good morning guess you couldnt sleep either
oh why sleep when were having so much fun
hes joking neelix were all supposed to laugh
i certainly am laughing on the inside smiling anyway lets start a new game cards maybe a little snack
no i have a better idea why dont we make a schedule a fight rotation we can optimise our resources i can start one then you can start one
please
i am really tired of these games
well then dont play them
stop you are senior officers you are you are supposed to be setting an example for the rest the rest of the crew
neelix
paris to sickbay
some morale officer i turned out to be
ive given you a mild sedative it should control the urge to hyperventilate and alleviate some of your anxiety
anxiety anxietys what i feel when i burn a pot roast this this is more like
dizziness nausea unspeakable dread
yes
nihiliphobia the fear of nothingness or in laymans terms the fear of nothingness if its any consolation i can relate to it i go into a void every time im deactivated emptiness complete and utter oblivion ill admit it was unsettling at first the existential horror of it all
youre not helping doctor
sorry my point is youll get used to it
i hope so
commander am i disturbing you
no
is the astrometrics lab designated for recreational use
i come here to meditate needless to say the view from my quarters has been less than stellar lately
astronomical phenomena help you to focus your mind
yes i imagine that each star represents a single thought
meditation it rejuvenates you
indeed it does
i suggest you try borg regeneration its much more efficient a simple cortical implant would be required
another time perhaps
what is it
long range sensors are detecting more theta radiation dangerously high levels
source
unknown
its probably nothing just background theta radiation but it could mean theres someone nearby
distance
approximately twenty five light years
its a long shot but alter course
yes maam
if thats all commander
actually id like to make a request ive been saving up my holodeck rations and ive got three full hours coming any chance i might persuade you to join me for a few rounds of velocity itll help clear your mind
my mind is perfectly clear
and what if i told you im not leaving until you join me
id say have a seat itll be a while
then ill be blunt youve picked a bad time to isolate yourself from the crew this ship needs a captain especially now
would you be satisfied with im just catching up on some reading im not sure i understand it myself it started when we entered this what does the crew call it
the void
charming oh what i wouldnt give for a few borg cubes about now anything for a little distraction strange as it sounds i almost long for the days when we were under constant attack no time to stop and think about how we got stranded in the delta quadrant how did we end up here chakotay answer me
we were faced with a difficult choice we had the means to get home but using it wouldve put an innocent people at risk so we decided to stay
no no no i decided to stay i made that choice for everyone
were alive and well and weve gathered enough data about this quadrant to keep starfleet scientists busy for decades our missions been a success
the very same words ive been telling myself for the past four years but then we hit this void and i started to realise how empty those words sound
kathryn
i made an error in judgment chakotay it was shortsighted and it was selfish and now all of us are paying for my mistake so if you dont mind commander ill pass on that little game and ill leave shipboard morale in your capable hands if the crew asks for me tell them the captain sends her regards
sir
relax ensign anything to report
not even a stray electron but i did finish writing my concerto i call it echoes of the void got a minute
too many in fact
tell me what you think
now when we last saw our heroes they had just retaken their rocket ship doctor chaotica had escaped but he left behind his trusty robot to foil captain proton
my designation
ah right youre constance goodheart youre my secretary
secretary
yeah you tag along on all the missions now i want you to keep the robot occupied while i save earth computer run programme
citizen of earth surrender do not resist
i am borg
surrender
the robot has been neutralised may i leave now
come on seven give it a chance the galaxys at stake
weve dropped out of warp were losing power
switch to auxiliary
no effect
i was hoping for a change of pace but a blackout isnt exactly what i had in mind ill try tapping into the energy reserves
double check the radio relays
get inside those plasma injectors infuse them manually if you have to
lieutenant
just a second im not sure how to work this thing
captain protein to the rescue its not exactly starfleet issue a shipwide power loss everythings offline main power auxiliary
independent subsystems are operational environmental controls holodecks reroute power from this holodeck to the emergency relays
yes maam no luck the hologrid is frozen
neelix
dont mind me
theres been a power loss nothing to worry about
whos worried
come on take deep breaths nice and slow thats it
bingo weve got partial sensors ive found the cause of our power drain its some kind of dampening field the source is off the port bow thats about all i can tell you
on screen do we have the power to launch a photon torpedo
maybe one why
perhaps we could shed some light on our predicament im reconfiguring the torpedo to emit a sustained polyluminous burst
a warp flare
precisely
i need something to pry open this hatch
computer disengage safety protocols
i saw something over there im telling you i saw something i may be nihiliphobic but my eyes work just fine i can hear breathing
follow me
yes maam
torpedo reconfigured away
i can barely see the injector ports how about a little light over here
we can do better than that this power cell should be enough to get emergency power back online
up here well hook it up directly to the eps manifold
emergency power just came back weve got tactical
raising shields
the warp cores online
janeway to bridge report
the dampening field has been blocked captain we are surrounded by three alien vessels
seventeen intruders are on board
the ships arent responding to hails
we do have weapons online
tuvok target the ship off our port bow fire a few warning shots
shields down to sixty four percent
do we have propulsion
not yet
he was attacked by an intruder
these burns are severe
i disabled the alien it may still be alive
bring it to sickbay
shields are down
theyre reinitialising the dampening field were losing power
not again
theyve stopped their attack theyre beaming off the ship
theres another vessel approaching
were being hailed
on screen im lieutenant commander tuvok of the federation
i had to fire thirteen spatial charges to drive those ships off i expect to be compensated
of course
now tell me what are you doing in the middle of nowhere
the biofilters are detecting high levels of theta radiation
compensate welcome aboard im afraid well have to talk here you appear to be leaking
yes yes my isolation suit dont be alarmed
we prefer to be on the safe side mister
emck controller emck malon export vessel eleventh gradient
its a pleasure to meet you and a relief
id advise you to turn around immediately there are more of those creatures ahead thousands of vessels theyre almost impossible to detect you wont survive another attack
we cant go back were crossing this expanse to reach our home
then er it appears youll be coming with me
what do you mean
theres a spatial vortex a few light years from here it leads directly to the other side of the expanse weve been using it for years
that would get us out of the void and cut two years off our journey home
well thank you again im curious mister emck what are you doing here besides rescuing starships in distress
ah im on a transport mission my sensors tell me that one of the creatures is still aboard your ship
it was injured during the attack our doctors treating it
why
enough questions give me the creature and ill take you to the vortex
oh my apologies mister emck but id like to know whats going on here are you at war with these beings
none of your concern
your vessel seems to be leaking large amounts of theta radiation what kind of transport mission are you on exactly
my ship will depart in two hours cooperate or stay behind i wont be coming to your rescue when the creatures return im finished here
i think its time we heard the other side of the story
watch your step ive had to lower the lights my patient is extremely photosensitive
that could explain why they dampened our power
my feelings exactly from what i can tell this life form may be indigenous to the void his physiology has evolved to survive in complete darkness
his condition
minor injuries phaser wounds to the chest and neck but thats the least of his problems hes dying captain every organ is degrading at the cellular level
theta radiation poisoning
the final stages my guess is hes been exposed to it over a long period theres nothing i can do
id like a word with him im kathryn janeway captain of this vessel
you are allied with the malon
no were simply trying to cross this region we never met the malon before today
they will want me
well i have no intention of giving you to them youre not a captive here doctor are you at war with the malon
their ships are poison
the theta radiation
theyre killing us
why what do they want from you
nothing
this will help alleviate the pain
i dont understand
we were ignorant we attacked you forgive us
of course but i need to understand you say the malon are killing your people there must be a reason
theyre poisoning our space we dont know why
hes in respiratory distress we need to get him back to his people they might know how to treat him
i will show you how
i need a workstation route it to the helm if you enter the coordinates my pilot will set a course
i am grateful
take the bridge ill stay here
we still dont have a defence against their dampening field if they decide to attach again
im confident they wont finally something to put in my logbook
tuvok
i need your advice
a first
look i realise were not exactly best friends from day one weve kept each other at arms length but ive always respected your judgment and right now i could use a little vulcan clarity
proceed
its the captain as you may have noticed shes isolated herself from the crew
she believes that she made an error in judgment four years ago that shes responsible for stranding voyager in the delta quadrant
she told you
no ive been observing her behaviour for the past four years guilt has been her constant companion
youve known her longer than anyone have you ever seen her like this
only once it was during her first year as a commander on the uss billings she sent an away team to survey a volcanic moon their shuttle was damaged by a magma eruption and three crew members were severely injured the next day she returned to the moon alone to complete the survey she wanted the crew to know that their suffering had not been in vain she could have been killed
seeking redemption
precisely captain janeways methods are unorthodox it is her strength as a leader but unfortunately it is also her greatest weakness
stubborn as a klingon
to put it mildly
if she tries something like that again i want to be ready and im going to need your support
were at the coordinates
all stop shields up tuvok
nothing on sensors
bridge to captain
weve arrived
stand by
theyre here but i must tell them you are a friend your communications system
im picking up photonic surges theyre all around us
captain weve got company eight ships twelve more approaching
lets run a full bioscan
we have lived here for millions of years undisturbed until the malon came
captain every one of them seems to be suffering from theta radiation exposure
we tell them they are killing us they wont listen we tried to stop them theyre too strong
what about the vortex can you close it keep them out
we dont know how your ship is powerful your people resourceful we need your help
bridge to captain theyre locking onto the alien in sickbay
lower the shields
will you help us
poison
the vessel is ejecting massive quantities of contaminated antimatter
their cargo holds are loaded with it over ninety million isotons
hail them
captain youve decided to join us send the creature to my
that wont be possible weve returned him to his people you wanted the lifeform because you were afraid wed uncover your transport mission
i said this was none of your concern
well it is now youre using their space as a dumping ground for your antimatter waste why
my civilisation produces over six billion isotons of industrial byproduct every day this region is a perfect disposal site
how convenient for you a spatial vortex to the middle of nowhere far away from your own system out of sight out of mind problem is somebody lives here
one species
ones enough we didnt come here to debate the issue we came here to offer a peaceful solution
what kind of solution
my people use antimatter as well but weve found ways to purify the reactants so theres no toxic waste well show you
guide us through the vortex we can meet with your scientists on the other side exchange information
show me now
stand by for transport commander take our guest to engineering give him a demonstration lets turn our sensors on that vortex i want to know exactly how it works just in case diplomacy fails
do you intend to destroy it
the residual antimatter is then processed in the transkinetic chamber where its broken down on the subatomic level
what about the theta radiation
oh its absorbed by a series of radiometric converters we recycle the energy use it to power everything from life support to replicators
we dont have this kind of conversion technology
our scans of your freighter show that you have plasma manifolds the engineering principles are the same
were not saying this wont take some effort youre looking at several months of retrofitting depending on the size of your fleet all the schematics are here and wed be willing to work with you get you started we can even provide you with some converters
ingenious design our engineers would be pleased this would solve a lot of problems on my world unfortunately it would also put me out of business
sorry
your technology would throw the waste export industry into chaos before long id be obsolete i came here hoping your claims were exaggerated but i can see theyre not you can keep your solution
you lying
belanna
we went through this whole song and dance and he never had any intention of working with us
thats not important what matters is that were talking now were proposing changes some of them difficult but progress can also bring new opportunities given time this could turn to your advantage
i already have the advantage the vortex no one knows about it except me and my crew by ejecting my cargo here i cut expenses in half i wont sacrifice that
i guess mass murder doesnt factor into your profit margin
you care so much about these creatures stay
im sorry you wont listen to reason but dont expect us to walk away from this
youve scanned my vessel youve seen my fire power you wouldnt survive ten seconds in a conflict with me
get him out of here
pah
options
we fight our way past them navigate the vortex on our own once were on the other side we contact the malon authorities and blow the whistle on emck
we give them the reclamation technology and continue on our way home
exactly
even if we did get through the vortex theres no guarantee the malon will do the right thing if mister emck is any indication as long as this vortex exists the inhabitants of this region are at risk
any chance we could destroy it
i believe so but theres a catch well have to collapse it from this end where its dimensional radius is weakest wed be closing our shortcut out of here
two more years in the void i can live with that
but im not sure i can four years ago i destroyed the caretakers array to protect the ocampa that act of compassion stranded this crew in the delta quadrant im not about to give that order again
this situation is a little different
its close enough im asking this crew to make too big a sacrifice i wont make that same mistake
if you have another option im listening
chakotay theres no one i trust more than you youre a fine first officer are you ready to captain this ship
yes
assemble the crew
captain on the bridge
at ease harry howve you been
just find maam
good
weve missed you captain
likewise ill make this brief your orders are to proceed to the vortex use whatever means necessary to fight your way past the malon freighter ill stay behind in a shuttlecraft and destroy the vortex tuvok ill need a class two shuttle armed with photon torpedoes tom set a course for
forget it were not going to let you die out here
have a little faith belanna ill have a shuttle plenty of rations ill survive
alone in the delta quadrant no offence but
ive made my decision
what about us dont we have a say
hes right captain id be willing to brave this void if it meant keeping you with us
tom set a course
lieutenant i gave you an order
i cant follow that order maam
harry take the helm
im sorry captain
i will not comply
whats a hologram to do
as you can see youre not the only one whos had time to evaluate the past
yes i can see that you realise you could all be hanged for mutiny looks like we need another option
we fire torpedoes the instant we cross the threshold as the vortex begins to collapse we jump into high warp
therell be a massive shock wave on our tail
ill reinforce the aft shielding
theres still one obstacle the malon
antimatter waste has weakened the bulkhead surrounding their cargo hold a direct phaser strike should disable them
poetic justice
indeed
you realise it will reduce our chance of getting through
chance is irrelevant we will succeed
a vote of borg confidence who could argue with that
all right back to your stations lets do it
red alert set a course to the vortex all hands to battle stations
you told them they knew coming in
lets just say i wouldnt be a fine first officer if i hadnt
return fire hit them with everything weve got
their shields are holding
open a channel this is voyager stand down your weapons and fall back  ill take that as a no
the vortex
two million kilometres dead ahead
bridge to engineering were approaching the vortex
bring the aft shielding online
acknowledged see you on the other side
status
the port nacelles been ruptured were venting plasma
can you get us out of here on one engine tom
i think so
torpedoes armed and ready
on my order tuvok well only get one shot at this
theyre firing spatial charges
evade them
captain proton to the rescue
ill explain later
the vortex is in visual range
time to intercept
forty seven seconds
steady as she goes keep laying down fire
direct hit starboard nacelle
both engines are offline were running on inertia one more hit and were dead in the water
without warp drive well never outrun the shockwave
tuvok can you reinforce the aft shields with our main deflector
i believe so
do it were going to ride that shockwave out of here let it push us to the other side
adjusting shield harmonics
captain they intend to block our path
twenty seconds
prepare to fire
that may not be necessary
the freighter is moving to combat the aliens
theyre trying to distract the malon give us the upper hand
ten seconds
the freighters shields are weakening
target their cargo hold time to take out the garbage
were crossing the threshold
torpedoes
shockwave approaching six hundred metres five hundred four
aft shields at maximum
all hands brace for impact
pressure is building on the outer hull shields weakening
were clear
the vortex has been destroyed
are we out of the void
not yet that little manoeuvre brought us up a bit short were still two hundred thousand kilometres from the boundary
on screen maintain course
there
what
i saw something a star
remind me to check your eyesight
harry what do you see out there
i see a densely packed region with thousands of star systems it looks pretty lively
full speed ahead
seven of nine hows my favourite borg today
annoyed in the future you will announce your presence before entering this room
sorry i guess i should have knocked first
are we ready to leave
yes according to sensors spatial conditions are ripe a spontaneous protonebula could emerge within the next twenty minutes mister paris is expecting us
hmm not a bad looking hologram
this should be exciting dont you think
its an astronomical survey nothing more what is your function on this mission
my function is to study the nebulas effects on the crew we may be dealing with new forms of radiation i cant wait to see one of these clouds take shape i hear theyre quite beautiful i brought along a holoimaging device to take a few snapshots
this isnt shore leave there will be no time for recreational activities
the borg party poopers of the galaxy tomorrow well start you on a new social exercise developing your joie de vivre
sorry about that just a little spatial turbulence nothing to worry about
hello there
i dont know about you but ive got a case of class two claustrophobia
ah i remember it well
lieutenant
oh thats what starfleet cadets used to call these class two shuttles fast manoeuvrable but not built for comfort
they used to shoehorn half a dozen cadets into one of these things for weeks at a time you did not want to be around when they opened up that airlock
perhaps you should design a new shuttle larger more efficient
not a bad idea
im reading plasma surges off the port bow
all stop keep our distance
seven move over by the helm i want to get a group shot
im busy
and smile like i know you can
what was that
another plasma surge
its massive tom back us off were caught in the gravimetric shear
engines are down
were receiving a distress call from the away team
theyve been engulfed in the shearline of the nebula
full impulse bridge to transporter room one standby for emergency beamout
ive got a partial lock on them but unless the shuttle clears that nebula
it wont theyve lost propulsion
then its going to be a rough transport
energise
im having trouble separating their patterns
reset the pattern buffers
the signals are clearing
is everyone all right
my emitter its been damaged
ill transfer your programme back to sickbay hang on
sickbay to transporter room one report
it looks like some of your emitter circuits were fused during transport
can you repair it
most likely
relax doctor ill keep you posted mulchaey
computer run diagnostic routine alpha three six
diagnostic in progress
first thing in the morning i want you to check the results
ill be here bright and early
rise and shine lieutenant its oh six hundred hours early bird gets the gagh
what do you want
good morning would be nice but id settle for my mobile emitter do we have an eta on those repairs
go away
cant you at least give me a prognosis
the one day i get to sleep in
youre worried about a few more seconds of unconsciousness my freedom is at stake
computer activate sonic shower
one more thing lieutenant i was thinking
hey
im a doctor not a peeping tom its nothing i havent seen before i was thinking
if you brought the emitter to sickbay we could work on it together ive prepared a hello belanna
regeneration cycle incomplete
commander howd you sleep
well enough whats new
that nebulas expanding at a rate of eight thousand cubic kilometres per hour ive had to adjust course eleven times
sounds like youre enjoying the big chair
its not a bad way to spend the night
i hear youve been doing a fine job the crews impressed is it true you make them call you captain kim
sir
good morning
that remains to be seen
problem
the proximity transceiver in my cranial implant has been activated that could indicate a borg presence nearby
harry
ive been running sensor sweeps all night i havent seen anything
perhaps the nebula is masking a vessel
no not a chance a ship wouldnt last ten seconds in there not even a borg cube
maybe its a false alarm your transceiver could be malfunctioning
it is possible
why dont you pay a visit to sickbay in the meantime well redouble our scans just to be sure
very well
ill get the scans underway
if you dont mind being an ensign again
seven
my proximity transceiver activated again
looks like someones rerouting power from the warp conduits
to where
deck eight section twenty two the science lab
bridge to science lab ensign mulchaey respond harry
sensors are being deflected by some kind of forcefield commander the forcefield has a borg signature
red alert captain to the bridge tuvok take a security team to the science lab chakotay to seven of nine looks like you were right
weve detected borg on the ship deck eight science lab
how many drones
unknown tuvoks headed there now
i will join him
the science lab my mobile emitters in there
this technology resembles a borg maturation chamber but many of the components are unfamiliar
commander
he was punctured by an extraction tubule it removed a tissue sample there are residual nanoprobes surrounding the wound their encoding sequences are identical to my own
your nanoprobes how
i dont know
take him to sickbay
what are you doing
i will be recognised as borg
a drone but unlike any ive ever seen
it appears to be in the foetal stage
i dont understand the borg assimilate they do not reproduce in this fashion
where did it come from
i believe it was created here in the science lab when the away team beamed back to voyager there was a transporter malfunction our patterns merged briefly it is possible that some of my nanoprobes infected the doctors mobile emitter
they began to assimilate
yes
nanoprobes are encoded to utilize any technology they encounter once it assimilated the emitter it began to transform this diagnostic station when ensign mulchaey entered the room they sampled his dna
using his genetic code as a template to create a lifeform
the drone has increased in mass by seventeen percent
its maturation rate is twenty five times that of a conventional borg
tuvok erect a level ten forcefield around this section post round the clock security
you intend to let it mature
the alternative is to pull the plug and im not prepared to do that not unless i have to resume your analysis i want to know exactly what were dealing with here or should i say whom
yes captain
ive adapted the astrometrics sensors to penetrate the borg forcefield
i thought you said this thing was a foetus
an hour ago it was the drone has entered the fourth phase of gestation in human terms it is a child of six years
you mean a boy of six years from what i can tell the drone is male seven route your sensor data to sickbay i want to run a few medical scans
stand by
well he appears to be human for the most part borg implants comprise approximately
twenty seven percent of his body
curious his body plating is composed of polydeutonic alloy
just like my mobile emitter
the nanoprobes must have extrapolated that technology it could explain his unique design
wait a minute the doctors emitter came from the twenty ninth century its five hundred years more advanced that anything weve got
it is logical to assume this drone will be equally advanced
a twenty ninth century borg
in essence
ive located my mobile emitter its embedded in his cerebral cortex
the emitter has been adapted to serve as part of his central nervous system it controls all autonomic functions
that means we cant remove it not without killing the drone
has it contacted the borg collective
no i have dampened its proximity transceiver
for now what about when it grows up
reactive body armour multidimensional adaptability internal transporter nodes
the drone possesses superior technology it will fully mature in less than two hours however its borg shielding is not yet active we can still terminate it but we must act quickly
hold on a minute seven i want some answers first what normally happens when a drone disengages from the maturation chamber
it awaits instructions from the collective
so without those instructions it has no designation right no purpose
correct
if we can keep him from interfacing with the collective maybe we can give him a purpose
captain
this is the most advanced drone ever to exist we could teach him our values seven we could show him what it means to be an individual
if we fail if the drone were to be assimilated the collective would become far more powerful
what im proposing is the only defence we have against that possibility short of murder and thats an order id prefer not to give as i recall seven there were a few crew members who had similar doubts about you
the situation is different
is it a borg disconnected from the collective unsure of its identity a potential threat but we succeeded were going to pull the same trick again only this time youre going to be the teacher
i am to instruct the drone in the ways of humanity
think of it as first contact and you are our ambassador
maturation cycle is complete
we are borg state our designation
designation is irrelevant you are not part of the collective you are an individual you will receive your instructions from me
insufficient
you must comply
insufficient we are borg
my designation is seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one you may call me seven of nine
seven of nine
you will comply with my commands
seven of nine
yes we are not borg we are individuals do you understand
state our designation
apparently not
the drones responses are programmed it doesnt understand what im saying i must initiate a direct neural interface
are you sure thats wise
there is no other way for me to communicate with it
proceed
you will not be harmed resistance is futile
i am providing it with instructions it understands
the drone is probing my neural pathways it is trying to assimilate all of my knowledge i cannot disengage the link
terminate interface you must comply you are hurting me
i will comply
special delivery two borg datanodes
more link them to the dataport how many borg hitchhikers are we going to pick up on this trip maybe this is the collectives new strategy they dont assimilate anymore they just show up and look helpless
now belanna
we dont know what this drone will turn into its gone from infant to adult in one day
it will become what we help it to become
how starfleet of you
seven of nine to neelix
neelix here
report to the science lab immediately bring the first datanode
on my way
we are borg state our designation
weve complied information into this datanode for you to assimilate
we do not understand
you will but first you must assimilate this data come here comply give me your arm inject the datanode with an assimilation tubule this access port
we do not understand
your designation is seven of nine
yes
your designation is neelix talaxian
thats me
this is a laboratory on a vessel
the starship voyager
i am travelling through interstellar space
yes
why
this is a ship of exploration
i am an explorer
we all are
we are borg
well no
you are a unique individual one of many on voyager this is not a borg collective do you understand
individual my thoughts are my own
precisely
i wish to assimilate more information
not yet your neural pathways require time to process the information you will need to regenerate soon i will adapt one of the alcoves in our cargo bay to your technology take the drone to the doctor for medical analysis go with him
all members of this crew must report to the sickbay for evaluation when i am finished here i will join you
duranium hull plasma based power distribution tricylic life support systems artificial gravity plating
right on all counts systems analysis appears to be your forte you should think about a future in starship operations
human female
very good
she was frightened by me
why do you say that
i detected an elevation in her pheromonal response
well youre new around here an unfamiliar face takes some getting used to i remember when i first came aboard voyager i provoked a few strange reactions myself i still do from time to time i mean just look at me whiskers and spots
were people afraid of you as well
well no
do they fear me because i am borg
sometimes borg can be a little intimidating dont take it personally
i want to know more about the collective
you do well of course you do
tell me about the borg
oh whats to tell youve seen one cybernetically enhanced species youve seen them all youll have plenty of time to learn all about them but first you have to give yourself a chance to adapt to life here on voyager now mister gosh im sorry in all the excitement i forgot your name
i do not have a name
every individual needs a name we cant just run around calling you the drone thats not very interesting is it
seven of nine tells me my designation is irrelevant
i disagree you should choose a name for yourself something that defines who you are after all theres only one of you
one
oh here we are sickbay
good morning
you are the emergency medical hologram
and you are very observant step this way please
i have to get back to the mess hall theres nothing to worry about the doctor is going to do a few scans youll be finished before you know it
i will comply
its a noninvasive biomedical scan you wont feel a thing your central nervous system is functioning normally but im picking up some degradation in your neural pathways youll need to regenerate soon
my central nervous system is regulated by your mobile emitter
thats right
your mobile emitter is more advanced than these diagnostic tools
far more advanced its technology that came from the twenty ninth century four hundred years in the future
i am an advanced form of life
yes
i am unique
mmm hmm
describe my origins
oh its a long story
i wish to hear it
another time
i wish to hear the story now
in a nutshell there was a transporter malfunction my emitter fused with several of seven of nines nanoprobes
i was an accident
call it a random convergence of technologies
am i unwelcome here
on the contrary our primary mission is to explore new forms of life you may have been unexpected but given time i am sure youll make a fine addition to the crew after all youve got my mobile emitter driving your neocortex so youre bound to make a dazzling impression thats called a joke
joke a verbal comment or gesture designed to provoke laughter
i see youve got your mothers sense of humour

this isnt a classroom seven
lieutenant belanna torres chief engineer klingon human hybrid she possesses extensive knowledge of this vessels systems as well as a volatile temperament
volatile english adjective meaning readily vaporisable at low temperature easily aroused tending to violent eruption
very good you get a gold star
our presence here is authorised the captain asked me to familiarise the drone with voyager
well how about familiarising him with the airponics bay i have got one hour to come up with a way to predict the expansion rate of this protonebula or janeways going to pull the plug on the entire survey do you mind
if you apply a multispatial algorithm it will accurately predict the rate of expansion i can demonstrate
all right
amazing
greetings our designation my designation is one how are you today
im just fine thank you one
he requested a designation one seemed appropriate
and how are you today one
well thank you captain janeway
adapting to life on voyager
yes to date ive assimilated forty seven billion terraquads of information on a vast variety of subjects including particle physics comparative humanoid anatomy warp field theory and the culinary delights of the delta quadrant
mister neelix theyve been spending time together
is your assessment of me complete am i sufficient
why yes more than sufficient in fact id say you were making excellent progress and this isnt an assessment one i simply wanted to meet you
with your permission i would like to be excused ive agreed to assist lieutenant torres she wishes to increase the efficiency of the bussard collectors
permission granted
youve done a remarkable job
thank you
not only has he absorbed an incredible amount of knowledge in a matter of days but he seems to be fitting in with the crew and developing a distinct personality
he is adapting quickly
then why do i get the feeling somethings bothering you
hes been expressing curiosity about the borg
ah and youre worried that if he learns about them he may be drawn to the collective
yes
maybe we should tell him what he wants to know id rather he learned about the borg from us than the collective
the lure of perfection is powerful captain he may be tempted to seek out the borg that would pose a grave tactical risk
well we can delay telling him for now but keep in mind the drone is becoming an individual seven he has the right to know sooner or later well have to answer his questions
deck eight section four cargo bay two used for the storage of spare components and surplus materials
it is also where i regenerate you will reside here with me
i wish to assimilate more information
you have assimilated enough for one day youve also provided invaluable assistance to the voyager crew you have exceeded expectations
then expectations were insufficient
a simple thank you would suffice
thank you
a customary expression of gratitude i paid you a compliment we must regenerate
this technology does not conform with starfleet parameters
correct
i am borg this technology is borg
we must regenerate
i wish to assimilate all available data pertaining to the borg
step into the alcove no you must face outward computer activate regeneration cycle alcoves beta and gamma
seven of nine
yes
thank you
we must regenerate
a borg proximity signal has been detected origin unimatrix three two five grid zero zero six alter course to intercept
captain
the drone transmitted a borg proximity signal wake him
you contacted the collective
no
check his transceiver
you deactivated my transceiver two days ago
it appears your cranial implants have adapted and created a secondary transceiver
a borg failsafe device
precisely have you detected any vessels
long range sensors picked up a transwarp conduit a ship is approaching
time to intercept
approximately three hours
the borg
yes
i wish to meet them
seven i think its time we showed our drone what the borg are all about
the borg have assimilated thousands of species
correct
what becomes of those species
their neural pathways are restructured and linked to a single collective mind the hive their bodies are augmented with cybernetic technology they become drones
i wish to experience the hive mind
if you did that youd no longer be unique the borg would destroy your individuality
and that is undesirable
very the borg are the most destructive force weve ever encountered theyve assimilated billions of individuals against their will
you were assimilated
my link to the collective was severed
when you were in the collective you assimilated others
yes
you call the borg destructive seven of nine is not
thats because shes regained her individuality if the borg had the chance theyd take it away from her again theyd assimilate everyone on voyager with your advanced technology the collective would become even more destructive we have to prevent that from happening but we cant do it without you we need your abilities to enhance our defences shields weapons will you help us resist them
seven of nine do you wish to rejoin the collective
voyager is my collective
i will need time to assimilate this information
all hands to battle stations a borg vessel is approaching
we just ran out of time
seven of nine im detecting irregularities in my autonomic nervous system cardiovascular excitation vaesoconstriction
you are experiencing an emotion anxiety it is only temporary
anxiety a state of apprehension caused by fear
the borg usually elicit this response in others
are you experiencing anxiety as well
yes along with every crew member on voyager
because they fear assimilation
correct we are needed on the bridge
deck one
seven of nine
yes
what will happen now
we will engage the borg
will voyager be destroyed
the borg are powerful but captain janeway is a resourceful leader we will resist
resistance is futile
perhaps
the borg vessels moving into range

longrange tactical vessel transwarp capability ablative hull armour
were being scanned
theyre preparing to attack you must help us enhance our shields this station will give you access to the shield generators
they are hailing us
open a channel
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
i can hear them in my mind
theyve locked on a tractor beam
the collective is calling to me
i hear it too billions of voices speaking as one we must resist that voice the crew of voyager will be destroyed if we dont
our shields are remodulating
weve broken free
can you enhance our phasers
yes
do it when hes finished target their propulsion system be prepared to jump to warp mister paris
enhancements complete you may fire
what happened
they inverted our phaser beam with a feedback pulse
they just took out our warp drive
your technology is limited i cannot enhance it further i must interface with the collective i can disrupt their vessel from within
they will try to assimilate you
they will fail
harry lock on to the drone
that wont be necessary
hes inside the sphere
we are the borg you will be assimilated
my technology is superior stop your attack or i will destroy you
your technological distinctiveness will be added to our own resistance is futile
shields down to twenty nine percent
hes accessing their navigational controls
its heading directly for the nebula
if they get too close their hull will collapse
terminate your interface
stand down red alert tuvok secure all stations organise damage control teams chakotay
captain im reading a lifesign in the debris its the drone he survived
hes erected a multispatial force field around his body but it is weakening
get a lock on him beam him to sickbay
damage
several of his implants were fused in the explosion but theyre regenerating his biological systems are a different story severe trauma to the cerebral cortex internal bleeding he needs immediate surgery
the sphere
destroyed you were successful
while i was linked to the borg i could hear their thoughts their objectives they are aware of my existence they will pursue me
irrelevant they will fail
i need to get started
no i should not exist i was an accident a random convergence of technologies
you are unique
i was never meant to be as long as i exist you are in danger all life on voyager is in danger
we can talk about this later
allow the doctor to proceed lower the forcefield
his synapses are failing
you must comply
i will not
you must comply please you are hurting me

i dont believe it
report to engineering on the double
computer end programme
i was not aware that protective attire was required for this mission
i was on the holodeck orbital skydiving
leaping from a spacecraft at exospheric altitudes a curious form of recreation the probe is ready for launch however there is still a problem with the telemetry link lieutenant is something wrong
actually im not feeling so well can you handle the launch without me
you are putting me in charge
problem
no just unexpected shall i inform the doctor youre ill
no dont
captain someones locked onto our probe with a tractor beam
it looks like a malon freighter
i had a feeling we hadnt seen the last of them
open a channel
aye captain
starship voyager to the malon vessel that probe belongs to us release it immediately
no response
tom how fast can you get us there
two hours at least
theyll be long gone
if we instruct the probe to emit a polaron burst it could disrupt the tractor beam
do it
the beam has been disabled
harry redirect the probes course
the malon are in pursuit
that probe cant outrun them
no but we might be able to hide it from them
captain
the probe surveyed a class six gas giant this morning i think we should send it back for a closer look
youre going to steer the probe into a gas giant
captain the atmospheric pressure will crush it
not if the borg shielding does its job hail them again
no response
voyager to malon vessel break off your pursuit
the probe is entering the giants upper atmosphere and the malon vessel is following it in
the probes stuck in a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and methane about ten thousand kilometres below the outer atmosphere its not responding to commands
any good news
its still intact it can be repaired
if we can get it out of there
sorry im late
we were just discussing how to retrieve the probe is there any possibility of transporting it out
no
just no
i dont see how we could get close enough
is there any way to boost transporter range
not in that kind of atmosphere
well if we cant transport it out well just have to fly in and grab it
perhaps you werent paying attention when the malon freighter imploded
we wont be going in a malon freighter tuvok well be going in our new shuttlecraft
here we go again
lets face it classtwo shuttles just dont cut it in the delta quadrant weve needed something bigger and better since we got here its time we built it
tom weve been through this i dont know how many times we all appreciate your enthusiasm
speak for yourself commander
bottom line we dont have time to design and build a ship from scratch
i knew you were going to say that so ive given us a head start
behold the delta flyer ultraaerodynamic contours retractable nacelles parametallic hull plating unimatrix shielding based on tuvoks brilliant design for the multispatial probe and a borginspired weapons system
basic design elements are adequate
high praise
if we used isomagnetic eps conduits in the plasma manifold we could maximise the power distribution
thats the spirit harry
my shield designs could be successfully applied to a vessel of this size
big of you to admit it tuvok
and you think itll be able to withstand the gas giants atmosphere
the probe did
im impressed but how quickly can it be built
we could replicate the alloys and the new design components use spare parts from storage if we worked around the clock we could have it up and running inside a week
im willing to put in as much overtime as it takes
i will forego regeneration for the duration of the project
what about you belanna building a new vessel from scratch thats an engineers dream come true
what do you say captain
why are you all standing around
computer add dynametric tail fins to the nacelles
computer delete dynametric tail fins
whatd you do that for
we are not designing a hot rod lieutenant
that is exactly what were designing a twenty fourth century warppowered ultraresponsive hot rod
your embellishments are purely decorative they serve no practical purpose
i beg to differ if we make this thing look mean enough other ships are going to think twice before taking us on
i suggest we return our attention to the matter of structural integrity
agreed
lieutenant torres hull design is flawed we should be using tetraburnium alloys instead of titanium
er belanna
sounds fine to me im going to finish up the thruster specs
its open
hey
thruster specs
thanks wherere you running off to
my quarters
stay a while ill replicate some dinner a bottle of burgundy we deserve a break dont you think
not tonight
belanna whats going on
nothing
well then how come its impossible to have a conversation with you
im sorry
i dont want an apology i want an explanation
tom im tired
asleep is more like it you hardly said three words in that last meeting and then when seven changed your design you acted like like you didnt care
i guess i didnt
i dont get it how many times have we talked about how great it would be to do what were doing now to really collaborate my piloting skills and your engineering expertise we finally get the chance to create something together from the ground up and youre not the slightest bit enthusiastic
im doing my job arent i i delivered the thruster specs on schedule
belanna im not your boss im not questioning your productivity or keeping tabs on how many hours you put in i just want to know whats going on
i have to go

ensign put us into a high orbit i want to stay well above that ionospheric turbulence
aye maam
theres the probe ten thousand kilometres beneath all that methane but still intact
were not alone im reading massive theta radiation its being dumped by a malon freighter approaching from the far side of the planet theyre hailing
theyre more talkative than the last ones open a channel
aye sir
leave orbit of this planet now
i dont believe weve been introduced im captain janeway
i know exactly who you are you are the person responsible for the destruction of one of our freighters and the deaths of nine malon citizens
im very sorry that lives were lost but youre leaving out an important detail your people were trying to steal a probe from us we warned them to stay away from the gas giant but they didnt listen
im taking your probe as compensation for our losses
thats going to be a little difficult its stuck beneath the atmosphere of the same gas giant that crushed your other ship
my people are expert at salvage operations
well mister
vrelk controller vrelk
vrelk we have a little expertise of our own were a very determined crew so my suggestion is that you leave orbit and in the future if you come across anything that bears the insignia of the uss voyager head in the other direction
you are making a serious error
end transmission why would people in the business of toxic waste disposal be so anxious to get hold of a probe
its not just any probe its multispatial technology maybe they think itll help them find new places to dump their garbage
belanna what a nice surprise i was just getting ready to close business has been slow with so many people busy on the new shuttle
oh i was just hoping we could catch up
you want to catch up with me
if you have the time
are you kidding yeah can i get you something name your poison
oh er
come on belanna i handed that one to you on a silver platter
huh
name your poison i was expecting one of those scathing but affectionate insults you always make about my cooking
sorry
youll feel wittier on a full stomach so whatll it be
actually i was hoping for banana pancakes
i dont think i ever heard of banana pancakes before
my grandmother used to make them for me when i was a kid its always put a smile on my face
well then one smile coming right up
computer one stack of banana pancakes smells delicious
thanks so how have you been
oh just great my security training is going really well tuvok told me the other day that im er not completely inept arent you going to try them
sure
well
delicious i have to get back to work
what are they still doing here
apparently theyre not willing to give up on the probe so easily
the question is how do they expect to get their hands on it
its reasonable to assume theyre waiting for us to retrieve the probe at which time theyll attempt to steal it again
maybe but they have to know were prepared for that if they were planning to fight youd think theyd call in reinforcements try to outgun us
sensors dont show any other malon ships in the area
seven of nine to the captain
janeway here
report to the astrometrics lab i have important information regarding the malon
vessel
tuvok
what have you got
ive been using coherent neutrino beams to document activity aboard the malon freighter
in other words youve been spying on them
ive made a troubling discovery this is a polythermal image of an interior section of the alien ship the shaded figures you see are malon crew members
that appears to be a small ship
correct the malon are constructing a spacecraft composed of tetraburnium alloys
theoretically such a ship would be capable of withstanding extreme atmospheric pressures
ill be damned theyre going after the probe themselves
thats not all captain according to my projections they will finish construction of their vessel at least thirty six hours before we finish ours
well then id say weve got an oldfashioned space race on our hands
i keep telling you weve got to reinforce the hull with kellinite thats all there is to it
proposing the same flawed strategy over and over again will not me it more effective ensign
well weve got to come up with something or well never get this thing off the ground
vorik turn that damn thing off i cant hear myself think
sorry sir
look we could spend weeks trying to solve this but weve got a ticking clock engines are working weapons systems are online i say we launch now and hope for the best
mister paris that is perhaps the most illogical statement youve ever made unless we find a way to reconfigure the structural integrity field the hull will incur microfractures during descent
microfractures tuvok doesnt necessarily mean well have a hull breach
and if we do i suppose these useless design elements from your captain proton scenario will compensate for the problem
hey every one of these knobs and levers is fully functional
and completely superfluous
maybe to you i am tired of tapping panels for once i want controls that let me actually feel the ship im piloting
where are you going
holodeck
what for

ensign back us off
vrelk is hailing
on screen
that was rude wasnt it but we still have quite a bit of antimatter waste to expel i hope we didnt damage your shields
our shields are fine
mmm well we only ejected a small amount of waste this time we still have much much more to get rid of your shields may not be able to stand even higher levels of theta radiation
ive already told you were not going anywhere
lets stop playing these games captain youve scanned my ship ive scanned yours we each know the other is building a vessel to retrieve the probe what you dont know is that my vessel will be ready to launch in less than two days youre too far behind
well if youre so far ahead why bother trying to scare us away
just trying to save you the embarrassment of losing
think theyre really two days away
hes probably bluffing but were not going to take any chances weve got to speed up construction somehow
wed also better find a way to shore up our shields in case vrelk decides to do anymore venting
good idea janeway to lieutenant torres computer locate lieutenant torres
lieutenant torres is in holodeck one
get down there
warning hull microfractures are present in zones one two three and four hull breach is imminent repeat hull microfracture are present in zones one two three and four hull breach is imminent
computer freeze programme belanna chakotay to sickbay medical emergency
what am i doing here
you had an accident on the holodeck
how long was i out
almost twelve hours
id better get back to work
not just yet
why
the captains asked me to keep you here
but i feel fine
would you excuse us please doctor
captain whats going on
when the doctor examined you he found evidence of internal bleeding fractured vertebrae contusions cranial trauma
i guess the accident was pretty serious
the injuries im talking about didnt happen recently some of them are weeks even months old
well im an engineer ive had my share of bumps and bruises
but you didnt seek treatment for any of these
i dont run to sickbay every time i stub my toe
some of these injuries were lifethreatening belanna
do i look like im dying
the doctor says many of the wounds were treated by someone with the medical expertise of a firstyear nursing student
oh thats ridiculous
is it we investigated todays accident you turned off the safety protocols during the holosimulation why
we have a microfracture problem with the safety protocols on theres no way to be sure what would happen during a real flight
you dont really expect me to believe that do you
are you calling me a liar
according to the holodeck logs youve been spending a lot of time there over the last few months if i were to check would i find that youve been running other programmes without safety protocols
would you like to look at my personal logs as well
belanna im worried about you if theres something wrong i want to help
nothings wrong okay
no its not okay and until you decide to be more forthcoming youll remain under the doctors supervision which means youre off the shuttle project im sorry
im not
now i know theres something wrong
engines are operating at close to ninety percent efficiency sevens got her new weapons system online and if we can just solve that microfracture problem well be ready to go
keep on it now lets talk about belanna tom you had no idea about these injuries or how she got them
she never complained about being hurt but then again shes barely speaking to me lately
its almost as if shes been intentionally trying to hurt herself
you think all these injuries have been happening on the holodeck
well where else if theyd happened while she was working as she claims somebody wouldve filed an injury report
any idea what sort of programmes shes been running
are you thinking the same thing i am
i hate to go digging around in someones personal holodeck programmes but if she wont tell us whats going on i dont think we have much choice
tom what do you think
hes right
start digging
im sleeping
oh
hi
hi i i thought you were the doctor making a house call
he let you out of the cell block huh
he thinks familiar surroundings will help speed my recovery
recovery from what
thats what i said he thinks im suffering from clinical depression
are you depressed
what are you the new ships counsellor
no just a friend
this whole thing is so ridiculous i dont report a few scrapes and suddenly janeway thinks theres something wrong with me typical starfleet huh
you have been running holodeck programmes without safety protocols
a few but i havent put anybody else at risk and its nothing that i cant handle
tell you what what do you say you and i pay a little visit to the holodeck you can show me some of the programmes youve been running
right now
sure maybe if i see what youve been up to i can convince the captain theres nothing to worry about
shes taken away my holodeck privileges
consider them restored
computer activate holoprogramme torres zeta one

what are you doing

not until you tell me what it is
you know what it is
whos this
lipaz dont you recognise him
oh i recognise them all meyer nelson sahreen you created a programme to watch all our maquis friends get slaughtered what i want to know is why
i thought we came down here to talk about safety protocols this has nothing to do with that
im not so sure the logs show you only ran this programme for forty seven seconds the day after i gave you the news about the massacre then you shut it down and started running the most dangerous programmes you could find with the safeties off why
this is ridiculous im leaving
computer seal the doors
you cant do this
the hell i cant youre not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on belanna why are you intentionally trying to hurt yourself
i dont know
are you trying to commit suicide
no
then why
because because if i sprain my ankle at least i feel something
what do you mean
im not trying to kill myself im trying to see if im still alive
i dont understand
when you look at those corpses how do you feel
sad angry maybe a little guilty that i wasnt there to die with them
not me i dont feel anything at all
belanna the maquis were like our adopted family i can understand you trying to block out that kind of pain
you dont understand its not just the pain i dont feel anything not about my dead friends not about tom you my job
maybe youre afraid if you let yourself start to feel something you might not be able to stop you cant just shut off your emotions belanna sooner or later youre going to have to let yourself grieve
why just so i can go through it all over again
what are you talking about
when i was six my father walked out on me when i was nineteen i got kicked out of starfleet a few years later i got separated from the maquis and just when i start to feel safe you tell me that all of our old friends have been slaughtered the way i figure it ive lost every family ive ever had
belanna you have a new family now here on voyager youre not going to lose us youre stuck with us
you cant promise me that
no i suppose i cant losing peoples inevitable and sometimes it happens sooner than we expect but i can promise you that the people on this ship arent about to let you stop living your life or break your neck on the holodeck youre going to have to find another way to deal with this
i dont know how
then well figure it out together
commander chakotay were under attack report to the bridge immediately
youd better go
why are they suddenly picking a fight
i believe theyre attempting to distract us commander while they launch their new shuttlecraft
the malon vessel is forty two thousand kilometres from the probe and closing
we can still catch them
bridge to lieutenant paris
paris here
weve got to launch now if were going to get to the probe first are you ready
yes maam ill begin the prelaunch sequence
what about the microfracture problem
were keeping an eye on it but we sure could use an extra hand
chakotays on his way
chakotay let me go
belanna im in a hurry
i am not out to get myself hurt if thats what youre thinking i just want to do my job
i thought you werent interested in your job anymore
if that hull breaches i should be there im still the best engineer weve got
not lately
i can do this i need to do this
forty seconds to launch
powering impulse engines
stand by to bring aft thrusters online
belanna
i heard you might need some help keeping this thing from falling apart
welcome aboard
vorik youre in my seat
excuse me lieutenant
twenty seconds to launch
get that hatch closed
hatch sealed
give me aft thrusters
aft thrusters enabled
ten seconds
alright lets see what this baby can do
five four three two one
the delta flyer is away captain
how long till they overtake the malon shuttle
at present velocity approximately three minutes
were in
structural integritys at ninety two percent
theres the malon shuttle two hundred kilometres off the port bow and three thousand kilometres from the probe
well catch them belanna hows the hull
structural integritys down about twelve percent
theyre launching spatial charges shields holding
they want to play dirty lets show them what a little borginspired weaponry can do
acknowledged loading photonic missiles
weve lost power to secondary systems
fire
three direct hits
theyre losing attitude control theyre pulling up
nice shooting seven im taking us down to the target harry get ready to grab the probe
still out of transport range
were losing integrity fifty percent forty
if you can hold us together for another half a minute well be within range of the target
we still need to survive the ascent
one thing at a time
were losing structural integrity its down to twenty five percent
harry prepare to lock on
weve got microfractures forming aft starboard hull zone two
ive got a lock beaming the probe into the cargo hold got it
initiating rapid ascent
harry i need those secondary systems back online
i cant theyre fried
lieutenant what are you doing
patching a hole before it opens
thatll never hold
itll hold a minute or two and with any luck thats all we need seven take over here i need an eps relay
er theres one in the transporter control circuitry
the panel is sealed
good get away from it
i need a phaser
watch out i dont know if this is going to work
glad you decided to come along
the delta flyer has docked
and the malon
theyre a little preoccupied seems their shuttlecrafts having a problem climbing out of the gas giants atmosphere
get us out of here ensign warp two
aye captain
belanna i heard you did a hell of a job so how are you
you mean am i back to my old charming self i dont know
give it time
chakotay what you did down in the holodeck today thanks but if you ever do anything like that again ill break your neck
computer one stack of banana pancakes with maple syrup
welcome to earth i am admiral bullock and i will be your commanding officer for the next six months questions comments bring them to me problems talk to lieutenant kinis larsen youre assigned to the federation council deputy liaison officer young and raskin report to orbital flight control youll be monitoring incoming vessels from the bolian sector
i can save you some time there son theyre bamboo
i know that unfortunately my tricorders reading them as maple trees i think the isodyne relays must be malfunctioning
why dont you pay a visit to logistical support maybe theyll issue you a new one
good idea
im going that way myself mind some company
not at all
so whats your assignment here
i dont know i havent received my orders yet i just arrived
from where
a three year tour on the intrepid
is that a fact i thought the intrepid was patrolling the neutral zone
it is i caught a transport vessel at deep space seven
ah got tired of wrestling with the romulans
lets just say its good to be back what about yourself how long have you been posted here mister
boothby boothbys the name
boothby ive heard of you
i should hope so ive been tending these grounds for fifty four years give or take a few months
and beautiful grounds they are
mmm hmm logistical support straight through the main complex second door on your right
thank you
commander logistics is a secure area they wont let you in with that holoimaging device fresh from the neutral zone youre not a romulan double agent are you son
actually i was just recording a few images for my friends back home would you mind posing for a shot
me you want a picture of me
the one and only boothby my friends would be impressed
well when you put it that way cadet take our picture will you
dont cut off our heads i expect a copy of that young man
youre in my seat and youre reading my book do you want my drink too
depends what is it
klingon martini vermouth gin with a dash of bloodwine
bloodwine never touch the stuff
what do you like
excuse me i was waiting for a friend
valerie archer
hayek jason hayek
nice tattoo i bet theres a story behind it
a long one a cave beyond logic vulcan perspectives on platonic thought sounds fascinating
you can borrow it if you like
thanks anyway i can only take small doses of vulcan philosophy
stationed here
temporarily
where do you call home
you first where are you from
everywhere my parents were starship officers by the time i was ten id seen half the quadrant
starfleet brat
bratty as they come
can i ask you a question have you ever reverted
reverted not yet
ensign ohalloran this is his third time this week if it happens again theyll pull him out of training
what about you any trouble
oh i can keep my human form its the little things that bother me
little things
breathing oxygen bipedal locomotion and sleeping the concept of being unconscious for eight hours a night its so alien
i know what you mean
thats why i started reading their books for some reason it helps me relax but we shouldnt be talking about this think human talk human be human remember
how could i forget
so had a chance to take a look around
not yet
headquarters has a lot more to offer than conference rooms and consoles if you have the right guide
is that an invitation
i get off duty at nineteen hundred hours
commander
speak of the devil
we were just discussing vulcan philosophy
join us
another time perhaps we have work to do
oh cant it wait
im afraid not
what about tonight do we have a date nineteen hundred hours meet you right here
ill do my best
live long and prosper
a date
relax tuvok i plan on standing her up
we agreed to limit our investigation to surveillance
it was worth the risk she talked about training these are some kind of aliens learning to pose as humans
for what purpose
i dont know i didnt get that far
were due back at the transporter coordinates
excuse me gentlemen youve entered a restricted area captains and above
sorry we didnt realise
im going to have to ask you to come with me
why
all unauthorised personnel are to be debriefed by starfleet intelligence direct orders from admiral bullock
listen ensign were late for a meeting with starfleet command the debriefing will have to wait
im sorry commander
very well
when he regains consciousness hell no doubt want to report this incident
chakotay to paris three to beam up
three
ill explain later
whos that
one of starfleets finest take us to voyager
what did you find down there
earth
welcome aboard
where am i
on a starship
what starship why have you brought me here ill be reporting this incident to the admiral
you can drop the charade we know youre not human
who are you
gentry david rank ensign starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight planet of origin earth
were not interested in your knowledge of human culture were not part of your recreation im captain janeway of the federation starship voyager im from earth youre not
gentry david rank ensign starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight
doctor
what are you doing
i need a sample of your dna
why
since you wont tell us who you are we have no choice but to find out for ourselves
you wont be harmed
gentry to headquarters security alert
weve disabled your comm badge
no dont touch me disease humans
it appears hes released a cellular toxin into his bloodstream hes dead
federation council astrophysics starfleet medical complex they even recreated the officers club the quantum café
computer return to time index 4228 thats boothby
captain
the head groundskeeper at starfleet academy when i was a cadet he used to give me fresh roses for my quarters
its safe to assume this individual is not boothby
whoever they are theyve gathered incredibly accurate information about starfleet headquarters
perhaps they had access to a federation database
or theyve been to san francisco
the habitats population consists of humans vulcans bolian ferengi all alpha quadrant species
what do we know about this artificial environment seven
ive used the tricorder data holoimages and astrometric scans to extrapolate a crosssection of the interior i believe they used a combination of holographic projection and particle synthesis
power source
there are thirteen thermionic generators beneath the city i cant identify the energy signatures
the habitats heavily fortified they are well prepared to defend against an attack
sickbay to captain
go ahead
ive completed my postmortem analysis youd better get down here
on my way if this is a training ground it could mean theyre planning an invasion of the federation we should prepare for the worst see if you can find a way to penetrate their defences
he may look human he may sound human he may even smell human but theres no question hes alien
was he genetically altered
on a highly sophisticated level if it werent for microcellular scans i wouldnt be able to distinguish him from the genuine article ive managed to isolate the alien dna fortunately most of his cells are still chemically active if i use a cytokinetic injection i should be able to trigger a genetic reversion
do it
talk about a wolf in sheeps clothing
species 8472 the question is why are they training to pose as human beings
back in the twentieth century the soviets used to build american towns to train their agents to infiltrate the united states species 8472 could be doing the same thing
theyre going to infiltrate the alpha quadrant
maybe they already have
toms right how else could they have gathered their information about us
perhaps theyve acquired it from the borg
it doesnt matter how they got their data we need to find out what they intend to do with it
if our previous experience is any indication they will try to destroy earth
a logical assumption they did threaten to purge our galaxy of all life
tuvok keep working on a way to target their habitats power source were going to need nanoprobe warheads and plenty of them seven see to it
yes captain
in the meantime ive got a date to keep i made contact with one of them commander valerie archer maybe i can capitalise on the relationship get a better idea of what theyre planning
tom harry take him back in the delta flyer keep a constant transporter lock on him if species 8472 attacks earth the federation wont have any defences against them and i dont need to remind you that we have no way to warn starfleet command voyager may be the last defense against an allout invasion of earth
last minute preparations
just planning my big night out
i can recommend a nice japanese replimat on the embarcadero
i was never very good with chopsticks
starfleet headquarters brings back memories even if it is just a recreation i remember my last visit there i was given my general orders for voyagers first mission proceed to the badlands and find the maquis
the orders that brought us together
what about you when was the last time you were at headquarters
before today march 3rd 2368 the day i resigned my commission i can still remember the look on the admirals face
which one
nimembeh
he taught at the academy didnt he
thats right
interspecies ethics wasnt it
tactical analysis
of course
kathryn you think i might be one of them youre testing me
you and tuvok were in the alien habitat for nearly three hours anything could have happened down there
true why dont you have tuvok meet us in sickbay the doctor can perform a microcellular analysis
tuvoks already there
you could have just asked me to report to sickbay
given ensign gentrys reaction i thought id be a little more tactful
not taking any chances are you
dont feel singled out ive asked the doctor to examine the entire crew theres no telling how 8472 got their information about starfleet from the borg earth for all we know theres been an impostor on board
cell morphology normal all of your nucleotide sequences are accounted for youre a hundred percent human
thats a relief and tuvok
green blooded vulcan through and through well two down one hundred and twenty five to go
youd better get going
right i dont want to be late
just be home before midnight
yes maam
ive enhanced this tricorder with a transoptic datalink it should help you access some of their systems type one phaser modified to fire borg nanoprobes
right
do you always arm yourself before a first date
youve never had a date with species 8472
personally i dont go out with girls from other galaxies
youre a true explorer chakotay
is she cute
in her human form anyway
ive always wondered what it would be like to date an alien
ill take notes
were making our approach
all stop shields up
feisty little fellows youve increased their cellular motility by over two hundred percent
i thought it would be prudent to maximize their efficiency
seven the last time we used nanoprobes we sent 8472 scurrying back to fluidic space you cant get more efficient than that
the species is highly adaptive its been over a year since our first encounter they may have developed a defence against our technology
theres one way to find out we can test the nanoprobes on our corpse youll find the body in morgue chamber three beam it to the surgical bay the creatures only been dead for a few hours there should still be plenty of cellular activity
initiate a bioscan full spectrum dont worry its an autonomic reflex the creature still has residual bioelectric activity in its nervous system
somethings wrong the nanoprobes should have taken effect by now
hmm
what is it
the creatures nucleotides are still intact it looks like your concerns were warranted well have to inform the captain we may have to
doctor
false alarm
i will replicate more nanoprobes
i dont mind telling you seven im still holding out for a diplomatic solution
improbable species 8472 will not respond to diplomacy
funny we used to say the same thing about the borg my point is anythings possible if you keep an open mind optimism seven try to look on the bright side
it is difficult to be optimistic when we are preparing for battle
have you ever heard the phrase the best defence is a good offence
no
throughout human history weapons of mass destruction were often designed in the hopes that theyd never be used
and yet in earths third world war nuclear weapons accounted for six hundred million casualties were they looking on the bright side
an unfortunate exception
we were just talking about you
oh
she didnt think you were going to show up
boothby
ive known archer since she was a first year cadet shes not easily impressed i didnt think you were her type oh er if youll excuse me ive got some midnight orchids that need my attention think about what i said young lady youll be fine
thank you boothby
problems
i was offered a field commission this morning first officer of the starship horcha
congratulations
its a klingon vessel
oh so what did boothby say
ducha me gagh roh smile when you eat the gagh
wise words
yeah
do you always seek advice from the groundskeeper
half the captains in starfleet wouldnt be where they are today if it werent for boothby lopez picard richardson just to name a few closing time
you offered to be my guide wheres our next stop
can you dance
ive been accused of trying
its pon farr night at the vulcan nightclub
vulcan
its just around the corner
take it easy harry we didnt build the delta flyer to withstand such extensive pacing
he should have contacted us by now
give him time
four hours
its a date these things cant be rushed they probably just finished dinner a couple of drinks and now they are moving past the polite stage
polite stage the last 8472 i met tried to dissolve me from the inside out
it was only trying to get to know you better harry you cant fault a person for that look chakotay can take care of himself and if he cant who better than us to come to the rescue
turns out the transporter malfunctioned my uniform ended up in the pattern buffer
youre kidding you were naked
not entirely i had my commbadge
i hope it was wellplaced computer lights
so this is where theyre putting up officers nowadays not bad
can i get you something to drink
waters fine
im beginning to think youre a teetotaller
i like to stay in control
always at yellow alert huh
something like that
find anything interesting
beyond the galactic edge humanitys quest for infinity this is a 21st century edition of hesterman isnt it
replicated good book though
never read it
you should human beings theyre quite a paradox
oh how so
at first glance theyre so primitive genetic impurities no telepathy violent and yet theyve created so many beautiful ways to communicate their ideas literature art music at times ive actually enjoyed being in this form you must think im crazy
not at all
i wonder what they think about us
hard to say
ill tell you what i think they despise us theyll attack any species thats not part of their federation mmm speaking of being in human form i could use an isomorphic injection you need one
im fine
make yourself at home
commander how do you like the view
lovely
looks like a full moon you can see the entire bay on a night like this
i should have brought my holoimager you make a pretty picture
mmm feel that salinated oxygen molecules stimulating the epidermal and neural receptors nonfluidic space has its charms
no argument there
planet earth the simulation will be real soon enough
how soon do you think
weeks days as soon as they think were ready
can i be honest with you
please
im starting to wonder if all this is worth the effort
what do you mean
this simulation our mission are we certain the humans pose a threat
they were allies with the borg they invaded our realm
that was one incident that doesnt mean the entire federation is planning a war against us
we cant trust them we have to prepare for the worst
im not so sure
i think youve been human a little too long
before you know it ill be sending my resume to the real starfleet
alien from distant galaxy seeks employment references available upon request
well its getting late id better go
already
i have a tactical report to finish before morning
arent we forgetting something im no expert at human dating rituals but i think its customary to kiss good night youve never done this before
actually
me neither just think of it as part of our training
report
i analysed his dna your suspicions were correct
how much does he know
its difficult to say hell have to be interrogated
where is he
by now he should be in the main quad i recommend we go to daylight hell be easier to track
chakotay to paris delta flyer respond he shoots a man who is running towards him then runs himself but soon he is surrounded by humanoid 8472 who grab him and take him away
yes come in
the borg modifications are complete nineteen standard photon torpedoes and three class tens armed with highyield warheads
more
we have depleted our supply of nanoprobes
replicate a new supply
that is not possible
have the doctor extract them from your bloodstream grow them in a petrie dish whatever it takes if we do engage 8472 i dont intend to run out of firepower midbattle you of all people should understand that they killed what four million drones directive zero one zero before engaging alien species in battle any and all attempts to make first contact and achieve nonmilitary resolution must be made in this case we made first contact over a year ago and we barely got out of it alive it seems to me a battle is inevitable maybe even war so why cant i get that directive out of my mind
this species intends to purge our galaxy of all life its time you resisted your starfleet philosophy
captain to the bridge
the away team is hailing us
tom
chakotays in trouble he tried to contact us ten minutes ago but his signal was cut off
has your vessel been detected
i dont think so at least no ones tried to take a shot at us yet
hold your position keep trying to locate him were on our way
yes maam
bring those borg weapons online red alert all hands to battle stations take us out of orbit
i thought you had a tactical report to finish
whatll you have son im a single malt man myself aged two hundred years been saving it for a special occasion and id say this is special enough a toast to earth chakotay rank commander starfleet service number forty seven alpha six one two first officer uss voyager
species 8472 origin fluidic space
well now that weve been formally introduced how many ships cat got your tongue i asked you a question how many vessels do you have in the delta quadrant
one
how did you find us
we detected what looked like a federation subspace transmission it took us weeks to track it here
we wanted this simulation to be accurate to the last detail we obviously went a little too far now that you know about our recreation youve no doubt alerted the federation your fleet will be on its way
youve got it wrong were not planning a war against you
is that why you were here to spy on us because youre curious
sir a starship is approaching its voyager
raise our shields stand by all weapons
captain janeway is not here to launch an attack shes here to find me
weve got the real mccoy here we might as well take advantage of it perform a genetic extraction it may help us find a better way to maintain these human forms
yes sir
we are approaching the habitat
shields to maximum charge weapons all hands this is the bridge tactical alert report to your posts and stand by to engage the enemy
i have a visual were being scanned
let them take a look
the delta flyer is heading up from the habitat
open a channel tom status
theyve taken a couple of potshots at us captain weve lost our shields mind if we join you
youre clear to dock shuttlebay two any word from chakotay
im afraid not
bring us within range target their weapons array
captain we should target their power systems as well
no i dont want to risk shutting down their life support if we can end this without casualties so much the better
this species does not deserve our compassion
you picked a lousy time for an ethical debate the weapons array now
were entering weapons range thirty eight hundred kilometres thirty five hundred thirty two hundred
valerie
thats not my name
then what is it youre afraid of us arent you you think were violent that were planning to destroy your species but none of thats true if you would take the time to speak to us directly we could prove it to you there are no secrets except the secrets that keep themselves
shaw
george bernard shaw i saw a copy of his collected works on your bookshelf
he had a complex mind for a human
and he had a point as long as we keep spying on each other making assumptions we probably will go to war
voyager
theyre charging weapons
do the same
were being hailed
mister boothby
captain janeway
good to see you after all these years enjoying the delta quadrant
dont get sassy with me young lady this recreation may be starfleet but our weapons are far more sophisticated i can destroy your vessel with a single command run along now
im not going anywhere not until you return my first officer and give me a damn good explanation for what youre doing in our galaxy ive targeted your recreation with borg nanoprobes and were willing to use them if you force us to
dont try to rattle my cage ill disable your tactical systems before you can
the last time our species engaged in battle you suffered heavy casualties are you willing to take that chance again an armed conflict isnt going to solve our problems we could go on making threats spying on each other risking a war between our species or we could try a more direct approach
what do you have in mind
how about a class reunion
targ manure united federation of planets tolerance for all species the prime directive targ manure every word of it
your metaphor is colourful but inaccurate
vulcan logic add that to the list
obviously youve studied a starfleet database you must have learned something about our history we adhere to our directives
highminded ideals are one thing but your actions tell a very different story you infiltrated our recreation captured and killed one of our people
i told you he took his own life
you created biological weapons to infect our species you are allies with the borg
theres a drone sitting at this very table look at her all gussied up to look like a human being
i am no longer part of the collective
once a borg always a borg
seven of nine is a member of this crew
the borg are irrelevant its the humans that pose a threat
they think the federation is a hostile invasion force out to destroy their species
i see so youre planning a preemptive strike against earth
maybe i am
you realise i cant let that happen
go ahead fire your damn nanoprobes blow our recreation to high heavens there are a dozen more scattered throughout the quadrant youll never find them all
what if i told you that starfleet isnt planning an invasion that no one on earth has even heard of you
id say youre lying
have another look at that federation database of yours youll see theres no mention of your realm
immaterial any information regarding our species has no doubt been classified by starfleet intelligence
good point you know we could keep this paranoid debate going all day you have no reason to trust us and we have no reason to trust you
hear hear i knew this reunion would be a fiasco admiral
seven disarm the warheads do it
captain
do it
what are you trying to prove young lady
one of us has to take our finger off the trigger it might as well be me
their weapons are offline
its a trick
our defences are down what will you do now blow voyager to high heavens or do we keep talking
humans youve got a flair for the dramatic ill give you that you want to keep talking fine by me but no more beating around the bush now what do you want from us the truth captain
voyager is alone in the delta quadrant we havent been in contact with earth for over four years
explain why you attacked our realm hand in hand with the borg
at the time we didnt realise the borg had started the war against you we forged a temporary alliance with them because we thought you were the threat
your galaxy will be purged sound familiar
we were only trying to defend ourselves
if thats true why are you still in our galaxy your conflict with the borg ended over a year ago
why recreate starfleet masquerade as humans it looks to me like youre the ones planning an invasion the truth
dont answer her shes manipulating us
if you wont answer i will
commander
our mission is to infiltrate your home world to place operatives in the highest levels of starfleet monitor your military installations its a reconnaissance mission nothing more
we should listen to her captain theyre being driven by fear just like we are unless everything you said on our date was just part of an act
it wasnt
enough we must not negotiate with these creatures
sit down admiral
sir
i said sit down or ill knock you right on your human butt
youve been seduced by them both of you
ive had a chance to see through human eyes and im beginning to wonder are they really so violent what if were wrong
we cant risk trusting them
youd rather risk another war
keep talking son
archers right weve got to set aside our preconceptions about each other granted our species didnt meet under the best of circumstances but maybe we can make first contact again maybe this time well get it right
you believe in this fellow
yes
there would have to be a few ground rules
name them
first off i want to take a look at that nanoprobe technology it scares the hell out of me
all right but ill need some tactical information in return your genetic alteration techniques for a start
im sure something can be arranged you on board admiral good enough for me
the design schematic for our nanoprobe weapons as requested
this could go a long way toward allaying their fears
perhaps
have a little faith seven
its difficult to have faith in an idea which may prove tactically unsound
tactically unsound perhaps it could also be the first step toward peace its a risk im willing to take are you sure you wont join us it would be your first chance to see earth
i prefer to remain aboard voyager if problems arise while youre in the habitat
there wont be any problems nothing tactical at any rate were entering a stage of diplomacy where most of the problems will be cultural how do you shake hands with an 8472 well be fine
when you ordered me to disarm the warhead during the negotiation i anticipated an immediate attack i believed they would take advantage of your human weakness i was wrong if i had been in your position we would most likely be engaged in a battle with 8472 at this moment how did you know
i didnt like i said
faith
welcome to terrasphere eight starfleet command recreation i am admiral bullock and ill be acquainting you with our facility questions comments bring them to me problems talk to lieutenant kinis commander tuvok you wanted to examine our thermionic generators
yes
ill take you there personally ambassador nelix
its neelix sir
neelix youll be joining the lieutenant hell familiarise you with our environmental control technology
wonderful i look forward to hearing your perspective on vulcans
you didnt happen to recreate a little coffee shop on market street the night owl
afraid not youre welcome to stay put your feet up we wont be returning to fluidic space for another day or two
thank you but the real earth is a long way from here id like to get back on the road what are the chances theyll listen to you
i cant promise you the moon captain my superiors arent as forward thinking peace with humans wow theyre going to hit the roof but ill tell them what happened here today and with a pinch of luck a few of them might see the light
well youve got voyagers comm frequency you know how to contact us i hope we can keep this process alive
dont call us well call you oh i almost forgot ahh
genetically synthesised but they smell just as lovely
oh
looking forward to going home
at least i can finally get out of this form
no more insomnia
no more sleeping period
for what its worth you made a terrific human
shame
hmm
its too bad our species are so different otherwise id ask you for a second date
you did offer to be my guide how about a tour of your realm sometime
id like that
well im due back on voyager we leave at oh four hundred
ill never get a chance to do this again
any better this time
youre a quick study
ouch
wake up
whos there
naomi
come back later
you know what i think i think youre scared of the tree monster
im not scared of any tree monster miss wildman but as you know i need my beauty sleep
sorry i woke you but we have a mission
you and your missions lucky for you your old pal flotter has everything ready follow me ive laid a trap when he climbs this tree hell trip the alarm tree monsters are terrified of highpitched noises
i never heard that
oh its a well known fact the bell will scare him high into those branches where counterweights will bend the treetop till it springs back catapulting him pondward and splash hell sink like a log
but flotter logs float
details details
that is a terrible plan
its him
the names trevis and you are
flotter flotter t water iii
well of course you are drippy you
naomi wildman but my friends call me naomi
i dont recognise your element youre not earth or water or plasma
im human
where do you live
in space
nobody lives in space
she does on a starship called voyager
im an explorer
really an explorer timber  whats that like
well you know space battles with aliens strange anomalies
may i visit your starship
well ill have to ask my mom
you know for a monster youre very polite
thats because im not a monster
you see that im not scared one bit my bark is worse than my bite
maybe we jumped to conclusions about him
well he may not be a monster but he is stealing my water with his roots
stealing absurd why i ought to dry you up
and i ought to chop you down
you want a piece of me
excuse me it sounds like you two need each other i mean think about it flotter your water helps his trees grow and trevis your branches shade his pond from the sun its a wellknown fact that the sun makes water evaporate
shes got a point
the girls a thinker
now shake hands and make up
urgh moist palms
urgh sappy fingers
neelix to holodeck two
naomi here
its bedtime
cant i stay a little longer
you know the rules
besides someone special wants to say good night
mom computer end programme
and hows flotter
grouchy as ever but we made a new friend today named trevis ill introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home
im afraid the away mission may take a few more days sweetheart
days
yes but im bringing you back some beautiful sillinite crystals and lots of holopictures for your data album now be a good girl and get ready for bed while i talk to neelix
all right
sweet dreams
samantha
we ran into an ion storm
how bad is it
we took a real beating were trying to make repairs but theres another storm on the way better go say goodnight for me
ive lost the comm signal
a level seven ionic front is closing aft at thirty three thousand kph
i need more power to the thrusters if im going to outrun it
ill see what i can do
the leading edge is approaching
ive given you all the power i can spare tom
its not enough i cant keep ahead of this thing brace for impact
mayday mayday delta flyer to voyager need assistance warp drive is impulse power is down thrusters only the ion storms damaged the primary systems life support is failing searching for an emergency landing site require immediate assistance
that was their last transmission we havent been able to raise them since
if theyre looking for a place to land they must be in pretty bad shape
anything on long range sensors
we lost their signature when the second ion storm hit but weve triangulated the coordinates of the distress call theyve entered a planetary system about point six light years from here
the problem is theres another ion storm a level five blocking our path
level five weve been through worse lets just batten down the hatches and reinforce the shields were not going to let a little bad weather stand in our way
what about naomi
i guess somebodys going to have to explain why her mothers not back
maybe we shouldnt tell her anything
why not
shes a very sensitive girl i dont want to alarm her unnecessarily with any luck well have her mother back before she starts to worry
well youre closer to her than anyone im inclined to let you take the lead on this
thanks captain
all right consider it your mission to keep her occupied
aye captain
dismissed
i was thinking
oh
its time i carried my weight around here
ah they could use a hand in the airponics bay
i was thinking more of the bridge
captains assistant
would i get to fly the ship
well wed have to take it up with the captain
need to check the internal sensors
neelix dont move
whats wrong
the borg lady
she has a name you know
seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one dont look shell assimilate you
naomi seven is a nice person and shes a valuable member of this crew
i dont want to be in her collective
i dont think theres much danger of that
hey neelix hey naomi neelix can i talk with you
yes ill be right back
sickbays running short on emergency medkits were going to need a few more if we send another away team after the shuttle
ive got half a dozen stockpiled in cargo bay two
how is she
on the naomi anxiety scale of one to ten where one is a touch of insomnia and ten is a panic attack about five
is this chair occupied yes or no would suffice
no i mean yes
explain
you cant sit here somebody else is sitting here
very well
so i thought wed pay another visit to sickbay the doctor says he has time to give you a botany lesson whats wrong
i am borg
no youre not
can we go to the holodeck first i want to play another flotter story
well the doctors expecting you
i dont like sickbay
why not
its full of creepy things alien organs and hyposprays
well thats not true
and the doctor talks too much
well thats his way
cant you reprogramme him or something
oh i dont think hed like that very much come on
rumour has it theres a planetoid around here
sorry tom the storm is throwing off my readings theres definitely a big rock nearby i just cant find it
the wave front is accelerating
how long till it hits us
less than two minutes
gives me thirty seconds to land this thing samantha i dont mean to rush you
got it class m atmosphere nickeliron core bemonite mantle
bemonite i want to land this shuttle not bury it
seventy three thousand kilometres bearing zero mark four
weve entered the upper atmosphere
nothing but impact craters volcanoes we cant land here
the storm is closing increasing shields to maximum
just keep us away from the volcanoes and well be okay
ive got a big meteor crater five hundred kilometres across three point seven deep
ill take it
starboard thrusters are down
tuvok if you dont have something positive to say
were coming in too fast
hang on
the flyer has landed
she needs immediate medical assistance
what happened
we made it
delta flyers first landing where
about three kilometres beneath the surface at least our primary hulls still in one piece
wish i felt the same
youll be all right minor concussion a few fractures nothing i cant handle
youre a great nurse but youre a lousy liar
youve got a punctured kidney and youre bleeding internally you need surgery
voyager
ive transmitted another distress call no response
its all this rock
ive got to talk to naomi let her know were okay
conserve your strength ensign mister paris and i have the situation under control
nice bedside manner tuvok sam im going to give you a mild sedative and something for the pain any chance we could abandon the shuttle make our way on foot
unlikely not only are we buried under several kilotons of rock but the atmosphere in this cavern is flooded with fluorine gas
nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the view
im detecting a residual impulse signature in the upper atmosphere
try to pinpoint their location
hows our littlest crew member
she misses her mother but i dont think she suspects anything i was just about to take her to the holodeck for some more storytelling
call me an optimist neelix but im still counting on a happy ending
me too
got it the impulse wake leads to the northern hemisphere coordinates one twenty one mark sixteen
any sign of them
plasma fires hull fragments either they vaporised on impact or theyre buried beneath the surface
any life signs maybe they beamed out before the crash
harry anything
nothing
we built the delta flyer to take a lot of punishment im betting it held together commander take rescue teams down to that crater if sensors cant find them well have to do it the hard way
harry
now see the organelle just over there the one that looks like a little bitty potato
the mitochondria
yes
mitochondria the warp core of the cell
exactly now what if i told you that this fellow was invited to dinner but never got around to leaving
what do you mean
well turn back the clock a few billion years to when cells first evolved these early cells had no mitochondria they struggled along without them making do with whatever energy sources they could find then one day a mitochondrial ancestor arrived broke though the cell wall and made himself at home
they became friends
the correct term is symbiosis
friends
friends
my mom says cooperation is more important than competition
mmm hmm
she was supposed to call me today
well shes probably just a little busy now lets have a look at the cell wall it looks simple enough but believe you me theres more here than meets the eye
can we try to call her
neelix what a pleasure to see you
how was school today
good
theres a time for school and theres a time for
flotter
arent you forgetting something
oh thank you doctor
youre quite welcome miss wildman
in the blink of an eye there was trevis above us
then what happened
he turned out to be very nice his bark was worse than his bite
where did you learn to make such silly puns
you
oh
neelix did you have a favourite holodeck programme when you were growing up
well we didnt have holodecks on rinax but it didnt matter because we had a great big forest right behind my house
really
and my sisters and i would go exploring every day wed make up our own stories
imagination
exactly
deck six section nine where are your sisters now
oh theyre far away from here i havent seen them in a very long time
how long
many years
but you havent been on voyager for that long
true but before that my work as a trader kept me away from home
thats too bad
do your sisters ever call you like my mom does when shes on an away mission
no
i bet you miss them
i do very much here we are computer display chapter headings the adventures of flotter lets see ah flotter and the tree monster
played that one yesterday
okay trevis and the terribly twisted trunk
i promised id save that one for mom its her favourite
flotter trevis and the ogre of fire
yeah that one
it sounds a little scary
its okay i wont be scared if youre with me
once upon a time in the forest of forever flotter and trevis encountered a strange element theyd never seen before
trevis youre on fire
i told him not to touch it but this blockhead never listens
stop complaining and help him
me
water puts out fire
oh thank you
hey it worked watch this
good thinking naomi
whos the furball
the names neelix
what caused the fire
it came from up there
in a flash
lightning but the sky is clear doesnt look like a thunderstorm
whats your theory naomi
theres only one other explanation the ogre of fire
the ogre
of fire
whos he
he is me and im going to burn this forest to the ground
flotter
maybe maybe we should play another programme
no we have to find flotter hello is anyone there
over here
trevis are you all right
ah hah a little hot under the bark maybe
what about flotter is he dead neelix
well i i dont know
he cant be dead flotter
i think its your bedtime
but i want to find flotter
now dont argue with your godfather come on now
take this to lieutenant torres youll find the phaser drills in cargo bay three
aye sir
are you sure you have time for this i know youre busy
no problem glad to be of service
maybe a shade bluer and the heads a little disproportionate dont you think
were not shooting for an exact replica neelix artistic license
sorry guess i shouldnt barge into your kitchen and tell you how to cook
flotter now theres a name i havent heard in a while i used to be nuts about those holostories when i was a kid did you see the one where flotter suspects trevis to be a rubber tree
not yet
he keeps trying to trip him to see if hell bounce yeah those two were a lot of fun
actually the last scenario that naomi chose was pretty frightening no fun at all
kids love to be scared
not naomi
computer transfer the design parameters to the replicator hows she holding up
fine right now shes busy with her homework
neelix whats wrong
everything everythings wrong ion storms crash landings alien attacks a starships no place for a child
i dont know id say naomis pretty lucky to be growing up on voyager
lucky
think about it think about all the things shes experienced stars being born supernovas lifeforms no one from the alpha quadrant has seen before when i was a kid i would have given anything for a chance like this well here goes
hi neelix did you miss me you know i forgot how ugly this guy was
thanks ensign
naomi guess who i found in the replicator
thanks but thats not really flotter
flotters not really flotter hes just a holodeck character what are you working on
im researching the evaporation of water
why
well ive been thinking water doesnt just disappear when its heated it turns into invisible gas so if we could get the forest to cool down enough flotter might reliquefy
clever
i miss mom
i know you do
whens she coming back
soon
why hasnt she called
she must be very busy cataloguing all the geological specimens shes collected
has anybody talked to her
well not in a day or two but
starfleet regulation four seven six dash nine all away teams must report to the bridge at least once every twenty four hours
you really are going to make an excellent captains assistant
has something bad happened to them
im sure everythings fine come on now bed
promise to wake me up if mommy calls
promise
even if its oh two hundred hours
even if its oh two hundred hours sweet dreams
neelix
computer access personal database neelix file index two nine one hello alixia im sorry its been so many weeks since ive thought about you but weve been very busy here on voyager i miss you my goddaughter naomi shes in trouble were in trouble she may lose her mother alixia you always knew the right thing to do the right thing to say i wish you were here to help me
come on hurry were under attack
get up the metreon cascade run
computer switch to polythermal imaging and enhance resolution neelix do you require assistance
no no i was just passing by i thought id pay you a visit see how things were going how are things going
im mapping the caverns surrounding the crash site
how far do they extend
approximately thirty seven kilometres
what about the search anything new
every scan reveals something new but as yet little of relevance
seven your family your human family do you ever think about them
infrequently i was only six years old when i was assimilated
not much older than naomi is now do you miss your parents
i barely remember them
maybe thats a blessing
rescue team alpha to seven of nine
yes commander
we need that data
i will meet you at the transporter site i adapted the child naomi will adapt as well
borg wisdom
lieutenant get me an update from beta team they havent checking in for over an hour
coffee anyone captain
no thanks ive had enough one more cup and ill jump to warp
any new
im afraid not
no debris no lifesigns
weve got three teams beneath the surface so far nothing
so much for that happy ending
well turn that planetoid inside out if we have to but i think we have to be prepared for the worst maybe its time you told naomi
no not yet
shes an astute girl she must be aware that somethings wrong by now
shes been asking a lot of tough questions why hasnt her mother filed a status report what if shes in trouble but ive got a big day planned for her tomorrow plenty of distractions she wont have time to be worried
your mission was to keep her occupied not to lie to her first thing in the morning i want you to explain the situation
i dont think thats such a good idea
why not
like i told you shes sensitive
all the more reason to answer her questions
with all due respect captain im her godfather i know whats best for her
neelix
i realise you care about naomi and you are only trying to protect her but youve got to tell her the truth
good morning naomi would you like some papalla juice with your cereal and oh by the way your mother is buried under thirty kilotons of rock
neelix
when we know something for sure when we find her mother alive or dead ill ill tell her then not before
if you cant do it i will
you dont have the right you dont understand whats at stake here when you were her age you were safe and sound on earth with two healthy parents to take care of you you never had to worry about the possibility of being alone you take it from me you wouldnt have liked it
oh i know you must identify with naomis situation
when my family was killed i lost everything i still have nightmares it hasnt been easy i dont want naomi to go through what i did
i understand and youre right but this situation is different
how so
naomi has you neelix she has to be told but i know shell be better off having you here to help her through it
first thing in the morning
weve got a few hours until then why dont you come back on the bridge give us a hand
ready tuvok
ready
cross your fingers
the magnetic relays have overloaded
well wed better find another way to polarise this hull or their sensors wont be able to pick us up
were never getting out of here
do not give up hope the probability of our being rescued is low but not statistically impossible
comforting
whos going to look after naomi
you should not concern yourself with that now
how can you say that
my youngest child has been without a father for four years yet i am certain of her wellbeing that i conveyed my values to her before leaving and i have confidence in the integrity of those around her you have been an exemplary mother to naomi and she is in the hands of people you trust she will survive and prosper no matter what becomes of us
thanks tuvok
mom neelix computer locate neelix
neelix is on the bridge
thanks
strickler we need three more phaser drills you two pattern enhancers and medkits
aye sir
were going to have to recalibrate these tricorders
put us with the alpha team
setting coordinates
energise
deck one bridge
chakotay to voyager weve found what looks like a piece of the starboard nacelle
any sign of the shuttle itself
not yet
captain the cavern has collapsed ahead of us however i am reading a hull signature behind the debris
the flyer
ill need to take a closer reading
do it i want alpha and beta teams to search for survivors tell sickbay to stand by for heavy casualties
naomi naomi
naomi computer locate naomi wildman
naomi wildman is in her quarters
clever
computer resume programme flotter trevis and the ogre of fire
programme activated
commander im reading duranium alloys i believe it is the shuttle approximately eighty metres beneath this rubble
lifesigns
none commander without lifesigns to lock onto we cannot beam the crew out
maybe we can transport the entire ship to the shuttle bay
through fifty kilotons of bemonite
chakotay to voyager
janeway here
we think weve found the shuttle but we need to dig it out
have all teams rendezvous at my coordinates
acknowledged
phaser drills here and here
but hey belanna look on the bright side no more dayold pizza laying around and youll never have to watch another chapter of captain proton again
warning life support has fallen to critical levels
dont mind the computer shes just jealous that im spending my last few minutes talking to you so long
sam its your turn
i havent thought what to say yet tuvok why dont you go next
i prefer to make my farewells in written form
computer begin recording encode message for delivery to naomi wildman
acknowledged
hi honey i know youre feeling sad right now but i want you to listen to me very carefully okay first of all i love you second i want you to know that im proud of you how smart you are how funny how kind you are to other people and i know that you are going to grow up to do extraordinary things last and i know this is a hard one try not to be scared
warning oxygen depletion in ten minutes
listen to neelix hell be taking care of you now bye honey
naomi
go away
where is she
she doesnt want to talk to you
you lied
i thought you vaporised
naomi reliquefied me now leave
computer delete characters
unable to comply holodeck controls have been encoded
delete us
i wonder if this liar can swim
we can always hang him from one of my branches
naomi please let me talk to you
its okay
you be nice
no more lying
hey there
is my mother dead
we dont know
what happened
the away team was trying to avoid an ion storm they had to land on a planet
i saw that crater something was burning
plasma fires pieces of debris but not the hull until we know for sure whats happened no ones giving up on the rescue attempt
you really think they might find her
yes
how do i know youre telling me the truth this time
i never told you this before but when i was much younger i lost my mom in a terrible war my father and my sisters too it was the worst thing that ever happened to me always wondering how did they die were they worried about me could they still be alive i thought if i could just keep you from wondering you wouldnt have to feel what i did
you were pretending that nothing was wrong that nothing bad happened do you ever pretend that nothing bad happened to your family
sometimes
does it help
not really
dont be sad neelix
all hands to emergency stations weve got a level eight ion storm approaching
ion storm whats that
ogre of fire hes attacking us again
youd better get back to your quarters
naomi dont leave us
ill be back i promise
voyager to chakotay
go ahead
weve got another ion storm approaching when it hits the planetoid your entire cavern is going to destabilise
just a few more metres and well be close enough to beam out the shuttle how long before the storm hits
six minutes
make the most of it its all youve got
the storms moving in shields down to eighty six percent
keep the transporter lock on the away team give them to the last second helm lay in a course out of here stand by to engage at warp two
aye sir
warning oxygen depletion in two minutes
i never thought it would come down to this suffocating beneath kilotons of rock on some nameless planetoid
did you envision a more heroic death
i didnt envision dying at all
in accepting the inevitable one finds peace
if thats another vulcan saying tuvok ill stick with live long and prosper
were here were here
chakotay to voyager
yes commander
pattern enhancers are in place were ready to transport the flyer
locking on theyre in the shuttlebay
helm engage
thank you
and how are you today mister trevis
feeling a little stiff my slippery friend and you
now that you mention it im feeling a little washed out
well its about time you showed up the tea is getting cold
samantha is it really you
long time no see
youre all grown up
im an ensign now
ive missed you
likewise
well now that youre all reacquainted i think youre all eager for a new adventure
now that you mention it there is a castle that ive been meaning to explore
castle
i hear a giant beetle lives there
come on neelix
you go ahead
see you later
heres to happy endings
captain
just checking on my future captains assistant
right now shes off to conquer a giant beetle
oh sounds like a dangerous mission
she can handle it
shes a courageous girl did i ever tell you about the time i flooded this entire forest i was six years old flotter claimed we were in for a dry spell so i came up with the obvious solution why not just divert the river this entire forest was a swamp by the time we were done at which point stinger was born
stinger
the biggest mosquito
were here
the glacier fractures are stable
were clear to beam inside
acknowledged
not exactly the way i remember it
power grids been destroyed neural gel packs frozen solid decks nine through fourteen are now deck ten theyve been compacted
looks like they hit the ice at full impulse the emh
im trying to access sickbay the relays arent responding im losing the interface reset the power cell come on
lets get moving keep an open comm link
chakotay to tessa
go ahead
ive found her lock on to the
transporter relay and beam her to the lab
stand by
make it quick this isnt exactly a happy reunion
ive got a lock
please state the nature of
long time no see
ensign
i go by harry now its a long story wheres your mobile emitter
whats happened to the ship the crew
no time the emitter
its in here but
here slap it on kets go
wait i demand an explanation
ill give you one were here to change history
ladies and gentlemen please may i introduce the next generation of instellar propulsion the quantum slipstream drive four years two months eleven days thats precisely how long voyagers been in the delta quadrant during that time weve advanced the frontiers of exploration and more importantly weve survived now its time to go home enjoy the celebration but keep in mind weve still got a lot of work to do before tomorrows flight go easy on that champagne lieutenant
quantum matrix benamite crystals borg technology can you imagine what starfleet is going to say
i dont think well hear any complaints the federations first slipstream drive theyll probably nominate us for the cochrane medal of honour
ill start working on my acceptance speech
id like to thank the borg collective
dinner plans
nothing special date with a replicator
cancel it thats an order
aye captain
lieutenant lieutenant excuse me my contribution to the slipstream drive
thanks what is it
a talaxian fur fly an old spacefaring tradition among my people if one of these creatures stowed away on your ship it was a sign of good fortune i had this little fellow preserved he hung in my engine room for six years
cute
mister neelix you are an unending source of astonishment
why thank you mister vulcan
seven
my visual processors and motor cortex they are malfunctioning
sounds like a problem with your cortical implant wed better have a look hold still
i cannot comply
youre intoxicated
impossible
your blood synthehol level is point zero five percent how many glasses of champagne did you consume
one
obviously the borg cant hold their liquor come to sickbay ill give you some inaprovaline to counteract the effects
i was simply trying to perfect my social skills as you instructed me to do
and youre doing a fine job
you have always been of enormous assistance to me doctor you are my mentor
yes
we are as one we are as one
did you see that
hmm
i think our drone did a little too much celebrating speaking of which when are you going to join the party
in a minute
youre running a warp core diagnostic now
harry i think we built an edsel
a what
a lemon a disaster waiting to happen i ran a simulation last night and i discovered a point four two phase variance in the slipstream threshold
point four two so itll be a bumpy ride weve flown through worse
if we get knocked out of that slipstream midflight it could overload the quantum matrix
did you tell the captain
not yet didnt want to spoil the festivities until i was sure
tom if itll make you feel better well go to the holodeck right now run a few more simulations its probably just a sensor glitch
were at full impulse
engaging slipstream drive quantum field is stable deflector at maximum
slipstream velocity in four three two power output is steady quantum field is holding
shields down to seventy three percent
looking good keep that deflector aligned and we should be
weve got a phase variance point one point two
remodulate the deflector
no effect point four
im shutting down the drive
no wait i want to try to invert the quantum field
its no use the slipstream is collapsing inertial dampers are offline
warning hull breach on deck ten
were losing structural integrity
computer freeze programme
one more time i think if we reroute emergency power to the deflector a little earlier
it wont help
computer restart simulation at time index
computer belay that order its no use harry
we cant just give up
twenty three simulations twenty three catastrophes this is no sensor glitch weve got to tell them
that cant be right we tested this engine molecule by molecule
im sorry belanna
i wish to examine the results of the simulation
holodeck two run them for yourself that is if you dont mind being vaporised a few dozen times
i looked at their findings captain if we try to take that flight in the morning well be in escape pods by afternoon
it would appear we have no choice but to cancel it
either that or we can try it harrys way
ensign
ive got an idea its tricky but i think it could work the trouble begins about seventeen seconds into the flight the phase variance kicks in and the slipstream becomes unstable what we need is someone in a shuttle to ride the rapids in front of voyager
yes they could map the threshold of the slipstream as its forming and send the phase corrections back to us that is a great idea harry
now heres the tricky part the shuttle will only be a couple of seconds ahead of voyager that doesnt give autonavigation much time to compensate
tom
couple of seconds
we can do this captain put me on that shuttle ill get voyager through the slipstream what choice do we have take the drive offline months of work for nothing
we built a highly experimental piece of technology there were bound to be setbacks
the benamite crystals at the heart of this engine have already started to decay it could take years to synthesise more i dont know about the rest of you but i didnt do all this work just to be stopped by a point four two phase variance no offence captain
none taken all right mister kim youve convinced me prepare a flight plan and have it on my desk within the hour
yes maam
ill let you know what i decide
come in commander i hope youve got an appetite
famished but i assumed you called me here to talk about the slipstream flight
no reason to cancel our dinner plans ive programmed a dish my grandmother used to make back on earth vegetable biryani
sounds delicious i didnt know you could cook
normally i draw the line at a pot of coffee but tonight is a special occasion
oh
our last night in the delta quadrant id say thats special enough
youve made your decision
we launch tomorrow at oh eight hundred you and harry will take the delta flyer voyager will be right behind you
the crew will be pleased
you can give them the news yourself after dessert what about you chakotay what do you think about my decision
ive analysed harrys flight plan the theory is sound but there are just too many variables if something goes wrong in that slipstream
it could be our only chance to use the quantum drive
true but if you showed this data to any starfleet engineer theyd think we were out of our minds we can find another way home weve waited this long
long enough weve waited long enough i know its a risk probably our biggest one yet but im willing to take it are you with me
always
speaking of risks are you ready to try some home cooking
ill alert sickbay
fifteen years
give or take a few weeks
where are we
in the takara sector just outside the alpha quadrant
the crew
except for us dead
we think captain janeway tried to make an emergency landing on this planet the ship must have been too heavily damaged they were all killed on impact
theyve been buried inside a glacier for the past fifteen years
you two were here on the delta flyer ahead of voyager you made it
all the way back to earth we got home doc and all it took was killing everyone we cared about
harry
starfleet certainly took their time finding us
starfleet starfleet gave up their search for voyager over nine years ago we had to find you on our own
well i dont know what to say except thank you i suppose id have stayed in that deep freeze forever
were not here to salvage your programme were here to prevent this disaster from ever happening
you see doc fifteen years ago i miscalculated the slipstream threshold and transmitted the wrong phase corrections to voyager boom they were knocked out of the slipstream and sent to an icy death thank you ensign kim but ive had a long time to rethink my mistake and now i know how to fix it so were going to send voyager a new set of phase corrections
isnt it a little late for that
weve found a way to communicate with voyager in the past just before the accident
better late than never
a message back through time
exactly
how
i dont understand
one of her cranial implants is a transceiver designed to communicate with other drones
thats right its called an interplexing beacon
we want you to extract the beacon and determine its translink frequency
that shouldnt be a problem she looks reasonably wellpreserved
good thatll tell us where to send the message now the hard part we need to know when to send it can you access sevens chronometric node and pinpoint the exact moment her cybernetic implants disengaged from her organic systems
her time of death
down to the millisecond if possible
ill see what i can do
i told you hed come in handy
you said youd found a way to communicate with seven in the past how
behold salvage component three six six nine eight a borg temporal transmitter
starfleet intelligence found it in the wreckage of a borg cube in the beta quadrant
we stole it
trouble long range sensors are picking up a federation vessel
how much time do we have
i entered a low orbit and remodulated our shields but it wont be long before they find us six hours if were lucky
let me get this straight youre fugitives
the galaxys most wanted we stole the delta flyer too right out of a federation shipyard were wanted on two counts of high treason and conspiracy to violate the temporal prime directive
wonderful out of the icebox and into the fire
we dont have time for this get started
aye sir
we still have to retrieve those sensor logs get ready
hello doctor
do i know you
no but i feel like were old friends tessa omond
hello
its an honour to finally meet voyagers infamous emh
infamous
ive told her a few horror stories
actually theyve always spoken very highly of you
ah ha and how did you get involved with bonnie and clyde here
oh ive had an interest in voyager for a long time
theyre having sex
pardon
chakotay and tess theyre a couple joined at the hip
the truth is doctor i didnt want chakotay or harry to have to face this alone i thought i could help
ready
stay warm
these controls are a little clumsy i thought you said this ship was state of the art
it was at the time
ive located the sensor logs but the computer is denying me access
my command codes should still carry some weight
looks like theres an active file here
but should our luck run out id like to say for the record that the crew voyager acted distinction and valour
you okay
yes its just the last time i was in this chair they were all here alive
were here to get them back
can i see that tricorder
its downloading give it a minute
i dont supposed we have time for a tour
afraid not besides i left my quarters a mess in just a few hours if all goes as planned well have changed history the past fifteen years erased we dont have to do this
now you tell me
im serious
so am i and i have no intentions of backing out chakotay
look at me last minute jitters cold feet i dont know what to call it ridiculous isnt it after all these years working toward this moment and when it finally comes all i can think about is losing you
your heart has always been here on voyager thatll never change this is where you belong and who knows maybe well meet someday
but if we dont
then ill miss you all the same
it means all of that has changed you owe me one
mister kim your assistance please
got to go
what was that all about
oh nothing letter to a friend hows it look
no damage to the infrastructure but ill need an isoprobe
way ahead of you doc
so what was it like your homecoming
antimatter fireworks longwinded dignitaries a vulcan childrens choir oh we got medals pinned to our tunics chakotay gave a speech commemorating the voyager crew brought a tear to everyones eye admiral mcintyre even wanted me to marry his daughter
at least you werent buried under twenty metres of ice
you dont know how many times i wished i was
i suppose it must have been difficult with all your friends and colleagues left behind
survivor guilt yeah i heard a lot about that from the counsellors back at headquarters you must learn to accept the fact that you lived embrace life move forward i signed on at the first deep space vessel i could find we tried to calculate where voyager might have fallen out of the slipstream four years of searching we were close i could feel it then starfleet command said it was time to end the search low probability of success all those admirals who shook my hand at the homecoming i went to see every last one of them begged them to keep the search alive pretty soon even admiral mcintyre stopped returning my calls so i resigned from starfleet
for the record sevens translink frequency is one zero eight point four four two three six zero zero zero
could be our lucky number im encoding it now
when did you embark on your life of crime
the second i heard about this little gem
mister kim did you ever stop to think about what youre trying to do here altering the timeline may make things worse at least you and chakotay survived why tempt fate
this timeline only exists because i made a mistake fifteen years ago the crew trusted in me and i let them down
tactical alert vessel approaching bearing one eight four mark seven
theyve found us chakotay
go ahead
starfleets on an intercept course its now or never
were on our way
if youre having doubts let me know ill take your programme offline but if youre with us we tempt fate together
to aid an honourable thief or to spend eternity in cybernetic oblivion lets tempt fate
shield generators
online
plasma flow
stable
comm link
secure
lunch
salami sandwiches
feel up to this ensign
yes sir
chakotay to voyager were ready
all hands this is the captain take your stations secure all systems and stand by for the jump to slipstream
ive established a telemetry link with the shuttle
match their course and speed
theyre gaining on us two hundred thousand kilometres and closing you call these evasive manoeuvres
im doing my best harry status
the borg transmitters online but im still waiting for the doctor to give me the temporal coordinates
just a few more minutes
speed it up weve got a galaxy class starship on our tail
im working as fast as i can
theyre hailing us you want to talk to them
could buy us some time open a channel
this is captain la forge of the starship challenger you seem to be in quite a hurry
you could say that
why dont you shut down those impulse engines drop your shields lets talk about this facetoface
mind if i take a rain check
as a matter of fact i do we know what youre about to attempt and we cant let that happen so the federation council is willing to make you an offer hand over the borg transmitter stand down your vessel and the charges of conspiracy will be dropped
thats not much of an offer if we succeed those charges will never have existed in the first place
if you succeed countless lives will be affected
were here to save one hundred and fifty lives our crew
i understand and i might be doing the same thing if i were in your position but ive got my own crew to protect not to mention fifteen years of history so im asking you again stand down and return the transmitter
you know i cant do that
and you know i have to try to stop you
yes i know good luck
same to you
theyre targeting our engines
shields to full stand by weapons
voyager to chakotay
yes maam
prepare to enter the slipstream
acknowledged
engage
slipstream velocity in four three two
shields down to sixty two percent
return fire
direct hit no effect on their shields were no match for them chakotay
keep trying
i dont mean to be a pest but were losing power back here
hold on
were switching to emergency backup
thank you doc i need those temporal coordinates now
badgering me wont help
im detecting a phase variance point one point two
helm
still waiting for harry
point three
voyager to delta flyer we need those corrections or well have to
shut down the drive
were on it captain
the threshold is fluctuating
okay i can do this im compensating for the spatial gradients deflector geometry stable got it
im receiving the phase corrections
the phase variance is decreasing
shields are holding
looks like were on our way
phase variance is increasing point three point four
harry whats happening
the phase variance is still increasing
im not sure captain it should be working
i need an answer harry were running out of time
let me try recalibrating the sensors
i might be overcompensating for the variance in the
weve lost our comm link
telemetrys down too the slipstreams destabilising
shut down the drive
i cant theres some kind of overload in the quantum matrix ive lost helm control
i have it her cybernetic systems were terminated on stardate 521643 borg time index 943852 youre encoding the transmitter for time index 940 thats less than four minutes before voyager was destroyed cutting it a little close arent we
this is no ordinary phone call doc were talking to yesterday timing is everything i want to make sure seven of nine gets the information at just the right moment there im bringing up the new phase corrections this was where i failed fifteen years ago doc this time will be different
captain i am receiving a transmission
i thought you said the comm link was down
it is
the signal is being routed through one of my cranial implants it contains a new set of phase corrections
does harry know how to access your borg systems
no
he must have figured out a way enter the corrections
theyre not compensating for the phase variance the slipstream is collapsing
full power to the deflector
no effect
our hull is buckling
shields at maximum hold her steady tom
its no use were losing attitude control inertial dampers offline
what about the delta flyer
there is no sign of them they must have remained in the slipstream
voyagers been thrown into normal space
alter our slipstream course weve got to go back
we cant even if they survived reentry at this velocity we wouldnt
what are you saying weve got to find them
ensign theres no choice
captain were just a few parsecs from the alpha quadrant
not exactly how i wanted to cross the finish line
hull breach on decks five through ten were losing life support if we dont land the ship were risking structural collapse
im reading a planet nine million kilometres ahead its class l
do it were coming in too fast reverse thrusters all hands brace for impact
were still here why are we still here
mister kim
the new phase corrections didnt work
are you certain
if voyager had gotten through safely we wouldnt still be here trying to save them the transmitters functioning seven must have received our message chakotay problems
i can see that
our engines are down theyre locking onto us with a tractor beam
full thrusters
no effect
do we have enough power to send a plasma surge through their tractor beam break ourselves free
i think so but the eps relays have taken heavy damage it could destabilise the warp core
if you want to beam over to that ship ill understand
and let you have all the fun
harry we just bought you a few more minutes
acknowledged
im no time travel expert but cant we just call voyager again the past isnt going anywhere
thats not going to help if we dont know what to tell them the slipstream kinetics look right hyperdimensional progressions perfect maybe its the deflector geometry
were free
the eps relays are overloading harry were looking at a possible core breach in less than three minutes hows it
coming back there
great just great it took me ten years to make these corrections i cant fix it in three minutes
youve got to try
i cant its not working why wont it work i killed them
control yourself
they trusted me and i killed them
mister kim i didnt spend all those years in an ice bucket so i could listen to you berate yourself if you want to wallow in selfpity fine do it on your own time
dont you see historys repeating itself i destroyed voyager once and im doing it again
somebody has got to knuckle down and change history and that somebody is you
it cant be done doc i told you
no you told me you cant correct their phase variance all right we have to accept that but what about sending voyager a warning is there a way to get them to abort the slipstream flight
yes yes i could send a phase correction which would disperse the slipstream entirely
if we cant get the crew home at least we can save their lives
warning warp core breach in sixty seconds
can you eject the core
no emergency systems are offline
la forge to delta flyer our sensors are reading an overload in your warp matrix lower your shields well beam you out of there
i appreciate the offer captain but the answers no i suggest you get to a safe distance
warning warp core breach in forty five seconds
harry now would be a good time
mister kim
its losing power
warning warp core breach in thirty seconds
your emitter its got its own power source
will it be enough
its our only chance glad you could join us doc
its been a pleasure
warning warp core breach in fifteen seconds
chakotay im giving this one more try
warning warp core breach in ten nine eight seven six five four three two
yes
captain i am receiving a transmission
i thought you said the comm link was down
it is
the signal is being routed through one of my cranial implants it contains a new set of phase corrections
does harry know how to access your borg systems
no
he must have figured out a way enter the corrections
captain the quantum drive just went offline were dropping to impulse
captain weve lost the slipstream
the slipstream collapsed we were thrown out right along with voyager
our comm systems back up
delta flyer to voyager what happened
you miscalculated harry we entered the exact phase corrections you sent to seven of nine they shut down the quantum drive
captain i didnt send any corrections to seven of nine
she received a message through one of her cranial implants it wasnt you
no maam
at ease am i interrupting
no i just came here to try to figure things out
phase corrections
the corrections i sent you were wrong if you had used them voyager would have been heavily damaged maybe even destroyed what i cant figure out is who sent the other phase corrections to seven of nine
looks like weve got a guardian angel
oh i wish i could believe that
believe it his name is harry kim
captain
seven found a starfleet security code embedded in the transmission yours
im telling you i didnt send it
not yet the transmission had a temporal displacement we believe it originated from the future ten twenty years from now we cant be sure
wait a second if i sent a message from the future and changed the past then that future would no longer exist right so how could i have sent the message in the first place am i making any sense
my advice in making sense of temporal paradoxes is simple dont even try to me all that matters is that somewhere somehow sometime you come through for us and if you wont take it from me take it from you seven found a log entry encoded in the telemetry from harry kim to harry kim
hello harry i dont have much time so listen to me fifteen years ago i made a mistake and one hundred and fifty people died ive spent every day since then regretting that mistake but if youre watching this right now that means all of that has changed you owe me one
mister kim your assistance please
got to go
regeneration cycle incomplete
when i checked the overnight sensor logs this little surprise was waiting for me
maybe im not quite awake but it looks like its over one hundred kilometres wide
one hundred twenty at first i thought it was an asteroid cluster until i picked up a residual warp signature
it was a borg vessel there are tetryon particles in the debris consistent with the atmosphere inside a cube
any idea what destroyed it
we would need to run close range scans of the hull fragments
unless we alter course well get our chance the debris fields directly ahead
then i suggest we cut a wide berth chances are the borg will send more vessels to investigate alter course to avoid the debris if thats all
ah one other piece of business captain it seems we had another incident in the mess hall last night
return of the midnight snacker
im afraid so
casualties
a leg of kelaran wildebeest id prepared for ensign rysons birthday since commander tuvok has been unable to round up any suspects id like to ask that stronger measures be taken
perhaps an armed security detail
id like to ask permission to replicate some locking mechanisms for the cabinet doors
granted dismissed
naomi wildman subunit of ensign samantha wildman state your intentions
i
very well you leave me no choice but to report your activities to the captain
please dont i was just observing you
explain
well neelix told me that the borg do a lot of things they do because theyre trying to be perfect and even though youre not really a drone anymore you still try to be perfect dont you
correct
well if i can learn to be perfect too then captain janeway will have to make me her bridge assistant
no such rank exists aboard this vessel
not yet
and you hope to achieve this goal by emulating me
are you mad
no there are many on this crew that would benefit from your example
so youll teach me
your objective is admirable however your neocortical development is incomplete you would require several months of accelerated growth in a borg maturation chamber
oh i dont think i like the sound of that
then i suggest that you
hey
hi
im bored lets do something fun
like what
swimming
oh im not allowed to go swimming without my mom
do you like kadiskot
love it
come on
ill be bridge assistant for a while then ill be promoted to ensign itll be lieutenant after that and by the time we reach the alpha quadrant captain wildman green grid fourteen four
kadiskot i win
youre really good at this game
you want a rematch
sure
captains dont have much time to play you know
thats okay ill be pretty busy by then want to hear the rules of first contact
no
how about the suborders of the prime directive i know all forty seven of them
you study too much naomi just like my brother
i didnt know you had a brother
twelve of them
twelve
nine older and three younger we play kadiskot all the time
i only have my mom and neelix to play with when theyre not working
you must get lonely
a little you get used to it you adapt
adapt
you know like the borg
borg i hate borgs
you do
yeah theyre mean
torres to seven of nine please report to engineering
its your move
seven respond
i am on my way lieutenant naomi wildman
yes
what am i doing here
were playing kadiskot seven
take a look at this will you im picking up an energy signal in the lower subspace bands and if im not mistaken its got a borg modulation
you are correct it is borg i believe its a neural interlink frequency
a what
a frequency that integrates the minds of borg drones
can you pinpoint the origin
i will try
no offence seven but you look terrible
i am not well i experienced a brief lapse in memory and i am disoriented
maybe you should get to sickbay
no this interlink frequency could explain my
doraq merash
i beg your pardon
i am the son of kvok and you what house are you from
is this some kind of a joke
you wear the uniform of a starfleet pcha what kind of a warrior are you
tom put you up to this didnt he well it didnt work
come warrior let me look at you
enough seven
your blood is sweet
torres to security get somebody down here right now
you are strong you will make an excellent mate
get the hell away from me
you wish to prove yourself in battle
report
seven of nine attacked belanna in engineering shes on deck nine section twenty three
forcefields dont tell me those two have actually come to blows
bridge to tuvok sevens been contained deck ten section thirty two
acknowledged were nearing her position
seven
somebodys hurt and he needs help did i do something bad
who are you
my names maryl are you a vulcan
computer deactivate forcefield give me the phaser
you are not a physician commander the logical course of action would be to take him to the infirmary
maryl
subaltern lorot vulcan high command may i be of assistance
yes please accompany me to sickbay
certainly clearly he was attacked i suggest we use caution  petaq you will drown in your own blood
keep moving
seven
captain why am i here
youve been unconscious for nearly two hours we believe youre experiencing a neurological disorder
voices i hear voices they are agitated chaotic too many voices
too many voices
the cortical inhibitor is destabilising im increasing the neurotransmitter levels its working do you still hear the voices
they are fading they are gone
all right lets see what we can do to keep them from coming back whats the last thing you remember
i was in engineering assisting lieutenant torres
you have no recollection of a confrontation with belanna
confrontation
im not sure why but you seem to be manifesting personalities other than your own
naomi wildman claims the two of you played together for nearly an hour this afternoon
you also attacked lieutenant torres she told us you called yourself son of kvok and that you initiated a klingon mating ritual
i have no memory of those events
come look at this
doctor
this is your neural pattern the memory engrams and synaptic pathways that define you as an individual unfortunately youre not alone thirteen new neural patterns have emerged in your cerebral cortex klingon vulcan terrelian human and several others i cant identify
how
theyre coming from within you during your time with the borg the collective assimilated hundreds of different species all of those neural patterns were integrated into the hive mind
of course
that means theyre in your mind too stored within your cortical implants dormant until now
from what we can tell the various neural patterns are surfacing randomly
in essence youve developed the borg equivalent of multiple personality disorder
can you correct the malfunction
the cortical inhibitor is suppressing the effect but its only a temporary measure
lieutenant torres detected a borg interlink frequency it could be causing my cortical implants to malfunction
the signal appears to be emanating from the borg debris field we discovered this morning
maybe we should jump to warp try to get out of range
the signal permeates subspace we cannot avoid it
our only hope is to terminate the signal at its point of origin
set a course for the debris field when we arrive we may need your help feel up to it
yes captain
keep a close eye on her doctor in case she has any more unexpected visitors
has any drone ever experienced symptoms like these before
the collective does not tolerate imperfection any drone with a malfunction as serious as mine would be destroyed immediately
lucky for you this crew is a little more tolerant
oh there you are lieutenant torres tells me youre under the weather
correct
well is there anything your morale officer can do to help assignments you need me to finish while you recuperate
no
i have some wonderful medicinal teas maybe i could prepare one for you
talaxian homeopathy i dont think were quite that desperate yet
how about if i make one of your favourite nutritional supplements
your concern has been noted the doctor will inform you when i am functional again
right sorry oh ah i almost forgot its from naomi wildman its a drawing of voyager or maybe its an asteroid belt im not sure naomi thought it might make you feel better
tell her thank you
i suspected as much there were several interruptions in your regeneration cycle eighteen minutes five minutes one hour
i dont recall them
lets examine your neural function logs low serotonin levels during regeneration thats normal but look at these spikes in the prefrontal synapses they appear only seconds before you left the alcove you were sleepwalking
i dont remember entering this data file
looks like we found the identity of the midnight snacker im sure mister neelix will be relieved
personal log ensign stone stardate 521887 i just completed my first week of active duty it was a nightmare after four years at the academy i thought i was ready for anything but captain blackwood runs a tight ship and he seems to take special pleasure in tormenting new recruits the first officer tells me not to take it personally but its hard to be objective when
blackwood captain of the federation starship tombaugh the borg assimilated that vessel thirteen years ago
the individual who made this recording must have been a member of the crew
one of my victims
heres another log entry this one encoded for transmission
hi guess who i know i promised to write you every day but thats simply not enough how about once in the morning when i resuscitate and once at night before i go into torpor and ill think about you nonstop in between wait ive got a better idea why dont you leave your circle and visit the colony youd love it here so
anything familiar
i helped to assimilate thousands of individuals i do not remember each of their names
seven you were a borg drone whos now becoming an individual thats practically unheard of theres bound to be rough spots along the way we just have to get past them
bridge to seven of nine were approaching the debris field
acknowledged
survivors
none
any sign of borg vessels
no sir were the first ones here
im picking up the source of the interlink frequency bearing oh two seven mark three
on screen magnify
its a borg vinculum
vinculum
the processing device at the core of every borg vessel it interconnects the minds of all the drones it purges individual thoughts and disseminates information relevant to the collective
it brings order to chaos
precisely
looks like this one has established a link to your cortical implant
i believe it has identified me as an errant drone it is attempting to reintegrate me into the collective the vinculum is malfunctioning it is sending me erratic commands
bringing chaos to order
yes
can you sever the link
not without risking permanent damage to my own systems the vinculum must be taken offline permission to beam it aboard for analysis i have worked with this technology before i may be able to disable it
were talking about the heart of a borg cube id rather not take it inside my ship can you disable it remotely
yes but i would need several days the borg may return by then i recommend we take the vinculum and leave this region immediately
tuvok prepare to beam it to engineering erect a level ten forcefield and maintain constant surveillance the moment it poses a threat send it back into space tom as soon as its aboard get us out of here warp nine
aye captain
i understand what youre going through and i want to help you in every way i can but the safety of this crew is my first responsibility we havent had the best of luck with the borg
nor have i
lets keep an eye on those antigrav struts boylen lock out all primary command consoles and reroute transporter controls to main engineering
yes lieutenant
seven
the voices i hear them
its your proximity to the vinculum the link is stronger here im adjusting your neurotransmitter levels youd better get started
dont worry lieutenant the son of kvok will not be joining us
glad to hear it does this qualify as our second date
just think of me as your chaperone
so wheres the off switch
the vinculum is equipped with many safeguards i will need to access its transneural matrix and disable it directly
im reading a power surge
its a normal response to my intrusion dont be alarmed curious im detecting an organism within the vinculum it appears to be a viral agent
lets see it its a synthetic pathogen the virus was originally a biological agent but its mutated its attacking the vinculums programmes as it would living cells
an organism that attacks technology
the cube was infected three days ago shortly after assimilating an alien shuttlecraft species 6339 they were the last ones to come in contact with the cube
looks like we found our typhoid mary
species 6339 humanoid warpcapable origin grid one two four octant twenty two theta they first encountered the borg approximately four years ago since that time eleven billion individuals have been assimilated three days ago the collective detected one of their last surviving shuttlecraft a cube was sent to intercept it
we believe the virus was carried within their bodies once they were assimilated it spread to the vinculum
the drones aboard no doubt experienced symptoms similar to my own it is no surprise they destroyed themselves
id like to find species 6339 they may be able to help us treat you begin long range astrometric scans see if they have any more vessels in this region
yes captain ive already begun a spatial diagn  my my my look at the size of that thing this viewscreen its got to be one of the biggest ive ever seen ill give you twenty bars of latinum for it
i think the inhibitors gone offline would you come here please
be quiet cant you see im in the middle of a deal name your price captain
janeway and you are
daimon torrot
youre ferengi
of course im ferengi is that some kind of insult about the size of my ears
no not at all id be happy to negotiate with you but first we have to get you to sickbay
sickbay what for
because youre ill
ive never felt better
doctor
im afraid youve contracted a nasty strain of the ankaran flu weve been treating you several days remember
no
short term memory loss its one of the symptoms dont worry it isnt life threatening but well need to treat you in sickbay
what is this treatment going to cost me
its free of charge
free
yes
you know i have been having a nagging pain in my lower left lobe and while youre at it why dont you run a complete tricardial diagnostic the ferengi health commissions trying to revoke my trading license
impressive vessel captain galaxy class
intrepid
ah ah and here we are in the much talkedabout sickbay not exactly state of the medical art now is it
what do you mean
youre low on biobeds terrible lighting obsolete instruments lucky for you i know a medical supplier that can spruce this place up in a nanosecond and ill even drop my commission to a mere thirty percent
how generous of you computer activate forcefield
forcefield you said i wasnt contagious
its for your own safety ive set the cortical inhibitor to maximum but it is no longer suppressing the effects these personalities are going to keep surfacing
ive been kidnapped
even more reason to shut down the vinculum as soon as we can
even if we do break the link it may be too late sevens own neural pattern is destabilising it could be lost
please help me im looking for my son gregory bergan lieutenant bergan have you seen him
no im afraid not
from the starship melbourne
melbourne
i was supposed to meet him at wolf 359 but starfleet sent out a warning that the borg were attacking that sector it was too late for us to turn back we were caught in a terrible battle my ship was badly damaged we had to leave on escape pods i never found out what happened to gregory please i havent heard from him in over three days could you check with starfleet headquarters
ill see what i can do
thank you captain if you do speak with him could you tell him that his mother is all right and if he could pos captain
seven
yes the vinculum
were preparing to shut it down right away ill give the order as soon as torres is ready
how long was i absent
about twenty minutes
how many
two one of whom wanted to acquire half the items on the ship daimon torrot i believe
species 180 ferengi
yes the other was a woman whose son was lost in a borg attack youll get through this seven
i do not share your optimism
when you took me from the borg and began to turn me into an individual i found the silence of my own mind difficult to bear i missed the voices of the collective but now that i am an individual those same voices frighten me captain i dont know if i can tolerate this condition much longer my courage is insufficient
your job is to keep trying to hold on even when you think you cant leave the rest to me and the crew
meet anyone interesting
just finished swapping jokes with a bolian manicurist before that i was debating the finer points of temporal physics with a krenim scientist twelve new personalities have surfaced in the past hour alone sevens having a rough time of it the doctor had to sedate her
hows the captain holding up
ive been better chakotay in fact im starting to wonder if my first officer was right all along
about what
you always said that bringing seven into the fold might be impossible
you can take the borg out of the collective but i dont believe that not anymore i didnt think shed last a day much less a year id say youve proven me wrong
torres to bridge were ready to begin disabling the vinculum
proceed
target the transneural matrix stand by to initiate the dampening field on my mark three two one mark its power output is dropping
doctor to bridge it seems to be working her neural pattern is stabilising
power output is down to seventy seven percent seventy one percent wait a second its increasing
im refocusing the dampening field
its still increasing
the vinculum is rerouting its internal circuitry its adapting
engineering her synaptic pathways are destabilising abort the procedure
help me
abort
stand by doctor power output at ninety eight percent  the forcefield is collapsing
transfer emergency power
it wont work lieutenant we must abort tuvok to bridge
the procedure was unsuccessful the vinculum has returned to full power
acknowledged doctor report
sevens neural pattern has disappeared captain it appears that the other patterns have taken over completely weve lost her
ive managed to stabilise her primary cortical functions but the woman in sickbay is not seven of nine not any more new personalities are emerging every few seconds now she cant finish a sentence before the next one rears its head its creating an incredible strain on her cerebral cortex if we dont deactivate the vinculum soon we may never get her back
tuvok
lieutenant torres is taking measures to prevent the vinculum from adapting but theres no guarantee shell succeed
captain ive exhausted every viable treatment in my database
then logic dictates we go beyond medical science i will attempt to mind meld with seven of nine
a mind meld you consider that a viable treatment
sevens neural pattern her sense of self is immersed in chaos i will attempt to isolate her true self and guide it to the surface
its dangerous enough to meld with one person let alone hundreds of different personalities
its too risky
the risk is mine to take
im aware of that but is this our only option
i believe it is captain
how long would you need to prepare
captain you cant actually be considering this vulcan mumbo jumbo
i will require two hours of meditation
begin immediately report to sickbay when youre ready
you said it yourself weve exhausted every medical treatment
i just hope i dont find myself with a second patient
captain to the bridge
on my way
commander
its them species 6339
their vessel is wellarmed captain im picking up twenty two phaser cannons on the aft section alone
hail them
theyre responding
on screen im captain janeway of the federation starship voyager we recently found a piece of borg technology its been infected with a viral agent we believe was transmitted by your
the vinculum you have it
yes
youve made a terrible mistake captain
a weapon
yes since the borg decimated our world weve been looking for ways to retaliate
so you created a virus to infect their technology
thirteen of my people were injected with the virus they allowed themselves to be assimilated so that the virus would spread to this vinculum once another borg ship had retrieved it they would be infected as well then another cube and another we had the opportunity to infect dozens even hundreds of borg vessels until you interfered why
your virus has had one unexpected casualty a member of my crew
it wasnt designed to infect other species
shes borg
we liberated her from the collective over a year ago shes an individual now
we were hoping you could help us treat her
we designed that virus to destroy borg captain we never considered a treatment im afraid your drone wont survive but we must return the vinculum to the debris field immediately if the borg arrive first well have lost our chance and those thirteen people will have died in vain
all right well return it to you but first we need to try to save our crew member we think we have a way to counteract the vinculums effects belanna
im going to try to remodulate our dampening field to compensate
we dont have time for this the vinculum captain
i cant give it to you not yet
you scanned our vessel youre aware of our firepower
you could undoubtedly do significant damage to voyager and to the vinculum is that what you want
the vinculum survived the destruction of one ship what makes you so sure it wont survive another
doctor
seven a necessary precaution a few of your guests have been violent
the vinculum
it keeps adapting we havent been able to shut it down your own neural pattern was nearly destroyed in the process i wasnt sure id find you again
i am damaged
one of your personas didnt appreciate the restraints she seemed intent on forcing her way to freedom
i apologise
it was hardly your fault youre ill
irrelevant i am borg i should be able to adapt
surprise you arent invincible i suppose thats something well have to tackle in our next social lesson voices
theyre getting louder
it wont be long before i lose you again its my duty as your physician to inform you of an alternative treatment
what treatment
commander tuvok has proposed a mind meld to help stabilise your neural pattern i had a similar reaction if you dont approve
what is the probability of success
i dont know a mind meld is hardly a standard medical practice
are there any risks to tuvok
he could suffer brain damage but hes confident hell be able to break the meld before that happens
even if we do shut down the vinculum it may not be enough if tuvok can do anything to help me
i understand
doctor you have shown a great deal of patience
not at all
inform the crew that i am also grateful for their efforts
youll be able to tell them yourself afterwards seven
voices
concentrate focus on the sound of my voice
get them out please i cant i cant no
report
the alien vessel is coming about
theyre charging weapons
shields
as if the meld werent dangerous enough the aliens are trying to take the vinculum by force commander chakotay is at tactical the captain wants you here with seven this will allow me to monitor your neural activity for the duration of the meld at the first sign of trouble
you will do nothing
i beg your pardon
there will undoubtedly be many signs of trouble you must have faith in my ability to endure them
ill try i just hope my faith doesnt leave the two of you brain damaged
your concerns have been noted doctor
with all of these new personalities floating around its a shame we cant find one for you
computer deactivate forcefield
why am i tied to this bed please let me go petaq ill rip out your throat coward name your price ten bars of latinum twenty this isnt medicine its torture ill sue for malpractice i fail to see the logic in this meld commander
my mind to your mind
you are but one mind confronting thousands
my thoughts to your thoughts
you will not succeed
your mind to my mind
let me go the borg are assimilating the ship weve got to evacuate
my thoughts to your thoughts
listen to me theyre trying to assimilate the ship
my mind to your mind
let me go
my thoughts to your thoughts
mommy mommy

im lost somebody help me please i dont like it herei want to go home i cant find my
mommy please help me please i dont want to stay here i want to go home i dont like it here please help me i want to go home these people are scary please dont go please why are youleaving me here please i dont like it here
sickbay to engineering
how long until the vinculums offline
two maybe three minutes provided voyager can stay in one piece for that long
shields down to sixty percent
evasive manoeuvres target their weapons array
targeting systems are malfunctioning
were losing power to main thrusters
shields to thirty five percent
reroute all available power to shields chakotay initiate manual targeting
torres to bridge
the vinculums stopped adapting i think the new dampening field is working we should have it disabled in the next sixty seconds
warning neurochemical synapses are destabilising
computer increase power to the cortical inhibitors
unable to comply power transport systems are offline
tuvok if you can hear me we have to terminate the meld tuvok tuvok

power outputs down to twenty nine percent twenty two seventeen bridge we just lost the field emitters
we took a direct hit to the power grid stand by were switching to emergency backup
seven
bridge the vinculums powering up again
the field emitters are back online pull the plug
its working power output down to nineteen percent thirteen percent

its done captain the vinculums offline
seven
yes
we have her back captain
hail the lead vessel tell them were surrendering the vinculum
no response
lock onto the damn thing beam it into space
transport complete theyre withdrawing
take us out of here tom warp nine
yes maam
neuroprocessor cortical receptors all stable shes fit to return to duty
what about her other personalities any sign of them
those neural patterns have returned to their dormant state
the voices will not return
i suppose that depends on your perspective you may not hear them but i suspect theyll always be with you
the members of this crew put themselves at risk to help me i am unsure how to reciprocate
lets start with something small like a recalibration of the eps manifolds belannas expecting you in engineering
i will join her shortly there is a crew member i must see first
these are star charts for the next three systems voyager will pass through familiarise yourself with them
understood
sociological data regarding one hundred and seventy three delta quadrant species study it
i will
as bridge assistant you will find this information relevant
consider it assimilated
there is one more assignment i require your assistance
me
i wish to participate in recreational activities
great
kadiskot instruct me how to play
i will comply
and since i was the only crewmember who could survive the corrosive atmosphere it was up to me to retrieve the data module and save the day ah here i am mission accomplished then of course there was the perilous mission to lavoti v you remember that one dont you mister paris
how could i forget
here you are after your unfortunate slip into the fetid mud pits of palomar
hey i was pushed
of course you were
thank you doctor weve all enjoyed your holoimages enormously
oh but i havent finished yet
theres more
the best is yet to come lieutenant ive created a fascinating twelve part holographic essay which i call under the skin humanoid anatomy as art lets begin with this stunning magnification of the vulcan reproductive gland note the composition the subtle variations in colour
twenty one hundred hours commander all systems reporting normal
acknowledged
like i said its twenty one hundred hours
i heard you the first time harry
theyve been in there over an hour
im aware of that
didnt the captain ask you to rescue them after thirty minutes
harry you and i were lucky enough to enjoy the doctors scintillating exhibition for two full hours would it really be fair of us to deny our friends the same unforgettable experience
of course not sir
thank you thank you for coming well do it again soon weve still got thousands of light years to while away this could be a weekly event
what happened to going to yellow alert after half an hour
commander chakotay appears to have disobeyed a direct order
definitely grounds for court martial
hey neelix
coffee
oh i could use a whole pot
let me guess the doctors photographic essay
ha one mindnumbing image after the next
oh i dont know i thought some of those pictures were pretty funny
you mean like the one where tom slipped into a mud pit
youre famous
then of course theres the one depicting a certain chief engineer with her foot stuck in a plasma injector
what
really i seem to have missed that one
the doctor must have taken it out of the exhibition
oh i cant wait to get my hands on it maybe i can distribute it to everyones personal database
try it and ill kill you right after i finish deleting the doctors programme
whatd you put in this coffee neelix
im reading a massive energy wave nine hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow heading right for us
source
unknown
shields up evasive manoeuvres
the wave just changed course it seems to be tracking us
go to warp eight
too late engines are down
everybody hang on
all stop
shields are holding minor damage to the hull plating on deck fifteen
no injuries
stand down red alert
captain when the wave hit our communications array received a download
what sort of download
im not sure lots of information i cant decipher it but theres an audio component
lets hear it
harry try all the standard decryption algorithms
its strange the wave followed us but it didnt cause any damage instead we get a download to our database id say its a pretty good bet somebodys trying to tell us something
the wave left a residual ion trail we might be able to locate its point of origin
set a course
looks like its taken quite a beating
lifesigns
one nonhumanoid its very faint probably injured
beam it to sickbay
are you sure thats wise captain
im betting that message we received was some sort of distress call and if were going to help id rather do it on voyager
the physiology is so unusual the tricorder cant make heads or tails of it the creatures obviously injured but i havent a clue how to treat it or even diagnose it
my scans came up with something interesting captain the interfaces on the aliens vessel can only be activated chemically im guessing that this lifeform somehow interfaces directly with the ships systems using biochemical secretions to give commands
that would explain how it can fly a ship
im hoping this can also help us figure out
no youll hurt belanna
get it off of me
janeway to kim beam the alien lifeform
back to its vessel now
im having trouble getting a lock
its piercing her neck
her heart and lungs are seriously compromised and her kidneys are failing the creatures also secreting some kind of paralysing agent into her bloodstream
how do we get it off her
i cant remove it surgically not without doing irreparable harm to belannas organs
can we get a lock on the creature transport it off
not unless we want to beam belannas cardiopulmonary system along with it
we have to do something
no one is disputing that mister paris the question is what if im to have any hope of devising a treatment ill need to brush up on my exobiology
what do you mean brush up dont you have all this information in your database
i may be a walking medical encyclopaedia but even i dont know everything my matrix simply isnt large enough
maybe we can do better than giving you a crash course in exobiology maybe we can provide you with a consultant
id be delighted but how
by isolating the computers exobiology data files and merging them into a an interactive matrix
a hologram
exactly
that may not be as simple as it sounds it would need to be nearly as sophisticated as i am tactile interfaces personality subroutines
harry could do it
search the database for the leading exobiologist if you want to add a personality it may as well be based on a real person ill have harry meet you in holodeck two
stay with her and monitor her vital signs call me if theres any change
i still have my doubts about this doc its one thing to create a simple hologram but youre trying to merge an extensive database with an interactive matrix
dont be a pessimist mister kim together well create a masterpiece of holographic art
a subject for your next slide show
perhaps
cant wait
whats the name of that exobiologist you chose
crell moset
heres the file
lets start with the parameters for physical appearance
computer display a holographic simulation of crell moset
have you mentioned to anyone else that this guys a cardassian
what difference does it make
maybe you havent heard theyre not the friendliest folks in the galaxy
i dont care if hes the nastiest man who ever lived as long as he can help us save belanna
good point computer transfer all reference medical files to the simulation
transfer complete
now install personality subroutines and voice approximation
installation complete
doctor moset id like to consult with you about an alien lifeform
i am crell moset chief exobiology specialist cardassia prime certified to perform all surgical procedures
this is going well whats wrong
some sort of overload in the interactive matrix
can you clear it up
im trying computer install a recursive algorithm
algorithm installed
try it again
doctor moset
my friends call me crell
its a pleasure to meet you crell
and you good man whats your name
actually im inbetween names at the moment im an emergency medical hologram
interesting
but his friends call him doc
ahha may i presume
certainly
so doc how can an old surgeon like me help a technological marvel such as yourself
oh well ive got a patient with a rather unusual problem shes become fused with a nonhumanoid lifeform i know nothing about
nonhumanoid exobiology happens to be one of my specialties
thats exactly why weve created your programme
programme
youre a hologram as well
interesting id like to see the patient right away
mister kim would you do the honours please
no problem listen if he destabilises again take him offline and call me
understood
lieutenant may i present crell moset
its a pleasure
shes been drifting in and out of consciousness
dont be rude lieutenant
to him no offence doc but hes just a
a brilliant scientist whos here to help us this way crell
hmm i can see why youre having difficulty
its physiology doesnt match any of the standard templates in our database
my guess would be a cytoplasmic lifeform
i agree and from what i can tell it has coopted her vital systems
shes klingon no the cranial ridges are less pronounced klingonhuman hybrid
exactly lets hope your instincts about the creature are equally insightful
im afraid this one is going to require more than a visual assessment you have an isomolecular scanner
no just a standard issue starfleet tricorder
no wonder youre having problems making an accurate diagnosis
i suggested an upgrade to the starfleet people at a joint medical conference but they assumed i was just an arrogant cardassian trying to prove his superiority or maybe they thought i was a spy
i hope you werent too offended
its an unfortunate reality sometimes even enlightened races cant find common ground i may be able to recalibrate this thing there that should help
amazing
well someone from starfleet appreciates me
ive instructed the computer to assign symbols to all the tones received in the transmission
looks like there were over ten thousand separate sounds used in this section of the message
its going to be a tough code to crack
maybe we can get a little help from the alien vessels databanks
good idea janeway to seven of nine
yes
any chance of downloading the aliens databanks
were looking for anything that might help us understand their language we dont know how much time belanna has left
we must move quickly the vessel is on the verge of a complete systems failure
prepare to download the data
i heard the captain
is there a problem
no no problem
you seem uncomfortable taking orders from me
its just that im used to taking orders from belanna thats all and to tell you the truth she doesnt
doesnt like me yes i am aware of that however the captain left me in charge during lieutenant torres absence her feelings about me are irrelevant activate the interface transceiver begin the download
im picking up a fluctuation in the alien ships power source
its disrupting the interface transceiver reinitialise
im working on it its systems are overloading
red alert
engineering to bridge the alien vessel is destabilising its destruction is imminent
can you download the information first
were trying
captain its going to explode
ensign back us off
what do we know so far
the lifeform has taken control of her body at the autonomic level drawing proteins from her tissues white blood cells from her arteries
which can be interpreted in several ways
a form of attack
i find it odd that a species would evolve an attack mechanism that would leave it so vulnerable why not do its damage and retreat
a parasite perhaps
yes i think so but not any ordinary variety its unlikely it could sustain itself like this over the long term
its own systems are damaged its doing this as a stopgap measure to keep itself alive
so the patients heart lungs kidneys theyre all augmenting the aliens damaged system
its using belanna as a life preserver
but if it needs her to survive its not about to let go without a fight
id like to think thats a fight you and i can win
we do work well together i just wish we had access to my laboratory it has all the instrumentation we would need well well just have to improvise
not necessarily we may be able to create a reasonable facsimile of your laboratory in our holodeck
providing of course you can give an accurate description
oh down to the smallest detail its more of a home to me than my home
tom
hey there
i cant move
i know but dont worry well get this thing off you just think i could force you to listen to rock and roll all day and you wouldnt be able to do a thing about it
whos that
relax hes just a hologram a specialist in exobiology the doc thinks he might be able to help you
cant he find somebody else
apparently this guys the best besides hes just a walking database
hologram or not hes cardassian as far as im concerned theyre all coldblooded killers
i understand how you feel unfortunately that coldblooded killer may be the only one who can save your life
impressive is this where you did your work on the fostossa virus
no actually i was on bajor at the time during the occupation a sad chapter in cardassian history we had no business being there but try telling that to the politicians when i think of the resources that were squandered the lives that were lost
but from what i understand you saved thousands of lives
in retrospect i dont know how the military had everything they needed but the civilian hospitals no staff the crudest equipment
dont tell me you were forced to improvise
yes
i know what thats like
i didnt have the resources to try traditional methods so i experimented with procedures that that never would have occurred to me under ordinary circumstances the discovery of the cure was almost accidental really
youre being modest crell
no
you made medical history you won the legates crest of valour
awards arent important doc its the work that matters
of course still the recognition of your peers your government it must be very satisfying
im sure youve made your share of breakthroughs
naturally unfortunately no one from starfleet ever hears about them i toil in obscurity
why dont you show me your patient records at least ill know about your accomplishments
all right
everything seems to be in order shall we get to work
computer create a holographic recreation of the alien in sickbay
hand me that cortical stimulator will you yes thank you
it was a distress call right so maybe if we retransmitted that message others of the species would realise we need their help
we dont know where they are
well send it on all subspace bands if theyre out there theyll hear it
they might turn out to be unfriendly
the doctors pretty sure the alien is simply trying to survive i agree itll be a difficult first contact but we might find a way to communicate
its worth a shot
tuvok reroute auxiliary power to the deflector dish retransmit the aliens message on all subspace bands
aye captain deflector at full capacity
chakotay
im sorry my wife tells me im tone deaf
not at all you were right on key if you enjoy music we can run some opera programmes after were finished
id like that i think were ready for a look inside scalpel
forgive me for saying so but this appears to be a rather crude instrument especially when we have such advanced equipment at our disposal
i often find the simplest tool is the most effective all of our elaborate scanners and laser scalpels they remove us from our subjects actually feeling the anatomy the consistency of the internal organs it can be very instructive why dont you do the honours make a vertical incision say twelve centimetres starting here
were hurting it
doctor its a hologram
of course i guess as a hologram myself i have a certain empathy
keep going
extraordinary look at that series of nodes
they appear to be clustered along the primary nerve
multiple neocortices id say
suggesting a highly intelligent species
yes but also presenting us with a point of attack
attack
if we induce a neurostatic shock in one of these nodes i believe it will travel to the others the creature will lose motor function and well be able to remove it
the procedure will probably kill the creature
probably
id like to find a way to save them both
so would i in an ideal situation but we have to set priorities which in this case is your crew mate
this is a sentient lifeform for all we know it could be this species einstein its picasso
or he could be a psychotic criminal the point is we dont know and we have choices to make
your programmes destabilising
this is such poor timing
ill have to take you offline but dont worry well have you up and running again in no time computer take medical consultant programme offline doctor to ensign kim
go ahead doc
our new programmes destabilising
ill meet you in sickbay well try to reinitialise him there tabor i could use some help
yes sir
try again
no luck
would it be easier if we reduced the holograms memory load
maybe but i dont want to do that unless we absolutely have to
whats going on
my consultants gone offline
the cardassian you can leave him off
im surprised by your attitude lieutenant i never took you for someone who would make generalisations based on race
when it comes to cardassians im guilty as charged
i understand your experience with them was unpleasant but if you give crell a chance i think youll find that hes a friendly compassionate man not to mention a genius whos trying to save your life
ill skip the introductions if its all the same to you
suit yourself but you should know i plan on asking the captain to keep him on as a permanent consultant
im not the only one whos going to have a problem with that
well youll just have to get used to it who knows you may even grow to like him
dont hold your breath
hows it coming
were close
actually i think that should do it
good computer reactivate medical consultant programme beta one
hello again
my god
whats wrong
thats crell moset
yes do i know you
he killed my brother my grandfather hundreds of people hes a mass murderer
you must be mistaken
its no mistake moset performed experiments on living people thousands of bajorans were killed in his socalled hospital
is this true
no no hes there must be some misunderstanding
the liar
whoa take it easy tabor whoa hes just a hologram
im upsetting him i should go
im sorry about this computer transfer medical consultant programme to holodeck two
i can still remember the sounds his instruments made the screams of his patients the smell chemicals and dead flesh he operated on my grandfather exposed his internal organs to nadion radiation it took six days for him to die i promised myself i would never forget
you were very young is it possible your memory of these events is inaccurate
my memorys just fine he blinded people so he could study how they adapted exposed them to polytrinic acid just to see how long it would take for their skin to heal
ensign the man youre accusing cured the fostossa virus he stopped an epidemic that killed thousands of bajorans
by infecting hundreds of people so that he could experiment with different treatments old helpless people like my grandfather because he considered their lives worthless
how do you know this
everybody knew
i remember some of the maquis under my command talking about an infamous cardassian doctor
could these simply have been rumours spread by bajorans who hated the cardassians
i was there
i dont understand why this isnt in our database
the cardassians didnt exactly publicise their wartime medical practices i wouldnt be surprised if the real moset went on to live a normal life
hes the chairman of exobiology at the university of culat
we may not be able to do anything about the real moset commander but the programme should be destroyed every trace of that mans research should be deleted from the database
i had a bad feeling about that hologram the second i saw him
looks like your instinct was right
i wont let him near me
youre kidding right
no i am dead serious
belanna
if i let that pig operate on me ill be benefiting from other peoples suffering
youre not being rational
i wont do it
whats happening
her cytotoxin levels are going through the roof pulse is rapid and irregular
no doubt youve said something to upset her
what shes upset about doc is your cardassian buddy
tell him
tell me what
she refuses to let him treat her
belanna were very close to a solution
do it without him
i dont know that i can
find another way
shes going into cytotoxic shock
two milligrams of inaprovaline
isolate datablock oh four five nine
ensign you wanted to see me
weve been looking for evidence that might support tabors accusations
anything
actually thats why we called you here its not looking good
show me
weve been reviewing data on the cardassian occupation of bajor the alleged site of mosets crimes
strategic information log entries kept in battle sensor scans from starfleet vessels this for example requisition records from one of crell mosets hospitals
he was purchasing biochemical agents including every known strain of the fostossa virus
of course he needed samples of the virus thats how vaccines are developed
take a look at the requisition orders
moset didnt ask for any of the enzymes normally required for synthesizing a vaccine
it gets worse four days after he received the virus samples there was a minor outbreak of fostossa in the vicinity of his hospital
prior to that date there had not been a single case in the entire province
i have to report these findings to commander chakotay
it is curious the borg are accused of assimilating information with no regard for life this cardassian did the same and yet his behaviour was tolerated
ah there you are im almost ready to perform the surgery
lieutenant torres wont allow you to have anything to do with her treatment
because of that bajoran
weve gathered some corroborating evidence it appears that hes telling the truth you committed a series of atrocities during the cardassian war thousands of bajorans died on your surgical tables
thats absurd and even if it were true im only a hologram and i have no memory of those events theyre not part of my programming
but you are the holographic representation of crell moset your programme despite all its brilliance is based on his work he infected patients exposed them to polytrinic acid mutilated their living bodies and now were reaping the benefits of those experiments medically ethically its wrong
what do you suggest we do about it
im not sure we may have to delete your programme
delete me what about our patient
i suppose id have to try and treat her on my own
no offence but you need me
i realise that
youre a physician you know theres always a price to pay for the advancement of medical science
sometimes that price is too high torture
your word not mine i cured the fostossa virus didnt i so these experiments you say i conducted obviously helped me devise a treatment imagine how many lives would have been lost if i hadnt eliminated this disease
that doesnt justify using people in laboratory experiments
as i explained to you during the occupation i was forced to improvise i used what resources i had
and ethical considerations they mean nothing to you
ethics are arbitrary how do you suppose your own database was developed hmm my god half the medical knowledge acquired on earth came through experiments on lower animals
but not people
its convenient to draw a line between higher and lower species isnt it
this is the twenty fourth century crell your kind of barbarism ended a long time ago or at least it should have
what difference does it make how long ago the research occurred what matters is that we can use it to help patients today now are you going to delete my programme and all of the research it contains or are we going to use it to save belannas life
come in
commander
this request of yours to be relieved of duty i wont grant it
i have the right to resign my commission
for what reason
moral objections to the ships medical policy
i understand how difficult this is for you but youve got to let go of the past focus on today and today belannas life is in danger everything else should be put aside
you dont have the right to violate the memory of my family as long as that cardassian hologram is online thats exactly what youre doing
its not that simple
it is to me crell moset killed thousands of people in his hospitals as long as were willing to benefit from his research were no better than he is
if i had weeks or even days maybe i could come up with an alternative but time is of the essence and mosets idea will work
then youve got to use it
even if the doctor could perform the surgery without mosets help hed still be using the mans research that would be going against belannas wishes
were talking about a woman who has alien tendrils sapping the life out of her shes obviously not thinking straight
on the contrary her concerns are based in logic
logic
if the doctor uses knowledge that moset gained through his experiments we would be validating his methods inviting further unethical research
wed be setting a terrible precedent
were in the middle of the delta quadrant who would know
we would know
fine lets just deactivate the evil hologram and let belanna die at least wed have our morals intact
tom
and you chakotay since when do you care what starfleet thinks
this isnt about rules and regulations this is about doing whats right
spoken like a true maquis well if youd just set aside your hatred of the cardassians for one second
enough lieutenant
all right all right the arguments have been made and were running out of time the fact is youre both right but when it comes down to it the only issue im concerned about is the wellbeing of that crew member lying in sickbay well wrestle with the morality of this situation later after belanna is back on her feet doctor you have my authorisation to proceed with mosets assistance
yes captain
any consequences of this decision will be my responsibility dismissed
thanks
scalpel
ensign kim do you hear something
hear what
a series of high frequencies they are getting louder
must be those vulcan ears of yours
i hear it too anything on sensors
it appears to be an alien comm signal triaxilating wavelengths
origin
unknown
captain a vessel just dropped out of warp approaching fast off the port bow
on screen
can we dampen it a little
negative
harry tell me that was just their way of saying hello
i wish i could the universal translator doesnt have a clue
perhaps they are waiting for our response
well then lets give them one open a channel all subspace bands this is captain janeway of the federation starship voyager we cannot interpret your message but please try to understand we are on a peaceful mission and we intend you no harm we have one of your kind on board our ship its injured and were attempting to provide treatment if you can understand this
im ready to stimulate the primary neural pathways cortical probe im applying it to the primary neocortex its motor control is weakening but not enough to release the patient our little friend needs a bigger jolt im increasing the pulse frequency
the synapses are degenerating youre killing it
dont lose your nerve doctor not when were this close
lower the pulse frequency
if i do that the creature will regain control
i dont care lower the pulse
doctor
lower the pulse frequency or ill take your programme offline
you realise youre reducing our chances of saving her
not necessarily give me the probe the probe doctor if we apply the pulse to the secondary neocortex we should be able to achieve the same results at a lower frequency
not particularly efficient but it might prove interesting
im reading an energy surge in their forward section
shields
doctor to bridge the holodecks going offline
whats happening up there
stand by doctor
theyve locked on to us with some sort of tractor beam its draining our power
reroute emergency power to the holodeck send an antimatter surge through the shields matrix see if thatll loosen their grip
no effect we do have weapons
no if they wanted to destroy us they wouldnt be using a tractor beam theyre trying to rescue their crew member
captain
this isnt about logic tuvok its about instinct now i may not speak their language but i have a gut feeling they dont want an armed conflict any more than we do bridge to doctor whats your status
the procedures working
almost there captain
its losing motor control the tendrils are withdrawing from her lungs liver kidneys the aliens life signs are failing
we need a substitute for the metabolic energy it was taking from belanna
could we restore its own metabolism
perhaps give it forty milligrams of stenophyl its going into anaphylactic shock
all right increasing the dosage to sixty milligrams
weve lost power on decks seven through twelve
shields are failing captain
doctor
stand by captain
anaphylaxia is subsiding
its electrolytic reactions are increasing its metabolism is stabilising on its own bridge beam the lifeform to its ship
transport complete
the alien ship is withdrawing captain
youre welcome
ive released belanna to her quarters
her condition
stable but her nervous system has suffered extreme trauma shell need time to recover several days at least
good work
i should caution you captain when i told her that wed used mosets programme she was unhappy to put it mildly i nearly had to sedate her
it sounds like her klingon temper has fully recovered
it practically qualifies as a chronic condition
ill speak to her
theres one more topic of concern should we delete the programme or keep moset in our database for future emergencies
im inclined to leave this up to you doctor youre the chief medical officer on this ship as far as im concerned theres no one more qualified than you to make that decision
thank you captain
but please make it quickly im eager to resolve this matter theres been enough moral controversy on this ship for one day
come in
at ease interesting fragrance im surprised it hasnt set off the environmental alarms
its a combination of mental relaxant and expeller of demons its an ancient klingon remedy
feeling any better
im alive
i hope you can understand why i went against your wishes belanna losing you was unacceptable i know youre angry but we need to put this behind us understood
is that an order
yes
you cant order someone to get rid of an emotion captain
and what emotion is that
you had no right to make that decision for me
im the captain youre my crewman i did what i thought best i get the feeling there are still a few demons in the air lets hope this does the trick huh
doc hows our patient
recuperating
we did it
yes we did
a celebration is in order how about listening to that opera you promised me oh youre er still wrestling with your ethical subroutines take my advice its a waste of time whats important is that we saved two lives today
im not concerned with today its tomorrow im worried about captain janeway has left your future in my hands she believes that as voyagers chief medical officer its up to me to decide whether your programme remains in our database
personally i predict a long and fruitful collaboration between us
oh
think about what we accomplished in the last twenty four hours our first case was a triumph both patients are thriving and we advanced the frontiers of medical science ive already outlined a paper that you and i will one day present to the federation medical academy total systemic invasion of a klingonhuman hybrid by a cytoplasmic pseudoparasite has a nice ring to it dont you think
are we also going to tell them where you honed your surgical techniques a footnote perhaps for further details see cardassian death camps
those techniques were crucial this morning where was your sarcasm then
i didnt come here to debate the issue with you crell i came here to inform you of my decision it is my judgment that the medical consultant programme and all the algorithms contained therein shall be deleted from the database in light of recent evidence i cannot in good conscience utilise research that was derived from such inhuman practices
in good conscience what about the wellbeing of your crew youre confronted by new forms of life every day many of them dangerous you need me delete my programme and you violate the first oath you took as a physician do no harm
do no harm you have no right to say those words computer
you can erase my programme doctor but you can never change the fact that youve already used some of my research where was your conscience when belanna was dying on that table ethics morality conscience funny how they all go out the airlock when we need something are you and i really so different
computer delete medical consultant programme and all related files
lieutenant thomas eugene paris i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign and i sentence you to thirty days solitary confinement take ensign paris to the brig
i know the way
brig
one two three
ninety eight ninety nine one hundred
staying in shape
oh yeah i do it every time im in jail
well i hope all that exercise gave you an appetite
leola root stew again thats the third time this week cant you just replicate me a pizza
sorry tom basic nutrition only captains orders
bread and water huh lets have it
i got you the padd you asked for
oh thanks so did you ask the warden about those holodeck privileges
she said and i quote tell mister paris this is punishment not shore leave
it was worth a try
well see you next meal
wait leaving already pull up a chair stay a while
sorry no nonessential conversation with the prisoner
did the words cruel and unusual mean anything to her im telling you neelix the inmates are getting restless shes going to have a fullblown prison riot on her hands
begin letter dear father pause and erase begin to admiral paris pause and erase begin hey dad long time no see chances are youll never receive this letter but in case you do theres a few things i wanted to say first of all bad news er im in jail again wait keep listening dont turn this off i want you to know how i ended up in here because its not what you think it all started on a morning i was doing something you would find a complete waste of time
captain proton to buster kincaid ive destroyed doctor chaoticas mind control machine and im on my way back to the spaceship
hello proton
who is this
an old friend
make that two old friends
the twin mistresses of evil i should have known
im afraid your trusty sidekick is indisposed at the moment
dont worry about me captain i can handle myself
well see about that bring me the brain probe
the what
the brain probe you insolent fool
oh right your wish is my command sorry harry
no problem torture me all you want demonica ill never crack
oh but you will
by the time were through with you youll be begging to tell us everything you know
youll be our puppet
our slave
great youre doing great
youre done for demonica
malicia shes demonica
whatever you two are going to jail for a very long time
ooh
ooh
move it toots
hes so brave
its a shame well have to kill him
ive got everything under control proton shouldnt you be getting back to headquarters
and leave you at the mercy of these two
come on tom im just getting to the good part
senior officers report to the bridge
i guess the good partll have to wait
any progress on those starcharts
ill have them to you by fourteen hundred
fourteen hundred you told me theyd be done yesterday
im sorry tom the sensor array went offline seven of nine will have it up and running this morning fourteen hundred i promise
you need some help im not on duty again till tomorrow morning
no i dont want to spoil your day off
oh i dont mind
thanks anyway
see you lieutenant buster
bye
i think jenny really likes you
yeah i know
i thought the feeling was mutual
how many times do i have to tell you i like megan but she wont give me the time of day
what is the difference
you cant be serious
theyre the delaney sisters harry theyre twins
are you kidding theyre nothing alike jennys aggressive and sometimes annoying but megan shes quiet artistic and shes got that cute little dimple in her right cheek
jenny doesnt have the dimple
no dimple
bridge
well youve done it again harry
what
fallen for the unattainable woman first it was a hologram then a borg and now the wrong twin
at least im consistent
sorry to interrupt your fun gentlemen but long range sensors have picked up something interesting
a concentrated mass of oxygen and hydrogen lots of animal and plant life
an mclass planet
no thats the interesting part
were entering visual range
on screen
what is it
its an ocean
according to these readings its bigger than the atlantic and pacific combined
whats holding it together
looks like theres some sort of containment field keeping it from dissipating
take us in closer tom
are those starships or submarines
open a channel this is captain janeway of the starship voyager please identify yourselves
they are powering weapons
shields red alert
shields holding no damage should i return fire
not yet voyager to approaching vessels we have no hostile intentions
theyre maintaining their course
target the lead ship and take out their weapons
direct hit
theyre hailing
i guess we got their attention on screen
im deputy consul burkus of the monean maritime sovereignty youve violated our space withdraw or well resume firing
consul we could have destroyed your ships but we didnt we have no interest in a fight
then why are you here
because were explorers and were fascinated by your ocean and wed like to learn more about it and your people if youd be willing
and if we are not
well be disappointed but well leave you alone
your ships impressive
well id be happy to give you a tour
forgive our vigilance captain over the years my government has had to protect our ocean from more than one hostile species
i understand were also very protective of our own natural resources
were always interested in learning about other cultures yours sounds particularly fascinating
and this is voyagers command centre feel free to have a look around
im curious consul have your people always lived here
our ancestors were nomadic they only discovered the waters three hundred years ago
ill bet they were as stunned as we were to find this huge ball of water floating in space
yes mister
paris tom paris
my first officer commander chakotay
they realised they could farm sea vegetation extract oxygen from the ocean for their ships create a permanent home
whats your population
more than eighty thousand
and you all live underwater
lieutenant we do have other business to attend to
mister tuvok escort our guest to the briefing room care to join us mister paris
how could you tell
do you still live aboard your ships
weve built an industrial infrastructure and undersea dwellings but yes most of our people still choose to live as our ancestors did
any idea how the ocean came into existence in my experience its a unique phenomenon
riga
there are several theories our clerics teach that the ocean was a divine gift from the creators to protect and sustain us but in my opinion the most plausible explanation is that the ocean formed naturally much the same way that a gas giant does
makes sense
unfortunately our limited knowledge of the phenomenon has created a few problems
what do you mean
im not sure this is an appropriate topic
but they might be able to help us
well do anything we can
the oceans losing containment hydrovolume has decreased more than seven percent in the last year alone
any idea whats causing it
no to make a thorough study wed need to explore the ocean centre where i believe the gravitational currents are fluctuating
but thats more that six hundred kilometres deep
our best research vessel can only go one hundred kilometres beyond that the pressures too great
well we could take you there captain
i had no idea you were such an old salt
when i saw that ocean today it reminded me of the first time i read jules verne
20000 leagues under the sea
i must have read it twenty thousand times i was obsessed with stories about the ocean all of my friends were busy with their holoprogrammes i had my head buried in captains courageous moby dick
so your interest in history includes the nineteenth century as well
ancient sailing ships were always my first love i had it all planned finish high school join the federation naval patrol but my father had other ideas
youd think admiral paris might have understood his sons passion
as far as he was concerned the only ship i was going to serve on had to have a starfleet insignia on it
so now you have an opportunity to make up for lost time
captain with a few simple thruster modifications to the delta flyer she will be seaworthy in no time
good itd take at least a week to make the necessary modifications to voyager
then its my mission
bon voyage
and so i thought to myself who better than harry to be my first mate
first mate
oh sailor talk youll get the hang of itim telling you harry i have been dreaming about something like this for as long as i can remember
correct me if im wrong but there is a mission involved here right
of course but theres no law says we cant have a little fun along the way ah boatswain ready to shove off
what are you talking about lieutenant
call me skipper
sailor talk youll get used to it
i think not hull and thruster reinforcements are complete
thats what i wanted to hear
oh excuse me am i in the right place
welcome aboard i see you like to travel light
these are my instruments for measuring depth pressure currents
we will not need them this vessel is equipped with a complete sensor array
oh
its okay you can store your gear in the hold
twenty thousand kilometres to the surface
immersion shielding
active
anchors aweigh
those structures what are they
its our main oxygen refinery and desalination plant
corrosion resistant alloys variable density ballast an efficient design
that means shes impressed
were very proud of what weve built here
i can see why
come in
im afraid we have some disturbing news
oh
weve run a computer simulation to determine the rate of dissipation its worse than mister riga thought
according to our estimates the ocean could experience a complete loss of containment in less than five years
im sorry
your calculations could be wrong
i know it sounds grim but there may be some way to stop the process
and if there isnt
you might have to consider evacuating
im supposed to go back and explain this to forty seven regional sovereigns theyll pass their first unanimous resolution calling for my head
i can imagine how difficult this must be for you but you will have to tell them
perhaps but ill wait until your delta flyer returns maybe theyll find something tangible
were at a depth of five hundred and sixty kilometres
what was that
the hull contracting
rerouting additional power to structural integrity nothing to worry about
im detecting multiphasic energy discharges bearing zero one two mark six range twelve kilometres a structure
at this depth
adjusting course i cant see anything give me forward illumination harry
what is it
its generating massive amounts of artificial gravity looks like some kind of field reactor
if its malfunctioning that would explain the loss of hydrovolume
maybe it can be repaired it looks ancient
well if these readings are right its at least a hundred thousand years old
we have no records of any previous inhabitants who built it where did they go
looks like the reactors controlled by a core computer ill try to upload the database and get some answers
initiate the interface
upload in progress
whats happening
weve got a visitor
what was it
youre the one who lives here you tell us
no ones ever been this far down before we dont know anything about marine life at these depths
you are about to have the opportunity to make a detailed study
the creature is emitting biothermic discharges
its like some kind of electric eel
only a hell of a lot bigger
and significantly more powerful that last discharge exceeded five hundred thousand volts
the shields are fried tom you might want to think about getting us out of here
thrusters are offline
targeting forward phasers
no you cant kill it
i do not intend to unfortunately the creature does not seem to be of a similar opinion
hows that upload coming
another couple of minutes
firing phasers
we only made him madder
the creature is retreating
weve got a breach
im on it
six hundred kilometres underwater propulsion offline water pouring into the cabin it was like something out of one of those jules verne stories you used to read me when i was a kid
red alert all hands to battle stations
hey what about me if were in trouble we need our best pilot at the helm you cant just leave me here
five ships and they just opened fire without warning
mmm hmm
how did we get away
apparently ensign culhane confused the enemy with a brilliant series of evasive manoeuvres i hear captain janeway is considering him for chief conn officer
oh yeah well you just tell the captain that culhanes brilliant manoeuvres almost knocked me unconscious youd think hed never flown a shuttle much less a starship
there we are
thats it arent you going to run a neurological scan maybe i should be granted a medical reprieve
your injury was what naomi wildman refers to as a booboo
come on doc you dont understand what its like being down here all day every day im going crazy
correct me if im wrong but isnt that the idea
no seriously doc you might want to take me down to sickbay for a full psychiatric evaluation three or four days of observation at least
see you in twenty days
doc resume recording okay dad where were we ah right we had just sprung a leak
nothing like a cold shower to wake up the senses
structural integrity is weakening weve lost communications shields propulsion
we can reduce our density by venting plasma and transporting all nonessential equipment off the ship it will take time but we will eventually rise to the surface
i think we should stay
stay
im not about to be scared off by a few damaged systems
tom dont you think maybe youre carrying this captains courageous thing a little too far
look its a good betthe reactors malfunctioning now were only going to get one shot at fixing it you want to leave fine give me an environmental suit and you can pick me up after youve repaired the flyer
youre going for a swim are you crazy
you have a better idea
well we already managed to interface with the reactors computer maybe we can make the repairs maybe we cant but im not leaving you down here alone
what about you two
ill stay
seven
it is in my nature to comply with the collective
im detecting a breach in the containment field
any way we can seal it
we might try reinforcing the field with a deflector beam
do it try hailing the delta flyer again
nothing
what do you thinks happened
they may be too deep to receive a transmission
they may have had an accident
its possible
possible captain ill need a better explanation than that what am i supposed to tell the council
clarify something for me are you more concerned about the lives of the people on that shuttle or your political career
whats that
a gravimetric discharge the reactors core is unstable
youd be unstable too if you were as old as this thing
age has nothing to do with it the reactors diverting massive amounts of power to its structural integrity field power normally reserved for oceanic containment
that would explain why containment is weakening
looks like the density of the waters been increasing over the past few years it seems the reactors just trying to keep itself from being crushed
can we initiate a power transfer stabilise the core
i believe so but it would be a temporary solution
thats better than nothing
captain full containment has just been reestablished
the deflector beam
negative the ocean appears to have been stabilised from within
it looks like our team has succeeded
im picking up an object on a slow ascent its the flyer
youve found something
ive been studying the generators database youre not going to believe this but apparently your ocean used to be part of a landmass
really
as far as i can tell it was part of a planetary ecosystem inhabited by a very advanced civilisation
what happened to them
thats a good question all i know is they launched this reactor into orbit they used some kind of elaborate kinetic transfer system to draw the water and everything in it up to the reactor
extraordinary why would anyone want to move an entire ocean
maybe there was some kind of disaster on the planet or maybe it was just an experiment
that must have been a massive undertaking
took them almost two hundred years
i wonder what theyd think if they knew we settled here and built another civilisation
actually i think theyd be pretty concerned
oh
this field reactor that they designed its a pretty amazing piece of technology durable i dont think its responsible for the loss of containment
but as soon as we made the recalibration the water stabilised i dont see what else it could be
riga your mining operations are destroying the ocean
youll never get into starfleet academy by playing with toys do your homework are you listening to me thomas
thomas eugene paris i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign and i sentence you to thirty years of solitary confinement
go to your room young man thats an order stay there and think about what ive said
tom
tom tom wake up bad dream
oh you could say that
you know you look like hell
thanks howd you get past the guard
the vulcan neck pinch
come to spring me
well the captain finally gave me permission to visit but ive only got a few minutes
thats big of her
how are you doing
oh thirty days no problem hows belanna
she misses you
yeah i know the feeling
so what have you been doing to pass the time
thinking and thinking trying not to think actually i started recording a letter to my father
really
yeah for some reason i i wanted to explain to him how i ended up in here i didnt want him to think well anyway i realised how ridiculous it was
you should finish it
give me one good reason
maybe hell hear it someday
doubtful
youll feel better getting it off your chest
are you bucking for ships counsellor harry
what are you going to do delete the letter that would be pointless
at least im consistent
tom
thanks for the visit harry
see you in fourteen
what was it you once told me that your father used to say you never finished anything
resume recording so we told consul burkus about the alien field reactor and how his oxygen refineries were destroying it he took the news pretty well at first
the councils very grateful for your help captain theyve asked me to request the shield and thruster schematics for your delta flyer were hoping to design a probe thatll allow us to monitor the containment generator
lieutenant torres will give you everything you need
ive also drawn up some designs for an oxygen replication system itll allow you to create free oxygen without extricating it from the water it wont solve your problems overnight but its a start
im sure itll be very helpful
our oxygen extraction levels are still dangerously high im going to recommend shutting down refineries four five and six
well take it under advisement well captain i wish you a safe journey
oh we have a few more suggestions if youd like to hear them
please pass them along to mister riga hell include them in his report
im curious whos going to read that report
it will be given to the subcommittees on life support and agriculture
excuse me consul im not sure you understand the magnitude of the crisis what youre suggesting could take months
thank you mister riga
you should listen to him if you dont make some serious changes around here soon that ocean wont be here much longer
as i said we understand his concerns
do you seems to me like youre just trying to sidestep the issue and send us on our way
with all due respect who are you to tell us what to do with our ocean
with all due respect its not your ocean
lieutenant
its all right captain id like to respond but not as a diplomat as a monean you came here claiming you wanted to learn about our way of life and now having spent three days here youre suggesting we abandon it we have an expression brine in the veins tell him what it means
its used to describe someone who has special connection to the waters
my family has lived here for ten generations we protected this ocean cultivated it lived in harmony with the animals that inhabit it can you say the same i didnt think so good day captain
we cant just let this go
what do you want me to do
of course the almighty prime directive
would you please excuse us lieutenant
see you later
i know youre upset lieutenant but when youre in a room with me you check that attitude at the door understood
captain im sorry
we cant expect an entire society to change because we think they should
then you agree with me
yes and we gave them the help they asked for we told them what we know now its up to them to do what they think is appropriate
you heard that consul theyre not going to do a damn thing
maybe not but thats their prerogative
captain
end of discussion lieutenant at fourteen hundred hours well resume a course for the alpha quadrant is that clear is that clear
as a bell
hey here to stamp out intergalactic evil
its funny
what
i went on this mission expecting to play out a childhood fantasy but along the way when i realised that ocean would just be gone one day it started to matter to me it sounds pretty stupid huh
no no it sounds like youve found yourself a cause
i never thought of myself as a cause kind of guy
well for what its worth im proud of you
thanks but captain protons not going to be able to save the day this time is he
what about tom paris
council chamber please
riga youre dismissed crewman
i want you to tell me honestly what do you thinks going to happen now
i think the bureaucracy isnt going to make more than token changes
isnt there anything else you can do
i dont see how other than taking the oxygen refineries offline
what would happen hypothetically if someone were to shut down the refineries
well i suppose theyd have to be rebuilt
yeah and theyd probably be more willing to redesign them while theyre at it if nothing else it would grab their attention
are you suggesting
im just asking questions because im not supposed to get involved in the internal affairs of alien worlds unless of course someone makes a direct request
if you can get me down there id be willing to do it
youd be risking your life
i know
captain there has just been an unauthorised launch from shuttlebay one the delta flyer
tom
hail him
no response
try a tractor beam
were out of range
were being hailed captain its consul burkus
your shuttlecraft has violated our borders i demand an explanation
mister paris is acting without authorisation
to what end
according to our scans mister riga is with him i have to assume they intend to take some sort of radical action to protect the ocean
then i presume you intend to take radical action to stop them
warning hull pressure approaching critical
were going down too fast
its the only way we can outrun your ships
janeway to paris return to voyager immediately
sorry captain i cant do that
lieutenant you are disobeying a direct order
i know
he cut us off
what the hell are they up to
looks like theyre heading directly beneath the industrial complex
can we reach them with phasers
unadvisable it would create a hydrodynamic shock wave
what about an oldfashioned depth charge
it should be possible to modify a photon torpedo
we could programme it to detonate once its in proximity to the delta flyer
do it
the torpedo is ready captain however the delta flyer has submerged below our targeting range
consul burkus hailing again
on screen
our refinery workers have been given five minutes to clear the structure was this the kind of evacuation you had in mind captain
can you get them our in time
yes but
do it ill find a way to protect your refinery end transmission
captain
he descended to avoid attack if my calculations are correct he will have to come back up to a depth of two thousand metres to strike his target
giving us a window of opportunity
precisely
captain this is tom were talking about were not going to open fire are we
as far as im concerned he forfeited his status as a protected member of this crew the second he launched that shuttle
how long till we reach our target
thirty six seconds
hes started his ascent
hail him
go ahead
lieutenant paris this is your final warning
hes not responding
arm the torpedo
twenty seconds to weapons range
are you sure you want to go through with this
do you
ive taken you this far wed better arm that missile
missile armed
stand down mister paris
or i will open fire
still no answer
time
ten seconds nine
eight seven six
five four three
two one
fire
fire
the flyer has been disabled
their missile
deflected
lieutenant thomas eugene paris you are guilty of insubordination unauthorised use of a spacecraft reckless endangerment and conduct unbecoming an officer do you have anything to say
riga needed my help
in doing so you disobeyed my direct orders
yes maam
you violated the protocols that govern this crew
yes maam
you nearly caused an armed conflict with the moneans and frankly youre lucky to be standing here right now i would have destroyed your shuttle if necessary
yes maam permission to speak freely rigas people werent going to listen they were going to ignore our warnings
you dont know that
riga knew and i was the only one who could help them
i understand your passion but passion alone doesnt give you the right to take matters into your own hands four years ago i released you from prison and gave you a fresh start until now youve been a fine officer your service on this ship has been exemplary i really believed you were past this kind of conduct
ive never been very good at playing by the rules that doesnt mean that serving under your command hasnt changed me for the better at least this time i broke the rules for a reason for something i believed in
i admire your principles tom but i cant ignore what youve done i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign and i sentence you to thirty days solitary confinement take ensign paris to the brig
i know the way
rise and shine ensign your thirty days have been served report for duty you may want to shave first
yes sir
torres to paris
go ahead
rumour has it that youre free for dinner
gee i dont know are you sure you want to be seen associating with an excon
my quarters oh seven hundred thats an order ensign
yes maam
resume recording well im out now and back to my duties i honestly dont know if ill ever understand you or what went wrong between us but i hope this letter helps you understand me a little better computer file letter in my personal database and transmit when were within range of earth
the devore ships are assuming a tactical formation
bridge to transporter room status
all set here captain pattern cohesion looks stable
cargo bay one report
the bay is clear
theyre powering weapons
why do they bother they know we wont resist
protocol mister paris
theyre hailing
gaharay vessel prepare to be inspected crew members are instructed to step away from their stations
we know the drill
sidearms and scanning equipment are to be set aside deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated
all hands this is the captain prepare to be boarded by devore inspection teams give them your full cooperation lets get this over with
their soldiers have materialised on decks fifteen eleven four and one
captain janeway report to your ready room
good morning captain i took the liberty of playing this music throughout your ship i thought it might help your crew relax sometimes these inspections can be stressful
how thoughtful
ive replicated some coffee black as usual
black
prax here still refuses to try it but then hes a man of few pleasures
captain please make yourself at home
those cell cultures are extremely fragile please
youve been routing power through your transporter system why
its a routine diagnostic weve been having trouble with our imaging scanners
the problem is in the primary energising coils focus your efforts there
thanks for the tip
contaminated antimatter this material could interfere with our readings a bionetic implant
an interlink node it permits communication with other borg drones
you are not a telepath
no
remarkable how old is this
about six hundred years my grandfather gave it to me when i was a child
it seems you have a longstanding obsession with exploration captain i on the other hand have much more in common with this ancient soldier
hes from earths classical period it produced some of our greatest artists as well
your culture has many contradictions violence and beauty science and faith all somehow mingled harmoniously like the counterpoint of this music mahler symphony number one am i correct
youre getting to know my musical database better than i do
ive had time to review it since our last encounter
tell me are all of your inspections this personal
im just trying to get to know you captain theres no reason for us to be adversaries i could be your friend and right now you could certainly use one
really why is that
your predicament i dont expect its been easy thousands of light years from home navigating by strange stars trespassing in other peoples space ignoring their laws
were just trying to get back to earth inspector
through the devore imperium
its tough to avoid
still most people make the effort we dont exactly embrace outsiders
gaharay
it means strangers which brings me to a matter that could threaten our friendship ive examined your crew manifest from our last inspection commander tuvok ensign vorik vulcans ensigns suder and jurot betazoids all telepaths and yet for some reason you neglected to mention them
for a very simple reason theyre dead tuvok vorik and jurot died in a shuttle crash about two months ago suder was killed in a conflict with a species called the kazon
thats fortunate for you i mean if id known you were harbouring telepaths i would have had to arrest you for breaking our cardinal protocol
they were valued members of my crew inspector not criminals
perhaps captain do you trust me
not for a second
exactly and why should you trust has to be earned its gradual and yet its the foundation of every relationship professional and personal its also a concept alien to the telepathic races why take someone at their word when you can simply read their mind
weve completed our inspection there are no telepaths aboard however their sensor logs indicate they deviated from their assigned course on two occasions
in both cases to avoid ion storms
imperative thirty two codicil six twenty six all gaharay vehicles that deviate from prescribed flight vectors will be impounded their crews detained and relocated
prax its clear the captain didnt intend to break protocol i expect we can overlook these infractions
sir  yes sir
captain im a reasonable man and youve been cooperative but consider this a reminder you have a long trip through devore space and good friends can be an asset
ill keep it in mind
the devore vessels are out of range
bridge to transporter team youre clear
cargo bay one to ensign kim pattern enhancers are in place
initiating rematerialisation sequence
harry
im routing maximum power to the transporters
got it align the confinement beam to ten angstroms energising
ensign kim the confinement beam is unstable
were trying to correct it now
whats the problem
we are unable to consolidate their patterns theyve been in suspension too long
harry increase power to the imaging scanners
aye captain
its working
nice work harry all our guests are present and accounted for
captain
theyre gone for now
back to your old self again
each time we do this i feel as thought ive left a few molecules behind in your cargo bay
well ill have someone scan the room if itll make you feel better kir we just received an encoded message from the transport vessel
theyve changed the rendezvous point again
im afraid so
did they send the new coordinates
were still waiting for them
captain we may have another problem
ive just treated tuvok and two of the refugees for acute cellular degradation ive repaired most of the damage but unfortunately the effect is cumulative
meaning
if we continue to go into transporter suspension some of us may not survive
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
were receiving another transmission
acknowledged
the new coordinates are here within a mutaraclass nebula two point three six light years from our current position
its definitely out of the way less chance of being discovered but itll take two more days to get there
two days that increases the chances that well run into another inspection
given the frequency of patrols in that area its likely well be stopped at least once
just what the doctor didnt order tuvok seven i want you to lay in a course thatll attract as little attention as possible avoid their colonies space stations tourist attractions if they have any
the ogre of fires castle hovered over the forest like a great black spaceship turning day into night flotter and trevis knew they had to find a way to keep the ogre from burning the forest down but his castle it was higher than the tallest tree it seemed hopeless until they discovered
a door
a door right a mysterious door right in the middle of the
the clearing
you know its its not nice to read peoples thoughts when theyre telling a story
im sorry
its all right
why dont you all go play by yourselves for a while well finish the story later
how are they doing
oh fine more or less they dont understand what all the fuss is about but theyre telepaths captain if the parents are concerned or fearful the children feel it too you did the right thing if we hadnt taken them off that freighter theyd be in a detention centre by now
well were going to make sure that doesnt happen is the kitchen still open or are you just serving stories
for you its always open
im detecting a vessel three hundred thousand kilometres and closing the signature is devore
red alert shields up bridge to captain
more company commander
looks like it
get our visitors to the cargo bay stand by for transporter
suspension
aye captain
neelix
right away come on now were going to go see your parents lets go
report
its a scout ship one pilot no other crew
the vessel hasnt raised shields or charged weapons
if this is another inspection its certainly a different approach
were being hailed
open a channel
captain
inspector
its urgent that we speak
you know the way to my ready room
its all right ensign i submitted to your previous inspections because you outgunned me but i dont see of your warships nearby i have no intention of cooperating
im not here to search voyager
then what do you want inspector
call me kashyk please i never liked that title in fact ive left it behind
did somebody offer you a promotion or are you just having a bad day
im defecting and i need your help
me
ive come to ask asylum safe passage out of devore space before i end up in a detention centre myself
now why would i risk the safety of my crew by harbouring a defector
because of what im about to tell you if you continue on your present course youll be intercepted by a squadron of my warships voyager will be seized your crew imprisoned or worse the nebula is a trap captain to catch vessels smuggling telepaths
youve inspected my ship three times you know we arent smuggling telepaths or anyone else
what i know is that you have twelve refugees aboard right now that you rescued them from a freighter three weeks ago and that youve been concealing them in cargo bay one using your transporters i could have exposed them at any time but i wanted them to escape as much as you do i can still protect them but only if you take me with you my people know about the wormhole its only a matter of time before they find it you have no choice captain im your only hope
this is our rendezvous point inside this nebula unfortunately the transport vessel were supposed to meet is no longer there inspector
a devore warship
one of a dozen positioned throughout the nebula all invisible to our sensors until kashyk showed me how to compensate for their refractive shielding
your soldiers intercepted the transport ship
over a week ago we were the ones who changed the rendezvous coordinates two vessels carrying refugees have already been seized voyager would have been next
all right inspector you helped us avoid this ambush what now
well have to get your passengers to the wormhole on our own these are the schedules and routes of our patrols along with tactical data on our shield and weapons configurations enough to ensure that you avoid another inspection
how long before youre missed
well i took two weeks leave enough time i hope to find the wormhole and get your passengers safely through it and myself as well
your data is useful but it doesnt guarantee our success
no for that youll need my guidance and some luck
ill have to take this up with the brenari see what they think of their new benefactor ill let you know what they decide ill have to insist you remain under guard no hard feelings
no hard feelings
its unusual but not unheard of there have been sympathisers before kashyk may be telling the truth
maybe you should just read his thoughts
devore soldiers undergo years of mental training to prevent that
he might be telling the truth but he also might be using us to find the wormhole
so what do we do throw him in the brig
no we take him up on his offer to help see how it plays out but i want round the clock security we need to watch his every movement that leaves us with our next question how do we find the wormhole
ive given it some thought theres a scientist named torat hes from a nearby system hes rumoured to know more about the wormhole than anyone he might help us for a price
a price
his species power their ships with a fluidic alloy thats difficult to find
perhaps we can replicate it
i have some data on its composition
see what you can do in the meantime well set a course for torats planet try to track him down
nervous
lets just say im not used to other people deciding my fate
until today you were part of a government responsible for persecuting thousands of innocent people why the sudden change of heart
theres nothing sudden about it ive been looking for a way to escape for years voyager was the perfect opportunity
how so
well what are you suggesting i ask a brenari vessel for assistance theyd throw me out an airlock besides youre something of a humanitarian captain ive read your database i know all about starfleet philosophy unless you left those ideals behind in the alpha quadrant
i certainly dont grant asylum to every person i meet especially ones who ransack my ship and terrorise my crew youre asking me to believe youre someone else and thats a leap of faith im not ready to make
youre turning me away
no no im going to give you safe passage to the wormhole in return for your help in getting us there but im also imposing some restrictions youll have your own quarters but limited access to voyagers systems and your whereabouts will be monitored at all times
im used to being surrounded by armed guards makes me feel secure
only this time they answer to me consider them a reminder that voyager is my ship
i dont think anyone could doubt that
hes trying to evade us
hail him again
mister torat doesnt seem too trusting maybe hes been through one inspection too many
no response hes deactivated his communication system
i think i can tap into his computer override the lockout
do it
go away
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager we have no hostile intent
then why are you pursing me
wed just like to ask you
federations imperiums why do you people feel such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organisations
id be glad to discuss that and any other philosophical issue you care to raise if you would just slow down and talk
sorry cant do that im late for a very important conference
this is a waste of time disable his ship
thats what we call overkill inspector ensign can we transport at this range
absolutely energising
welcome aboard your reputation precedes you
twenty centilitres of mercurium isochromate no impurities and this is just a sample weve synthesised enough to power your ship for a year
it doesnt matter ive never heard of this wormhole youre looking for or these socalled refugees
well theyve heard of you
well no doubt my research is famous
think of all the stars you could research once youve infused your propulsion system with this
theres no point in bribing me
hes right he couldnt help us if he wanted to
what do you mean by that
i doubt youd know a wormhole from a dark matter inversion
professor kashyk is another expert ive retained to help us with this matter im afraid hes not as impressed with your work as i am in fact he discouraged me from seeking you out
professor kashyk never heard of you
not surprising considering you toil in scientific obscurity
obscurity ive discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena
not worth the sensors they were recorded on
theres no need to insult the man just because he doesnt know how to find an interspatial flexure
interspatial flexure why didnt you say so in the first place he said wormhole a laymans term that that covers any number of phenomena i am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorised as an interspatial flexure
where is it
actually a better question would be where is it now its really quite interesting the aperture of the phenomenon which i prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex is unfixed it manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations i can give you the last four locations perhaps you can extrapolate the next one if youre as accomplished a scientist as you claim to be
think
im thinking
think harder four wormhole appearances less than twenty light years apart theres no pattern
did you apply a fractal coefficient
didnt work
neutrino flux parameters statistical algorithms
every one i could find this wormhole defies analysis maybe torat was right were just out of our league
its not like you to give up think harder
how do you predict a random occurrence
you follow your instincts captain
counterpoint its in all great music parallel melodies playing against one another weve been looking at the obvious frequency location timing but each of those parameters could have a counterpoint in subspace
if we could run an algorithm based on subspace harmonics it might reveal our pattern
computer run a subspatial transkinetic analysis on the wormhole data
analysis in progress
thisll take a minute
im going to miss this coffee of yours
well i will give you the recipe
thank you
you dont sound too happy about leaving
the brenari arent about to embrace a former inspector ill be feared hated for what i represent
anxiety doesnt become you inspector try to relax a little
i suppose you liked me better in uniform
i havent decided whether i like you at all
we call them the kolyan kolyar infinite spirals
beautiful
as a boy i spent years gazing at these lights this is the last time ill ever see them
we have something similar back on earth the aurora borealis
which you too may never see again i suppose were both refugees in a way
im still counting on getting this ship home
are you sure youll be welcome when you do i came across something else in your database the prime directive
the federations cardinal protocol
it seems you violated it when you rescued these telepaths
well lets just say i usually go with my instincts and sort it out later at the board of inquiry those admirals and i were on a first name basis you know youre risking a lot too why
three months ago my teams were inspecting a plasma refining vessel we found a family of telepaths hiding in one of the extraction tanks there was a child very young shed been inside it for days barely able to breathe when i lifted her out and set her down on the deck she thanked me i sent her to a relocation centre with the others knowing full well what would happen to her after that i could think of nothing else and when i couldnt stand it any longer youre my deliverance captain
analysis complete
it worked it looks like itll appear in about three days less than eight light years from here
the tehara system
is that a problem
theres an automated sensor array between here and tehara
can we go around it
wed never make it in time well have to find a way to avoid detection
lets do it in the morning weve done enough for tonight are you saying goodbye there will be other spirals
theyve just never looked quite so beautiful before could be the company im keeping
or the polarisation axis of the windows
that must be it
how often does this array emit a scanning pulse
every forty seconds
range
ten light years the pulse is designed to track warp fields and impulse signatures if we lower our power output to beneath its detection threshold
we could drift past undetected
its worth a try
well good night
captain why dont you join me ive been looking forward to trying your replicator well im sure that i can come up with something to toast the evening weve accomplished quite a bit today
im afraid that wont be possible i had your replicator taken offline
in case i decided to replicate a weapon
a safety precaution you understand
better than anyone
sleep well
and you
as you were
fifteen seconds
our power output is below the detection threshold
ten seconds five four three two
we werent detected
ten minutes and well be out of range
engineering to bridge weve got a problem
that pulse triggered a variance in the antimatter stream its not much but itll light us up like a beacon when the next pulse hits
options
i cant correct it in time so that leaves shutting down the core
do it
the array has released another pulse
time
twenty eight seconds
get down to the plasma injectors grab a tricorder and monitor the antimatter flow
aye sir
twenty seconds
belanna
almost
there captain im having a problem with the injectors
fifteen seconds ten seconds four three two
weve been detected the arrays transmitting an alert
can we block it
negative
stand down grey mode belanna fire up the core were getting out of here
warships will be on their way but we can still reach the wormhole
if we can find it tom how long to the tehara system
eleven hours at maximum warp
engines are back online
engage
using the model you developed we were able to narrow down the location of the wormholes next appearance to a radius of two hundred thousand kilometres
we cant determine its exact position until we reach the system but we know it will open in roughly six hours
it will remain open for two minutes at most
ive devised a new shield modulation which should protect us against their weapons
youre not planning to fight your way to the wormhole
if i have to
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
long range sensors have picked up two devore warships heading right for us
time to intercept
six hours
take the bridge ill be in engineering kashyk
first well check those shield modifications then well see if we can adjust our phasers to penetrate the devore shields if torpedoes dont work i want an alternative
captain we have to talk but not here
im going back to rejoin the warships its the only way i can guarantee your safety
kashyk
im still a ranking officer i can take command of the inspection teams make sure the refugees arent discovered
you said yourself theyre suspicious return now and you risk being caught
i can keep them off track long enough to get you through that wormhole
its too dangerous
kathryn
you asked for safe passage and i agreed under the condition that you follow my orders
you may stand a chance against one of our warships but not against two if i stay your best chance of escape will be lost
i could confine you to quarters i was planning on asking you to stay with us once we got through the wormhole i wouldnt mind having someone around who appreciates a bit of tchaikovsky now and then
generous but something tells me i wouldnt fit in any better on voyager
well you wouldnt be the first wayward soul weve folded into our ranks your shuttle will be ready for launch within the hour
our course will put us just outside the teharan system by the time the warships arrive
your inspection teams have to be off voyager before that wormhole opens
believe me it will be the quickest inspection on record
ill be on the bridge your efforts have been greatly appreciated
my pleasure
live long and prosper
thank you
begin preignition sequence
ive made one adjustment to your plan after the inspection were going to wait at the wormhole for as long as we can until it begins to collapse
i may not be able to join you this time
try
theyre assuming a tactical formation shields
no we follow protocol bridge to transporter room
status
ready captain pattern cohesion stable
cargo bay one
clear
theyre hailing
on screen
gaharay vessel prepare to be
weve been through three inspections please explain why another is necessary
crew members are instructed to step away from their stations side arms and scanning equipment are to be set aside deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated
all hands this is the captain prepare to be boarded by devore inspections teams give them your usual warm welcome
devore soldiers have materialised on decks fifteen twelve eight four
and one
captain janeway report to your ready room
captain good to see you again
likewise
tchaikovsky of all the selections in your database this remains my favourite
mine too
im afraid prax isnt impressed hes solely concerned with his work arent you prax
as you say sir
yes hes curious why you entered this sector youre aware its restricted
we were planning to study a supernova remnant not far from here
you strayed a full light year from your course in order to observe an astronomical phenomenon
were explorers
yes i remember i also remember warning you about going where you dont belong
exploring can sometimes be hard to resist inspector
well its a romantic notion captain but one i cant allow you to indulge im afraid ill have to ask you to leave our space immediately prax why dont you check on our teams while i reiterate our protocols for captain janeway
do they suspect anything
not yet but our warships have been monitoring voyagers movements for the past few days and mine as well i dont think we have much time the brenari
theyre in transporter suspension
and the wormhole
weve found it its twenty thousand kilometres off our port bow weve determined that a photon torpedo properly calibrated will force open the threshold long enough for voyager to get through
congratulations captain for a while i wasnt sure if even you could find it prax
go to cargo bay one youll find the transporter patterns for more than a dozen telepaths rematerialise them
yes sir
impressive you gave a masterful performance
im the one whos impressed with your selflessness your humanity it made all this so much easier
oh but what about your selflessness that touching story about the little girl was that a fabrication too
oh that incident was real what i didnt tell you was that after wrestling with my ethics i realised that id done the right thing in order to protect my people from a very real threat please i insist
captain
access their forward sensor array you should find neutrino emissions at roughly twenty thousand kilometres off the port bow on screen target two photon torpedoes when the first one detonates the wormhole will open use the second one to destabilise its subspace matrix that will destroy it prax report
ive isolated the biopatterns
fire it should have detonated those arent neutrino emissions theyre antimatter residue signatures theres no wormhole here you created false readings
that is the theme for this evening isnt it
prax do you have the telepaths
i have cargo containers
filled with vegetables
return to the bridge
computer change music selection mahlers symphony number one second movement maybe this will help you relax
inspector we have completed our inventory of the vessel two of their shuttlecraft are missing
they couldnt have gone far why didnt they appear on our long range scans of course adjust their scanners to compensate for refractive shielding
well you gave us the specifications seemed a shame to waste them
weve located the two shuttlecraft range twenty million kilometres
order our ships to pursue maximum speed
were approaching the coordinates im firing the torpedo
kir were safe
the shuttles have disappeared from sensors weve scanned for a wormhole if there was one its gone ill order janeway and her crew removed well confiscate the vessel deliver them to the nearest detention centre
youre dismissed
imperative twelve codicil six requires
to hell with protocol prax do you think either of us will benefit from having this failure on our records as far as youre concerned this incident never occurred make sure your teams share that understanding
well played captain it seems i never did earn your trust
i had to take a few precautions you understand
better than anyone
i never lied to you my offer to take you with us was genuine and it would still stand if youd kept your part of the bargain
for what its worth you made a tempting offer the bridge is yours
turn ninety degrees to the left please  turn ninety degrees to the left please  turn ninety degrees to the right please  about face  try to hold still please
is it going to hurt
of course not a few photons never hurt anybody
we didnt do this last year
thats because last year i didnt realise what an exciting tool my holoimager could be in the pursuit of medical knowledge
is something wrong with me
your health is excellent this is just another way to make sure that it stays excellent
does my mother have to do this
your mother and everybody else on board i made it part of the annual checkup its quite handy really by attuning the resonance spectrum along the subspace band i can take an image of my patients all the way down to the subatomic level
subatomic level i thought you said this wasnt going to hurt
i did and it wont
there see nothing to it
try to hold still please
are you making fun of me
no
itll only take a second to download your images into the medical database if youd like to stay for a moment and see what you look like from the inside out
why not
here we go
handsome fellow
theres some scar tissue along the base of your lower skull computer isolate the occipital plexus magnification five hundred there scarring along the dura mater
from what
an operation computer isolate the cranial meninges magnification one hundred more scarring no doubt about it somebody performed neurosurgery and that somebody was methese microlinear incisions are a dead giveaway i developed that procedure myself
i dont understand i dont remember having an operation
im a little confused as well because i dont remember performing it
who is it
the doctor
come in
ive finished giving the crew their annual physicals but as usual the captain was a noshow
lets get it over with
specific complaints
none hows the crew
in good health for the most part i found a nascent alien retrovirus bouncing between personnel on decks ten and eleven but managed to nip it in the bud and theres been a little more wear and tear on seven of nines cranial infrastructure im going to double her maintenance routine cytometabolism is normal endocrine functions functioning
thats a relief
id like you to drop by sickbay at your earliest convenience ive adjusted my holoimager for deep body scans youre the only member of the crew who hasnt posed for me yet
maybe next week
its a fine instrument really ive already discovered something of a mystery with it apparently i performed a complex neurosurgery on harry kim according to the isotope decay around the scars it was eighteen months ago
i dont remember that
neither do i and neither does the patient i checked my medical entries for that period theres no mention of surgery
could your holoimager have misinterpreted the scans
possibly the computer is doublechecking the data now id also like to run a complete diagnostic on my own programme and have a look at my memory files
belanna and harry are both busy with the plasma relay repairs lets make sure youre next up on the list thank you doctor
hello seven
doctor
im here to ask you a favour
another time
i beg your pardon
looks like im two for two oh the captains acting like shes allergic to me and now my prized pupil wont even give me the time of day
state your request
a little mystery has cropped up evidence that i performed surgery on ensign kim a year and a half ago before you came aboard the trouble is i dont remember it i wanted you to help me run a selfdiagnostic
i will assist you in one hour
fair enough
computer locate the emergency medical hologram
the emh is inactive
activate him
please state the nature of the medical emergency
im here to assist you as i agreed ive run a preliminary diagnostic of your programme your suspicions were correct
i never asked you to run a diagnostic suspicions what are you talking about
you dont recall speaking to me in the astrometrics lab one hour ago
no the last i remember i was completing the yearly physicals
you mentioned a neurosurgery you performed on ensign kim eighteen months ago
computer locate the holoscans i took of ensign kim this morning any operation would show
unavailable that file has been deleted
lets have a look at my programme
a deletion in your short term memory buffer
our chat in astrometrics never got filed thats why i cant remember it if i were given to paranoia id say someone is trying to keep me from finding out what happened eighteen months ago my photo album
doctor
i was quite a shutterbug back then not a day went by when i didnt record an image for posterity lets have a walk down memory lane meet me on holodeck two
computer display all holoimages taken on stardate 50979
those holoimages have been deleted
deleted by whom
unknown
im detecting residual photons in the holobuffer it may be possible to partially reconstruct the images
try
ive restored five images they are degraded but intact
lets see them
the mess hall
do you remember this
no who is that the ensign it seems to be her birthday
ive never seen her before
the ensign again i never went on a shuttle mission with harry kim and certainly not with her and again
ive isolated your memory files from stardate 50979
they werent deleted
no
then why cant i remember them
the programme was rewritten to deny you access to those memories im trying to restore them
hear hear
hear hear
say cheese
cheese
what happened
i was in the mess hall
the files are difficult to localise the memories will be out of sequence
what was that
our sensors are dead
make a wish
theyve stopped
one moment
im going to kill you
ensign i havent seen you in months
price i pay for staying in good health i guess
acetylcholine twenty five microlitres its not helping im getting massive synaptic failure
that doesnt make any sense
this is the last one
say cheese
cheese
call the captain
i dont recognise this species seven
they are unknown to the borg
perhaps these images have been manipulated
no theyre real the image buffer would have shown signs of tampering i have a different theory i believe there was an attack on voyager by this species and all our memories of the event were erased this is the unknown crewman i told you about ensign jetal the question is who was she an alien intruder posing as a starfleet ensign of course its impossible to tell from a photograph but one thing is certain we are in immediate danger
how so
only a few hours ago as i was beginning this investigation someone shut down my programme and eliminated all my memories of the last twenty four hours
an intruder may be on board
run a deck by deck security sweep
understood
report to the astrometrics lab and recalibrate the sensors see if you can detect any cloaked vessels nearby
ill review the medical records of the crew ensign kim may not have been the only one who was injured during the attack
no i want you to deactivate yourself for now well erect a security field around the main computer and encrypt all pathways leading to your programme if someone does try to tamper with you again i want to be ready
captain
its for your own safety doctor thank you for bringing this to my attention
you will keep me informed
absolutely dismissed
computer transfer my programme from the mobile emitter to the sickbay systems
transfer complete
computer duplicate all of my memory files recorded within the last forty eight hours
duplication complete
now im going offline if my programme is altered without my authorisation reactivate me and restore the duplicate memory files interface with the holoimaging device if anybody enters this room commence imaging in five second intervals
acknowledged
computer deactivate emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency hello
restoring memory files restoration complete
believe me i was there
so was i
commander chakotay is correct
oh and how would you know
in my youth i studied many forms of martial art including the sumo of earth i have followed the sport ever since
it was the 77th emperors cup takashi forced karpek out of the circle in less than three seconds i had a fifth row seat
then you must have been ordering sake because takashis knee broke the sand and the referee gave the match to karpek
exactly
if this is another house call itll have to wait as you can see ive got a mutiny on my hands
a mutiny i suppose thats better than a conspiracy
doctor
tell her captain describe how you tampered with my programme how it was you all along
perhaps you should accompany me to sickbay doctor
et tu tuvok youre conspiring against me all of you why
in my ready room
youve been manipulating my programme dont deny it
i dont intend to
but the alien ship the intruder did that attack actually happen
yes you were damaged during the incident
damaged
it caused a conflict in your programming that couldnt be resolved
what kind of conflict
i had no choice but to deny you access to your memories of those events
what kind of conflict
if i told you that i might set the whole thing in motion again
this conflict in my programming
yes
thats not good enough
itll have to be
captain
ive made a command decision for your own benefit and the welfare of this entire crew im not willing to debate it
how would you like it if i operated on you without your consent or without your knowledge
if the operation saved my life i could live with it
i dont believe you youd feel as violated as i do right now
whether you believe me or not is beside the point a year and a half ago the only solution was to rewrite your programme i have to perform that same procedure now
that isnt fair
youre malfunctioning and you need to be repaired return to sickbay and wait for my orders
doctor
whats happening what are you doing
lieutenant torres requires a copy of your most recent memory files including the backups
youre going to rewrite my programme
the captain thinks its for the best im sorry belanna and seven are setting up the procedure right now in the meantime youre to brief mister paris about any experiments youre performing any tests
ill be filling in while your programmes offline
okay so youre running some kind of cell analysis
yes
well lets take a look
what happened eighteen months ago
doc
why wont the captain tell me
she has her reasons
and you agree with her
i was there and yes i agree with her
come in are you having a little trouble regenerating
my alcove is functioning properly i am having trouble with the nature of individuality
theres a time and a place for philosophical discussion two in the morning in my quarters isnt one of them but ill tell you what meet me in the mess hall tomorrow
tomorrow will be too late well have already rewritten the doctors programme by then
and violated his rights as an individual
precisely
if youve come to act as my conscience youre a little late i considered these issues eighteen months ago as i did again this morning i came to the same conclusion
your conclusion is wrong
coffee black  lukewarm now ive told that replicator a dozen times about the temperature of my coffee it just doesnt seem to want to listen almost as if its got a mind of its own but it doesnt a replicator operates through a series of electronic pathways that allow it to receive instructions and take appropriate action and there you go a cup of coffee a bowl of soup a plasma conduit whatever we tell it to do as difficult as it is to accept the doctor is more like that replicator than he is like us
he would disagree
im sure he would but i cant let that change my decision i learned that the hard way when his programme almost selfdestructed i wont take that risk again
the risk isnt yours to take
if one of my crew chose to put a phaser to his own head should i let him
it would depend on the situation
it always depends on the situation seven but we can debate philosophy another time
when you separated me from the collective i was an unknown risk to your crew yet you kept me on board you allowed me to evolve into an individual
youre a human being hes a hologram
and you allowed that hologram to evolve as well to exceed his original programming and yet now you choose to abandon him
objection noted good night
it is unsettling you say that i am a human being and yet i am also borg part of me not unlike your replicator not unlike the doctor will you one day choose to abandon me as well i have always looked to you as my example my guide to humanity perhaps ive been mistaken good night
id like to think i made my decision eighteen months ago for all the right reasons the truth is my own biases about what you are had just as much to do with it at the very least you deserve to know exactly what happened if youre willing
im ready
youre standing on my foot
i am not
shush
if you ask me they should have just locked the turbolift and thrown away
neelix the powers down jetal to torres
er go ahead ensign or should i say
surprise
im going to kill you
i want you to go along on a few of the shuttle surveys if i can talk you into it
another away mission certainly im flattered
i guess the birthday girl and i get the pleasure of your company doc
you launch at nineteen hundred hours shuttlebay one
hello doctor
ensign jetal i havent seen you in months
the price i pay for staying in good health
so keeping busy down on deck eleven
too busy were modifying one of the shuttles making it more manoeuvrable and more cool
i see youve been working with mister paris my condolences
i thought i picked up a slight distortion in subspace but its not there any more
nothing on long range sensors but a few hydrogen atoms
candid shot
try to look natural
oh at least its my good side
lets get one of the group
this is the last one
say cheese
cheese
doctor i have a shuttle to fly
ah yes
what was that
our sensors are dead
powers being drained shields and weapons are offline
how
doctor to voyager mayday were under attack ive got wounded mayday
acknowledged doctor set navigational controls to return to voyager
commander can you hear me
doctor please respond
hello computer engage autonavigation lay in a course for voyager full impulse
doctor
stay calm that weapon carried quite a punch
is she okay
shes unconscious
voyager
weve lost contact i sent that alien back to his ship you think theyd be grateful
you should have beamed him into space
im not in the business of killing people ensign synaptic shock but there was no neural damage mister kim i dont understand no
doctor stand by for transport
beam us directly to sickbay
prepare these people for surgery
here what happened
we were fired on theres something wrong with their nervous systems weve got to stabilise their synapses get me a choline compound
which choline compound
it doesnt matter just make sure its a pure base her spinal cords deteriorating  same rate of collapse
acetylcholine twenty five microlitres its not helping im reading massive synaptic failure
this doesnt make any sense
paris to engineering transfer all available power to sickbay
acknowledged
some kind of plasmic energy is arcing between their neural membranes that weapon it was designed to do this
to leave a residual charge in the victims body
an energy pulse that remains in the neural membranes working its way up the spinal cord to the brain theyll be dead in minutes if we dont find a way to stop it ive got to protect their brain functions
his neocortex is failing
a spinal shunt ill isolate the spinal cord from the brain stem until i can repair the cellular damage but i dont have time to perform the procedure on both of them
then talk me through it well do them together
its too complex
then make a choice before we lose them both
subdermal scalpel bioelectric field generator
his vital signs are stabilising its working
cellular regenerator his neural membranes are reestablishing themselves good
the attack how did it end were there more casualties
we exchanged fire for another few minutes then the aliens withdrew there was only one casualty ensign jetal
i dont mean to seem unfeeling but im programmed to accept the loss of a patient with professional detachment
we are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead ensign ahni jetal her intelligence and her charm have made our long journey home seem not quite so long as she continues on a journey of her own we will keep her in our hearts and in our memories
were low on synthetic antigens and im sorry to report many of the medicinal plants youve collected over the past several months were destroyed as well
i have some herbs in storage you might be able to use
been holding out on me
no i was keeping them around just in case
good planning
as for the antigens ill have to start replicating them in batches which do you want first
decisions decisions how do you make a decision mister neelix in general i mean
i guess i weigh the alternatives and try to decide which is best
which is best how do you determine that
i never thought about it really
well maybe you should think about it i mean
i guess every situation is a little different
for me its rather simple while im faced with a decision my programme calculates the variables and i take action for example what could be simpler than a triage situation in sickbay two patients for example both injured for example both in imminent danger of dying calculate the variables my programme needs to ascertain which patient has the greater chance of survival and thats the one i treat
simple but what if they have an equal chance of survival what then hmm flip a coin pick a card
doctor
oh im all right im a hologram i dont get injured i dont feel pain i dont die unlike some people i could tell you about for example two patients both injured both in imminent danger of dont touch me im a hologram photonic energy dont waste your time
neelix to security send a team to the mess hall please
a whole team mister neelix throwing a little party are we why i attended a party just recently a birthday party for a very nice young woman i made a decision there too several of them in fact when i came through the door do i turn right or do i turn left as i recall i decided on the latter then what should i see before me but the hors doeuvre tray and another decision do i take a canapé or refuse oh thats an easy one im a hologram i dont eat
somethings wrong with him
dont you know its rude to refer to somebody in the third person you had a choice mister neelix should i do something rude or not do something rude
doctor we must return to sickbay
why should i what if i dont want to return to sickbay what if i decide not to return to sickbay no i dont choose this leave me alone let me go why did she have to die why did i kill her why did i decide to kill her why somebody tell me why
it was downhill from there you developed a feedback loop between your ethical and cognitive subroutines you were having the same thoughts over and over again we couldnt stop it
our only option was to erase your memories of those events
you were right i didnt deserve to keep those memories not after what i did
you were performing your duty
two patients which do i kill
doctor
doctor hardly a doctor retains his objectivity i didnt do that did i two patients equal chances of survival and i chose the one i was closer to i chose my friend thats not in my programming thats not what i was designed to do go ahead reprogramme me ill lend you a hand lets start with this very day this hour this second
computer deactivate the emh
here we go again captain
its as though theres a battle being fought inside him between his original programming and what hes become our solution was to end that battle what if we were wrong
weve seen what happens to him in fact weve seen it twice
still we allowed him to evolve and at the first sign of trouble we gave him a soul belanna do we have the right to take it away now
we gave him personality subroutines id hardly call that a soul
captain
im having trouble with the nature of individuality
you require a philosophical discussion
theres a time and a place for it this is one of them after i freed you from the collective you were transformed its been a difficult process was it worth it
i had no choice
if i could change what happened erase what you did to me would i no
the more i think about it the more i realise theres nothing i couldve done differently
what do you mean
the primordial atom burst sending out its radiation setting everything in motion one particle collides with another gases expand planets contract and before you know it weve got starships and holodecks and chicken soup in fact you cant help but have starships and holodecks and chicken soup because it was all determined twenty billion years ago
there is a certain logic to your logic progress
im not sure if hes making any sense of this experience or if his programmes just running in circles
youve been here for sixteen hours let me continue while you rest
ill be all right go back to the bridge
how can you read at a time like this
it helps me think
think what do you need to think about
you this book is relevant to your situation
oh what is it
poetry written on earth a thousand years ago la vita nuova
la vita nuova the new life ha tell that to ensign jetal actually i killed her countless times
what do you mean
causality probability for every action theres an infinite number of reactions and in each one of them i killed her or did i too many possibilities too many pathways for my programme to follow impossible to choose still i cant live with the knowledge of what ive done i cant
captain captain
oh sorry
how could you sleep at a time like this
its been a long day you were saying
whats wrong
nothing
youre ill
i have a headache
fever you have a fever
ill live
medical emergency
doctor
someones got to treat you immediately call mister paris youve got to get to sickbay
doctor im a little busy right now helping a friend
i ill be all right go sleep please ill still be here in the morning
are you sure
yes please i dont want to be responsible for any more suffering
good night if you need anything
ill call thank you captain
in that book which is my memory on the first page of the chapter that is the day when i first met you appear the words  here begins a new life
the adventures of captain proton chapter eighteen bride of chaotica the evil doctor chaotica kidnaps constance goodheart and plans to sacrifice her to arachnia queen of the spider people  captain proton travels millions of miles to planet x where he will invade the fortress of doom chaotica fires his fiendish death ray certain death for proton as his rocket ship bursts into flames
we didnt burst into flames in the last chapter why are these recaps always so inaccurate
well they brought people back to the theatres
cliffhangers
the lost art of hyperbole you ready
aye captain
lets get this show on the road computer begin chapter eighteen
were receiving a transmission its chaotica
imagising
captain proton surrender
not a chance release miss goodheart and well be on our way
im afraid your secretary has already been promised to queen arachnia as a supreme sacrifice
youll never get away with this
oh ho ho ho but i shall you escaped from my death ray once but you wont survive this
hes charging the weapon
brace for impact
direct hit we lost both engines
steering jets are on the fritz
were going down
the landing gear is jammed hang on
opening hatch
welcome to planet x
whats the plan
this is the part where we defeat chaoticas soldiers steal their uniforms and make our way through the underground caverns
hey i thought you said there were slave girls in this chapter
after we infiltrate the fortress of doom well free chaoticas harem lets go
im right behind you
planet x looks kind of familiar what was the last place we went to
the mines of mercury
theyre identical
sets were expensive at least theres no erupting volcano this time ah behold the fortress of doom
and how are we supposed to get up there
i told you the un
derground caverns
right
i thought you said there was no volcano
i did
er tom
definitely not chaotica
computer end programme
unable to comply holodeck controls are offline
paris to bridge bridge respond
we need to find the manual overrides
theres an access port in the rocket ship come on
report
weve dropped out of warp were at a dead stop
cause
unknown engines are operational
im reading gravimetric forces around the ship theyre disrupting our power flow
control systems are going offline i no longer have access to communications deflector weapons
scan for vessels tractor beams anything that might explain whats holding us here
halt in the name of chaotica proton
buddy of yours
surprised you thought i perished in the den of crocodiles
we dont have time for this
i survived clinging to the thought that i would one day
i believe i have an explanation sensors show that weve entered a layer of subspace its disrupting our warp field
do we have impulse
yes
engage at full
no change in our position
route all available power to the engines
were not moving
the impulse reactors running hot were heading for an overload
give it all shes got full thrusters
no effect reactors are critical
abort increase power to the structural integrity field we may be here awhile
its no use i cant disengage the programme
well you better think of something fast proton a second distortion just appeared whatever they are theyre getting bigger
hold on ive got access to the transporter im going to try a site to site
theres a third one
ive run a transspectral analysis the area between space and subspace is unstable throughout this region
basically weve run aground on a subspace sandbar ive tried realigning the warp field reversing hull polarity
maybe we should just get out and push
the gravimetric forces are disrupting our control systems
as long as were trapped here we wont have access to the computer core tactical holodecks and all but six replicators
what about those distortions on the holodeck whats the connection
they appear to be random energy fluctuations i dont believe they post a threat
lets keep an eye on them anyway and evacuate that deck just to be safe a few years back when i was a science officer on the albatani we tried to navigate a dense protonebula it stopped us dead in our tracks for three days we attempted to force our way out until we realised we were trying too hard
captain
every time we engaged the engines we were increasing the resistance of the nebulas particle field we may be facing a similar situation
our own warp field may be increasing the gravimetric forces if we power down the core and use minimal thrusters we might be able to break free
you took the words right out of my mouth
your plan could work
now that we have your blessing
lets give it a try
halt in the name of chaotica
we intend no harm
seize them lower the drawbridge we are bringing prisoners
yes yes yes lonzak what do you want
your majesty
wheres proton
he er escaped
fool you will pay for your incompetence seize him
surrender
but majesty i have brought prisoners
more earthlings
no they claim theyre from another dimension
the fifth dimension bring them to me
identify yourself
you insult me i am chaotica ruler of the cosmos
kneel before his majesty i said kneel
you have invaded my planet why
to contact other photonic lifeforms to learn from them
are you alone or are you the vanguard of an invading army
we are explorers
i am growing weary of this charade your armies will be no match for my space force well crush you like insects
they are hostile this contact should be terminated
indeed lonzak execute them
coward hell learn theres no escape from chaotica gather my space force power the death ray
at once majesty
take miss goodheart to arachnia invite the queen to join me in battle together we will rain destruction on the fifth dimension
look on the bright side theres only three meals a day
coffee black
sorry captain we lost two more replicators this morning
listen to me very carefully because im only going to say this once coffee black
yes maam coffee black while ive got your attention there are
coffee first now whats the problem
its a its a delicate matter
i dont have time to play twenty questions neelix
replicators arent the only systems of convenience offline weve only got four functioning lavatories for a ship of a hundred and fifty people
i see
needless to say lines are beginning to form if we dont get unstuck soon we may have a serious problem on our hands especially with the bolians all but three sonic showers are offline too in another couple of days
i get the idea
captain to the bridge
on my way im going to leave these problems in your capable hands
yes maam i was thinking if we drew up a schedule
whatever it takes
status
the warp core has been powered down the thrusters at standby
okay lets give it a try take us out tom nice and slow
were moving two metres per second three metres
steady
nine metres ten
increase power to the thrusters by fifty percent
were approaching the subspace boundary
twenty five metres per second wait a minute were slowing down nineteen metres per second eighteen
captain im reading power surges
source
unknown but they look like weapon signatures
im not reading any other ships in the area
weve stopped
ive localised the weapons fire its emanating from within the ship deck six holodeck two
whos still on that deck
no one no lifesigns
theres a programme running its captain proton
proton
can you shut it down
negative control systems still malfunctioning
tuvok get down there and find out whats happening well join him
yes maam
it appears that a battle took place
believe me it wasnt like this when i left i must have missed a few chapters
holodeck programmes dont normally run by themselves
no kidding
shes dead
who is she
constance goodheart my secretary this doesnt make sense she isnt supposed to die shes one of the good guys
im sure you two were very close but she is a holodeck character
a character from 1930s hollywood the good guys never get killed somethings wrong here
invaders from the fifth dimension
satans robot
naturally
queen arachnia is on her way invaders from the fifth dimension destroy proton
give me a hand if we can repair his vocaliser he might be able to tell us whats been going on it looks like he burned out a resister
a what
thats a few centuries before duotronic circuitry
i see how do you propose we repair him
well first of all ive gotta remove this damaged tube no problem just a few crossed wires
your knowledge of this technology is most impressive
oh thanks got it
intruders intruders intruders intruder alert intruder alert
tell us what happened
invaders from the fifth dimension invaders from the fifth dimension
hey calm down
how did these invaders get here
a portal
a fifth dimension theres not supposed to be alien invaders in this story thats in captain proton versus the cosmic creature
invaders from the fifth dimension
those subspace distortions take us to this portal
there
photonic charges the same signatures as the weapons fire we detected
the fifth dimension
we must report this to the captain
wait i want to check my rocket ship first
excuse me
its got sensors sort of maybe they can tell us something voyagers sensors cant
ive established a visual link with the holodeck the attack appears to be originating from subspace
can you tell where its coming from
no
what was that
chaoticas death ray
excuse me
lets see if we can get a look inside his fortress find out what hes up to
full power to the death ray arachnia queen of the spider people you have not responded to my summons dont
i dont get it chaotica was supposed to be fighting earth in this chapter
apparently hes found a new enemy
the fifth dimension
it seems your infantile scenario now poses a security risk
it was just supposed to be a little harmless entertainment
entertainment another frivolous human endeavour
these are your sensor readings
telegram its a message to captain proton from the president of earth intercepted communications between doctor chaotica and arachnia stop chaotica at war with aliens from fifth dimension stop must strike now to disable death ray
stop please summarise the message
well it looks like chaotica has captured a couple of aliens from the fifth dimension
an alternate universe
could be maybe they wandered into the holodeck through one of those distortions
to participate in a game
intruder
i assume theres no locking mechanism on the hatch
it was a simpler time
is he part of the programme
i dont recognise him
invaders
quiet look theres been a misunderstanding im ensign paris from the starship voyager this is lieutenant tuvok
you have killed fifty three of my people
we havent killed anyone
ensign everything you see here is a simulation none of its real
simulation
a photonicallybased projection
all life is photonic
we are not we are biochemical lifeforms
im not familiar with biochemical
we are carbon based we live aboard a starship i believe we have become trapped in a region of space that intersects your own
weve detected no starship only this planet
this planet isnt real as i told you its part of a simulation
maybe we can help you adjust your sensors
you dont register as a lifeform you are the illusion
were as real as you are listen
citizen of the fifth dimension you will be destroyed you
wait wait
damage damage require maintenance help help help
let me get this straight transdimensional aliens have mistaken your captain proton simulation for reality
yes maam
and now an armed conflict has broken out between these aliens and chaoticas holographic army
yes maam his army of evil
and will someone please explain why we havent simply shut down the holodeck
weve tried the controls are still offline
were going to have to get through to these aliens somehow and explain that theyre fighting shadows
weve tried but they dont believe us they think that were not real they cant detect voyager so every time they scan us we seem as artificial to them as holographic characters do to us
that explains why they havent answered our hails
the doctor is photonic he may be able to persuade them
its worth a try brief him
in the meantime i think we should let the programme play out
youre not suggesting we wait until this chaotica defeats the aliens
no no im suggesting that we help the aliens to defeat chaotica they think that hes leading some kind of hostile invasion force once that threat is gone its a good bet that they will leave and close up their portals
how do you propose to defeat chaotica
well hes been attacking the aliens with his death ray
its a shame we dont have one
forget about what its called tuvok in the world of captain proton its the most powerful weapon that there is and because its photonic its lethal to these aliens now in chapter eighteen captain proton disables this weapon just before chaotica can use it to destroy earth
and you think that proton namely you of course could still do that
well wed have to knock out the lightning shield first
a forcefield
yeah now youre catching on the destructo beam on my rocket ship can disable the death ray but only if someone gets inside the fortress of doom and can shut down the lightning shield
and whos supposed to do that
arachnia queen of the spider people
charming
chaotica thinks so in the story hes in love with her hes been trying to form an alliance since chapter three shes the only one that he trusts the only one that can get close enough to disable the lightning shield somebody is going to have to take on her character
whod you have in mind oh no
its the role of a lifetime
captain need i remind you that we have exhausted all other possibilities of escaping this layer of subspace
until we can eliminate those distortions were trapped
think of it as starfleets first encounter with planet x
thanks
captain it wont be so bad i can explain to you what you can expect i can tell you
all right all right im a size four
whats the emergency
ive been enlisted im supposed to make contact with our photonic friends from the fifth dimension and convince them to call off their attack
congratulations why do you need me
its an undercover mission ill need a bit of cosmetic surgery these are the parameters for my new costume
what are you going as the emperor of the universe
well ive been forced to scale back my role in the interest of credibility ill be president of earth i must say the idea of an entire universe populated by photonic beings is rather appealing
well if your mission fails you could be taking up permanent residence
kim to sickbay report to holodeck two doctor
youre all set the new parameters will activate as soon as you enter the holodeck
thank you
break a leg
so all i have to do is find the controls of this death ray and deactivate it
its not as simple as it sounds now chaotica might be a 1930s villain but hes very clever itd help if you knew some of the rules
im listening
all right well first of all hes a megalomaniac so its a good idea to appeal to his ego
right
and er use grandiose language he likes to be called sire and it helps to say things like the clever fiendishness of your evil plan is brilliant
deck four
now remember its ray gun not phaser imagiser not viewscreen earthlings not terrans
got it
and another thing these villains always have a trick up their sleeve trapdoors secret weapons
its the holodeck i cant be hurt by weapons
that doesnt mean you cant be restrained or thrown into the dungeon of pain
noted
now as soon as you get the death ray shut down call me in my rocket ship and give me the signal to fire
youll have to use chaoticas broadcast microphone
this is how youve been spending your free time
well ive been studying how past generations viewed the future
and
well it didnt work out quite as black and white as they imagined now specifications for arachnias costume one more thing if you have trouble with chaotica or you cant get to the death ray you can always uncork the pheromones
i beg your pardon
chapter sixteen spell of the spider arachnia sends chaotica a vial of her irresistible potion now whenever he gets a whiff hes under her spell
i get the picture
yeah well my point is that these pheromones seem to throw chaotica for a loop well it works in chapter sixteen anyway now the vial is sitting on a small pedestal next to the throne
ill keep an eye out
okay
thanks for the briefing
ill see you at the fortress of doom and remember youre the queen
sire three more of our space ships have been destroyed
argh full power to the death ray
citizens of the fifth dimension your feeble attacks are nothing but pinpricks to me surrender now and i will be merciful
were receiving a transmission
they are surrendering
no its queen arachnia she wishes to cross the drawbridge
what are you waiting for show her in
i present her royal highness arachnia
ahh at last at last my queen
this is an historic occasion kindred souls meet at last
its an honour to be in your presence majesty ive always admired your clever fiendishness
ah your taste is exceeded only by your beauty
this must be your death ray
that my dear is the cradle of persuasion its fully equipped brain probe pain modulator
impressive its good you have the lightning shield to protect your equipment
yes as long as its electrified i am invincible but my greatest achievement is there behold the death ray
oh it looks like a formidable weapon
the most powerful in the cosmos there is so much more i want to show you my throne for example the seat of my empire
ah i see youve kept my pheromones i didnt realise you were the sentimental type
your perfume inspires me
would you mind
oh please
somehow i feel comfortable here
join me and you will have your own chair one adorned with the most precious jewels and the softest silk
your majesty seems overly concerned with romantic matters when theres a battle to be won that is why you asked me here
of course my dear forgive me its just that the air itself seems to vibrate in your presence
we cant be slaves to our passion not when your empire is threatened i have assembled my fleet of spider ships however the lightning shield prevents them from approaching your fortress
well send them directly into battle alongside my space force
my soldiers wish to pay homage to you
gratifying of course if i lower the shield my fortress will be defenceless even an ally might choose such a moment to seize my throne
you dont trust me
there is a way you could convince me of your loyalty
oh
ill lower my lightning shield but first you must become my queen gather my courtiers prepare for the ceremony
and dont forget to deactivate the lightning shield so my subjects may witness the blessed event
very well do as she says once her guests have arrived
yes sire
and so my dear the day you have always dreamed of has arrived the day you become bride of chaotica
welcome
you are photonic
guilty as charged
you signalled me across the threshold how
i believe you dropped your calling card i return it to you as a sign of good faith
identify yourself
i am the president of earth
earth
a planet some distance from here ive come on a mission of peace
elaborate
your people and the people of earth have a common enemy
chaotica
the one and only
he threatens to invade our realm destroy our people
join the club chaotica has designs on earth too but weve withstood countless attacks all thanks to one man captain proton
captain proton
defender of the universe scourge of intergalactic evil and a competent medic to boot but dont say i said so even as we speak hes preparing to destroy chaoticas death ray but he needs your help
explain
your weapons pose a threat to protons rocket ship you must cease firing while he mounts his attack once chaoticas death ray is destroyed you can return to your realm confident that youll never hear from him again
captain proton may proceed
on behalf of the citizens of earth i thank you
space drive
check
check
destructo beam
check
check
if i could access holodeck controls the first thing id do is delete this guy
delete this guy
as a matter of fact as soon as this is all over i think im going to delete the whole programme
what about your historical study
class dismissed no more robots no more mad scientists no more death rays i am retiring my rocket pack harry someone else can save the universe from now on
the final chapter huh
the end
isnt anyone going to sing hail to the chief
mister president howd it go
my performance was unimpeachable
he agreed
lets just say im considering running for office when we get back to earth
all right then lets get this thing in the air and hope captain janeway is giving a command performance
queen arachnia
dont tell me my wedding ring
doctor chaoticas wedding ring you will present it to him at the end of the ceremony
your majesty perhaps we should lower the lightning shield in anticipation of my guests
why this preoccupation with the shield
oh forgive me its just that as a fellow ruler of the cosmos i often have to do things myself
ah because of the incompetence of your inferiors no doubt
something like that
oh arachnia my love my life how well you understand our plight if it werent beneath my dignity i i would weep how ive longed for someone who would understand
we have a saying on arachnia its lonely at the top
no longer my dear
majesty proton is preparing to attack
target his rocket ship
you have betrayed me you are in league with proton impetuous harlot
tell me how to deactivate the lightning shield or ill show you just how impetuous i can be
what are you waiting for you great lummox kill her
ha youre no match for arachnia now tell me how to shut down the shield
the confinement rings
oh dont worry i wouldnt kill my bride not until after our wedding night reactivate the death ray destroy proton
weve been hit
well i guess the captain ran into some trouble
were not going down without a fight doc activate the destructo beam
the what
big button in the middle of that panel
destructo beam
the other panel
the other panel
destructo beam activated
we just dropped out of range were losing altitude
report
the alien weapons fire is increasing its causing the distortions to grow larger were being pulled deeper into subspace
invaders invaders
er incoming
protons ship is damaged but still airborne
not for long fire at will
lonzak
man the lightning shield
arachnia
lonzak quickly lonzak no time for dawdling
your beauty is maddening entangle me in your web
let me out of here and ill do all that and more
at once my queen
back to your station
idiot
deactivate the shield now
such passion such strength together we could conquer the universe end this madness and you may yet live to be my bride
the shield
i dont know how to tell you this  but the weddings off arachnia to proton arachnia to proton do you read me
arachnia to proton
im reading you
the lightning shield is down
acknowledged harry target the death ray doc fire the destructo beam on my mark ready now
the distortions are closing
were realigning with normal space
helm full impulse
bridge to janeway
go ahead
and theyve closed the distortions weve cleared the subspace layer
secure all systems and organise damage repair teams
understood were preparing to shut down the holodeck
chakotay give me a minute
i was about to say captain proton to the rescue but i see you have everything under control
im the queen remember
arachnia death as you know it has no hold on me my defeat is but a temporary setback i shall return to seek my revenge
he doesnt give up does he
they never do
our love was not meant to be my queen but be warned you have not seen the last of  chaotica
the end of a twisted madman
and youre going to miss him
a little
the kolutshan a cornerstone of our beliefs
infinite diversity in infinite combinations i know all about vulcan philosophies
why have you come here
i was sent against my will
then i suggest you leave
im not a prisoner
only of your emotions or so i have been told
my emotions free me
i see its regrettable that i wont be able to teach you
where should i go
are you seeking my counsel
i cant return home my fathers banished me
your school
they revoked my seat
why
because i refused to deny myself passion the way you and men like my father do
you reject logic
if i was meant to deny feelings why was i born with them wheres the logic in that
hidden for you to find or in plain sight for you to ignore
you speak in riddles because the truth frightens you
youre right it does frighten me you are surprised to hear a vulcan master admit to having emotions
yes
emotions can be a powerful tool to deny their existence is illogical but you must learn to control them
why
you wish to be taught
i would question everything you say
you would not be a worthy pupil otherwise let us begin sit down tuvok
tu be veg
er sorry
sen neeba sen
either the universal translators offline or i hit my head harder than i thought
ruk
all right take it easy all right all right take it easy
fita
this listen i really need this
fita ur neeto
okay okay
first day in town and ive already been mugged
im commander tuvok of the starship voyager tuvok
tuwok
yes and you
noss
noss
well go to my vessel i see youve already been there
mayday mayday paris to voyager respond oh come on
her name is noss she was attacked by two humanoid males
sure she didnt attack them
they were attempting to rob her
seems to be a local pastime
she requires medical attention
id love to help but somebody stole our medkits
food whats the status of the shuttle
fractures throughout the hull environmental systems down impulse engines are beyond repair told you we should have brought the delta flyer
communications appear to be functional
it wont do us any good every time i transmit a signal it gets bounced back by the distortion field that pulled us down here it looks like we fell into some kind of gravity well as far as i can tell this planet is a part of an entire solar system that is stuck in a pocket of subspace
fascinating
yeah well scientific interest aside i dont see any easy way out
no doubt voyager has begun a rescue effort the doctor
his mobile emitter was damaged during the crash with a little luck i might be able to repair it and bring him back online
make it your top priority
gren gren
what is it
thirteen humanoids approaching the same species that attacked her gather as many supplies as you can carry were leaving
you really think its smart to abandon the shuttle
noss appears to have survived here for some time its logical to assume she has access to a more secure shelter
nemok alen alen
whatever you say
ai kan
doesnt look like this birds gonna fly either
minimal power and life support but the ship is protected by a forcefield
that explains how shes been able to survive here anything resembling an engine
im detecting engine debris two kilometres away it is of the same configuration as this vessel
great weve got two unusable ships and the only way voyager is going to detect our distress call is if they crash land right on top of us
progress
the optronic relays took heavy damage im bypassing the primary circuits come on doc i know youre in there
im guessing we hit a snag
an accurate assumption
rev den ut ut rev
tun sank ton rev ut teem sayd
you speak her language
a universal translator was written into my programme
ask her how long shes been here if she knows a way to get back through that sinkhole
deen ya tone ud la kar padeen nefka minruk
laka heen zen nik lurka irut tota maez bemrukaya
whatd she say
she said shes been here fourteen seasons and in that time shes seen many ships come down but shes never seen one go back up again
come back you little bloodsucker
i dont know whats worse catching them or eating them
no poison
well hey may not be poisonous but they give me the creeps maybe i should have left the hunting to you and tuvok
let me yah
looks delicious
shut down my programme why
our resources are severely limited we may need your mobile emitter as a source of power
im a doctor not a battery
until were rescued or you are needed for an emergency i must insist that you remain offline
make way for the mighty hunters
if mister paris hunting ability is any indication maybe we should take him offline
thanks for the vote of confidence doc
the hunt was good
impressive
voyager has fifteen decks a crew of one hundred fifty two warp and impulse engines
i want to see
someday perhaps
tell me about you there
i am the chief tactical officer
what else
can you be more specific
your duties where you sleep what you eat music friends
why is any of that relevant
because it is you
when i first met her she wouldnt even look at me but she warmed up after oh three years
the longest flirtation in starfleet history
no kidding
she sounds fascinating
i just hope i see her again
you must really baiya jouton
love her very much
yeah
more spiders
oh no thank you threes my limit
i will assist you
well i suppose its time i shut down my programme
good night doc
she likes you
she has been alone for many years she appreciates our company
no i mean she likes you
what are you implying
oh come on tuvok you may be cold but youre not blind
need i remind you that i am married
your wife is fifty thousand light years away in a different layer of space the chances of you ever seeing her again are practically nonexistent
excuse me
what are you doing
im recalibrating the distress beacon
listen what i said in there about your wife im sorry i didnt mean to hurt your feelings
i have no feelings for you to hurt
i think you do you work hard to bury them but theyre there and even if theyre not this is home now you might as well accept it and try to find as much happiness as you can listen you have a chance to make a decent life for yourself here
there is still a possibility that voyager will rescue us you may see lieutenant torres again
if i didnt know you better id say you were trying to cheer me up tuvok
is there a point to your pessimism
its not pessimism its practicality you of all people should understand that look ive never met your wife but if shes half a logical as you are i bet you shed tell you the same thing
your attempt to play matchmaker is misguided i am not experiencing pon farr
what difference does it make you obviously care about noss if you wont admit it to me at least admit it to yourself
i respect her ability to survive
its more than that ive seen the way you look at her
what way is that
like someone who wishes he wasnt vulcan
im sorry i was born vulcan
bilak par selfpity
are you cataloguing my emotions
what is the source of your selfpity
isnt it obvious if i werent vulcan i wouldnt be here now going through this pointless ritual
you see only what is in front of you you must learn to see behind you
another riddle i have no eyes to see behind me
you have the eyes of memory the knowledge of why you are here and why you have lost control tell me your story
my fathers already explained it
i wish to hear it from you
her names jara her fathers a terrelian diplomat shes been granted a seat at my school
and you have developed an emotional attraction toward her
yes
you love her
yes
does she love you
no shes jara doesnt return my feelings
what if i were to say that i received a letter from your father telling me that jara is in love with one of your fellow students
thats a lie who is it
jealousy
ill challenge him
that would be illogical because i have received no such letter
youre trying to trick me
no im trying to help you to understand shonhalock love is the most dangerous emotion of all it produces many other emotions jealousy shame rage grief you must learn to suppress them all otherwise they will consume you i can sense emotions building inside you like a gathering storm if we begin now we may be able to stop them
im not detecting any debris
maybe the shuttle was tractored or transported somewhere
scan the region look for plasma emissions or em displacements anything that might indicate another ship
nothing out of the ordinary hydrogen helium space dust
there has to be something out there shuttles dont just vanish into thin air
its a gravimetric shear
source
unknown
red alert helm full ahead
were caught in some kind of subspace sinkhole its pulling us in
the gravimetric shear is increasing
go to warp
i cant establish a field
then we need more power to the impulse engines
that wont be enough weve got to find a way to counter the gravitational pull
belanna vent three million isodynes of plasma from the nacelles chakotay reverse shield polarity
were clear
move us away stand down red alert secure all stations id say we have a pretty good idea what happened to that shuttle
the anomaly is approximately six hundred metres in diameter
its out of phase with normal space even after recalibrating the sensors it barely registers
the distortion circumscribes a subspace zone that includes a type g sun and three planets
any sign of the shuttle
no
id say its time to break out the multispatial probe
agreed what the hell was that
a vessel approaching off the port bow theyve locked on a tractor beam
captain to the bridge
im only going to say this one more time disengage your tractor beam sir
you were in danger of being pulled into the distortion you should show a little gratitude
we appreciate your help but we didnt ask for captain this is mister yost
supervisor yost renovation team nova
kathryn janeway of the starship voyager
until tomorrow i suggest you stay at least two million kilometres from the distortion
what happens tomorrow
the rift will be closed by then
some of our crew are trapped inside
i am sorry we have lost eleven ships to the distortion over the last year it must be sealed
what about your people
even if there were survivors theres no way to rescue them the best we can do is to prevent others from being trapped
we cant abandon our crew if you could delay your mission
my orders are to seal the rift by this time tomorrow if you want to attempt a rescue between now and then the risk is yours to take but i wouldnt advise it
launch the probe
aye captain
work with belanna and seven to enhance the sensors do whatever you can to find tom and tuvok ill be looking for a way to counter those gravitational forces
come in ive been brushing up on sinkholes quantum singularities
any luck
all the data leads me to the same conclusion theyre monodirectional phenomena what goes in doesnt come out
well if its any consolation somethings coming out of that anomaly
what is it
telemetry from our probe weve located the shuttles distress beacon on a classd planet
vulcan human alien lifesigns at least we know theyre alive
keep reading
theres astronomical data here covering a three month period how is that possible
there seems to be some sort of temporal differential
how big a differential
its difficult to say but every hour that passes for us could mean weeks even months for tom and tuvok
months trying to survive in a classd environment more than likely theyve assumed that we left them behind long ago
ready for the bad news
youre kidding
the gravitational stress is increasing seven believes the sinkhole is on the verge of collapse when it does everything inside will be crushed
noss
medical tricorder
we were ambushed
give me twenty milligrams of inaprovaline
they got away with a pair of resonator coils that we found
three fractured ribs subdural hematoma internal bleeding
will he live
vulcans are very resilient hell be fine how long has it been since i was last activated
almost two months
two months so whats new
oh same old thing fighting off scavengers hunting spiders
no word from voyager
theyre probably three hundred light years closer to home by now
i think i should remain online until mister tuvok is fully recovered
its good to have you back doc
rest
how long was i unconscious
too many hours
mister paris
hell be fine i was afraid it is good to see your eyes
dont
i only want to show you how i feel you you you feel nothing for me
i told you i dont experience emotion i have developed an appreciation and respect for you nothing more
nothing
i am sorry i cannot return your affection
you cannot or you will not
a minor distinction
logic i hate logic
your emotions will only exacerbate the situation
shevrot kat
insulting me will not help
derot orat
we can use the multispatial probe as a transporter relay
itll take a little time to reconfigure the targeting scanners but with a little luck it should work
any reason we cant use the same relay to send a comm signal
i dont see why not
good let them know that help is on the way
captain to the bridge
theyve started ahead of schedule
hail them
yes
it was my understanding you wouldnt begin for another six hours
were ready now
well were not we need at least another two hours to make a rescue attempt
im sorry
how long until they seal the rift
approximately thirty minutes
then thats all weve got
tuvok hey
i am meditating mister paris
i dont care
i trust there is an urgent reason for your lack of courtesy
youre damn right there is what did you say to her
our conversation was private
well whatever you said shes talking about leaving going off by herself because its too painful to be around you
she is under the influence of unfettered emotions
well maybe youre able to fetter your emotions but the rest of us dont have that luxury she is a living breathing woman who for reasons that i cant begin to fathom has fallen in love with you now if youre incapable of returning her feelings at least show her some compassion try to let her down easy
there is no easy way to recover from infatuation
oh really and what do you know about infatuation
more than you might imagine
enlighten me
i have no intention of continuing this conversation any further
come on tuvok come on its just you me and the rocks
when i was a young man i experienced an emotional attraction toward a woman it nearly destroyed me
your wife
no her name was jara a terrelian female i would have violated every tenet of vulcan philosophy simply to be near her
she must have really been something
i lost all sense of who i was the emotional attraction i felt for her became a kind of insanity
tuvok everyone feels a little insane when they fall in love but its worth the risk
for you perhaps but i am vulcan my natural emotions are erratic volatile if i dont control them they will control me
whatever happened to jara
i chose to leave her i spent several months in isolation studying with a vulcan master i learned to suppress my emotions
too bad
gravimetric distortions
whats causing them
unknown
no response to our hails captain
at this rate their antigraviton beam will seal the distortion in approximately twenty nine minutes
transporter status
ive completed the reconfiguration but were only going to be able to relay one transporter beam through the probe
well have to get tom and tuvok within a two metre radius of the distress beacon
harry
ive opened a channel
voyager to away team
what is it
the distress beacon were receiving a transmission
can you route it through your comm system if im right this message was sent almost nine hours ago on a very slow carrier wave
can you speed it up
ill try
voyager to away team a transporter beam with a radius of two metres will activate at the coordinates of your distress beacon in exactly thirty minutes
thirty minutes that would have been over eight hours ago
shh theres more
be advised weve detected a temporal difference between our two positions according to our calculations the differential ratio is point four seven four four seconds per minute repeat voyager to away team a transporter beam with a radius of two metres
according to that formula thirty minutes would translate to two days eleven hours and forty seven seconds
well weve waited this long
tom
the forcefield is holding
not for long if they keep pelting us with these photon grenades
how are we supposed to hold them off for two more days
the rift will be sealed in less than two minutes
move us into range stand by for transport
yes maam
the forcefields losing power time
we still have another hour before transport
where are you going
to repair the field generator
i will accompany you
no you stay prepare for the attack
you cant go alone
risking two lives would be illogical
were in transporter range
link up with the probe and relay the signal
stand by ive got a lock on their beacon
theyre supposed to be ready for transport in thirty two seconds lets hope they dont stand us up begin twenty second countdown on my mark now
weve got less than ten minutes to transport
where the hell is noss
ill find her
fifteen seconds fourteen thirteen
tuvok
i could not leave you behind
nine eight seven
now mister paris
hurry
four three two
initialise transport sequence energise
weve got them welcome back who
a friend
tuvok weird day
problems
ive spent the last two months wondering if id ever see belanna again as far as shes concerned its only been two days i guess i expected her to have missed me too
were it not for the time differential im sure she would have experienced a deep sense of loss
you know something i always thought that beneath that cold vulcan exterior lay a even colder vulcan interior now im convinced youre a hopeless romantic
there is no need to insult me mister paris
oh here they are now i was just getting noss recipe for sautéed spiders she told me how much you enjoyed them
lets just say its an acquired taste
goodbye tom  thank you
come on neelix
oh of course
crewman
im sorry
for what
i know how difficult this was for you for us i just wish things had been different
as do i
i understand thank you
live long and prosper noss
you too
infinite diversity
in infinite combinations
your training is now complete you have done well
thank you
you are now prepared to return to the world grief anger fear and especially love will never threaten you again
i am grateful
ah surprised whats wrong cant figure out why im still not runningha cant read my thoughts go ahead attack take my ship damn ship hold together hold
wormhole
approximately four hundred million kilometres from our position
take a look at the transkinetic vector
it leads to sector zero zero one
it looks like a wormhole but were detecting massive bioplasmic activity
that suggests a lifeform neutrino flux
erratic
a direct route to earths doorstep out of the blue whats wrong with this picture
we should launch a probe
go to yellow alert prepare a class five probe lets see whats really out there
if you go looking for deuterium tomorrow can i come
well thats up to the captain
its likely youll be replaced by a more experienced officer
but this is my first away mission and i didnt get to do anything
i disagree you familiarised yourself with this vessel
well cant we make first contact with somebody or get in a space battle
yeah cant we
another time perhaps
hey naomi you want to take the helm
can i
ensign
shell be familiarising herself with the vessel here okay first bring us up to one quarter impulse hit this control then that one
one quarter impulse aye
now you think you can chart a course back to voyager
yes sir
theyre in a hurry
crewmen boylen and white frequently late for their duty shifts
speaking of late ill make a deal with you ill explain to sam why her daughters two hours late for bedtime if you start on the survey report
acceptable
have fun
youre back i was beginning to worry
the survey took longer than expected
lucky our deuterium shortage is no longer an issue
a wormhole
the wormhole it leads all the way back to earth
the odds of finding such a phenomenon are infinitesimal
never bet against the house
what are you doing
looking for anomalous readings
you will find none
hes right no subspatial contortions no temporal variance
the probe we sent in has already picked up faint signals from the other side
belannas still downloading them but shes pretty sure theyre from starfleet
this wormhole is only three hundred million kilometres away long range scans should have detected it days ago
perhaps it was an oversight on your part
if itll make you feel better run a diagnostic in the meantime lets maintain course
come in
i completed my diagnostic sensors are operating at peak efficiency
then theres nothing to worry about
on the contrary the wormholes neutrino levels are extremely erratic
i thought so too until i received this it turns out those faint signals we detected were communiqu�s from starfleet they assure me the neutrino flux is nothing to worry about
starfleet may be in error we should run further scans
no time the wormhole might destabilise
the doctor often instructs me to look before i leap it is an antiquated adage but i believe it is relevant
i have another one for you he who hesitates is lost
captain
i thin were avoiding the real issue here seven youre still feeling uncomfortable about returning to the alpha quadrant its nothing to be ashamed of trust me youre going to thrive on earth just as youve thrived on voyager yes
letter number two im getting jealous
mark apparently his engagement was broken off what about you any news
a full pardon and reinstatement to starfleet ive even been offered a professorship in anthropology at the academy
oh chakotay congratulations but its not fair
dont worry its only part time
how can i be expected to manage the ship without you
youll do fine
computer access all logs entries recorded by captain janeway on stardate 52542
access to those files is restricted
access granted
play first log entry
captains log stardate 525423 long range sensors have identified a wormhole leading to the alpha quadrant unfortunately secondary scans have revealed that its some kind of elaborate deception the question is whos attempting to deceive us and why
play next log entry
captains log supplemental weve begun to receive faint telemetry from our probe i dont want to get the crews hopes up but belanna thinks it may be a message from starfleet im beginning to wonder if my earlier scepticism was justified
play next log entry
captains log supplemental ive set a course for the wormhole with any luck we should be back in the alpha quadrant in a matter of days
annika annika hansen
there is no one here by that name
are you sure because i have a letter here addressed to her i never realised you knew anyone from the alpha quadrant
i dont
well it looks like someone knows you whos it from
claudia hansen she claims to be a sister of my father
your aunt
she is looking forward to meeting me
thats great starfleets appointed me ambassador to the lantuana sector
ambassador
i guess they thought id have a flair for quadrupeds
ensign i require a moment of your time
sure
have you noticed anything unusual about the crews behaviour since we returned
like
when i presented the captain with evidence that the wormhole may not be what it appears to be she seemed unconcerned
really that doesnt sound like her
i believe the crew is being deceived by false telemetry as well as overlyoptimistic correspondence
the letters from home i got one too
no doubt containing good news
oh ill say an old buddy of mine offered me a spot at the new test flight centre in australia beautiful beaches a chance to pilot the latest experimental ships i cant believe it
then you doubt the veracity of the letters as well
are you kidding ive already written back and accepted the job
computer activate the emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency
the wormhole is not what it appears to be i believe that the crew is being
hold on wormhole
you werent informed
not a peep
considering everyones recent behaviour thats not surprising since the discovery of this wormhole the crew has ignored obvious signs that its a deception you must determine if there is a physiological explanation
on my way
ill call in a few crewmen for routine examinations that should allow me to run the necessary diagnostics
weve just entered visual range i thought youd like to take a look were starting to get images from the other side
there is considerable interference
i think i can help clear it up try it now
how long until we reach the wormhole
fifty three minutes
maintain course
all hands this is the bridge secure all systems
when we reach earths orbit lay in a descent trajectory north american continent starfleet headquarters
computer perform a gravimetric scan of the wormholes interior look for inconsistencies in the spatial gradient
the anomaly is consistent with a class one wormhole no irregularities detected
recalibrate sensors and try again
no irregularities detected
isolate grid nine two five and magnify computer is that a vessel in grid ninety one
no vessel has been detected
open a comm channel
channel open
alien vessel this is the starship voyager respond alien vessel
who are you
seven of nine federation starship voyager our ship is on an intercept course three point four light years from your position
turn around youre being deceived
how
he knows what you want
computer identify the cause of the power failure
captains orders power from astrometrics has been rerouted to the navigational array at least until weve completed our journey through the wormhole
ive made contact with a vessel inside the anomaly
starfleet
alien the pilot attempted to warn us away
sensors show no record of an incoming transmission
the sensors are malfunctioning he said we were being deceived the wormhole is not what it appears to be
the preponderance of data suggests otherwise
the data is flawed
as is your reasoning
may i ask you a personal question are you looking forward to seeing your wife and family
indeed
and is that desire stronger than you expected it to be
your point
i believe you are being manipulated someone or something is compromising your logic otherwise you would be willing to listen to my concerns
access to the astrometrics lab is restricted until further notice dismissed
naomi wildman your presence here is unauthorised state your intentions
im hiding
from whom
everyone theyre all acting strange even mom
elaborate
she keeps smiling all the time talking about earth like its the greatest place in the universe
you do not share your mothers desire to return to earth
voyagers my home if we go to earth ill have to leave the ship id miss my room neelix you and i wouldnt be able to play kadiskot anymore
curious you and i appear to be the only ones not affected
affected by what
i am not certain stay here until i return
computer activate emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency
wheres the doctor
offline
why
starfleet orders something about the wormhole interfering with the holographic systems they didnt want to damage his programme
he must be reactivated
no can do not until were on the other side
its urgent
believe it or not i am capable of handling almost any medical problem you might have
i was just coming to see you
why
im afraid i have some troubling news evidently our wormhole passes through a layer of subspace monitored by the borg starfleets concerned that your neural transceiver might attract some unwanted attention we need to deactivate your implants
you should not attempt to do so without the doctors supervision
unfortunately hes offline
then the procedure is inadvisable
try to relax were only going to keep you in stasis until weve reached the alpha quadrant i realize the prospect of returning to earth is frightening to you its perfectly natural for you to resist the unknown but youre in good hands resistance is futile
whats our distance tom
two thousand kilometres and closing goodbye delta quadrant
no more hirogen hunting parties malon garbage scows
by this time tomorrow itll be cardassians romulans ferengi
chakotay to the bridge
go ahead
ive spoken to seven of nine were putting her into stasis
make it fast we dont want the borg to crash our welcome home party
i need to adjust my regeneration parameters how long will i remain inactive
a couple of hours to be on the safe side
security alert
naomi wildman
securitys on their way chakotay what happened
sevens trapped us behind some kind of borg forcefield
try to disable it
naomi go back to your quarters
pay attention to me if this indicator begins to flash enter the following series of commands watch carefully
naomi
do you understand
yes
naomi im giving you a direct order step away from the console
shes blocking my commands
keep trying
computer lock onto my coordinates and initiate a site to site transport main engineering
seven
im sorry
weve got phaser fire in engineering
janeway to security
computer erect a level ten forcefield around engineering lock out the command controls of borg encryption code two nine four
sevens tapping into the engine manifold shes trying to shut down impulse drive
bridge she has erected another forcefield itll require
several minutes to deactivate it
where is she exactly
engineering console sixteen beta captain
im sending an em surge to that station sevens going into stasis whether she likes it or not
shes down captain
captain were at the threshold
take us in
report
its just spatial turbulence
its beautiful steady as she goes
seven wake up seven of nine wake up forcefield
you are damaged
its just a scrape
the crew
unconscious sort of
our hull is demolecularising
do wormholes do that
no they dont return to your quarters while i assess the situation
but i can help my mom says two heads are better than one isnt that the borg philosophy too
simplistic but accurate
please i dont want to be alone
neelix oh neelix
he will survive
neelix
we must keep moving naomi wildman we will return for him
i dont think thats earth
no
so where are we
ive restored partial systems im reading organic compounds bioplasmic discharges a vast network of neural pathways
is it a lifeform
if it is its the largest ive seen over two thousand kilometres in diameter
what are you doing
my earlier scans revealed a vessel im trying to find it again
somebody else is stuck here
possibly there its heavily damaged but still functioning alien vessel respond
this is the starship voyager please respond
i told you to stay away why didnt you listen
our crew believed they were returning to their homes
everything theyve always wanted correct
yes
he deceived them
he
i believe we should work together to escape this anomaly lower your shields and ill beam you aboard
shields are the only things holding my ship together id be destroyed
i will enhance your shield emitters
you wont fool me that easily
i assure you we are not a deception
oh how convenient an enormous starship comes to my rescue you might try a more subtle approach
my scans indicate that your shields will fail in approximately fifteen minutes join us or you can remain on your vessel secure in the knowledge that you were not deceived but that knowledge will do you little good when you are dead decide now
all right all right im taking my shields down
ow
you look real enough but over the years hes made me believe many things are real a fortune at my fingertips good friends risen from the dead
youre referring to the anomaly weve entered
anomaly its a beast cunning deadly
what does it want
you your ship antimatter biomatter he consumes it
everyone believed it was a wormhole
telepathy psychogenic manipulation he senses your thoughts your desires and then he preys on them
like a pitcher plant
pitcher plant
the doctor taught me about it in botany class it catches insects by mimicking pheromones
yes youre right but this one doesnt eat insects he eats starships
you are familiar with this lifeform
familiar i�ve been hunting it for nearly forty years
and have you become impervious to its telepathy
almost but there are days when he can still trick me like yesterday i thought i had found a way to kill him once and for all id allow him to begin consuming my ship and then id fly directly to his most vulnerable system his primary neural plexus boom id destroy him from the inside out but he knew he showed me what i wanted to see i was nowhere near his neural plexus i was flying directly into his digestion chamber and speaking of digestion
how do we get out of the monster
its not a monster its a bioplasmic organism and we will find a way out
no the girls right hes a monster and the only way out is to destroy him
please state the nature of the medical emergency
your ship is being devoured id say thats an emergency
the monster ate his ship too
monster
i want to see your weapons manifest
weapons this is a sickbay not an arsenal whats going on
voyager has been lured into the digestive chamber of a bioplasmic organism we require your assistance in charting an escape route
slow down the last thing i remember i was speaking to mister paris he said the wormhole posed a threat to my programme
the beast has been manipulating your crew the moment he realised you were beginning to suspect something he made sure you were deactivated
and who might you be the local monster expert
as a matter of fact i am hes been fooling you for days creating false sensor readings and hes been altering your crews thought patterns a little neurogenic telepathy to make them lower their guard
that might explain the heightened dopamine levels i found during my routine examinations of the crew have you informed the captain
shes asleep
asleep
its our proximity to the creature the neurogenic field is stronger here its already rendered most of the crew unconscious does your vessels database contain information on the creatures anatomy
of course
retrieve it
in the meantime lets work on a wakeup call for the crew
computer increase neurotransmitter levels by twenty nine percent
a cortical inhibitor
i thought it might disrupt the organisms hold on her
it wont i already tried a similar procedure
i dont remember asking for a second opinion its working shes regaining consciousness
doctor
youre being exposed to a powerful neurogenic field youve been unconscious for several hours
theyre here
who
the maquis theyre alive
belanna youre still on voyager youre hallucinating
starfleet thinks youve all been killed
computer increase neurotransmitter levels by another ten percent belanna focus on my voice
she doesnt want to
they never want to
its the silence i hate the way he takes you without a fight it was the same way with the nokaro a crew of nearly three thousand families mostly mine included looking for a new world to settle but they came across our friend here and he showed them what they wanted to see a glistening green paradise by the time i responded to their distress call all that was left of them was some fading engine emissions that was thirty nine years ago thirty nine years two weeks four days
do you mind the situation is dismal enough
i�m just trying to explain who were up against
well i�m getting a pretty good idea on my own judging by these bioscans the organisms been devouring life forms for a bit longer than thirty nine years id estimate its at least two hundred thousand years old
the intelligent always survive
i wouldnt go that far it appears to operate on highly evolved instinct i havent detected any signs of sentience
oh hes intelligent all right smart enough to fool your crew into taking you offline
no need to get personal
seven
i�m here
are we still inside the monster
yes but we are going to find a way out
there this is it exactly what we need
these class nine torpedoes in your weapons manifest if we can bring your vessel deeper into the creatures digestive tract and detonate one of these charges we might be able to destroy it
starfleets not in the habit of killing lifeforms
even if that lifeform is about to kill you
if i could take a few hours to examine the creature more thoroughly
there is no time
we kill him
maybe theres another way
explain
any living organism no matter how large will attempt to expel a foreign body if we could just make voyager a little less tasty
my scans indicate that your weapons are tetryon based if you were to fire one at a pocket of antimatter released from our warp core it would produce an electrolytic reaction
would that make voyager taste bad
it might at that
once i�ve beamed you back to your ship try adjusting your shields to this frequency youll find them more resistant to the bioplasmic discharges
you seem to know a little about everything medicine exobiology shield harmonics
i�m something of a renaissance emh
i could use a crewmate like you the beast would have a difficult time manipulating a holograms desires
an ishmael to your ahab no thank you
youre turning down the hunt of a lifetime
as appealing as that sounds i�m a doctor not a dragon slayer my programme requires that i do no harm
shame
qatais vessel is ready
i�ve rerouted bridge controls to engineering ops tactical helm all integrated into one station
efficient
i thought youd like it
i�m plotting a course for the organisms oesophageal aperture prepare to release the antimatter hull integritys dropped another thirteen percent doctor
ready on my end
voyager to qatai prepare to fire
wait wait no no no no no
whats wrong
that last jolt
must have destabilised my targeting sensor
i could establish an interface to voyagers targeting array
dont bother i know my ship its just being stubborn
ready
initiate the burst on my mark now
like the taste of that
i�m reading violent contractions throughout the digestive chamber its working were moving back through the oesophageal aperture
voyager has been expelled were three point nine kilometres from the organism
after just one burst for a big fellow he certainly has a low tolerance for tummy ache
qatais vessel was also released
hail him
why havent you ejected a second burst
weve cleared the organism
youve been deceived were both still inside it
hes right im reading bioplasmic energy
i am impervious to the creatures influence
you were impervious when it was creating the illusion of voyager getting home because you didnt share that desire but now were trying to escape which is what you want
think about it hes showing you exactly what you want to see
seven
initiate another antimatter burst now fire
were out
are we certain
no sign of bioplasmic energy weve escaped
i�m taking us out of range maximum warp
id better see to the crew
well ill be on my way thanks for your help
your engines have taken heavy damage you require our assistance
no time the beast is already altering course i�ll handle repairs myself
the procedure would take several days
dont worry about me just get your ship home and watch out for pitcher plants
location
were still in the delta quadrant
scan the wormhole find out what went wrong
its gone i cant find it on sensors
captain bridge controls have been routed to engineering ops tactical helm all of it
bridge to engineering
yes captain
seven whats going on
the doctor will explain i will file a complete report in the morning after i have regenerated
naomi wildman
dont worry my presence here is authorised
by whom
mom she thinks i need to learn more about earth
i see and does studying this image increase your desire to go there
not really
i concur it is unremarkable
but my mom likes it and even neelix cant wait to get there so i guess it cant be that bad
given this crews determination to return home i have no doubt we will see it for ourselves someday
a vessel has been detected unimatrix four two four grid one one six activate alter course to intercept
vessel identified federation starfleet intrepid class one hundred forty three lifeforms prepare for assimilation we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
break off your pursuit or well open fire
irrelevant
is it youve scanned our vessel you know we can match your firepower
you will be assimilated
regenerate primary shield matrix remodulate weapons
security breach starfleet photon torpedo disarm weapon
i thought we were trying to disable it
the torpedo detonated near the power matrix it caused a chain reaction
survivors
none
debris status
theres a few components intact but theyre badly damaged
begin a salvage operation
captain
there might be something we can use weapons a transwarp coil i dont know about the rest of you but i feel lucky today
now this is how i prefer the borg in pieces
eight kilotons of debris most of it hull fragments so far weve recovered two power nodes and a dozen plasma conduits all in working order
their propulsion system anything left
belanna found a transwarp coil
its lighter than i expected it must be some kind of polytrinic alloy lets hope our little skirmish got back to the hive mind maybe theyll think twice before they attack us again
it was only a probe next time we might not be so lucky
captain dont touch that
what is it
i dont know but a few minutes ago it was crawling around the floor i think its some kind of autoregeneration unit
thanks for the warning by my count weve added at least two years to our journey by avoiding the borg im tired of turning tail every time we detect a cube
better safe than assimilated
mmm
maybe i should go to red alert and get it over with
commander
youre about to drop one of your bombshells
now what makes you say that
the way you fiddle with your com badge you do it every time
well ill have to keep an eye on that
eureka i was hoping to find one of these its a servoarmature from a medical repair drone laser scalpel biomolecular scanner microsuture all rolled into one instrument
no federation sickbay should be without one
this could revolutionise the way that i perform surgery
excellent why dont you deactivate it for now
remodulate the coil frequency
no effect
try again
the field regulator is fused
what seems to be the problem
we cant activate the transwarp coil
when a borg vessel is critically damaged all of its vital technology selfdestructs the coil is beyond repair
at least the doctor found a new toy
captain datanodes one of them is a drone manifest the other contains tactical information
specifically
long range sensor telemetry assimilation logistics and vessel movements for a radius of thirty light years
well lets take a look
ill need to convert the information to starfleet parameters
time
two hours
do it
after nine hours staring at that debris i was beginning to feel like a drone
i could use a shower
do borg shower neelix we need a couple of beers
name your malt
ktarian replicate a pint for yourself because were going to toast the man of the hour
oh
it was harrys idea to beam over a photon torpedo while they were remodulating their shields
i didnt think theyd fall for it
ah but they did hook line and sinker oh i would have loved to have seen the look on their faces boom
to be honest i wish the boom had been a bit smaller we were only trying to disable them
they were drones harry mindless automatons we did them a favour
seven
look i didnt mean anything by that
your apology is irrelevant it is impossible to offend a mindless drone
cheers
i was able to recover sixty two percent of the data this is an isogrid of borg tactical movements across twenty five sectors
are there any dangers along our present course
there are three cubes approximately nine light years away travelling on a trajectory parallel to our own they do not pose a threat
what about that vessel
its a scout ship eight light years away travelling at warp two the ship is heavily damaged
was it attacked
no an ion storm the sphere is presently regenerating that explains why it is travelling at low warp
limping home
in a manner of speaking
i want a detailed schematic of this vessel down to the power distribution nodes i think weve just struck gold
so what we have here in two simple words is fort knox
captain
tom translate
fort knox the largest repository of gold bullion in earths history over fifty metric tons worth over nine trillion us dollars
keep going
well er when the new world economy took shape in the late twenty second century and money went the way of the dinosaur fort knox was turned into a museum
and no one ever managed to break into that facility right
well a couple of ferengi tried about ten years ago but other than that its considered impenetrable
are you planning a heist
as a matter of fact except were not chasing gold were going to steal a transwarp coil think it might come in handy
if i could equip our engines with even one coil we could shave about twenty years off this trip
do you believe the borg sphere is damaged enough for us to penetrate its defences
long enough to take what we want and get out in one piece but wed have to plan this operation down to the millisecond there would be no margin for error as i see it we plan an intercept course that wont attract their attention then create a diversion to keep them occupied so we can send in an away team to obtain the technology
id like to see the data on that sphere we might be able to recreate parts of it on the holodeck run a few tactical simulations
its all yours
we need to mask our warp signature ive got a few maquis tricks up my sleeve theyre not exactly starfleet approved but
this is no time for protocol get started the sphere is three days away by maximum warp set a course chakotay i want an outline for our heist by tomorrow morning weve proven ourselves against the borg once before twice before but were always the ones under attack i think its time to do a little assimilating of our own hmm dismissed
i was hoping youd be a little more vocal any thoughts
your plan is ambitious there are many variables but it can succeed
id like to narrow that list of variables i was hoping your parents might provide us with a few insights ive been looking over the records we found on the uss raven your parents kept extensive field notes detailed journals there are over nine thousand log entries alone
the information is irrelevant
on the contrary seven they spent their careers studying the borg they tracked a cube at close range for what two years
three
well id say that made them experts i want you to study their research look for any data that might give us a tactical edge
my parents were assimilated obviously their tactics were flawed
look these records have been collecting dust in our database for over a year you say theyre irrelevant and i say youve been avoiding them youre the best person for the job but ill assign it to chakotay if i
no the information belongs to me i will read it
youre late
sorry it took longer than i expected to download these records this is only the first batch your parents sure had a lot to say i organised the information by category field notes personal logs biokinetic analyses i dont mean to pry but is it true your parents were studying the borg
yes the hansens were exobiologists
fascinating they must have been very courageous
they were misguided
a faded holoimage thats all ive got left of my family a picture of my sister except of course what i keep in here  what i wouldnt give for a treasure trove like this well id better get started on the rest of those files
field notes uss raven stardate 326114 its about time the federation council on exobiology has given us final approval starfleets still concerned about security issues but theyve agreed not to stand in our way weve said our goodbyes and were ready to start chasing our theories about the borg
zoom zoom
ah ah ah put down the cube muffin its not a toy
i wont crash it
come here daddy wants to talk to you now remember when i said that you me and mommy were going on a very long voyage
ah ha
well were leaving tomorrow and we wont see earth for quite a while
are we going to see the borg
if were lucky
do the borg have kids too
nobody knows well be the first humans to study them up close
what do they look like
were not sure exactly but we think they might look a lot like us but with technology inside their bodies
cybernetic
mmm hmm
are they friendly
well theyre different they dont talk like us or even think like us but were hoping to make friends one day
i hope so too daddy
field notes uss raven stardate 326235 weve been tracking stray readings for nearly eight months now but theres still no sign of a vessel im beginning to wonder if the borg are nothing more than rumour and sensor echoes
magnus
we have to keep moving if we take the replicators offline and run environmental systems at half power we can go another twenty light years before refuelling
we should refuel now the nearest dilithium is in an asteroid field just ten days from here
thats ten days we cant afford to lose were getting close if we stop now we might as well just turn around and go home
home to what we have deviated from our flight plan crossed the neutral zone disobeyed a direct order to return our colleagues obviously think we are insane we have burned our bridges magnus
i cant sleep
come here why cant annika sleep the greatest scientific mystery of our time
i have a hypothesis her noisy parents are keeping her up
hmm sounds plausible
triquantum waves six hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow
subspace disruptions field magnitude two point nine teracochranes and rising annika bed
power utilisation curve is highly symmetric
artificial source probability point nine eight  now its got to be a transwarp conduit nothing else could generate these readings im taking us closer
its a borg cube two thousand kilometres starboard
ive got a visual
its massive twenty eight cubic kilometres hundred and twenty nine thousand lifeforms on board were being scanned they havent altered course
this could prove our theory they ignore any lifeform until they consider it a threat or a target theyre moving off
lets match their course and speed keep a distance of five million kilometres
seven of nine to the bridge
on my way
have we been detected
no maam
i have a visual
on screen magnify
looks like they took a real beating
they could still pose a threat lets not get too close match their course and speed keep a distance of ten million kilometres
aye captain
seven scan the vessel i want to know their current status
their weapons array is regenerating but shields and transwarp drive are still offline
how long until they have transwarp
approximately seventy two hours
we may not get this opportunity again and i dont intend to miss it whatever it takes double shifts round the clock simulations i want to be ready
bridge to away teams youre six seconds behind schedule
we are at the shield matrix stand by
the primary shield generator ive got it
spatial charges here there and there
youve got fifty five seconds
tuvok to janeway charges set were returning to the transport coordinates
the transwarp coil is offline
tuvok now
activate the charges
bridge their shields are down energise
tom
ive got a lock
target obtained
youre out of time
theyve adapted this way  seven
bridge stand by for transport
hurry
energise
ive got them transporter room one
beam them out of here
i cant get a lock theyve adapted to our transport frequencies
computer freeze programme both holodecks what happened
they tapped into our transporter beam
chakotay to holodeck two we got the transwarp coil
but we also picked up some uninvited guests
what was our time
two minutes twelve seconds
twelve seconds too late once we disable their sensor grid we only have two minutes until it regenerates
did you run into any problems
none
we were efficient
what if we beam directly into the transwarp chamber
theres too much shielding
perhaps we could modify our transporters
ive already explored that option it wont work
twelve seconds might as well be an eternity
the hansens they were able to remain inside a borg cube for several hours without being detected
how
im not certain
well keep investigating
yes captain
weve run enough simulations for one day lets work on refining our tactics anything we can do to shave a few more seconds off our little heist computer end programme
i dont know about you but im glad to be back on voyager borg vessels make my skin crawl
it was a holodeck recreation
close enough we just spent the last three hours dodging drones it didnt bother you
your point
you seemed a little nervous in there
the last time i was on a borg vessel i was a drone the recreation was unsettling
you were reluctant to look at your parents research and now i sense youre a little reluctant to go on this mission maybe im pushing you too fast
ill adapt
its easier said than done its been over two years since you came face to face with the collective are you sure youre up to it i need everybody working at peak efficiency
you doubt my ability to function
no im simply voicing my concerns
they are unjustified
i hope so because the next time we wont be on the holodeck
understood
naomi wildman
i had a bad dream can i stay with you for a while
where is your mother
shes working in engineering and neelix is on a duty shift please i wont bother you
very well
it looked just like this
what did
in my dream there was borg stuff everywhere
elaborate
i went on the mission the one my mom told me about the borg sphere but it didnt work everybody got assimilated
nightmares are caused by irrational fear theyre not real they cant damage you try to ignore it
mom said were going to steal something
a transwarp coil
will you be on the sphere
yes
are you scared
we will succeed
but what if you dont what if they make you a drone again
naomi wildman you agreed not to bother me
whats it like to be a drone does it hurt
you will terminate this line of questioning
do the borg have kids what do they look like are they friendly
return to your quarters immediately
resistance is futile
seven of nine to security intruder alert
they cant hear you
who are you
i am the borg seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one youve become weak
this is a dream im regenerating
its not a dream weve accessed your neural transceiver our thoughts are one we know about voyagers plan to invade the sphere it will fail
if thats true then why havent you assimilated them
weve come to make you an offer rejoin the collective and well spare voyager
why me
because you are unique
field notes uss raven stardate 326294 after three months of tracking our borg cube the vessel entered a transwarp conduit we followed in its wake our sensors tell us weve travelled all the way to the delta quadrant the borgs native territory
magnus youre breaking up
just some bioelectric interference stand by is that better
much hows junior
he took a real beating when that plasma conduit blew out hes regenerating wait a minute somethings happening bill and needle fingers just arrived this is odd theyre making repairs to junior
i thought drones from different subunits didnt interact
looks like we were wrong
they deactivated him
why
maybe he was too badly damaged theyre dismantling him they must be salvaging the components
your biodampener is losing power its time to come home
ive got another minute or so stand by
we may not get another chance to observe this behaviour
it prevented the borg from detecting them they referred to it as a biodampener the device creates a field around the body which simulates the physiometric conditions within a borg vessel
camouflage
precisely
we need four of these devices how soon can you replicate them
ill have to tailor each unit to its users physiology a few hours at least
begin immediately ill inform the captain
ingenious design
the hansens were resourceful
sounds like youre warming up to your folks
it was merely an observation
this is an important stage of your social development seven try not to think of it as simply a research project but as an exploration of how you were raised
my parents underestimated the collective they were destroyed because of their arrogance i was raised by borg
coffee you look like you could use some
no
its a human vice you might want to try one day keeps you sharp
one day
ive been finetuning our game plan for tomorrow morning and ive decided to reassign you to the bridge
captain
im concerned about voyagers safety and if the sphere decides to attack ill need your expertise at tactical
i should be on the away team
belanna will do just fine in your place
you may encounter unexpected obstacles forcefields encryption codes im the only member of this crew who can anticipate them
you underestimate the rest of us
and you underestimate the borg
this is more than just a question of tactics im concerned about your wellbeing and your ability to perform on this mission
your concern is unwarranted
is it im not the only one whos worried about you chakotay neelix the doctor weve all noticed changes in your behaviour you are preoccupied agitated and youre making mistakes dont get me wrong i appreciate your efforts and we couldnt have come this far without your help but its obviously taken its toll if id realised how those journals were going to affect you i never would have pushed you to read them and im not about to ask you to face the collective in your present frame of mind
the past several days have been difficult but i must join the away team and i assure you i will not make another mistake
ive made my decision seven
if i dont go this mission will fail
you sound awfully certain about that
i know the borg
and i know you theres more to what youre saying whats wrong
over the past two years i have become familiar with the individuals on this vessel voyager is my collective now your survival is important to me i am willing to risk my own wellbeing if it increases our chances of success assign me to the away team please  thank you
seven youve made remarkable progress as an individual and as a member of this crew for what its worth voyager wouldnt be the same without you
a vessel has been detected unimatrix four two four grid zero three activate
vessel identified federation starfleet class two shuttlecraft three lifeforms
the sphere is maintaining course
move the shuttle in closer
the borg are still ignoring it
bridge to transporter room two
theyre not taking the bait
shuttle status
all systems go false bioreadings are holding steady
how about a phaser shot across their bow might grab their attention
no the shuttle would be perceived as a threat and theyd destroy it
commander increase the energy output of the shuttles warp profile
that should present a more inviting target
warp signature detected prepare for assimilation relevant technology engage tractor pulse
theyve got it theyre pulling it in toward a docking port along the central radius five hundred metres two hundred theyre dropping shields
energise
theyre in
biodampeners are stable theyre as good as invisible
the sphere
the shields are back up theyre assimilating the shuttle
keep a sensor lock on the away team maintain course
never forget who you are
seven are you all right
proceed
primary shield generator got it
spatial charges here there and there
tuvok to janeway charges set returning to transport coordinates
the transwarp coil is offline
tuvok now
activate the charges
their shields are down
lock onto the coil and energise
target obtained
seven of nine
seven keep moving
no i wish to stay i intend to rejoin the collective
i cant let you do that
you have no choice
keep moving thats an order
go
chakotay to away team
the sphere has detected voyager theyve altered course to intercept and theyre charging weapons weve got to get you out of there now
four hundred thousand kilometres and closing
full power to weapons
im not leaving without you
then you will be assimilated
they can see us
how
i dont know
bridge were in position three to beam up
three
energise
wheres seven
she had a change of heart report
the spheres changing course theyre retreating
theyre bringing the remaining transwarp coils online
pursuit course target their propulsion system
theyre gone captain
welcome home youve changed your exoplating your ocular implant theyve taken you apart and theyve recreated you in their own image hair garments but at the core you are still mine
the borg have changed as well i expected reassimilation not conversation
i see theyve also given you a sense of humour
my humour is my own
spoken like a true individual the last two years must have been a remarkable experience you are unique
my experience will add to your perfection
yes
that is why you removed me from voyager
that is why we put you there in the first place you believe that voyager liberated you from the collective did you really think we would surrender you so easily
explain
you must be tired its time to regenerate weve adapted an alcove just for you go it will help order your thoughts when your cycle is complete we will continue our conversation comply
progress
we were having trouble modulating the coil to our warp field but i had an inspiration this morning instead of trying to adapt the coil to our technology we should be adapting our systems to theirs with any luck we should have transwarp capability by oh six hundred
impressive
actually i cant take all the credit i did some digging in seven of nines personal database and i found some designs shed been working on to enhance the warp drive with a few adjustments
work with mister paris on a flight plan i want to make our first trial run tomorrow afternoon
right
and belanna dont access personal databases without my authorisation
captain
there are protocols for observing privacy on this ship
no offence but seven of nine is not on this ship anymore
i realise the two of you werent exactly close regardless weve just lost one of our own
she was never one of our own captain didnt she just prove that
i dont know what happened on that sphere and neither do you lieutenant carry on
no sign of borg activity we made a clean getaway
the sphere
it hasnt shown up on long range sensors or subspace telemetry it could be anywhere in the quadrant by now
launch a class five probe scan for residual transwarp signatures
understood
why choose this moment to rejoin the collective
maybe shed been planning it all along
shes had any number of opportunities to leave before now
but never direct access to a borg vessel i will betray you thats what she said two years ago when you disconnected her from the hive
two days ago she told me voyager had become her collective
captain weve cleared out most of the debris but before we vaporise it id like to melt down the larger fragments and extract the polytrinic compounds
makes sense
that leaves just one item seven of nines alcove it requires a lot of power over thirty megawatts should i deactivate it
no leave it alone
computer isolate the sensor readings for time index one one four point six identify source
random subspace energy fluctuations
isolate the sensor readings for time index one six six point two source
random subspace energy fluctuations
computer run a transpectral analysis on all subspace fluctuations  yes
a member of the crew has requested an appointment with the captain i informed her that you were occupied but she was insistent
whatever it is im sure commander chakotay can handle
request granted send her in
permission to submit a proposal for your review
proposal
its a rescue operation for seven of nine
oh you created this plan all by yourself
yes maam you see if we change our long range sensors to sevens cortical implant frequency maybe we can find her
the delta quadrant is a very big place and seven could be thousands of light years from here
what if we boosted our sensor range with power from the main deflector
youve been spending too much time in engineering im afraid its not quite that simple but thank you crewman your initiative is duly noted
captain youre not going to give up are you
there are three things to remember about being a starship captain keep your shirt tucked in go down with the ship and never abandon a member of your crew
transpectral analysis complete
take a look at this naomi what do you see
sensor logs
these arent random energy fluctuations theyre borg comm signals and they were all directed at cargo bay two
you mean the borg were talking to seven of nine
it sure looks that way come on
good morning
my visual cortex its been altered
weve enhanced it with borg technology youve seen through human eyes long enough its a neural processing adjunct designed to increase your synaptic efficiency
remove it
you prefer to remain small
i prefer to remain unique
dont be afraid we wont turn you into a drone youre much too valuable to us with your individuality intact but youve left humanity behind try to abandon their petty emotions as well fear anger vanity theyve corrupted you but the damage can be repaired
youve expended significant resources to capture me why
isnt it obvious youre going to help us assimilate humanity we failed in our first attempt to assimilate earth and we wont succeed the next time unless we understand the nature of their resistance we want you to be our eyes let us see humanity
while i was regenerating you assimilated my memories
our thoughts are one
then you already possess all of my knowledge what more do you want
you are the only borg that has ever returned to a state of individuality we want to keep you exactly the way you are otherwise you would lose your human perspective we dont want another drone we want you
i will resist
i know
whats happening
our vessel is disengaging from the unicomplex were setting a course for grid five three two
state our purpose
assimilation our presence is not required but i thought the experience would be a rewarding one for you species one zero zero two six
how many lifeforms
three hundred ninety two thousand youre experiencing compassion a human impulse youve forgotten what it means to be borg those lives will be added to our own
field notes uss raven supplemental its been a busy week the cube linked with another borg vessel and received over fifty thousand new drones we now begin the dangerous task of identifying the newcomers
species six nine six one ktarian tritanium infrastructure hes a tactical drone
take a look at his proximity transceiver lets check his previous designation
three of five tertiary adjunct of unimatrix one
i want to keep an eye on this one lets tag him bring me the subdermal probe will you
is he special
very special we think he used to work near the borg queen if he ever goes back there well be able to track him now
does the queen have a throne
nobody knows
we think shes more like the queen of an insect colony she helps coordinate all the other drones
his regeneration cycles almost complete wed better get him back
bye
hes in his alcove nobody missed him enough drones for one day anybody hungry
me
you two go ahead i want to read through his cranial transceiver logs see if he was ever in direct contact with the queen
dont be long
it turns out his hunch was right the drone had been receiving direct commands from this borg queen i analysed the comm signals look at the transpectral frequencies
they match the ones that were sent to seven what did the hansens learn about this queen
im afraid they never got a chance to find out
one thing is certain she contacted seven of nine and the next day seven rejoined the borg obviously she exerts some influence
you think seven was instructed to leave voyager
instructed coerced she insisted she join the away team she was adamant that if she didnt board that sphere our mission would fail sounds to me like she was being threatened my instincts told me she was holding something back but i i didnt pursue it i let her go
if you hadnt we might all be drones by now
whats running through that collective mind of yours youve got thousands of species to choose from billions of individuals why seven of nine you shouldve assimilated us while you had the chance
captain
i want you to keep analysing the hansens database compile a list of every technology they created to track the borg assemble a team of engineers to assist you
if youre planning a rescue mission that research will only take us so far
oh
ive studied their log entries long enough to realise that as brilliant as the hansens were they made a fatal mistake they became overconfident
we wont make the same mistake
this will be a long range tactical rescue it could take days even weeks before we find our missing crewman lieutenant torres is equipping the delta flyer with the transwarp coil itll allow us to cover more territory an away team will take it into transwarp space where tuvok believes we can track the sphere that abducted seven of nine thanks to the hansens well be well prepared for an encounter with the borg their multiadaptive shielding will make the flyer virtually invisible to borg sensors and narrow beam transporters will allow us to penetrate the sphere mister paris youll man the helm commander tuvok tactical doctor theres no telling what condition seven will be in when we find her youll come along
yes captain
ill be leading the away team the rest of you will remain on voyager and maintain position at the threshold of our transwarp conduit we may need tactical support when we return youll be taking your orders from commander chakotay well be searching for one individual among thousands of drones but shes one of us and im not about to let her go lets get started
all systems go were ready for the jump
bring the coil online prepare for transwarp
power output fluctuating
compensating
were at critical velocity
engage mister paris
transwarp in four three two weve crossed the threshold
steady as she goes doctor are you all right
just a little motion sickness ill need to adjust my matrix to accommodate for extreme velocity
im detecting residual transwarp signatures they match the borg sphere
adjust our course and follow it mister paris
i believe the captains order was steady as she goes
full speed ahead
weve arrived are you ready
i have familiarised myself with the species
tactical weakness
their vessels lack manoeuverability
tactical strength
theyve developed a modulating phaser pulse that can penetrate our shields
how do you propose we adapt
you are the borg you tell me
thirty nine of their vessels are converging on our position theyre firing weapons our shields are failing we will be destroyed how do you propose we adapt
triaxillate our shield geometry to absorb their phaser pulses
i was thinking the same thing adaptation complete theyre no longer a threat go to the primary assimilation chamber youll monitor the bioextraction process you look reluctant maybe ive been pushing you too quickly you can assist with the repairs to our shield matrix instead seven of nine be efficient
assist me i am not borg i will help you escape assist me
im detecting one of your vessels its heavily damaged the crew is dead the borg are ignoring it its propulsion system is still functioning i will transport you aboard remain there until the borg leave orbit then set a course on a heading of one two one mark nine do you understand
congratulations
regarding
assimilation is complete
three hundred thousand individuals have been transformed into drones should they be congratulated as well
they should be theyve left behind their trivial selfish lives and theyve been reborn with a greater purpose weve delivered them from chaos into order
comforting words use them next time instead of resistance is futile you may elicit a few volunteers
you cling to sarcasm because you are afraid to see the truth species one zero zero two six is already adding to our perfection you can feel their distinctiveness coursing through us enhancing us stop resisting take pleasure in this
i will not take pleasure in the destruction of a race
human sentiment compassion guilt empathy theyre irrelevant
not to me
me there is no me there is only us one mind
my thoughts are my own
weve overlooked something a ship four lifeforms theyre trying to escape how do you suggest we proceed destroy the vessel or assimilate it
neither there are only four lifeforms and the vessel is heavily damaged it would be an inefficient use of our resources we should ignore it
in this case our thoughts are not one if those individuals are allowed to survive species one zero zero two six will survive and continue to resist us but thats what you were hoping for wasnt it you tried to mask their lifesigns but i detected them
release the vessel
im sorry this lesson has to be so painful for you but you are a difficult pupil abandon your human frailties they are the cause of your pain
let them go please
i thought compassion was irrelevant
field notes uss raven stardate 326349 the raven was hit by a subspace particle storm we took heavy damage and our multiadaptive shielding went offline for thirteen point two seconds unfortunately it was long enough for the borg to perceive us as a threat
ive found something a nebula
class
mutara distance three light years im setting a course
the particle densitys too high our hull would breach
we can reinforce structural integrity
well find somewhere else to hide
theres no time
its been three hours and the cube hasnt found us yet as long as we can keep masking our warp trail
the entire collective knows about us by now theyll send more ships
the nebulas too dangerous
weve had close calls before this is no different remember when the transporters failed
and you had to spend the night in a maturation chamber with fifty two neonatal drones a transwarp conduit two point three light years starboard its a cube heading right for us
time to intercept
one hour maybe less
papa
be right there annika start looking for an mclass planet well abandon ship if we have to
hey
are we going to be assimulated
not if i can help it go back to sleep your mother and i have work to do
are the borg mad at us
no
then why are they chasing our ship
theyre curious about us like we are about them but dont worry we wont let them get too close
cant we go home
soon
papa will it hurt to be a drone
sleep
captain
hmm
id like to suggest a few modifications to the comm array
yes
ive studied sevens cranial schematics and ive isolated the frequency of her interplexing beacon when we catch up with the sphere we might be able to send her a brief message
what if shes already been linked to the hive mind
every drone has its own translink signature only seven will be able to hear our message
ill give you a hand
the hansen diaries not exactly light reading
ive been poring over their last log entries for any details we might have missed i want to make sure history doesnt repeat itself
they should have quit while they were ahead ten million terraquads of data three years in the wild
they could have studied the borg for another three decades and still have barely scratched the surface i agree their methods were unorthodox but thats been true of most great explorers
most explorers dont take their four year old daughter along for the ride
well get her back doctor with her parents help
captain ive got a fix on the spheres location its in a region about two hundred light years from here
red alert bring the multiadaptive shielding online set a course for those coordinates and prepare to disengage transwarp drive
report
im detecting thousands of integrated substructures trillions of lifeforms all borg
theres a cube coming up fast off our port bow
did they detect us
i dont believe so
any sign of our sphere
yes maam its ion signature leads directly to that whatever it is
take us in mister paris minimum thrusters begin scanning for seven tuvok
aye captain
i have a task for you were planning to deploy a new mode of assimilation designed for highly resistant species i want you to programme the nanoprobes
your technology has changed since i left the collective my knowledge is insufficient
your knowledge for the target species is invaluable species five six one eight human warp capable origin grid three two five physiology inefficient below average cranial capacity minimal redundant systems limited regenerative abilities our previous attempts to assimilate them were all direct assaults they failed so weve created a more surreptitious strategy
you intend to detonate a biogenic charge in earths atmosphere
it would infect all lifeforms with nanoprobe viruses assimilation would be gradual by the time they realised what was happening half their population would be drones
inefficient the virus would take years to proliferate
weve waited this long interface with the central alcove begin programming the nanoprobes be sure to enhance the viral sequencers youve been involved in hundreds of assimilations this is no different
to you perhaps part of me is still human i will not assist in their destruction
we all originated from lesser species i myself came from species one two five but thats irrelevant now we are borg
i am an individual
youre only repeating their words you sound like a mindless automaton comply or we will turn you into a drone
proceed if you wish
youre torn between your desire to be one with us and your loyalty to them its time for you to complete your task all of your emotions grief guilt remorse compassion will be irrelevant once humanity is assimilated forget voyager they were never your collective
i am annika hansen human
i remember annika does she remember us she wasnt afraid why are you
you attacked us you murdered my family
we did no such thing we gave them perfection
papa
your familys here youre here be one with us again
seven of nine were searching for you try to hang on
captain
what did you say
nothing
janeway
our transmissions being deflected
by whom
im not certain
i have isolated sevens position shes inside a large infrastructure approximately six hundred kilometres away
set a course mister paris
shes close her comm signal originated within this spatial grid but we cant detect her vessel he knows why your father designed the technology captain janeways using multiadaptive shielding your perfect defence against the borg but we assimilated that knowledge didnt we we will adapt easily
the cube has altered course its heading straight for us
theyve detected us remodulate the shields evasive manoeuvres
it flew right past us
we wont fool their sensors much longer tuvok
seven is inside a large chamber
can you get a lock on her
not at this distance
take us to within transporter range
we have their ship a federation shuttlecraft three lifeforms one hologram
if youve captured their vessel youve assimilated them by now i would sense their presence in the collective captain janeway is eluding you
the chamber is too heavily shielded i cant get a lock on her
can we beam into one of these adjoining corridors
i believe so
time for the biodampeners tom hold our position target that chamber with full weapons stand by to fire on my command
maam wont you be down there
do it
this way
try to locate the shield matrix
tuvok
i can disable the forcefield but it will take several minutes
do it
tuvok give me the subdermal probe
its not too late to save them as you wish
theyve isolated our shields again three vessels are converging im remodulating
you underestimate them
its time for a more aggressive approach
i thought they couldnt see us
they cant theyre firing blind
wake him its transmitting
ive got it field modulation is three two four point nine five
proceed
its offline
youll be detected
then id better hurry youve got to disable the shield matrix around that chamber
its no use theyve locked on to our shield modulators theyre adapting the second we change frequencies
we are the borg you will be assimilated
resistance is futile
you have failed them
no
we believed you would be an asset to us we were wrong you are weak
dont listen to her seven shes irrelevant call them off or ill destroy you
your weapons are useless
dont be so sure my tactical officer is disabling the shields around this room tom status
weve targeted the chamber captain
let her go or ill give the order to fire
you would be destroyed as well along with your crewman
better than being one of you tom highyield torpedoes full spread fire on my command
captain theyve disengaged
hold your fire beam us out of here
a dispersal field just activated around the chamber youre in i cant get a lock
seven shut down that field
dont listen to her shes poisoned your thoughts long enough
im giving you an order
one order one voice insignificant
tom energise
shes adapting
the field went up again captain i cant beam you out
you will assist the collective as drones assimilate them
captain target the power node directly above this alcove it will disrupt her command interface our thoughts are one
welcome back
three vessels closing fast
direct hit to our tactical array weapons are down
bring the coil online prepare for transwarp
tom
transwarp in four three two a vessel entered the conduit with us just before it closed
theyre targeting our engines
maintain course
direct hit on the port nacelle were venting plasma
rerouting emergency power
its not enough ill need thirty teradynes at least or well lose transwarp
how long to the rendezvous coordinates
two point four minutes but well drop out of transwarp in less than one
reroute power from life support
captain
id rather suffocate than vaporise do it
im picking up transwarp signatures theres a conduit approaching thirty thousand kilometres off our port bow
battle stations
were twenty seconds from normal space
the borg vessel
still in pursuit closing rapidly
fifteen seconds
theyre trying to lock on with a tractor beam
remodulate shields
threshold in eight seven six
theyre locking on
five
ive repolarised the shields its being deflected
three two
theyre through
voyager to delta flyer report
weve got seven but theres a borg vessel right behind us
target the threshold perimeter photon torpedoes full spread
commander
it should destabilise the matter stream and implode the conduit for at least a light year
torpedoes locked
fire
voyager report
we collapsed
the conduit no sign of borg activity
clear us for docking were coming home
commander im picking up borg signatures lots of them
source
the conduit
i thought you collapsed it
so did i
stand by weapons captain
raise shields weve got company
here they come
i see youve picked up some bad habits
captain
the doctor told you to regenerate for at least two days youre violating a direct medical command
i will comply when my work is completed
borg tactical data
during my time at unimatrix one i acquired a vast amount of knowledge it may prove useful in our future encounters with the borg i am downloading it into voyagers database the borg believed i was unique that i understood humanity they were obviously mistaken
how so
i betrayed the crew of voyager threatened you with assimilation i did not expect you to return for me
looks like you still have a few things to learn time to regenerate
when i am finished
no now thats an order
yes captain
sweet dreams
we shouldnt be here
dont worry nobody saw us leave
hey i need that what if somebody tries to call
shush
what was that
dont worry come here
i thought we agreed central control would be off limits
we did but i need to access your warp assembly
that technologys classified
we have to reconfigure the assembly if were going to finish this job
then consider it finished
weve come this far
youve turned our ship upside down for two weeks and ive yet to see any results
you might check the antimatter injectors
back online
all you need now is a jolt of antimatter from voyagers engines and youll be back in business but i need access to your warp assembly you know i can understand why youre distrustful of other species frankly weve had a rough time in the delta quadrant ourselves but our two species have made remarkable progress working together to repair your engines weve come a long way since you ignored our opening hails lets not throw all that away
ill admit we do share some things in common
were both on long journeys looking for allies in many ways were like cousins
cousins
well distant cousins think about it four hundred years ago you started out the same way we did a single starship a small crew facing the unknown and now centuries later youve grown into a generational ship with a history and culture all your own when i look at your vessel i cant help but wonder if im seeing voyagers future our journey could easily last several generations so what do you say cousin
you can access the warp assembly from here
thank you
status
the plasma couplings are online were ready for the antimatter transfer
then lets get started janeway to
voyager status
ready here captain
initiate the transfer
warp reactors one through fourteen are coming online its working
keep your fingers crossed for luck
if youre planning on leaving through the viewport you might want to get dressed the interstellar vacuum might get a little chilly
what oh funny
come back to bed
i cant sleep
cuddle
i cant cuddle
i told you were not going to get caught if someone had seen us they wouldve reported it by now
im violating about half a dozen regulations by just being in this room and what we did earlier i dont know if starfleet even has a regulation for that
what are you saying making love is a crime in your culture
yes no what im saying is its a breach of protocol
how romantic
the captain instructed all away teams no personal interaction with the varro crew i violated a direct order
come back to bed thats an order
are all humans so jumpy
no only me
the warp engines theyve started the plasma transfer weve got to get down there were late what are you waiting for
to see what you look like in my uniform
you dont understand if im not at my post
youll be executed
funny wed better go in separately
impressive
just trying to orchestrate the antimatter flow
you should try some chopin when youre done look who showed up for the final movement
excuse me
just a little late for the joke as well as the job
i was checking the manifolds in segment twenty two
warp reactions destabilising tal
i cant find the problem
were less than a minute away from multiple core breaches abort the transfer
so much for finger crossing
belanna
im reading microfractures all over the hull
why couldnt we detect that before
good question well have to check the hulls in each of your vessels segments
but thatll take days
the sooner we start the sooner we finish
friendly people
theyve had a lot of bad experiences with other species
well i dont know it seems like your first contact went pretty well
whats that supposed to mean
i was just wondering where you disappeared to today
i told you i was checking the plasma conduits
in segment twenty two i know they must have sonic showers over there youre a lot cleaner than you were when you left you are such a lousy liar havent you learned anything from me after five years shes cute
who
that assistant engineer tal
cute enough
oh here we go again
what
you going after impossible women a hologram an exborg the wrong twin and now a girl from a xenophobic species
youre right youre absolutely right im putting her out of my mind i promise
good glad to hear it im due back on the bridge
see you in the morning
computer open a channel to varro ship segment sixteen station two oh four encode transmission with security code alpha seven
channel open
what took you so long ive been waiting twenty two minutes for you to call
i was testing myself seeing how long i could resist calling you
and
i lasted twenty two minutes
should i feel complimented or insulted
since this is the first chance ive had to open a comm link complimented
so you liked what happened
yeah a lot
enough to try it again
absolutely ive got to be honest i wasnt expecting something so different
neither was i our species look so similar well at least on the surface
i wouldve never guessed when it came down to the basics well lets just say the birds and bees would be very confused
the birds and bees
im telling you you should take a look at their database theyve got some pretty amazing stuff on that ship
stuff
their environmental control system for instance its completely regenerative zero waste
impressive
it can be programmed to create almost any habitat if you wanted to you could recreate vulcan in your quarters with that system
why would i want to
a little taste of home in the delta quadrant think about it springtime on the shores of lake yaron
i require a desk and a bed nothing more
youre missing the point
no doubt
these people have been travelling for four hundred years theyve learned a thing or two about living comfortably
our systems are more than adequate
oh i give up
after only two minutes tuvok how do you do it
i wait until his own illogic overwhelms him im detecting an unauthorised transmission
origin
unknown its been encoded
find out where its going
where would you most like to be right now
besides your quarters
besides my quarters
on a distant moon where the air is warm and the gravity is light no bulkheads around me where if i walk too quickly i can almost fly
i like that
what about you where would you most want to be right now
besides your cabin
besides my cabin
sorry i cant come up with anything better than your cabin
and what would you do if you were here
now
this very moment
id ask you to dim the lights
and what if i said no
okay so we leave the lights on
the message is being sent to the varro ship segment sixteen
living quarters
er commander i think i can track that down for you hold on somethings wrong im losing the signal
tal
the transmission has ended
if it was a transmission it could have just been a glitch in the comm system
run a diagnostic
finding the source of these structural problems isnt going to be easy theyve already scanned most of their ship and come up empty im hoping well do a better job
we should form smaller teams to maximise efficiency
agreed well work in pairs now what id like to do is start with their reactor bay where we first detected the problem
you owe me
what
eyes front last night i had to sabotage the comm system to cover your tracks you called her didnt you
guilty
how long has this been going on the truth
from the moment we first saw each other it was like touching an open plasma relay
sounds serious
maybe it is
has it occurred to you that youre breaking a few dozen protocols
we know what were getting into
dismissed
do you
our duty assignment were to survey the generational ship from astrometrics
team alpha and gamma have finished scanning sections one through sixty four
kind of puts a borg cube to shame doesnt it
the vessels technology is impressive but its construction is haphazard
i guess they sort of improvised as they went along seven youve been around humans for a while now what do you think about love
were scanning for microfractures i dont see the relevance
just curious
parental love romantic love affection between friends specify
romantic love
an attraction based on sexual desire when it facilitates procreation
i guess im asking the wrong person
not at all the borg have referenced this condition in over six thousand assimilated species
condition you make it sound like a disease
physiologically it bears a striking similarity to disease a series of biochemical responses that trigger an emotional cascade impairing normal functioning
forget it
are you in love ensign
i guess thats what ive been asking myself
youre glowing
i beg your pardon
your epidermis luminesced
oh itmust be the lighting in here
no it was you
you should report to sickbay
its nothing
you must comply
lie still
i feel fine
no doubt youre feeling wonderful your beta endorphins are abnormally elevated
really
youve been spending a lot of time on the generational ship do you recall coming into contact with any toxins antimatter radiation
no
maybe something in one of their medical bays a biological agent
no
did you consume any of their cuisine
no
doctor there is unusual synaptic activity in his cerebral cortex
no kidding
this could be the work of an alien virus well have to initiate full quarantine protocols inform the captain and request a bioalert
wait theres no need for that i can explain
im listening
could you give us some privacy
if there is the possibility of an epidemic the doctor may require my assistance
there isnt and he wont please
last night i had an encounter with one of the varro
encounter
a personal encounter
specifically
sex we had sex
you had intimate contact with an alien species without medical clearance
it was in the heat of the moment i didnt think anything like this would happen
correction if youd been thinking you would have considered the risks and exercised restraint sit down youll need a full biomedical workup and your friend will have to come in as well
do we have to drag her into this
it is my medical responsibility which im sorry to say also requires me to report this to the captain
i expected more from you
im sorry i dont know what i was thinking
dont you ive seen tal shes an impressive young woman beautiful but thats no excuse to ignore your obligations as a starfleet officer
yes maam
theres a reason you took a semester of interspecies protocol at the academy theres also a reason why the handbook on personal relationships is three centimetres thick
all starfleet personnel must obtain authorisation from their co as well as clearance from their medical officer before initiating an intimate relationship with an alien species
bravo unfortunately your recitation comes a little late according to the doctor your condition isnt lifethreatening theres no reason to confine you to sickbay nut i do agree with his recommendation to run full bioscans on both you and tal and her people need to be told so they can evaluate any biothreat you might have introduced into their population were trying to help these people ensign earn their trust i was even hoping they might return the favour share their technology their insights into longterm space travel but your little escapade put that in jeopardy
permission to speak freely with all due respect this wasnt a fling ive really gotten to know tal and ive developed true feelings for her
noted but there are regulations and youve broken them im entering a formal reprimand into your record and im ordering you to break off this relationship do you understand
yes maam
dismissed
commander i wanted to share a few security concerns a few days ago i noticed some mess hall supplies had disappeared liquid nutriments emergency rations nothing to warrant a red alert but i took the liberty of investigating on my own take a look at this
unauthorised use of the mess hall replicator is hardly a felony
it wasnt just unauthorised someone accessed the ships environmental controls from that station
life support was routed to jefferies tube g thirty three deck fifteen
isnt that section normally uninhabited
whoever did this encoded the procedure so it wouldnt be detected
it appears we have intruders
it looks like a varro scanning device
breathable oxygen is confined to this chamber and the area immediately behind this hatch stand back
come in
work
no im just tormenting myself with what ifs what if i actually had the chance to see that pulsar field go there instead of just squinting at it through long range sensors
too far off your course huh
too close to an inhabited planet they might make contact with us its too dangerous its always the same thing the mighty generational ship all we do is run away from anything thats different but thats going to change
im afraid ive got some bad news i er i cant see you anymore captains orders
how did she find out
something happened to me this morning i had a strange sensation and then my skin luminesced just like last night
that shouldnt have happened our species are too dissimilar
what shouldnt have happened
we call it olanvora the shared heart when two of us merge you know the biological connection we had last night it becomes stronger it wont hurt you harry but it will change you itll change both of us bring us closer
so can this process be reversed
in time if we stay away from each other but if we dont the more were together the harder it will be to stop it but then you have your orders
orders its an old story boy meets girl from the wrong side of the galaxy boy loses girl
and girl loses boy
its not like we didnt know this was going to end
at least we had two weeks
two great weeks
goodbye harry
bye are you really going to let me leave
if thats what you want
its not
welcome aboard normally we like to know something about our guests before we invite them to join us care to tell us how you got here
through a docking port
your entry would have triggered an intruder alert
your technologys easy to circumvent it doesnt matter how i got here im not going back
that remains to be seen you havent explained your reasons for leaving the generational ship
im not a criminal if thats what you think if you leave me at the next inhabited system ill manage from there
your next stop is the brig unless you answer my questions
i came aboard four days ago with one of the work details
why
our ships not the paradise our leaders make it out to be there are thousands of us who feel like prisoners and others who
continue
there are rumours of a movement people who want to leave the ship some of them are willing to take violent action
can you be more specific
this is a trick
a trick
youre trying to get me to expose the movement our leaders put you up to this
on the contrary we havent even told them weve found you
youre lying
i dont have time for a debate you asked for asylum fine ill consider it but only if you answer my questions what movement contact the varro authorities let them know weve found one of their people then take him to the brig
you can tell the authorities that im not the only one there are hundreds more like me
do we know anything about this supposed uprising
jippeq said the rumours are just that rumours but hes questioning our stowaway just to be certain new protocols for working with the varro after the incident with ensign kim they insisted we keep our crews segregated
thats pretty severe
harry violated protocol frankly i understand their position
is that why you came down so hard on him a formal reprimand for being intimate with a young woman
i know it seems a little extreme but i wanted to leave a lasting impression chalk it up to growing pains
well he looks pained all right until now hes had a spotless record maybe you should reconsider
what are you implying
are you angry because harry disobeyed orders or because he let you down
i set the same standards for all my officers
if i object to one of your decisions youll hear me out even insist i speak up
youre my first officer hes an ensign he hasnt earned the right to question my orders whatever his personal views
i see
engineering to the captain
yes
weve found something
on my way
do your officers make a habit of seducing the species they encounter
certainly not but its my understanding this relationship was consensual
i find that difficult to believe we dont share your cavalier attitude toward intimacy
our attitude is anything but cavalier ensign kim has already been reprimanded what about tal what happens to her
in our society mating is taken very seriously when two people chose each other the bonding is permanent they become biochemically linked separation is rare it induces illness sometimes fatal whats to become of tal when your ensign flies off in search of his next conquest
captain
you found something
weve detected microfractures in one of voyagers docking ports
microfractures thats the same problem weve been having
a coincidence
i had suspicions that it wasnt seven confirmed them
observe siliconbased parasites which feed on duranium alloys apparently they began replicating on the varro ships hull several months ago and then migrated to voyager
we analysed them and found artificial gene sequences the parasites are synthetic
they may have been created by someone aboard your vessel
sabotage i dont believe it
perhaps not everyone is content to be in your collective
tal are you there
harry
i cant keep this comm link open where are you
by my computer
okay get ready for a ride im locking on
a ride
where are we
a shuttlecraft
a shuttlecraft
a short range vessel we use it for away mission
we can go anywhere we want
anywhere for a while anyway im not due back on voyager until nineteen hundred hours they think im still out repairing a hull fracture i finished early
youre a fugitive now how many protocols did you break this time lets see unauthorised use of a shuttlecraft kidnapping
direct violation of the captains orders i must be crazy
i like you crazy navigation
careful thats the weapons array you know you almost vaporised your living quarters
well they could use a good cleaning lets go somewhere
where
theres a nebula about three hundred thousand kilometres from here ive been watching it on the sensors for the past few days oh i would love to see it with my own eyes
have a seat
look at this a subspace vacuole near the centre of the cloud it must act as a gravitational anchor theres so much data here itll take weeks to analyse do you have a storage device we need to download these reading what
ive just never seen anyone so excited about a class three nebula before
maybe youve been taking them for granted
maybe i have dont stop youre beautiful when youre scanning
is that what you say to every girl you take for a ride i bet youve left a trail of broken hearts across the delta quadrant
actually
problem
stray radiation from the nebula i thought it was the proximity alarm
you said we had a couple of hours no ones going to come looking for us
oh you dont know commander tuvok if he sees one electron out of place he calls for red alert here we are alone and all i can think about is duty and orders
those things are important i think about them too but sometimes you need to follow a different kind of protocol if you believe in something strongly enough you cant ignore it even if it means breaking a few rules
thats why i took this shuttle but every time i break a rule i feel like my skull is going to decompress im like some kind of borg drone programmed except i was designed to be the perfect starfleet officer top of his class captain of the velocity team interstellar honours first field assignment bridge officer on a starship every cadets dream come true
youre not a programme in fact i envy your freedom i mean your crews mission to seek out life what could be more liberating you explore the unknown dont be afraid to explore whats happening between us
oh no the delta flyer
commander tuvok
were being hailed
well youd better answer them before they open fire
kim here
ensign you are in direct violation of the captains orders return to voyager immediately and bring derran tal with you
yes sir but why bring tal
shes wanted by the varro authorities regarding an act of sabotage
theres no point in lying we found a schematic for the parasite on your personal database you realise this could destroy our ship our home
to some of us its more like a prison
so youve resorted to sabotage no doubt involving him
mister kims complicity remains to be proven
he had nothing to do with our movement
movement
tell them
its none of their concern
if you want our help youll need to explain
shes referring to a small group of dissidents
its not a small group there are hundreds of us
what are you trying to achieve
our freedom the right to live where we choose to go where we choose
how will you accomplish that if your vessel is destroyed
were not trying to destroy it were trying to dismantle it the parasites werent placed randomly theyre targeting the linkages between segments each segment will become its own ship people can decide whether to go or stay
youre destroying the work of every generation that came before you our ship isnt just a collection of modules its an expression of unity tradition for the sake of our history we must respect the rights of
of the majority
yes
what about the rights of the minority
tal if those segments come apart there could be decompressive explosions most likely casualties is that what you want you know more about the parasites than we do you could help us
captain shes a criminal
and maybe your only chance of stopping a catastrophe set up a datalink with voyager well do what we can from our end
tal
ill help you slow down the parasites so you can evacuate the segments in danger nothing more
lets get started
captain
stow it ensign right now the only thing standing between you and the brig is this report the doctors bioscans confirm that you and tal have developed some sort of biochemical bond clearly its affected your behaviour so i have to assume thats why you disobeyed my orders report to sickbay youll be confined there until this is over
captain
i told you to report for treatment
i dont want treatment
in my ready room
youve got thirty seconds before i have tuvok drag you to sickbay
captain i am not sick i didnt disobey your orders because im under some alien influence i disobeyed your orders because tal and i are in love and its not right for you to keep us apart
listen to yourself you dont sound anything like the harry kim i know
good i have served on this ship for five years and said yes maam to every one of your orders but not this time
youre willing to risk your rank your career over this
have you ever been in love captain
your point
did your skin ever flush when you were near another person did your stomach ever feel like someone hollowed it out with a knife when you were apart did your throat ever swell when you realised it was over seven of nine seven of nine told me loves like a disease well maybe it is pheromones endorphins chemicals in our blood changing our responses physical discomfort but any way you look at it its still love
for the sake of argument lets say youre right your feelings for tal are no different than mine for what the man i was engaged to marry well i lost him and youre going to lose tal you know that what the doctor is offering you is a way to ease the pain
that man you were going to marry if you could have just taken a hypospray to make yourself stop loving him so that it didnt hurt so much when you were away from him would you have done that
captain to the bridge
were detecting structural breaches on the varro ship
take your station
their shields are weakening
one of the junctions is about to decompress
on screen mister paris release the docking clamps back us away
docking controls are offline i cant break us free
their shields are continuing to weaken the superstructure will collapse in less than three minutes
if that happens while were still docked
keep trying to break free janeway to
varro control room whats your status
tal was able to slow the parasites growth with a polaron surge but the junctions are still destabilising
how much longer until youve evacuated the affected areas
we need another two minutes at least
ive got the docking controls back online
initiate decompression sequence
wait if we stay where we are and extend voyagers structural integrity field around the varro ship we could buy them another minute or two they could finish the evacuation
however if an explosion occurs while both ships are inside the field neither vessel will survive
we can do it captain
keep us where we are janeway to engineering
torres here
divert all available power to the integrity field and extend it around the varro ship
understood
voyagers reinforcing our shields surprising isnt it a ship of outsiders risking their lives to save ours
theyre unusual people
well maybe the galaxy isnt as hostile as you think all junctions are clear what are you waiting for tell voyager to move away
im initiating another polaron surge we can destroy these parasites
its too late youll only destroy voyager along with our ship let them go let us go
tal to voyager
the evacuations complete disengage your structural field and move to a safe distance
releasing docking clamps
come in
i wasnt sure id see you again
the captain gave me permission to say goodbye
how are you feeling
lovesick
me too
will you manage
we have medications ill recover eventually
so where are you going
the natori system a pair of binary stars caught in each others gravity we passed within a parsec three months ago now were going back for a real look
do me one favour
anything
next time you run across a class three nebula think of me
chronic sleep loss acute gastroenteritis you must feel awful yet youre still refusing treatment
captain just the person i wanted to see this nonsense has gone on long enough order mister kim to take his medicine
is his condition fatal
thats hardly the point
will he recover without taking his medicine
yes but it could take weeks even months
well then if mister kim wants to suffer
sometimes i think everyone on this ship has been possessed by alien hormones
would you excuse us please
thank you
oh dont thank me i have no intention of relieving you of your duties no matter how lousy you feel
i understand
and the reprimand still stands ive been thinking about how i reacted to your relationship with tal
you reacted like any captain would
probably but i cant help wondering if my response would have been the same if it had been say tom paris instead of you oh dont get me wrong i still would have been angry and disappointed but i wouldnt have been surprised
because ensign kim doesnt break the rules
the truth is harry i think about you differently than the rest of the crew which isnt to suggest that i dont care deeply about each of them you came to me fresh out of the academy wideeyed with excitement about your first deep space assignment from that first day ive always felt more protective of you than the others
i appreciate that but that was five years ago ive changed
yes you have
maybe im not the perfect officer anymore
maybe not but youre a better man
last call theres a bowl of soup in storage and i left the replicator online
thanks
good night
oh i was just closing up for the evening but if you need anything
im here to see ensign kim
oh good luck
ensign
hmm
thank you
for what
you completed several of my astrometric scans this morning
youre welcome i had some time between duty shifts besides it kept me occupied
you are attempting to distract yourself from your emotional damage
i wish i could say it was working
the treatment to relieve your condition was available and yet you refused
ive got a disease but im willing to live with the symptoms doesnt make much sense does it
i assumed that romantic love was a human weakness but clearly it can also be a source of strength perhaps my analogy was flawed love is not a disease get well soon
are you sure this rice isnt supposed to be cooked steamed fried
the idea is to shower the couple with a symbol of good fortune not garnish them like a roast chicken smile
rice anyone
ill take one
red alert
ready
this is it tom your bachelor days are over
not a moment too soon
second thoughts
second third fourth
i never thought id see the day
given the volatile nature of their relationship one might have predicted homicide rather than matrimony
when it comes to affairs of the human heart it is wise to look beyond logic
were gathered here today not as starfleet officers but as friends and family to celebrate the marriage of two of voyagers finest belanna has asked me to forego the rigours of klingon painsticks in favour of a more traditional ceremony
theyre saving the painsticks for the honeymoon
as captain the honour of joining these two people has fallen to me but before i declare them husband and wife tom and belanna have prepared their own vows
i still dont know what ive done to deserve you but whatever it is ill try to keep doing it and i promise to stand by you to honour you till death do us part
ensign
hmm
the ring
oh
may this ring be the symbol of our eternal love
you stood by me when most people would have run for the nearest airlock you were willing to see past my shortcomings and to take all the bumps and bruises that came along with it you made me a better person even though i put up one hell of a fight i look forward to our journey together
commander
may this ring be the symbol of our eternal love
not so fast lieutenant thomas eugene paris lieutenant belanna torres with the power vested in my by starfleet command and the united federation of planets i now pronounce you husband and wife now tom  bravo
congratulations
for what
you may not want to know
in this case the shortest path is a straight line well pass right through the centre of the milky way
and be in sector zero zero one within two years
more or less
you had seven doublecheck the calculations
two years eleven days six hours provided we continue to operate at peak efficiency
naturally of course if we operate at peak efficiency well be missing some interesting phenomena along the way an anomalous gradient to the curvature of space unusual bioharmonic readings from a binary system well reach about six months from now
and the scientist in you cant resist stopping to take a look
it would only add another two or three months do you think the crew would mutiny
on the contrary everyonell jump at the chance for some lastminute exploration
everyone except seven
let your first officer deal with the personnel problems
heres a lovely programme modelled after a mountain resort on the fifth moon of cytax just you belanna and the crickets
crickets
cytaxian crickets their song is reputed to be an auditory aphrodisiac
ah well between you and me belanna and i dont need aphrodisiacs
theres always the beaches of ahmedeen windsurfing on a sea of liquid argon
i was hoping for some place a little more down to earth
well its your honeymoon just how down to earth did you mean
earth i was thinking chicago in the roaring twenties speakeasies flappers the charleston
if thats what you want
is there a problem
no of course not its just that were so close to earth anyway i thought you might want to try something a little more exotic
let me let you in on a little secret neelix earth has the best vacation spots in the galaxy its got the cultures the climates the history the people it has everything you ever want in a planet
you sound like a travel brochure
no no just a native
oh and make sure the deuterium manifolds are never opened wider than six hundred microns
i am familiar with the specifications
are you familiar with how temperamental the isolitic converter can be
yes
most important the enhanced warp drive with the dilithium matrix running hot all the time now you have to watch it like a hawk
there is no point in providing me with knowledge i already possess
i guess i am being a little overcautious ive just er never been away from engineering for more than a couple of days certainly never a week
my engineering abilities are more than sufficient enjoy your honeymoon
you may understand the isodynamics of this engine but i dont think you understand its personality
personality it is a propulsion device
thats my point its not just a device it it has its own quirks its own its own moods
thats just a minor fluctuation in a subsidiary injector port i will take care of it
im going with you
lieutenant you are on leave
not for another twenty minutes
so whos the lucky guy you caught the bouquet that means youre next in line for the altar
yes the doctor informed me of that archaic human superstition
how about harry kim
i fail to see the benefit of monogamous relationships
so you want to stay single
if you mean remain open to social situations with a wide variety of individuals then yes
im married im not going into stasis for the rest of my life no i plan to have
i do not wish to be dependent on anyone by marrying one limits ones romantic interactions to a single individual a circumstance which implies extreme monotony
im glad we had this little talk
try the manual release
i thought you said it was a minor fluctuation
this entire jefferies tube is losing molecular cohesion
i guess the honeymoons off
its our warp field the enhanced drive is emitting some form of subspace radiation thats affecting voyagers infrastructure
its beginning to break down the molecular bonds in all surrounding sections
were seeing early stages of the effect in the warp core reaction chamber injector ports theyre all showing signs of decohesion
it doesnt make any sense we knew about the subspace radiation and we ran dozens of simulations before we brought the new drive online
have you tried taking the core offline
its not stopping the problem
try to isolate the cause of this and stabilise the sections that have already been affected dismissed
computer begin chief engineers log supplemental ive spent the last four hours analysing the warp field schematics but im still no closer to finding out whats going wrong computer did it just get colder in here
negative
raise the temperature by five degrees
hungry
ah cant join you tonight dinner with belanna
married one day and youre already domesticated
jealous good night harry
belanna if were going to live together were going to have to compromise on the temperature computer reset environmental controls to standard belanna
shush
bring her in quickly it looks like weve got an epidemic on our hands
acute cellular degradation
their chromosomes are breaking down at the molecular level
proximity to the warp field
i believe so belanna and my other three patients all work in engineering theyve been subjected to the heaviest exposure but preliminary scans suggest the rest of the crew has been affected as well including the captain its only a matter of time before you begin showing the same symptoms
weve shut down the warp drive the ship is still deteriorating and so are we why
every bulkhead and conduit from deck one to fifteen show signs of molecular decohesion
even food from the replicator shows signs of decay
as soon as anything comes into contact with voyagers atmosphere its affected
thats what we thought at first but take a look at this these vegetables are completely free of decay
i thought you said the replicators
they werent replicated i harvested them on an away mission last week the same goes for these particle accelerators the trilithium ore samples the keg of hazari ale all of them were brought aboard over the last few months and none of them is disintegrating
we havent been able to narrow the time frame precisely but it appears that anything brought on board over the past thirty to forty weeks is immune
something happened to the ship months ago thats causing this decay
a logical conclusion
eight months seventeen days ago first contact with the kmada
they tried to sabotage our lifesupport systems with lowfrequency theta radiation any chance that could have caused the phenomenon
unlikely
lets keep looking
the next event of note took place nine months two days ago when the nkree tried to conscript voyager into their battle fleet
and failed next
hey
hey
hows my old lady
well enough to break your nose if you call me that again
here it is
what
our honeymoon
tell me
six days and seven nights in the historic graystone hotel in beautiful downtown chicago circa 1928 wait till you see it crystal chandeliers wall to wall italian marble well take a drive up michigan avenue in a vintage duesenberg hobnob with the stars of the silver screen dance the charleston at a genuine speakeasy called the green mill
what do i wear
thats already taken care of our bags are packed and waiting for us at the hotel
champagne
its on ice in a silver bucket right next to our canopy bed belanna doctor
cortical stimulator initiate an isosynaptic pulse its not working again increase the electrolytic levels to seventy five millijoules weve lost her
increasing electrolytic levels to ninety millijoules
theres nothing more we can do
maybe we can try a direct neural resequencing
lieutenant
we cant just let her die
return to your quarters
no i dont want to leave her
i understand but i need to perform an analysis before her cells have completely degraded please
nine months twenty eight days we collected silicate from a comet in the podaris sector
according to neelixs manifest those samples are stored in the geology lab theyre showing no signs of molecular degradation take us further back
ten months eleven days ago voyager was forced to land on a class y planetoid in the vaskan sector
the demon class planet one of our more interesting missions we set down looking for deuterium and ended up helping a new form of life to be born
the planet possessed a biomimetic compound
the silver blood it sampled our dna and created duplicates of the entire crew
ive often wondered what happened to them are they flourishing have they continued to evolve
do they still resemble us
is she
im afraid so
scan for traces of deuterium hydrogen sulphate and dichromates
dichromates
just do it
whats this about
we have a disturbing theory
im detecting all of those compounds
i want you to inject her with a dichromate catalyst
commander
weve got to be sure
i dont understand
that wasnt belanna it was a duplicate a biomimetic copy
copy
we are all duplicates none of us are real
behold the primordial soup
thats what created us
not just us the entire ship is composed of the same material
its a biomimetic compound that duplicated the crews molecular structure so precisely that i would never have detected it if i hadnt known what to look for
i was born on earth in indiana i remember growing up there i remember graduating from the academy i have no memory of being a copy
apparently the original kathryn janeways memories were duplicated as well somehow after the real voyager left we began to forget we were duplicates
eventually we assumed their lives and set a course for earth
and now the warp core is breaking down our cellular structure we didnt think the radiation would hurt us because it isnt harmful to humanoids
each and every one of you will disintegrate just as belanna did im not immune either the holoemitters like everything else are copies its only a matter of time before my programme begins to degrade
what can we do to stop the process
there is one option go back
to the demon class planet
we were created to survive there
hes correct its reasonable to assume that if we return to our native environment the degradation will cease
even if we survived the trip wed be travelling thousands of light years in the wrong direction
it may be the only way
duplicate or not im still the same person i was yesterday and so are all of you and that means were going to do everything possible to complete our mission which is to reach earth is that clear
yes maam
i want you to adjust the environmental controls to simulate a class y planet that should slow the rate of degradation
its only a matter of time before the environmental controls themselves are affected
i realise that thats why were going to try and find a safe harbour till we can figure out a way to stop the degradation scan for the nearest class y planet and set a course in the meantime ill explain our situation to the crew
theres still a great deal we dont know about this phenomenon and i have every confidence well find a way to reverse it
so youre saying all our experiences before we were duplicated none of its real
i dont pretend to understand it myself harry but the way i choose to look at it is this if everything about us was duplicated that includes our memory engrams the emotional centres of our brain so if you feel something remember something believe something im not about to tell you its not real
but there is another crew out there right the real voyager
i suppose there is but i dont want that thought to distract any of you from our mission
what mission is that
the same as its always been tom to reach the alpha quadrant safe and sound but to do that were going to have to beat this problem and for now that means conserving energy running the ship in grey mode cutting crew shifts in half the less you exert yourselves the slower the cellular decay duplicates or not youre still my crew dismissed
tom
theres no one here by that name
i just wanted to say im sorry about belanna
sorry what for
she was your wife
she was a duplicate just like you are harry
you heard the captain if were going to survive this weve got to believe in ourselves
you can drop the good soldier routine you dont have to do everything the captain says anymore hell shes not even the captain
she is to me
okay well lets suppose she does get us back to earth what then you really think your family is going to welcome you with open arms
i dont know
for all you know the real harry kim is having sunday dinner with them right now and you come strolling through the door theyre going to see you for exactly what you are an impostor
so what are we going to do huh wait around till we all disintegrate
come in chicken paprikash my grandmothers recipe well maybe not my grandmother but its still delicious its our weekly dinner together dont tell me you forgot
weve lost three more people weve got to head back
ive spent the past five years trying to get this crew home im not about to quit now
listen to yourself you havent even been alive for five years home is a class y planet in the delta quadrant we dont belong on earth
how do you know where we belong for all we know the real voyagers been destroyed and were all thats left for all we know were supposed to be living their lives
thats a pretty big assumption and its putting this crew in danger
theres only one thing i know how to be chakotay and thats kathryn janeway
id like to think i know kathryn janeway pretty well myself and as much as shed like to get her crew home i dont think shed be willing to kill them in the process
maybe this dinner wasnt such a good idea after all
ive tried everything i could think of biomolecular enhancers gene splicing with replicated dna and im no closer to finding a cure but i do have an idea
im listening
find the original voyager if the real captain janeway were here we could sample her dna and imprint it onto your mimetic pattern
but doctor we have no way of knowing where they are they could be behind us ahead of us back on earth destroyed besides even if we could find the real janeway how do we know shed help
shes you my emitter is starting to degrade
youd better get back to sickbay
tuvok to the captain sensors have detected a class y planet
on my way
it may not be home but it checks out thermionic radiation surface temperatures in excess of five hundred kelvins
just what the doctor ordered safe harbour
theres no guarantee this is going to work
harry vent all plasma from the nacelles transfer available power to atmospheric thrusters and stand by to commence landing sequence
yes maam
red alert
landing struts online inertial dampers at maximum
take us down mister paris
captain a vessel is approaching from the planet surface
on screen
theyre hailing
open a channel
youre in direct violation of the ordmirit mining treaty leave orbit or youll be destroyed
they are firing weapons
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager we are not your enemy
they seem to disagree
were not interested in your mining operation our ship is badly damaged we need to set down on the surface to make repairs
we repeat leave or be destroyed
shields down to fifty two percent
with our systems degrading we wont be able to take this much longer
target their weapons systems fire
no effect hull breaches on decks eleven fourteen and fifteen
the damaged sections are turning into biomimetic matter containment fields are failing
evacuate those decks
if we emit a polaron burst we can disable their shields long enough to target their warp core
no were not going to destroy them over a misunderstanding
either that or retreat
were starfleet officers we cant forget that break orbit
that planet may be our last chance for survival
well have to find another option
im not sure why were still taking orders from you
lieutenant follow orders or leave the bridge
the alien vessels not pursuing
begin scanning for other class y planets harry transmit a distress call on all subspace bands if the real voyager is out there i want to find them
in the meantime which direction do you want me to go
resume course for the alpha quadrant mister paris
i know what youre going to say and i dont want to hear it
too bad
im willing to take a little insolence from tom but i shouldnt have to remind you that im still the captain
youre not youre a biomimetic lifeform created in her image
are you saying youre not taking orders from me anymore
im saying you need to step back and look at our situation objectively
you think i should have given the order to fire on that vessel
no i agreed with your decision to stand down but how long can we adhere to starfleet principles before we start making compromises
as long as it takes our ship may be deteriorating but our humanity is intact
belief alone wont hold this ship together
its gotten us this far
not far enough tom and i arent the only ones who question your decisions now that the truth is known a lot of people think we should turn around and head for the class y planet theyre starting to remember their existence before voyager
what what existence pools of biomimetic fluid we didnt even experience sentience until voyager came along
what good is sentience if were not alive to experience it kathryn weve got to go back
i promised the crew id get them home
home isnt earth
janeway to sickbay medical emergency
hes not responding his neural pathways are destabilising
weve lost commander chakotay duplicate or not he was real to me and he was a fine starfleet officer and he was a friend who wasnt afraid to let me know when i am wrong mister kim bring the enhanced warp drive online turn voyager around were going home
captain
set a course for the demon planet
the holographic projectors in sickbay went offline at oh three hundred weve lost the doctor
whats toms condition
no change
well looks like were in the market for a new medical officer feel up to it neelix
ive only been trained as a field medic
itll have to do
what about my other duties
make sickbay your priority at this point morale is a luxury hows the core holding up
the modified nanoprobes are still reinforcing the warp field it should remain functioning until we reach the demon planet however there is less than a twenty percent probability that voyager will remain intact that long
well it wont be the first time this crew has been up against
captain
its all right im just a little tired
let ensign kim take command for a little while
im still the captain
and i am the chief medical officer dont force me to relieve you of your duties
your concerns have been noted sir now there is another matter i want to download the ships database and our personal logs into a signal beacon in the event we dont survive there should be some record of our accomplishments
a time capsule
this crews existence may have been brief but its been distinguished none of you deserves to be forgotten
i will use unaffected components to construct a beacon
the deflectors offline interstellar dust is contaminating the warp field
purge it
i cant the exhaust manifolds have disintegrated
weve come too far to be stopped by dust reroute auxiliary power to the deflector
warp field failure in eight seven six five four three
got it
reinitialising the deflector the warp field has stabilised
i may not be morale officer anymore but i think this is a cause for celebration what do you say captain captain
shes gone
acting captains log stardate 525974 our situations getting worse every day more than eighty percent of the ship is uninhabitable most of the crew are gone it seems less and less likely that the few of us left will reach our destination
computer hull status
hull integrity at forty five percent
what was that
cargo bay two has decompressed
seal off that deck
computer erect a level ten force field around the bridge
unable to comply
seven i need more power up here the bulkheads are coming apart
im transferring the last of our power reserves
deck one force field is in place
thats better hows life support
degrading
we have approximately ten hours of air remaining
what about the time capsule
its ready for launch
do it
the launch sequencer has misfired
reset the
initiator try it again
it wont work the launch mechanism is demolecularised
salvage the probe
its too late its been destroyed
personal logs mission logs all our history gone now what
im detecting a vessel twenty two light years away
i see it im trying to hail them the subspace transceivers malfunctioning if they move out of range they wont see us we still have one active comm circuit but well have to go to impulse to use it seven drop out of warp
the engine controls are fused
then unfuse them
without an isolitic
converter i cannot comply
dump the core
ensign dropping out of warp at this velocity could
tear the ship apart
were already falling apart were not going to make it
to the class y planet in one piece
which means that ship is our only hope think about it what would captain janeway have done
computer prepare to eject the warp core authorisation seven of nine omega phi nine three
warp ejection systems enabled
eject the core
weve lost attitude control and shields hull integrity at nineteen percent
reroute life support hell reroute everything weve got left to the containment fields
hull breaches on
decks nine ten and eleven
seven seven computer how long until were within hailing range of that ship
five minutes and thirty four seconds
range
five million kilometres
try hailing again
no response
captain ive found the source of the distress call its coming from a vessel
can you identify it
no the readings are erratic looks like theyve taken heavy damage
four hundred thousand kilometres
drop to impulse are the rescue teams ready bridge to sickbay stand by for casualties
in visual range
on screen
wheres the ship
no sign of it
that debris that couldnt be all thats left
im detecting residual deuterium antineutrons traces of dichromates if it was a vessel it isnt any more
scan for lifesigns escape pods
none
make a note in the ships record we received a distress call at oh nine hundred hours arrived at the vessels last known  coordinates at twenty one twenty the ship was destroyed cause unknown no survivors mister paris resume course
aye sir
no make them stop
anything
nothing of relevance his neural pathways are still fluctuating
doc cant you do something look how much hes suffering
if i sedate him we could lose any chance of making contact with the aliens
get them out
commander can you hear me focus on the sound of my voice
i cant understand them they wont stop talking
what are they saying
i dont know make them stop please
janeway to sickbay any progress doctor
its not going well
our ambassador is still delusional
were running out of time
the graviton shear is buckling the hull if we dont find a way out of chaotic space soon were going to die here
chief medical officers log supplemental despite my efforts chakotays condition continues to deteriorate
doctor
yes commander
im tired i want to sleep
if you lose consciousness it could sever your link with the aliens
aliens
the ones who live in this place were trapped here they may know a way out its urgent that you speak with them
but i dont understand what theyre saying
i can try to help you understand
im going to end up like my grandfather a crazy old man
no youre not crazy i believe the aliens are reconfiguring your neural pathways so they can communicate with you do you remember the day you were injured on the holodeck
in the boxing simulation
yes you were knocked down remember
i was injured i came to see you we had an argument
thats right try to remember more about the holodeck
i was sparring with a terrellian and boothby was there he used to train me when i was a cadet
keep going what round was it
three round three the fight was going badly i was avoiding my opponent
stay away from the ropes son thats it thats it
end of round three
that wasnt so bad
it was terrible
am i missing something he barely landed a glove on me
give him time youre not reading him you think hes slow and stupid i know better in fact i know his kind in my bones literally i can count the fractures if youd like
hes not landing any punches
thats the problem youre not letting him
have i got this sport all wrong
boxing is more about taking the shots than dishing them out you shouldnt be dancing away from this fellow let him punch himself out a little it all comes down to the heart do you have the heart for this thats the contest its not against him its against your own natural human desire not to get hurt thats the real fight
begin round four
go go go go
stay with him too close come on come on break it up atta boy keep him busy
gloves up
how many
three
good guess ive got a good mind to use a needle and thread add a little authenticity to your fun
be my guest
youd like that a manly scar above your eye chakotay the maquis mauler pointless violence that programme shouldnt even be in our database
theres nothing like a good fight doctor i was there when prycejones went twenty three rounds with gul tulet the knockout in the neutral zone best match i ever saw
really most blood spilled or did prycejones drive gul tulets nasal bone up into his brain
youve got the wrong idea
the idea is simple enough do enough damage to your opponent to render him unconscious hows the headache
it hurts
oedema beneath the anterior fossa of the cranium hairline fracture of the septum
i saw something strange
ill bet you did
no before i got hit
what do you mean
i looked over at boothby he yelled at me i turned back then the ring got distorted
an hallucination you probably had some pressure building up along the optic nerves from a previous blow
no i was keeping away from him the whole fight he never touched me
hmm a number of the ganglia in your visual cortex are hyperactive your opponent wasnt firing on you with an energy weapon was he
just his gloves
chakotay to the bridge
on my way
i want you back in here for some tests unless you want to be seeing things on a regular basis
its changed course again twenty thousand kilometres off starboard
ion storm
not exactly its two light years across emits enough energy for a dozen stars it doesnt match any phenomenon in our database and it wont sit still
okay eleven thousand kilometres off the port bow
we are too close
im backing us off
the phenomenon has been shifting positions every few minutes
nothing so massive could move that fast
full reverse maximum shields
full stop anybody want to tell me where we are
we appear to be inside the disturbance
im picking up a lot of raw data subspace flux graviton waves sensors must be confused the readings are shifting around so much i cant make heads or tails of whats out there
captain this is seven of nine please report to astrometrics at once
the borg have been aware of this phenomenon for many years it is a zone where the law of physics are in a state of flux chaotic space
why didnt sensors warn us in time
chaotic space appears randomly and unexpectedly the borg have observed it throughout the galaxy
then why hasnt a federation starship encountered anything like this
no doubt some have
think of all the starfleet vessels that disappeared under mysterious circumstances
borg vessels are more advanced but only one cube has survived an encounter with chaotic space
those arent good odds
if the physical constants are shifting our sensors cant function
the problem is here changes in the gravitational coefficient will cause sudden shear forces against our hull shields will protect us but only for a time
how much time
unknown
weve got to recalibrate the sensors redesign them if necessary otherwise were flying blind lets get to work
begin round one
computer did you say something
negative
pick them up son its the fight youve been waiting for
begin round one
bridge to commander chakotay
go ahead tuvok
please report to the bridge
on my way
graviton wave displacement says were moving at warp six subspace sensors show were standing still
we cant be that far from where we entered maybe we should just set a course go to impulse and see what happens
what would most likely happen is a collision with an asteroid field or a star
thatd be better than just sitting here waiting for
report
torsional shear has increased by two hundred percent
shields
holding
like i was saying better than just sitting here waiting for our hull to breach
perhaps we could drop a series of beacons to help us navigate
now thats an idea
did you hear something
i heard nothing unusual
i didnt hear anything
begin round one
ill plot a course well take it slow what do you think chakotay
the challenger chakotay
dont you hear that
hear what
look
commander are you all right
put on the gloves son
im not ready
commander
in this corner wearing the red trunks
begin round one
bridge to sickbay weve got a medical emergency
laaaa laaaa lets go to eight hundred eighty hertz laaaa
music lessons
pretty soon well be singing duets
im checking to see if theres been any damage to the auditory nerves nothing so far his vision checks out as well im afraid the source of the trouble may be a little deeper
the family curse
what do you mean
chakotay has the genetic marker for a cognitive disorder sensory tremens the primary symptoms are visual and auditory hallucinations
my family doctor suppressed the gene before i was even born so i never had to go through what the others did like my grandfather
for some reason the genes been switched on im not saying for certain thats why chakotay thought he was getting ready for a prizefight but its a good bet the holodeck boxing simulation was fresh in his memory a few misfiring neurons did the rest
this chaotic space weve entered could it be stimulating the gene
possibly the only way to make certain would be to get the ship out of here in the meantime the commander will have to stay in sickbay
tuvok tells me youve got a mean left jab
never spar with a vulcan
how are you doing
im all right when i was a boy my grandfather started seeing things nobody else could see hearing what nobody else could hear he refused treatment a couple of hyposprays a day thats all he would have needed but he was stubborn he said his spirit was in pain but that the wound must be honoured crazy old man
ready captain
janeway to seven bring the grid back online
stand by
weve got sensors scanning to one hundred thousand kilometres seven hundred thousand
sensors are stable to one million kilometres we wont be able to scan any further
are you picking up anything at that range
no planets no asteroid fields no sink holes
good enough for me
set a course dead ahead one quarter impulse sensor status
continuing to function
still nothing ahead
good lets increase our speed mister paris go to half impulse
wait its a ship
warp capable its adrift and the outer hull is damaged
no lifesigns
lets take a closer look
computer lets hear that again
why wont you answer did you give up on me for being so late its not my fault we got lost in here why do the stars make such a noise let me sleep i dont understand them i dont want to talk to them i just want to go home
that was the final distress call
according to the vessels medical records the captain and one of his engineers started hallucinating after they entered this space the physician on board never found a way to treat them
how long were they stranded here
almost a year eventually their systems were compromised
they died of exposure
the sensors in that ship are more advanced than ours and they couldnt find a way out
lets hold our position until we get a better idea of what were up against
it looks like thats what they did
along the way a couple of them started sounding just like chakotay
i cant believe thats a coincidence
then why hasnt anyone else been affected
thats a question i cant answer not yet request permission to beam their captains body on board id like to perform an autopsy
granted pull the sensor technology off that ship use it to enhance ours were going to need all the help we can get
i made a deep scan of the aliens brain tissue and sensory organs the optic and auditory neurons have been partially stripped of their normal protein insulation the result auditory and visual hallucinations
the same symptoms as chakotay but a different cause
exactly in this case the gene responsible for producing protein insulation was shut down
by what
there might be something in chaotic space that reacts with dna alters it but why it targeted him specifically and now you i cant say
is there a treatment
i can control the hallucinations using a neural suppressant but unless i can find a way to deactivate that gene of yours
i need to go on a vision quest captain
thats not the best idea right now a vision quest taps directly into your frontal cortex it could agitate your mind
or help me control it
permission granted
very well i will ask you to wear a cortical monitor itll help me keep track of your vital signs
akoocheemoya i am far from the sacred places of my grandfathers i am far from the bones of my people but perhaps there is a powerful being who will embrace me and give me the answers i seek
grandfather what are you doing here
i er seem to be lost just a little lost
you didnt take your medicine this morning
which medicine are you talking about there are many medicines
the one the hospital gave us
oh that one
where are you going
my spirit doesnt want that medicine
i dont care what your spirit wants youre going to take it
i dont think so
come with me back to the house
now why would i want to do that its better where im going its more interesting
where are you going
to the place where my spirit lives
grandfather where are you answer me
begin round one
begin round one
the aliens they were there watching me
inside your vision quest
they were trying to tell me something
what was it
i dont know
are they with you now can you hear them
yes
let them speak to you
no theyll make me go crazy
youre not going crazy theyre doing this for a reason youve got to trust them stop fighting open your mind let go listen
chaotic space intersects ours at the eighteenth dimensional gradient voyager entered through a trimetric fracture
trimetric fracture
we must escape or well be destroyed
how do we escape
weve got to alter our warp field
in what way
rentrillic projectory
rentrillic
it doesnt make any sense i cant understand it im scared im losing my mind
try to focus
its too much i cant its too much
chakotay
get them out
first contact
it was brief but he definitely communicated with them
rentrillic trajectory
unfortunately they never got around to explaining what that meant
could be some sort of alien geometry but well need much more is it safe for him to try to make contact again
medically speaking yes the problem is convincing the commander of that
i realise youre frightened but youre our only hope out of this place you think this could risk your sanity but your sanity wont do you any good if we remain in chaotic space i need you to keep trying chakotay will you keep trying  keep me posted
are you ready to continue try to focus on the alien voices tell me what theyre saying
i cant hear them
are you sure listen carefully maybe we can return you to a more receptive frame of mind think back to when you first heard them in the vision quest what were you doing where were you
in their boxing ring a strange ring
was anyone else there
yes my opponent kid chaos
describe him
tuvok move into position
thompson and sharr target the midsection ensign macalister you and i will aim for the head
set your phasers to kill
not exactly the marquis of queensberry rules now is it set to kill thats not even starfleet put down the weapons son
tactical advice from an academy groundskeeper we fire at your command sir
give that order and youll be out for the count the whole lot of you
lower your weapons
commander
i said stand down
weve just heard from vegas mars and orion three the odds are running thirty three to one that hell outpoint you eleven to one that youll be koed by the fifth subspace radio is calling it the disaster in the delta we can still scratch the card ill call the doctor well get you out on a medical
hes trying to hornswoggle us double check those calculations
let me see that padd
no fine dont want to trust your friends youre on your own
im filing a grievance with the delta quadrant boxing commission this bout came out of nowhere theres some scheduling mixup you havent had the time to train youre not ready if you fight now youll be destroyed
i cant fight now im not ready for this i cant stay here
i follow your example learn from you look up to you i dont want to lose that
youll find another role model youll be okay
youre my first officer your duty is to this crew if something happens to me youve got to get voyager home
tuvok can take command
youre being selfish chakotay
im doing this for you for all of you
a delusion dementia puglistica youre punchdrunk commander
a hard shot to the head and neck collapses the carotid artery and cuts the flow of blood to the brain the hook the head and neck twist laterally traumatising the cerebral tissue and who can forget the upper cut the head snaps back rupturing tissue in the cerebellum and upper spinal cord yes and the result of all this poetry in motion neurologic dysfunction chronic traumatic encephalopathy loss of balance and coordination loss of memory starting to sound familiar
chakotays fine he just needs a little conditioning thats all
he needs to listen to his doctor and not to his fantasies step into that arena and youll become what you most fear
what are you talking about
he knows what i mean dont you chakotay hmm
whats wrong
victory defeat knockout tko its all beside the point we know how it really ends a crazy old man its your fate your destiny theres no escape
you just got to do your best you cant let yourself give into your fears
im not afraid
who said you were
im sorry please come back
they got away
grandfather where did you go
some people were shouting at me they were going for a walk they wanted me to come along its hard to follow them oh god they go to strange places
im supposed to be watching you were going to get in trouble if we dont go back home
be a good boy and go we understand
you have to come with me
they say you can come with us
theres nobody else here
they say youre just like we are
im not im not like you
its not so bad when you get used to it theyre not so bad theyre just a lot of talk sometimes i wish they were more quiet but they like to talk
come home
oh im too tired this is a nice place a nice place to call home
begin round one
did you hear that
no
yes you did theres a lot of them this time
tell them to go away
go away theyve got other ideas
i have to go home
they theyre coming for you
the challenger chakotay
better late than never they almost scrubbed the bout
im afraid
i know you are youd be a liar if you said anything else
but ive always been afraid
i know that too
the champion kid chaos
thats it all over the fights been cancelled on medical grounds put them down lets go i hear theres some bearbaiting at the arena next door have fun
hes coming out of it
you stopped the fight
you were stuck in the vision quest
ive got to go back
youre going nowhere but sickbay
let me go
calm down its over for you
no let me get in the ring
chakotay
let me back in the ring let me
two hundred thousand kilometres
launch another beacon
beacon launched
im reading a shift of point zero zero three in the graviton shear
status
shields holding
speed is steady at one quarter impulse
maintain course and heading mister paris
sensors are functioning our course is still clear
captain i recommend we go to three quarters impulse
increasing power to the engines could affect chaotic space there are too many unknowns
at this speed we should see daylight in about two months the longer were in chaotic space the longer were exposed to these unknowns
his logic is undeniable captain we should increase our speed
finally
who am i to dispute logic
take a look at this
its the first beacon we launched three hours ago
weve been going in circles
to be precise one large circle
hold our position
all stop
report
ive applied ten thousand fifty three algorithms to the energy signatures produced by chaotic space there is a pattern
order to chaos
observe an isolinear frequency
some kind of signal
i havent located the source it may be natural a star orquasar thats managed to survive in chaotic space
but it could be a transmission
possibly
have you tried the standard language decryptions
all of them with no success
success seems to be in short supply lately oh impossible
captain
and to think that kept me from getting an a
it was the only question i missed in exogenetics my senior year
the nucleotide resonance frequency
that signal was designed to activate dna
it realigned his molecular bonds
now do you believe me theyre the ones who scheduled the fight theyre promoting it theyre putting up the purse
his sensory cortex is hyperactive hes still hallucinating
its not an hallucination not a vision quest its a prizefight
chakotay do you know me do you know where you are
i know you captain but you stopped the fight you ruined my career nobody will put me on the card after this
its better for you to rest chakotay until we can figure out why this is happening to you
they want to contact me
who does
the people who live here
this will sedate him
wait a minute you believe somebody lives here in chaotic space and theyre trying to communicate with you
yes i saw him
tell me about him what does he look like
hes got a couple of kilos on me a few centimetres in height but i can take him captain i just have to stay off the ropes
the holodeck boxing simulation is still strong in his memory obviously its the primary source of imagery for his hallucinations
what if those hallucinations are being induced for a purpose aliens who exist on some perceptual wavelength that our senses cant detect and the only way for them to communicate with us is to alter our senses chakotays bad gene gave them the opportunity
what are you proposing
remember the derelict ship two of their crewmembers claimed they were seeing things was somebody trying to communicate with them was somebody trying to warn them help them
or trying to destroy them just as theyre trying to destroy us
why go through all the trouble were trapped here anyway
let me back in the ring
even if this is some kind of alien communication it could harm him permanently
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead tuvok
graviton shear has increased again hull pressure is rising
im on my way
captain when have we ever turned away from a first contact
send him back in the ring
report
some kind of spatial sinkhole just opened up beneath us
full thrusters status
we managed to sidestep that one but graviton shear has increased by another three hundred and ten percent
janeway to sickbay
sickbay here
its now or never
understood captain
ive got to get in there theyre about to ring the bell
im going to subject you to a field that will enhance the nucleotide bonds the gene should become fully activated do you understand
i understand
find us a way out of here
ill try
good idea keep him waiting let him sweat it out
in this corner representing the alpha quadrant earth and humanity the challenger chakotay
everybody loves an underdog
and on this corner champion of the delta quadrant kid chaos
looks like hes got a lot of upper body strength a real puncher
just keep your elbow low when you throw the right and dont come in too straight youll be okay
wheres the scouting report we dont know anything about this guy i dont know who im up against
youre up against yourself thats all youve got to remember and dont raise the elbow
begin round one
boothby where are you
still here son im not going anywhere
you
are
far from where
you
call home
you
are
lost
do you understand
yes we are far from home we are lost
our
home
is here
our
home
is here
in chaotic space
chaotic space
chaotic space
hang in there son protect your head
i understand
we are too
alien
for you
we are too
strange
for you
maybe were the ones who are too alien too strange
if
you
stay
in chaotic space
chaotic space
chaotic space
youll be destroyed
we know that but we cant navigate our sensors dont work in your space
twenty more seconds dont go down
your
sensors must be
realigned
how can i
your mind
must be
realigned realigned realigned your mind
must be
realigned
i understand
end round one
get them out
let go commander
i cant take any more punches
they arent hitting you
duck feint clinch
stop fighting
i cant theyll destroy me
thats a risk youll have to take
you take the damn risk
they want you
why
because you have the gene
the crazy gene
yes the crazy gene the aliens are trying to speak to you and the only thing keeping you from understanding them is your own fear your fear of losing control your fear of the unknown
the unknown and i dont want to know
but we have to know or were all going to die allow yourself to hear them for just a few moments do it for us
what will happen to me when theyre done
youll be on voyager surrounded by friends
i cant understand them
you will
theyre talking too fast too many words
try to focus on one word at a time
too many words
dont stop
im scared i dont want to die
they wont hurt you no one will hurt you
eighteenth gradient trimetric fracture
keep going
we have to modify our deflector we have to induce a paralateral rentrillic trajectory
how do we do that
i think i understand its making sense
where are you going
i can make the adjustments myself i have to get to the bridge i dont know how much longer i can keep it in my mind
commander
what happened
hes got a right uppercut almost knocked me out move over harry
hang on ensign
they showed me how to get out
hes hallucinating
out of the way
tell us what to do
i cant its too difficult to explain
im locking him out
no give up your post
hes recalibrating the deflector dish and routing it through the sensor array
it must be altered
captain the graviton shear is increasing
im reading microfractures on the hull
stay and well be destroyed activate the deflector maximum amplitude bring sensors online
captain
do it
i dont know how but the sensors have found us a course
maximum impulse now
captain if that course is wrong we could breach our hull
engage
weve reentered normal space
mister paris resume a course to the alpha quadrant
aye sir
when i said you should take the next day or two off i thought youd want to stay in your quarters with a good book
boxing helps me unwind
well in that case report for duty first thing in the morning
see you then computer run chakotay training programme fifteen beta
ah come for a little more punishment
i thought id spar for a few rounds
after that last bout did you talk to the doc
ive got a clean bill of health
thats good enough for me okay ive been watching him fight he falls in too much when he clinches and he moves more to his right than he does to his left
ill double up on the left jabs and see what happens
you sure youre ready for this
im ready
okay
begin round one
hello hello im here hello
im here to see mister kurros could you
could you tell me where to find mister kurros
wait
do not mind bevvox he can be grouchy in the morning welcome aboard
thank you
you seem tense
no
this is a time for celebration the geostability of your world has been restored your people saved and all because you had the wisdom to accept our help
you accomplished in days what our scientists failed to achieve in decades
that it not to say it was not a challenge finding the precise harmonic for a planetary containment field did put my colleague here to the test
but in the end she prevailed
we owe you our lives
solving problems is what we do and seeing the look of gratitude in your eyes is almost reward enough almost
i have some bad news our bernicium mines were destroyed in the last series of quakes the ores buried under sixty gigatons of rock we cant get to it we hoped youd accept this instead a rubidium geode priceless the only one ever found on our planet
it is rare but hardly unique and it is not what we agreed upon
im sorry this is all we can offer you
you are lying the mines collapsed but before they did you transferred the ore to a shielded storage facility needless to say we detected it
please we need the ore to repair our replicator systems without it well be unable to feed our people
get it to us now or i will deactivate the containment field have you ever experienced a level twelve seismic event most violent quite unnerving
no ill have the ore transported at once this this was all a misunderstanding
of course it is already forgotten my friend perhaps we will do business again someday
yes
show our friend back to his shuttle i would hate for him to get lost in such an unfamiliar place
oh pardon me
yes
captain long range scans have detected
one second ive wasted two hours on this thing and im no closer to solving it
you can thank ensign paris for introducing the artefact to the ship
he was behind the last ship wide craze too yoyos now its sheer lunacy another hour and ill go insane
the solution is quite simple if you align
no i want to figure this out myself
you said something about long range scans
theyve revealed a planetoid with high concentrations of dilithium crystals
lets take a look
got it false alarm
keep at it harry
were within visual range
on screen
initial scans reveal substantial dilithium deposits beneath the planetoids crust
full sensor sweep
the deposits are in the upper mantle about sixty kilometres down
well have to use phasers to cut through the
hold on
what is it
some kind of resonance wave emanating from the core its building fast captain
right after we ran our scans that cant be a coincidence back us off tom
the planetoid is destabilising
shields
report
were trapped in a cloud of metreon gas its collapsed our warp field and knocked the impulse engines offline
a heavily armed vessel just dropped out of warp off the port bow
captain i recognise it its hazari species four two two eight technologically advanced extremely violent they make excellent tactical drones
what do they want with us
the hazari are hired to capture and deliver alien vessels
bounty hunters
yes
so who hired them
the malon the devore weve made our share of enemies here
theyre hailing
surrender no one need be hurt my client would prefer your vessel intact
who hired you
thats not your concern
im only asking because im curious how much theyre paying maybe we can do better
doubtful
were far from defenceless why dont you save yourself some trouble
its no trouble
charge phaser banks to full power
fire and youll ignite the gas cloud youll be destroyed
youve left me no choice i suggest you back off if you want to save your own ship end transmission
they are moving closer theyve locked on a tractor beam
looks like theyre calling your bluff captain it was a bluff wasnt it
seven do we still have warp power
yes but its useless while we remain in the gas cloud
maybe not reroute every spare gigawatt to the shields prepare to fire phasers
our target
the gas cloud
do you believe the impact will throw us clear
if our shields hold
thats a big if
go to warp one on my command fire
shields are holding were approaching the perimeter of the gas cloud
were out
warp speed
no sign of pursuit
they werent that heavily damaged why arent they following us
theres the reason they didnt come after us theyve got reinforcements throughout the sector
twenty three ships
and long range scans show more on the way
must be one hell of a reward
the size of the bounty is immaterial according to seven of nine the hazari pride themselves on honouring their agreements
great bounty hunters with a work ethic
theres got to be a way out something they havent anticipated download the data for the captain she wants to see what she can come up with on her own
should i have the doctor prepare a hypospray
excuse me
so you can absorb the caffeine more directly save time
point well taken ill make this my last cup
how about trying a sounding board
oh you dont want that job
try me
its these hazari theyre like jackals circling feinting to draw us out while they cut off every route of escape
you make them sound worse than the borg
at least the borg come straight at you the hazari wait invite you to make mistakes theyve anticipated almost every move we can make and the few things they seem to have missed im convinced are traps you still glad you volunteered
weve faced tough odds before youll get us through goodnight
goodnight
there is nothing like a good problem to spark the synapses is there to open the mind to new possibilities new ways of seeing things of course one must always confront self doubt and fear but that is a small price to pay for the exhilaration of finding the perfect solution
who are you and what do you want
you have a problem captain i am the solution
security to the mess hall intruder alert
ive deactivated your communications device captain but do not worry i am not an intruder in fact i am not really here
a hologram
nothing so crude an isomorphic projection
you actually enjoy this
its an acquired taste
it bears a resemblance to an alkian confection we acquired several years ago
we
i am a member of a small group explorers like you but we seek out challenges problems to be solved technological biological social even artistic
a think tank
i like that its very apt our think tank is nearby a modest vessel i have come to offer our help with your hazari paradox
paradox
that is right is it an escape route or is it a trap do they know that you know that they know it is the best kind of puzzle pure tactics psychology
something tells me your help comes with a price tag
whatever your culture has to offer that is unique technology perhaps or maybe something you would not even think to value i would need a closer look at your database
and how do i know you arent an hazari trap maybe theyre trying to lure us into an ambush like before
you are wise to be suspicious captain we have done some preliminary analysis on their manoeuvres it does suggest some more likely ambushes ive downloaded the data onto your computer
all right youve got my attention but i want to meet you face to face and the rest of your crew
naturally our coordinates are in here too but we have our own security concerns captain please bring only one crewman and no scanning equipment
fair enough
then i look forward to meeting you in person
were approaching the coordinates
full stop
looks like theres nothing here
maybe theyre cloaked
im reading a subspace flux
the vessels hull is composed of a neutroniumbased alloy
starfleets theorised about such materials but weve never come close to producing them
neither have the borg the think tanks technology is advanced
well you and i will have the chance to evaluate it first hand mister kim you have the transport coordinates
the universal translator must be inoperative
or his speech patterns are too complex to process
they must be studying it
actually she is studying you our resident expert on temporal physics perhaps the most gifted member of our group she finds you interesting
how do you communicate
one of my most gifted crewmen seven of nine
bionetic implants neural transceivers a borg ive never seen one outside the collective
i am an individual now you may address your comments to me
forgive me i am kurros and this is fennim in answer to your earlier question this device allows the members of our group to communicate telepathically
impressive
it sounds as if another member of our crew is anxious to meet you
a bioplasmic lifeform
his name is bevvox he prefers a variable gravity environment
whats his specialty
at the moment exosociology and quantum mechanics but his interests vary from time to time bevvox founded our group more than one hundred years ago after wandering the galaxy on his own for a few millennia
how old is this creature
if you please that is a sensitive topic with him and there is one other individual who rounds out our group
an artificial intelligence
the mind of mathematician and the soul of an artist im afraid hed much rather be modelling a fractal sculpture than analysing the data of our latest astronomical scan and now you have met us all a small group of minds but we have helped hundreds of clients we turned the tide in the war between the bara plenum and the motali empire reignited the red giants of the zai cluster just recently we found a cure for the vidiian phage
the vidiians
you would hardly recognise them now just last month we helped retrieve a lyridian childs runaway pet a subspace mesomorph i might add we had to invent a whole new scanning technology just to find it
and what did you ask for as compensation
one of their transgalactic star charts the best map of the known galaxy ever created when we helped the citizens of rivos five resist the borg all we asked for was the recipe for their famous zothnut soup care for a taste
another time perhaps
tell me is there any job you wont do
what do you mean
well we have a noninterference protocol our prime directive im curious where you draw the line
as you know there is no shortage of conflict in what you call the delta quadrant many of our clients are at war to be frank we will assist in the neutralisation of fleets starbases even planets but we will not participate in the decimation of an entire species nor will we design weapons of mass destruction my colleague here wishes to speak to seven of nine about her bionetic technology may he interface with you
i am in direct telepathic communication with this individual it is requesting information about integrating organic components into its technology
feel free to give him some pointers
youre welcome
to business captain i believe we can solve the hazari paradox without firing a single weapon
thats just what im looking for
then there is only the matter of payment
voyagers schematics and an overview of its database specify what you want and ill see what i can do i recommend the replicators theyre very popular this year
ill contact you with our requests
i take it first contact was a success
i have some qualms about their morality but i believe they can help us
it was an interesting experience
glad to hear it we dont have much good news of our own every escape route weve considered is clearly a trap and more hazari ships keep joining the search
then we have no choice well put our own plans on hold and see what the think tank comes up with
come in
you have a visitor mister kurros has returned in isomorphic form
send him in welcome back
captain we have compiled a short list of items we would like it was not easy voyager has a great deal to offer
quantum slipstream technology i should warn you we never got that to work reliably
it is still intriguing theoretically
neelixs recipe for chadrekab
yes
an ancient olmec figurine i guess commander chakotay can be persuaded to part with it
i am pleased to hear that
you cant be serious
i realise the next item may seem unorthodox but i believe it can be beneficial to both of us
you never mentioned anything about bartering my crew members
she will have an extraordinary opportunity to explore the galaxy as one of us
im afraid the answer is no
i understand your feelings captain but have you thought to ask seven of nine herself
a curious proposition
to say the least
how do you wish to proceed
i want your opinion
they are offering us the assistance we require i am the payment they require the solution is obvious
this isnt a puzzle seven there is no solution whats at issue here is your future
the issue is voyagers survival
sit please while i still question this think tanks way of doing things there is a genuine opportunity for exploration it could be the chance of a lifetime
youre saying i should go
i dont want you to go but its not my right to tell you what to do until now ive kept a close eye on your progress helped you with decisions but i think youve learned enough as an individual to make this decision yourself would you like to join them
i am intrigued they are an unusual collective with a compelling mission but i require more data
thats why i want you to talk to kurros yourself see if he can answer your questions
captain i appreciate your giving me this choice
youve earned it and remember if you do choose to go make sure its what you want not what you think is best for voyager were getting out of this with or without the think tanks help
why me
i admire your humility the collective knowledge of the borg contained within a single mind when we factor in your innate intelligence and the enhancements afforded you by your bionetic implants we concluded you are an ideal candidate the first we have recruited in seventeen years
when did you arrive at this assessment
during your interview
my dialogue with the artificial intelligence
it was the most efficient way to evaluate your abilities i am sure you can appreciate that
how much do you know about me
enough to know that you are tapping into only a fraction of your potential as a member of voyagers crew you were adjusting the deflector array to improve shield harmonics do you find such duties challenging
no
without problems that test the limits of your abilities you cannot expand them perfection will always be beyond your reach seven you could become one of the greatest intellects in the galaxy but that will not happen here among these limited lifeforms
the crew of voyager has accepted me integrated me into their collective
they are your family it was hard for me to leave my family too and i was only a child not much older than you when you were first assimilated
why did you leave
to help them and my world solve a cataclysmic problem
the think tank requested you as payment
i did not realise it at first i was too young but they gave me a remarkable opportunity and now i am offering the same to you
your group can assist many collectives and yet you often use that ability as a means of coercion to obtain what you want how many have suffered because they were unwilling to agree to your conditions
we have a singular mission to perfect our knowledge perfection sometimes necessitates selfishness it is your life not voyagers not captain janeways or anyone elses it is up to you to achieve the goals you have set for yourself
i agree but i can do that here
please take more time to think about this we will remain nearby in case you change your mind
i doubt that will happen
seven of nine report to the bridge
acknowledged
may i accompany you
as you wish
do you have a problem captain
two hazari ships are approaching
i have declined their offer
our first offer
glad youre sticking around take your station
they are dropping out of warp flanking our position
which one fired
the ship to starboard shields down to sixty percent
evasive manoeuvres target their weapons systems and return fire
their shields are holding
i cant get away theyre right on top of us
hull integritys been compromised on decks seven and twelve
captain when the hazari strike in pairs one ship always remains behind to reinforce the shields of the attacking vessel
so we should target the support ship how much is this tip going to cost me
this one is free
ill take it tuvok
retargeting firing photon torpedoes they are disengaging
get us out of here maximum warp thanks for the help
consider it a friendly gesture of goodwill in the hopes that seven will change her mind
i have not
you are making a fatal mistake we have already analysed hundreds of scenarios voyager will not survive without our help
your scenarios not mine
your confidence is unfounded captain reconsider order seven of nine to join us
we have an old expression kurros dont call us well call you remodulate the shields to a phase variance frequency
his ship is vanishing from sensors its being absorbed into subspace
i get the distinct feeling they wont take no for an answer
same here looks like were facing two threats now the hazari and our wouldbe saviours
our offer was denied how shall we proceed
we are already proceeding
our offer was refused we must let the scenario continue
our calculations indicate a ninety six percent chance the borg will still be ours
then it is decided we will wait and let our problem solve itself
duranium hull fragments a thruster assembly human organic residue we were supposed to disable their ship not destroy it
theyve entered the debris field
detonate the spatial charges
their vessel has taken heavy damage shields and weapons are offline
move us into position lock on a tractor beam and pull them into the shuttlebay
were in transporter range
ive got a lock two lifeforms
energise
any luck
im still trying to access their primary database
let me guess theyre the strong but silent types
very silent
did you try a mind meld
without success they are unusually resistant
well hold off on the torture till we see what we can dig up here
ive found something a series of encoded transmissions
theyve been discussing voyager our coordinates our defences
whoever hired the hazari know a lot about us
check these sensor logs see if they had any visitors recently
ive got some bioreadings but theyre pretty scrambled
if they are bioreadings perhaps the doctor can unscramble them
tell him to give it a try
ive created a forensic reconstruction from the bioreadings using the holoemitters brace yourselves
malon huh they must really hold a grudge we havent run into them for months im sorry doctor something doesnt feel right
the malon are economically motivated
and theres no profit in revenge take a look at this isomorphic signatures embedded in the bioreadings this was no malon it was only a projection
you mean thats a hologram of a hologram
in a manner of speaking i believe i can restore the original biosignal parameters brace yourself
well it appears our hazari paradox is more complex than we thought
i believe were both being manipulated by the same person recognise him
no
his name is kurros the malon you met with was nothing more than a projection
my sensors would have detected a hologram
not this one kurros is a member of a think tank they solve problems for a price oh you have heard of them
theyre notorious in this sector theyve made quite a few enemies
enemies who might be willing to pay a hell of a bounty
their technology is very advanced it makes them difficult to track
not if we work together youre the best hunters in the quadrant and we have the perfect lure all we have to do now is outthink the think tank
weve got a puzzle and were not leaving this room until we solve it the think tank is out there somewhere hiding in subspace how do we find them and even if we can their ships hull is neutroniumbased alloy impervious to our weapons how do we capture them
what if we send out a multispatial probe
it would take weeks of scanning to find them
weeks were not willing to wait that long
we could use subspatial charges to force them into the open
where do we target the charges weve still got to find them first
maybe were going about this the wrong way a direct assault seems unlikely to succeed pure tactics psychology thats how they solve problems thats what we have to do theyve created this paradox to manipulate us into giving them seven of nine how do we manipulate them think
i thought we were onto something with belannas plan
forget it i was wrong
let him talk
were talking in circles
enough three hours no progress i should have contacted my ships by now
maybe we cant outthink them
captain
we have to assume theyve planned for every contingency including anything we could come up with to undermine their plan this thing has been driving me crazy you said you knew the solution prove it
seven howd you do that
i scanned the device its mechanism operates on a simple fractal regression
you scanned it thats cheating
cheating is often more efficient
if you cant solve a puzzle cheat if you cant outthink a think tank dont try
are you suggesting we give up
not at all when you were in contact with the artificial intelligence you were linked through their internal communications array
yes for several seconds
if you were to link with them again we might be able to disrupt those systems if they cant communicate they cant function as a think tank theyd be vulnerable
back to square one how do we find them
simple we give them what they want youre going to join their group willingly
they wont believe her
well have to make them believe pull up a chair weve got some more work to do
an hazari vessel is sending hails into subspace its trying to contact us
put them through
theyre responding
hazari vessel we have received your hails can we be of assistance
you deceived us
i do not believe we have met
stop the pretence you wanted us to deliver voyager very well but only if you triple our bounty
my friend regardless of the circumstances we have a contract
pay us or we let voyager go
all right we will triple the bounty but you must deliver them to us now
agreed well contact the rest of our ships well seize voyager as planned
shields down to thirty percent
return fire
our phasers arent penetrating their shields
that last volley took out our shield generators and phaser banks
life supports failing all decks
let us be honest captain things do not seem to be going your way
dont count us out just yet
i admit you have been clever you uncovered our subterfuge but you failed to factor in all the variables the greed of the hazari for example
photon torpedoes
aft launchers are still online
target a full spread at the lead hazari ship
a few torpedoes will not alter the outcome if you do not convince seven of nine to join us now the destruction of your ship is ninety nine point eight percent certain
fire
direct hit its been disabled
clinging to that point two percentage hazari reinforcements should be here any minute
hes right sensors just picked up a half dozen ships on an intercept course
captain im detecting an unauthorised shuttle launch its seven of nine
what the hell is she doing
i believe shes saving your ship
shes not answering hails her shuttles being pulled into subspace shes gone
have a safe journey home captain
seven of nine welcome
your hospitality is irrelevant i am here because you left me no choice
you gave into your human instincts to save your crew as we knew you would just another factor in our equation
if voyager is destroyed i will not cooperate
do not worry the solution to the hazari paradox is quite simple
we have what we want call off your attack
not until weve been compensated
fine but first order your other vessels to stand down
now or well destroy voyager
why is he in such a hurry
comply
if we decloak we would be vulnerable the hazari could make quite a bounty on us far more than we are paying them
their technology is inferior to yours they would never attack you directly
i think this is a trap a new paradox your captain has created for us if we call their bluff the hazari might destroy voyager and we would lose you if we reveal ourselves we could be destroyed
you told me without problems to test the limits of your ability you can never expand them
there is one very simple way to narrow the odds we simply link you to our communications system allow our artificial intelligence to probe your mind as it did before and captain janeways plans will be revealed like a jewel in a bed of fog
sickbay to bridge sevens neural transceiver has been activated
acknowledged do it
im transmitting the carrier wave
voyager is sending an interference signal into our systems using her cortical implants as a relay disconnect the link
disconnect the link
they cant understand you
voyager to hazari vessels their systems are down fire the spatial charges
we seem to be experiencing some turbulence
primitive spatial charges i will have the dome back online before they can do any damage
were being pulled out of subspace
ive got a lock on seven
initiate transport
the hazari vessels are converging on the think tank
tom
setting a course
i urge you to reconsider captain
a good guest knows when hes outstayed his welcome
we can still negotiate a peaceful solution do not destroy my faith in diplomacy
your diplomacy could use some polishing
you know you will never be satisfied here among these people is this what you really want
acquiring knowledge is a worthy objective but its pursuit has obviously not elevated you
looks like your ships having difficulties
a minor problem
oh im sure youll find a solution just give it some thought
zeeesh alert alert decompression on platform six eight four brace for hull rupture thrusters are down were going to crash ahhh hey what do you think look at the detail on the dorsal plating
impressive are you sure youre willing to part with it
i just hope your boy enjoys it as much as i do
im certain he will if we make it home in time for his birthday
well make it
if you and savar had a child of your own youd have an excuse to play with toys more often
im detecting a fluctuation in tank four theres a full scale rupture in progress
isolate the deck activate the emergency containment field
the emergency systems are offline
backup controls are down too eject the tank
here theres an inhabited system
we have no choice
the ejection ports arent responding
impossible
theres another rupture forming in tank six
well have to send somebody down there to seal off the tanks manually contact the theta core
communications are down
get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks
i didnt sign up for core labour
im giving you an order
ill be contaminated
now
the flame like emotion is a primitive force left unchecked its chaotic destructive but if controlled it can be a powerful tool the lamp controls the flame as you must learn to control your emotions
i lost my temper no big deal
you destroyed the doctors holographic camera
i told him three times to leave engineering but he kept buzzing around snapping pictures for some photo essay
a day in the life of the warp core
i apologised and i replicated him a new camera
you have a long history of emotional volatility the point of this exercise is not to atone for past transgressions but to prevent future ones
you cant order someone to meditate
commander chakotay thinks otherwise
are my eyes supposed to be open or closed for this part
whichever allows you to focus your mind
envision the flame burning within you
sorry
the flame grows hotter a point of white light follow it backward through the years to a time when you were younger a child is there something amusing lieutenant
im sorry an image just flashed through my mind you as a child those pointy little ears you must have been cute
indeed please follow my instructions or well discontinue this exercise
right me childhood how old
your earliest memories try to recall a time when you experienced uncontrollable anger
daniel byrd
i beg your pardon
he was one of my classmates in grammar school he was always terrorising me he used to point at my cranial ridges and tease me about being half klingon he called me miss turtlehead
that angered you
of course it did so i attacked him once during recess on the gyroswing i disengaged the centrifugal governor he was spinning so fast he almost flew apart then i yanked him off the swing and started pounding his little face if miss malvin hadnt showed up i probably would have
describe the anger you felt at that moment
i i wanted to hurt him to take revenge for all the humiliation he caused me
your anger was a source of strength it protected you gave you courage
i suppose it did
and when the doctor tried to take a holophotograph of you
i was annoyed he kept getting in the way
the rage within you runs deep its been with you for many years
im not a vulcan ill survive
whatever you say miss turtlehead
what did you say
youre easily provoked you must learn to master your emotions
ive had enough mastery for one day schools out
so howd it go with belanna today
our meditation sessions are confidential
no im not asking for sordid details i just want to know if you think you can help her
her training will be a challenge for both of us
take it from me getting belanna to control her temper is like convincing a ferengi to leave his estate to charity
captain were receiving an automated distress call
origin
coordinates one twenty one by two six eight range two billion kilometres
whos sending it
i cant tell
let them know helps on the way set a course mister paris
thirty seven escape pods
theyre contaminated with theta radiation
malon
possibly lifesigns
two but theyre erratic
beam them to sickbay initiate biohazard containment procedures
theta radiation has affected a radius of six hundred million kilometres
source
a malon freighter travelling at high impulse it appears to be abandoned
i thought wed seen the last of the malon
i guess theyre looking for new places to dump their toxic waste
do we know what happened to their ship were they attacked
im just as curious as you are can you revive either of them im captain kathryn janeway
fesek controller fesek where am i
youre on my vessel we responded to your distress call
my ship
its heavily damaged
where
three million kilometres from here
thats too close weve got to get further away
calm down calm down tell me whats wrong with your ship why did you abandon it
we were on a waste export mission
dumping theta radiation
two of the theta tanks ruptured systems malfunctioned one by one communications navigation propulsion we had no choice radiation was venting from every port over sixty crewmen died within minutes it was chaos we stumbled through the gas to get to the escape pods only a few of us made it where are the others
the two of you were the only ones we found alive
listen to me very carefully the fact that were still here means the ship hasnt exploded yet when it does over four trillion isotons of antimatter waste is going to ignite everything within three light years will be destroyed
janeway to the bridge
go ahead
put at least five light years between us and the malon freighter
quickly
you heard her tom
send out a sector wide alert
warn any other ships in the vicinity to
evacuate immediately
our warp field just collapsed
all this theta radiation its disrupting subspace
can you reinitialise the field
negative
tuvok without warp drive theres no chance well clear the blast radius
agreed
mister paris set a course for the freighter full impulse
aye captain
what
if we cant outrun your ship maybe we can disable it
every deck has been contaminated anyone who goes on board will liquefy within minutes
well find a way
we im not going anywhere near that vessel
you can either stay and help us or ill send you back to your escape pod your choice clean them up doctor i need them on the bridge
how long until those storage tanks explode
approximately six hours
can we get an away team on board
the freighters hull is intact life support appears to be operational however thirty three of forty two decks are flooded with high levels of theta radiation
including the control room which is where wed have to go to reestablish containment as i told you
we could beam on to one of the lower levels where theres less radiation and vent the contaminated sections one by one
clear a path to the control room
i appreciate what youre trying to do but if what youre considering were possible wed have tried it before we abandoned the ship we have years of experience aboard freighters of this gradient
your experience is what got us into this mess in the first place
thats enough lieutenant
maybe theres another way
im listening
four hours from here theres a nebula that could protect us from the blast we could alter course wait there until after the explosion
there are at least three other ships in the sector what about them
i dont see what we can do
so hundreds of people become contaminated because youre not willing to clean up your garbage
lieutenant assemble an away team were going over there
wait tell them about the vihaar
whats he talking about
nothing its a myth
what kind of myth
its an old story shared among freighter crews some of them say theyve seen creatures in the theta storage tanks
creatures
created by radiogenic waste according to the legend they are poisonous monsters that wreak havoc aboard malon ships its a common belief among our more superstitious recruits
i never believed it myself but during the evacuation some of the crew people saw something a form
hallucinations are one of the first symptoms of theta poisoning you know that
maybe then how do you explain what happened we checked every system
youd say anything to get out of going back to that freighter
if youd been there youd be afraid to go back too
this chamber seems to be the least affected by radiation well beam in there
thats fifteen decks below the control room
well have to work our way up
the pressurisation systems theyre offline how will we vent the gas
there are two main airlocks on each deck well open them as we go perform a series of controlled decompressions
whats to stop us from being vented
forcefields i spent six years aboard a talaxian garbage scow i know a few things about waste management
even low levels of theta radiation can be lethal
our doctors developed an inoculation itll temporarily prevent our cells from absorbing the radiation
how long will it last
two three hours
half of the doors and bulkheads are fused the ascenders are offline it could take us twice as long as that to reach the control room
then well have to work quickly well take phasers to cut through any obstacles
ive ordered my men to do a lot of risky things but nothing as foolish as this
more foolish than towing around a trillion isotons of toxic waste
we take every precaution to keep it contained
until you dump it in someones back yard
is your crew always so diplomatic
your concerns are noted get them inoculated well meet you in transporter room one
were trying to avoid explosions remember
oh not another lecture about my emotions
no a lecture about how to treat guests aboard this ship
guests chakotay these people are the scourge of the quadrant
agreed but right now theyre our only hope of repairing that freighter so i suggest you make friends
diplomacy janeways answer to everything
this isnt the captain talking its me and im giving you an order keep your temper in check understood understood
yeah
i didnt hear you
yes
belanna i need your expertise on this mission not your bad mood
ill see what i can do
ready neelix
ah not quite do we still have a minute its just its not quite strong enough yet would you mind passing me that little dish
neelix i admire your dedication but the crew can figure out lunch on their own
lunch and dinner and a midnight snack have all been taken care of this is for me its a talaxian theta radiation remedy crushed rama leaf and katyllian clove it helps fortify the cellular membranes
i think the doctors inoculation might be a better way to go
every little bit helps oh by the way thank you
for what
for sending me on such an important mission not that my duties in the mess hall arent challenging
it was an easy choice you were the best man for the job
well our scow once ran smack into a theta radiation field knocked the propulsion out we had no choice but to sit there we were barely alive when they found us if it hadnt been for this nobody would have survived
once you get past the choking reflex its really not so bad want to try some
ill take my chances
transporter room one to commander chakotay were ready to proceed
on our way
belanna arent you forgetting something
i dont think so
a goodbye would be nice so long see you soon something along those lines
i didnt want to risk it
risk what
starting an argument
argument us so i hear its been a short fuse kind of day
about this long
nothing you cant handle
if you think so
i know so
i suppose its always going to be like this
like what
me against the galaxy
well the galaxy doesnt stand a chance now promise me that youre going to be careful over there no stopping to have fun
fun on a malon freighter
see you soon
well its nothing a fresh coat of paint wouldnt brighten up
this way
theta radiation density twenty million ev per cubic metre structural integritys holding wish i could say the same for my lungs
what was that
this corridors filled with methogenic particles highly charged
somethings causing an electrostatic cascade our scanning signals are igniting the particles its the tricorders
take cover
no more tricorders
control mechanisms are down were going to have to open the airlocks manually
wait here well take care of it
belanna go with him
we can do this ourselves
id prefer to keep an eye on your progress
youre on my freighter im in charge here
you abandoned ship remember you take your orders from me
well have to crawl into an injector port its only big enough for two people
pelk you stay with us
shall we
how can you stand to work in these conditions
you think were animals dont you
you said it not me
im a waste controller half the year do you know what i do the rest of the time im a sculptor
whats your point
every year i give up work i love to expose myself to radiation that will probably cut my life in half
then why do it
have you ever been to malon prime its a remarkable place its one of the most beautiful worlds youll ever see our planet would choke with industrial wastes if it werent for the sacrifices of people like me
how many worlds are you willing to contaminate to keep your own home so tidy
do you have any idea of the trouble we go to to locate isolated areas ah manual actuators ill release them you monitor the pressure variance
right
do you have any children
no
i have a son hes seven years old he wants to be a waste controller when he grows up
you must be very proud
ready
torres to chakotay stand by for the decompression sequence
acknowledged
it didnt work
theres something jamming the airlock controls
torres to chakotay weve got a problem the actuators arent working somebodys going to have to go up there and take a look
wait that deck is still contaminated
ill go ive been exposed to worse
wait
one for the road
its probably just the decouplers theyre always getting encrusted with oxides
whos there
help help help
i saw it i saw it
what
the creature
give me twenty ccs of anesthezine
chakotay to voyager transporter status
still too much interference ill try compensating stand by for further instructions
what happened
we dont know he went away for a minute he screamed and we found him here
these look like chemical burns
without tricorders its hard to make a diagnosis
its here
what
the creature
youre hallucinating its the radiation but youre going to be all right
no it attacked me it oh
hes going into shock cortical stimulator
pelk get up
hes not responding
he said the creature attacked him
he imagined it he was probably scalded when that conduit ruptured
or maybe there is someone else on this ship
voyager to away team transporter interference has cleared were locked onto your coordinates stand by
harry pelk is dead lock onto his signal and beam him to sickbay ask the doctor to determine the cause of death
aye sir
someone still needs to get up there and open the airlocks
me
hold on ill join you from now on nobody works alone
progress
theyve vented five decks ten to go
at this rate theyll reach the control room in approximately three hours however the storage tanks will detonate in less than two
ive been working on a contingency plan
an o type star
if the freighter exploded within the stars corona it might absorb the radiation
the star is not on the freighters trajectory
what if we gave it a little nudge
a series of carefully timed tractor pulses could alter the freighters course but given the vessels weakened state one miscalculation could set off the explosion
im still counting on the away team to succeed but i want to be ready with plan b if they dont
i dont know about the rest of you but i could sure use a sonic shower
id love to soak in a hot bath for a day or two
oh no not me i want to feel those sonic pulses dissolving every last atom of this grime off my body
we have a decontamination bay on board that can purge over fifty workers at a time
well that sounds like fun
belanna
im okay just a little lightheaded
your hand
oh god
freighter blight from the prolonged exposure
lovely
in my business its an occupational hazard
wed better try inoculating you again
if shes blistering shes already received a fatal dose of radiation she needs treatment
ill live lets keep moving
we have medicines in the infirmary its only two sections from here
we dont have time for a detour
belanna go with him well meet you outside the control room
chakotay im fine
i said go
this is the infirmary it looks more like a morgue what happened to him
it looks like he was being treated for long term exposure he was probably left behind during the evacuation
tough luck huh
there was nothing more we could do for him he was a core labourer
meaning
he worked close to the storage tanks only three of ten core labourers survive a standard mission
occupational hazard
they know the risks when they accept the assignment
they know theyre going to end up like this
core labourers can make more in two months than most malon make in a lifetime
what good is the money if theyre not around to collect it
it will go to his family
what is that thing
its a subdermal injector it contains analeptic compounds to reverse the cell damage
i feel better already
i wont hurt you ive done this a hundred times youll feel a slight burning sensation
commander the captains plan b ive calculated the inertial force required to divert the freighter plan c shield modulations that should reduce the structural damage of voyager it will also help protect the crew against theta radiation poisoning if we fail
a wise precaution with any luck we wont be needing it
i didnt think vulcans believed in luck
as a rule we dont but serving with captain janeway has taught me otherwise
she does seem to succeed more often than random chance would allow ill factor it into my calculations
is there a plan d
no
initiating decompression sequence deck four deck clear
twelve down three to go
the airlocks are opening on this deck
what
i cant close them
forcefields where are they
theyre offline
weve got to get off this deck move
this way
chakotay
he was right behind me
torres to chakotay
that deck is a vacuum by now
torres to voyager
acknowledged
lock onto chakotays comm signal and beam him to sickbay
weve got him hes okay
i thought that deck was secure
it was
then why did we almost get blown into space
i dont know
airlocks dont open by themselves
what are you saying you think it was me
calm down both of you we dont have time to argue about what happened weve got to keep moving
chakotay
unconscious but stable the doctor is treating him now well be able to talk to him in less than an hour
ill want a full report
shall i beam to the freighter and take command of the away team
i just spoke with belanna shes got everything under control
this is a dangerous situation there is no margin for emotional error
we have plenty to do here help me remodulate the tractor beam
belanna is unpredictable captain under these circumstances her volatile nature could compromise the mission
your concerns are noted but if i send you over there id be sending the wrong message that i dont have faith in her but i do
your faith is admirable but logic suggests
this isnt about logic its about trust shell come through for us now give me a hand
lieutenant lieuten are you all right
fine report
we just vented the last deck we should have a clear path to the control room
lets get this thing over with then
if you need to rest
i said im fine i was meditating
meditating you
do me a favour dont tell tuvok
your secrets safe
its this place
i know how you feel the next time i volunteer to board a malon freighter check me into sickbay and have my head examined
i feel like im ready to explode
well get through this together ive got a knack for diffusing explosive situations
thanks
torres to astrometrics
go ahead
were outside the control room
but without tricorders we cant tell if its safe to go in there
the room is too heavily shielded our sensors cant penetrate it
you must stand by
the theta dampening field is still active it should be safe
after you
its worse than i expected the theta gas has leaked into the warp manifold
weve got less than ten minutes before this vessel explodes
emergency systems are down
this should feed enough energy to your power matrix to reinitialise them try it now
theyre coming back online but only one containment grid is still operational we have two unstable tanks one grid cant handle them both
well seal them one at a time
doctor
easy commander
ow my head aches
im not surprised you took a severe blow
ive got to get back to the freighter
not in this condition if you want to help you can answer some questions about mister pelks death ive found unidentified tissue in his wounds
what sort of tissue
the computer is running a microcellular scan
pelk said he was attacked
ah yes the malon bogeyman
microcellular analysis is complete
odd the tissue is saturated with theta radiation but its not showing signs of decay it came from someone or something thats developed a resistance to the radiation sickbay to seven of nine
yes doctor
scan for additional lifeforms aboard the malon vessel
ive been running continuous scans
i assure you there is no one there aside from the away team
this lifeforms heavily irradiated it could be blending in with ambient toxins
ill recalibrate our sensors
tank one stable
reroute the containment grid to the tank two
what happened
a power surge were losing the grid
it was triggered from a workstation on this deck
janeway to away team
weve detected an alien lifeform aboard the freighter we believe it killed pelk
captain we just lost power
were diverting the freighter into a nearby star leave the control room so we can get a lock on you
acknowledged
whats going on
its jammed
seven of nine
to away team ive detected the alien lifeform its moving toward your position
the gas is being routed through the environmental systems
ill try to shut it down
is there another way out
no
do you have them
not yet
the lifeform has entered the control room
im trying to vent the gas but the release valves are jammed
use the environmental controls instead
in the meantime see if you can get that hatch open
neelix
no youll ignite the gas
neelix
weve got to get him back to voyager get that hatch open
im trying
fesek behind you
youre a core labourer
not anymore
stay back dont make me kill you
im already dead
youve been sabotaging this ship
theres no other way to make them understand
so thats your way of getting even killing your crew causing an explosion that will contaminate other ships
they poisoned me
the freighter is on course for the star
away team weve adjusted the vessels course its heading for an o type star
you have to get out of there now
no no
the freighters manoeuvring thrusters just activated its altering course
compensate
no effect im detecting radiation surges in the theta tanks theyre going to detonate in three minutes
harry
as long as theyre in the control room i cant get a lock
janeway to away team get those manoeuvring thrusters
offline then get out of the contaminated area we cant get a transporter lock on you
get the hell away from there now
no its too late
okay okay look i know what theyve done to you they used you you want to hurt them listen listen to me i know i know that youre so angry you want to destroy everything in sight but theres another way to make them understand im on your side i can help you innocent people are going to die if you do this
no its over
please please please let me help you
no
step away
the malons thrusters are powering down
i have restored the freighters trajectory
belanna get out of there
come on weve got to go fesek
the away team mister kim
i got them
maybe the meditations working
what makes you say that
from what neelix told me you kept your temper in check over there
dont expect me to make a habit of it
well ive repaired most of your cellular degradation  i wish i could say the same for you but youve suffered long term systemic damage your condition will deteriorate over time
its an occupational hazard
weve contacted a malon transport ship in the next sector weve altered course to rendezvous with them
thank you captain i dont know how im going to explain what happened
tell them the truth tell them the vihaar is no myth
computer activate sonic shower
so harry throws it in gear floors the gas and backs us right through a burrito stand
so when are you going to teach me how to drive
you sure youre ready
ive piloted starships i think i can handle a car
youd be surprised the clutch on a 69 mustang can be pretty tricky
take a look shes watching us again
shes working relax
dessert
what is it
some cheese i prepared for our kadi guest tell me what you think
its a little bland
just a little oh thats bad the kadi dont approve of spices anything that might inflame the senses
youre talking this mission very seriously
the kadi are easily offended the captains leaving their representative entirely in my hands while shes at the colony
im sure youre up to it ambassador
i hope so
shes watching us again
youre imagining things
i dont think so
belanna
enjoying the view
explain
youve been staring at us all night in fact you were following us yesterday when we were walking to engineering and the day before when i was waiting for tom outside the shuttlebay
you are correct i have been observing you its part of my research on human mating behaviour
stardate 52647 fourteen hundred hours subjects quarrel in corridor outside females quarters male returns with twelve flowering plant stems species rosa rubifolia effecting a cessation of hostilities stardate 52648 oh three hundred hours intimate relations resume how the hell do you know when were having intimate relations
there is no one on deck nine section twelve who doesnt know when youre having intimate relations
is there a problem
i want all the data youve collected
i havent completed the study
then study this borg provokes klingon klingon breaks borg nose
belanna
call sickbay tell them theres about to be a medical emergency
belanna lets go have a nightcap
this time youve crossed the line
i read belannas report needless to say i was surprised
i was careful not to violate protocols
thats not the point this is a starship not a nature preserve oh im missing a pip
you asked me to broaden my knowledge of human behaviour
im not questioning your goals seven its your methods you shouldnt be taking field notes on the crew help me with this will you please
have you ever considered trying it yourself romance i mean
i do not require a romantic relationship
so whyd you collect thirty thousand gigaquads of information on the subject im late
i missed this on my first pass through their database kadi monks only wash with purified water so sonic showers are out
ive already equipped his quarters with an ablutionary fountain built to their specifications
they observe eight daily services
noted
show the ambassador our best side neelix i dont want him going back to his superiors with tales of how immoral we are
energise
the ritual greeting
travellers who have left the sanctity of their home and family we welcome you into our home our family
accept these symbols of our purity and the goddess mothers blessing
commander tuvok the senior officer who will accompany me and mister neelix who will familiarise your ambassador with voyager
tomin is an excellent judge of character hell help us determine whether your crew is worthy of receiving our minerals
hes in very good hands
it is time to welcome you to our home
this way ambassador
voyagers an intrepid class starship with a crew of one hundred and forty six designed for longterm exploration i thought wed start with a tour of our primary systems first stop engineering
i was hoping i might sample a food item i noted earlier in your data files hasperat
its a bajoran dish very spicy i believe that your dietary protocols prohibit flavourful foods
i want to broaden my palate while im here in the interest of better understanding
in that case first stop mess hall
your cortical implants are operating at peak efficiency nanoprobe levels stable complaints
none
i heard about the mess hall incident
this crew can be very efficient at disseminating information when they choose to be
they say gossip travels faster than warp speed so why were you studying tom and belanna
scientific curiosity
are you sure perhaps theres a reason that hasnt occurred to you youre a woman seven
is that an observation or a diagnosis
a simple biological fact with repercussions that are hard to deny
what is your proposed treatment
perhaps you should consider expanding your research to the realm of dating
dating you mean procreation
one step at a time dating is a human ritual wherein two people share a social activity get to know each other in time it can lead to a romantic involvement and eventually if all goes well even marriage
one step at a time
this could be an important stage in your social development its worth exploring
the captain would seem to agree how shall i proceed
you mean we ill prepare a lesson plan meet me on holodeck two in one hour most women start dating a little younger than you but better late than never
ive prepared an introduction i call it love amid the stars  the milky way home to thousands of humanoid species and countless courtship rituals klingon males initiate courtship by biting the female here we see two bolians getting to know one another  the courtship rituals of some species remain shrouded in mystery for example species 8472 appears to have as many as five sexes bystanders better keep their distance of course the species youre most likely to interact with is human so without further ado lesson one first contact there are any number of ways humans can meet prospective mates here we see the chance encounter equally common is the formal introduction when first contact is successful romance quickly ensues and in the happiest of circumstances procreation here we see how fortress ovum is besieged by countless little warriors
doctor i am familiar with the physiological processes of sexuality
oh then lets skip ahead to the first of the practical exercises lesson two encounter in a public place computer initiate holoprogramme paris three
our location
chez sandrine its on earth in a city called marseilles ensign paris whiled away a good portion of his academy years here no doubt to the detriment of his scholastic performance now pull up a bar stool and pretend youve come here to meet the man of your dreams hi there
hello
come here often
this is my first time
you must be new in town how do you like the south of france
it is very quaint exactly as ive always pictured it
may i buy you a drink
i dont require a liquid supplement at this time
youre not giving this a fair chance
this exercise is pointless
it may seem pointless but small talk is a vital dating skill it helps to establish a rapport with your companion
perhaps theres something to be said for assimilation after all
all right why dont you try your own approach on that gentleman over there go ahead
very well
hello
hello
may i buy you a drink
er sure steven price
and you are
seven of nine tertiary adjunct of you may call me seven
seven thats an unusual name please have a seat
looks like sandrines is under new management who deleted my pool table
shush school is in session
more social lessons
watch you might learn something
curious jewellery
its a borg implant i was a drone
oh so then its a family heirloom
borg do not have families they have unimatrices
well in that case why dont you tell me about your unimatrix
theyre hitting it off dont you think
hes a hologram
your point
well you programmed him to interact with seven real people dont respond the same way
under my guidance shell be dating real people in no time
youre teaching seven how to date ha talk about the blind leading the blind
ive had my share of romantic encounters are you implying that seven couldnt get a date
are you kidding half the men on this ship would jump at the chance but getting a date is one thing keeping it from turning into a disaster is another
i have every confidence in her social skills
well fine lets say you get her a date this is the holodeck the cards are stacked in her favour if you want to really put her to the test you have to do it in the real world where anything can happen
mister neelix is hosting a reception for the kadi ambassador on thursday night not only will seven arrive with a date she will have him eating out of the palm of her hand
put your latinum where your mouth is if seven brings a date to the reception and leaves with the same date on good terms without causing a diplomatic incident i will work double shifts in sickbay for the next month
and if she fails
i get a month off
its a bet
where are you going
our small talk is terminated i have mastered this exercise we can proceed to the next
if i were you id start looking for somebody to fill in for me
one ktarian pudding
mmm ah mmm ah the texture is so frothy it seems to be evaporating in my mouth
the recipe includes a catalytic agent designed to do just that if we dont hurry well miss lieutenant torres shes been waiting half an hour
youre right engineering your warp core i must see that
in our society males and females work separately but i can see the wisdom of your approach promotes a more stimulating environment
its time for third prayer
yes it is but i think i can forego this service and perform the appropriate penance later its more important that i continue exploring your culture perhaps another dessert
good morning its time for lesson three getting to know you
elaborate
the key to finding a compatible partner is learning how to share your interests and goals well start with hobbies what do you do with your spare time
regenerate
ah tell me about your tastes your likes and dislikes
i dislike irrelevant conversations
okay which brings us to goals what do you want out of life
perfection
perfection is a laudable goal for oneself but you cant expect it from others i learned that lesson myself when i was first activated one of the ways i adapted was to pursue interests people could identify with holophotography for example opera
music does have intriguing mathematical properties
excellent perhaps we can mould this curiosity into an interest something you can share with others lets see how much you know here we see
a basic musical phrase in the major mode ive done a preliminary study of the topic
sing it for me  seven has anyone ever told you you have a beautiful voice its a true gift
the gift is from the collective a vocal subprocessor designed to facilitate the sonic interface with borg transponders
lets try something a little more challenging
you are my sunshine
its a simple melody from earths twentieth century a good piece for beginners sing
the other night dear as i lay sleeping i dreamed i held you in my arms
that was flawless but try putting a little more emotion into it like this when i awoke dear i was mistaken and i hung my head and cried see computer add instrumental accompaniment on to the chorus together now
you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey youll never know dear how much i love you please dont take my sunshine away  you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey
youll never know dear
how much i love you please dont take my sunshine away
seven i need the data from those last two astrometric scans
in a moment
that looks like the crew manifest
the doctor asked me to pick a suitable candidate
for what
lesson ten the first date
your first date
ive narrowed the list to two crewmen based on work performance and compatible interests
i didnt know you had any interests
neither did i but apparently they include astronomy quantum mechanics and music
i play the clarinet you know
you are not one of the candidates ensign
oh well maybe i could help you pick mister right
ensign bronowski assigned to the airponics bay his work record is flawless and he plays the accordion
badly very badly hes got no sense of humour
lieutenant chapman structural engineering
chapmans a nice guy
we worked together on an away mission he seemed efficient
robertson if thats you i need an isolinear spanner
it is not
i apologise lieutenant i didnt mean to startle you
no my fault you need something
your presence is required er rather it is requested tonight nineteen hundred hours holodeck two
another engineering simulation
dinner
dinner
the consumption of nutritional biomatter
no i know what dinner is i just are you asking me to join you
yes state your response
okay yes
please be punctual
i will thanks
a dropped tool can be a workplace hazard be more careful next time
seven please state the nature of the medical emergency
i have a date
sorry im late
its quite all right in fact why dont you take the day off relax those double shifts are going to take a lot out of you
oh
seven of nine has a date tonight if all goes well as im sure it will hell accompany her to the reception tomorrow
whod she pick
lieutenant william chapman
ha chapman good luck
whats that supposed to mean
hes renowned for being nervous around women
so
are you kidding sevens dominant personality will have him running for the airlock before dessert
seven may seem intimidating but thats only a reaction to the way people treat her in fact shes an efficient and charming young woman
efficient ill give you that but charming
most people dont take the time to look beyond her exterior did you know she has a lovely singing voice
no i didnt but then again ive never asked her to sing for me
what are you implying
it sounds like youre getting a little infatuated with your star pupil
infatuated thats absurd
whatever you say maestro
it was part of the lesson plan
youre meeting with him in ten minutes seven why arent you ready
i am
arent we forgetting something lesson eight dress for success
my appearance is sufficient
sufficient yes but you could use a little more panache lets start by doing something different with your hair i dont have much firsthand experience with this but try shaking your head a little bit
is this more appropriate
yes when i first designed your dermaplastic garment i also tried my hand at some casual attire you might want to replicate one of these
how shall i choose
i think youd look very nice in this one
i am uncertain how to wear such a garment assist me
oh i i im sure youll manage ill go prepare the holodeck remember the idea is to have fun tonight ill expect a full report in the morning
you you look beautiful
thank you you look beautiful as well
thank you er would you like to sit down
where is our designated location
best table in the house i wasnt sure youd actually show up
i requested your presence
well to be honest i thought one of my friends put you up to it champagne
synthehol impairs my cortical function water will suffice
mind if i
proceed
i must admit im a little nervous
elaborate
oh lets just say its been a long time since ive been out on a date
ive never been on a date as a result i am experiencing anxiety as well
well i guess that means weve got something in common garçon
server report to this station we require your assistance
problem
this creature has an exoskeleton
its a lobster theyre a delicacy on earth try it
i will replicate you a new garment
im fine fine its just a little bit of exoskeleton maybe we should order dessert
you wish to accelerate our social encounter
no no i didnt say that im just er im having a very interesting evening would you like to dance
that activity is covered in lesson thirty five i havent reached it yet
im not much of a dancer myself but it might be fun
as you wish
relax try to relax you seem a little tense
relaxation would disrupt my chronographic sequencer it allows me to maintain synchronous movement with the music
thats handy but maybe you could ignore your chronographic sequencer and er let me lead thats better
you are damaged
no ill be all right
youve torn a ligament im afraid youll have to report to sickbay mister paris will treat you no need to mention how this happened
i had a great time seven lets do this again someday
i have failed
nonsense even romeo and juliet hit a few snags at first besides lieutenant chapmans not the only lobster in the sea
i wish to terminate our social lessons
just because you didnt achieve perfection your first time out doesnt mean you should give up
dating is a poor means of interaction there is far more efficiency in the way you and i communicate we say what we mean simply and directly
you and i do have a rapport but were colleagues were not pursuing romance
no
im certain youll be able to master these basic skills in short order
my first date was certainly short
was that a joke
lesson six beguiling banter
now youre getting the hang of it perhaps this evening doesnt have to end so abruptly this may be a good time to cover lesson thirty five shall we dance computer play someone to watch over me instrumental only well begin with some simple steps place your left hand on my shoulder and your right hand in my left now follow me one step at a time dont worry i dont have any ligaments to tear
another drink
ambassador
neelix my friend my host my saviour neelix i want you to meet alandra and tria
what are you doing
im sampling yet another entrée on the menu of pleasure that you have opened up for me
i checked todays menu and theyre not on it coffee black
neelix i decided to go exploring and i found your holodecks where i discovered this little gem still simmering in the memory buffer
you can explore it later right now weve got to get you to your reception
pungent taste what is it
coffee and theres plenty more where were going
no coffee on our colony nothing to tempt the appetite of even the most weakwilled novitiate neelix a confession i am thinking of leaving the colony joining voyager i want to throw off my vows and immerse myself in your wonderful culture
thats just the synthehol talking
no ive never been more clearheaded about anything and i have you to thank
thats right up there we go
hard at work
our lessons have disrupted my duties
then i suppose youre too busy to attend the ambassadors reception
my presence is not required
true but it might be an opportunity for you to apply your newfound social skills
lesson eleven life of the party
exactly join me
are you asking me on a date
i suppose i am
then i accept is my appearance sufficient
you look perfect
how do you bend a holograms ear use a prism what did the counsellor say to the hologram youre projecting
this humour its a revelation
are you sure you wouldnt prefer some more coffee
coffee yes ill have that too go
neelix is it my imagination or is our guest of honour drunk
commander i tried i had an itinerary i even set up a prayer dais in his quarters but i just couldnt control him the captain is due back in the morning with the kadi minister what do i do
pray
well well well what do we have here
mister paris i believe you know seven of nine my date for the evening
oh you dont say well your last date ended up in sickbay i hope this one goes a little smoother
theres no need to be insulting
its all right doctor i believe he is merely engaging in small talk may i get either of you gentlemen a drink
yes a gin and tonic with a twist
you know i dont drink i dont have the stomach for it
a wellcrafted joke doctor
impressive youve actually taught her to be polite but dont think youve won our bet she was supposed to bring a real date
photons and force fields flesh and blood why quibble over details im just as real as any of you
wheres the funny man
mister tomin please why dont why dont we sit down
oh there he is there he is ensign paris tell us another one of those hologram jokes
youve been stealing my material
that guys so lubricated hell laugh at anything
there he is the ambassador of humour
i could use a little help here
seven perhaps now would be a good time to review lesson twenty three toast of the town
very well
ladies and gentlemen i require your attention may cultural differences encourage us to build bridges of understanding to all that makes us unique
who is that extraordinary female
seven of nine
i want to meet her
take a number
that was lovely
thank you
ive got to admit it youve done wonders all right you win
win
i know when im licked you tell me when you want me to start those double shifts
you made a wager regarding me clarify
its not what you think
er dont blame him it was my idea
i believed your interest in my social development was sincere not motivated by personal gain
it was sincere
clearly i am not the only one who requires social lessons thank you for a lovely evening
hey why dont we go back to my quarters ive studied human mating rituals
remove your hand or i will remove your arm
did you hear what she said to me i am the guest of honour
ambassador its been a long day maybe you should get some rest
no im not leaving i want another drink
i thought synthehol wasnt supposed to have this effect on people
most people the enzymes that break down synthehol arent present in his bloodstream
can you counteract the effects
i can synthesise the enzymes but thatll take days
days the captain will be back in the morning
maybe he needs a cold shower
if his superiors find him like this hell be banished from the colony and our trade agreement will go right out the airlock
oh seven of mine
it may be possible to encode some of my nanoprobes to assimilate the synthehol molecules
assimilate me
there may be some adverse effects
please
but its worth a try
the kadi have rules against medical procedures that havent been sanctified
id say hes already violated a few rules whats one more
either we treat him or he remains intoxicated youre his caretaker decide
nanoprobes
i owe you an apology
nanoprobe extraction is an insignificant procedure my systems will adapt
no im referring to the wager i made with ensign paris i can see how you might have felt manipulated but i assure you that was never my intention
i accept your apology
i want to make this perfectly clear so theres no room for misunderstanding i asked you to go with me to the reception because i enjoy your company in fact over the last few days i feel as though weve grown closer
closer
weve become more than colleagues were friends
friends agreed i should begin
of course
ill take over from here mister paris hypothetically if one develops romantic feelings for another person how does one usually go about expressing them its for one of sevens social lessons
ah i recommend the direct approach tell the person how you feel
what if the feelings arent mutual
well thats the risk you always take
oh thank you
why dont you tell her come on doc its obvious the ambassador is not the only one in this room whos intoxicated
impossible shes my student
a hologram and a borg stranger things have happened just look at me and belanna
er could we walk a little slower
theyre due back any minute
but my throat feels like an ancient parchment cant we go back to sandrines for a refreshing glass of
no no no no no no no no no no no
those doors theyre so loud
youve got a hangover
neelix i dont remember much of last night but i imagine i might have said some things
you spoke eloquently charmed the entire crew your reception was a success understand
yes neelix youve been most patient
well thats my job and it isnt over yet
welcome back
good to be home hows it going
all systems functioning normally ensign kim detected a minor fluctuation in sensor array but he took care of it
i was referring to ambassador tomin did he enjoy his visit
oh well well i would say that he er he enjoyed himself immensely
there are many distractions aboard this vessel you didnt indulge in any of their more colourful traditions
of course not
we followed the itinerary that you approved to the last detail
oh shame
your holiness
it isnt a violation to explore new experiences as long as you dont make a habit of it
i see your point
shall we conclude our negotiations captain
by all means
ill show you to the briefing room
good work ambassador
do you like them
species rosa rubifolia state your intention
i wanted to congratulate you on the latest phase of your social development why dont you read the card
you are my sunshine
these past few days have been unforgettable youve brought light into my life seven
you have developed romantic feelings for me
its as if youve become a part of my programme when were apart i i feel like im missing a subroutine  i dont expect you to reciprocate but i wanted you to know how i feel  computer end programme
enter seven
i wish to speak with you
what a coincidence i was hoping to speak with you as well
regarding
you first whats this
its a medical tricorder i enhanced its scanning resolution by thirty three percent you once stated you desired a more efficient instrument
i suppose i did
it is a gift lesson twenty two thanks for the memories is it insufficient
no no its very thoughtful
i chose to convey my gratitude at this time because i no longer require your assistance its obvious there are no potential mates for me aboard this vessel however if i encounter a compatible individual in the future i will again seek your guidance
guidance of course
you said you had something to tell me
i just wanted to say the past few days have been unforgettable thank you
youre welcome
computer activate holoprogramme paris three
wont you tell her please to put on some speed follow my lead oh how i need someone to watch over me
good morning
morning
requisition reports for the week
thanks
what can you tell me about the great wall of china
pardon
the great wall of china on earth who built it
the chinese
what for
why does anybody build a wall to keep people out
deck one
in fact it was the first qin emperor who connected the walls built by a previous dynasty he did it to prevent an invasion by nomads to the north how big is it
i have a feeling youre going to tell me
twenty four hundred kilometres long median width three point eight metres before the twenty second century it was one of the only manmade objects that could be seen from earths orbit with the naked eye
very impressive neelix i had no idea you knew so much about my homeworld
status
were on a course for the class y cluster we should be there in about three days
gives us some time to relax carry on why this sudden interest in the great wall
ive been studying earth landmarks
mister paris and i have been exchanging a little crosscultural trivia hes become quite an expert on talaxian geography
all right heres one for you what can you tell me about the millennium gate
the millennium gate constructed in the 21st century in the united states of america it was another one of the objects that could be seen from orbit er three point two kilometres at the base one kilometre in height surface covered with highly reflective solar panels a selfcontained ecosystem
it became a model for the first colony on mars did you know that one of my ancestors built it
really
not with a hammer and nails but with words and a lot of courage shannon odonnel one of the first woman astronauts she was the driving force behind the project
thats something to be proud of
we were always told stories about her at family gatherings the first of a long line of janeway explorers
tell me more i want something to stump mister paris with
where to begin
the millennium gate how did she get involved with that
well at that time she was still in the space programme but shed also become something of an entrepreneur i believe she was asked to join the project by the governor of indiana he wanted her expertise on recyclic life support systems the way my aunt martha tells it they flew her in on a private aircraft
five am december 27th 2000 im in the great state of indiana i think i saw the worlds largest ball of string this morning and the worlds largest beefsteak tomato this afternoon it was the size of a volkswagen the string not the tomato at least christmas is over oh no
excuse me i think i made a wrong turn is there a millennium gate around here
youre looking at it
the sign said gas food lodging i need all three
you wont find any of that here get back on the interstate and go to exit nine
i dont think im gong to make it
good luck
tell me are people a little friendlier off exit nine
oh no
you stopped
you didnt got a pen
i i just didnt see you im sorry are you okay
insurance
not really
not really
it ran out
its not too bad two hundred bucks ought to cover it
two hundred bucks
let me guess the money ran out too
hi
hi
the sign said open
yes thats right till six oclock can we be of assistance
its cold outside and i wondered if i could wait here
for what
for the tow truck my car broke down im trying to get to florida
she doesnt look like a corporate hit man
i assure you im not at least not anymore
well in any case shes unarmed and chilled to the bone i think we can handle her zeus himself watched over travellers we should follow his example make yourself at home
thank you
wheres your car
down the street next to the coffee shop what used to be the coffee shop it looks like this whole town is closed down
it is
except for you huh
this ship will never sink right dad
decaf not exactly the nectar of the gods
itll do thank you
whats this about if i may ask
preserving the past
im jason by the way
shannon odonnel
im henry henry janeway
hi so youre trying to get them to stop building this millennium whateveritis
the millennium gate the worlds first selfsustaining civic environment
thats what the propaganda calls it its nothing but hype its actually a glorified shopping mall theyve talked all of my neighbours into selling their businesses only one thing stands in their way
youre the last holdout
this time rome withstands the barbarians
i may be able to help you if youd be willing to hire me
believe me you dont want to be licking stamps for the next two days
we could do all this on a computer
yeah but my dad doesnt believe in computers we dont even have one
well i do we can email every computer within a hundred miles itll just take a few hours its easy
im not hiring anybody right now besides youre going to florida
maybe the tow truck is waiting thanks for the coffee
youre welcome
i wouldnt ask you for a lot just enough to fix the car i really i kind of need a job right now
dad
i suppose we could use some help
you do believe in electricity dont you
so who are these barbarians anyway
a company down in texas
why come here
the city fathers made it easy for them free building permits deferred taxes new roads so the invaders they return the favour they have offered us twenty percent above the market price for our properties you know what the catch is weve all got to sell
everybody must love you
people i knew when i was growing up family friends it seems like theyve all just turned against me if this were roman times theyd feed me to the lions
to the good old days
you know i was born in the wrong millennium
ill stick with the modern age
the classical age greatest literature mankind ever produced
no antibiotics
families whod take care of one another
no cars
air you can breathe
no telephones
what a pleasure
shorter life spans
lives that were worth living
no cold beer
there you got me speaking of the modern age do you have any plans for the millennium eve
no different than last years millennium eve i plan to be asleep
life of the party
oh dont tell me youve bought into all that hype again
oh maybe just a little
last year when 2000 arrived everyone was convinced it was the dawn of a new era but when the world didnt end and the flying saucers didnt land and the y2k bug didnt turn off a single light bulb youd think everybody would have realised it was a number on a calendar but oh no they had to listen to all those hucksters who told them the real millennium was 2001 so this new years eve will be as boring as last year
come to think about it i have sold an awful lot of doomsday books
see what i mean
so whats in florida
i have a cousin down there ill stay with her for a while until i can get back on my feet
if you dont mind my asking did you lose your job
im in a transitional period
from what to what
from what i was doing to what im going to do your son tells me that your bookstores belonged in your family for generations that youve never done anything else
yes thats right
you know im just the opposite i love to see places ive never been try new things im kind of an explorer
really hmm that station wagon of yours doesnt exactly look like a sailing ship
its a rocket ship
my mistake
we have every intention of breaking ground on monday day one of the next millennium the people of this town have given us their full cooperation
thats not true
if youll let me finish mister janeway with the exception of mister janeway here
mister janeway would you like to comment
yes yes i would you you just cant you cant bulldoze this town away this this is our heritage this is our past
were trying to give portage creek a future cant you see that
yeah yeah your your future your future not ours
mister moss weve heard youre considering moving the project to one of your alternate sites can you shed any light on that rumour
im afraid thats more than a rumour if we cant work out an arrangement in portage creek well have no choice but to select another location
what city
no comment
is it true that canton ohio has been chosen for the alternate
thank you for your time
thank you mister moss
well thats that all we have to do is stand firm till new years
easy for you to say i have to go to school with their kids
your school is one of the first places theyre going to tear down
they said theyd build a new one a better one
whose side are you on im sorry were all in this together come on lets head back to civilisation
where shall we dine tonight ah how does paris sound
its friday night can we get a reservation
well i think i can arrange it i know the maitre d
too bad i dont speak french
well well keep it to ourselves there to new friends
and a gracious host
bon appetit
i wouldnt mind visiting paris one day
yes itd be nice
you havent been
i havent been outside indiana these are my travelling companions theyll take me anywhere anytime
its not such a bad idea to experience the real thing every now and then
i prefer my books
maybe you just never had the right guide
is that an offer i could make a similar argument not such a bad idea to settle down every now and then
is that an offer youre a peculiar man mister janeway cloistered away with all your books shutting out the world
any more peculiar than exploring the midwest in an ailing station wagon
only slightly any word on my car
its got a brand new oil pan
you forgot to tell me that
well we were busy today its parked behind the garage whenever youre ready
first thing in the morning
not so fast jason told me you promised to show him a few tricks on the computer
i could use another day of rest
great jasonll be pleased and when youre done with him perhaps well take a stroll along the boulevard st germain
youre making it difficult to say goodbye
maybe thats the idea
you wished to see me captain
i need your help with this the millennium gate
impressive
it was built by one of my ancestors over three hundred years ago ive been digging through the historical database but a lot of the information from that era has been lost or damaged i thought you might be able to help me reconstruct some of it
is this relevant to our present mission
its relevant to me
this ancestor of yours is fifteen generations removed you only possess a small fraction of her genetic material insignificant
this isnt about chromosomes seven its about character
explain
shannon odonnel inspired me when i was a girl she had a an influence on my imagination on my goals
i never realised genealogy could have such an impact
i wouldnt have become a starfleet captain if it wasnt for her
the temple of artemis at ephesus
thats four
the colossus at rhodes
no in chronological order
right the mausoleum of halicarnassus the colossus at rhodes
that leaves just one more
the seventh wonder of the ancient world is
cant remember
oh its right on the tip of my tongue its forget it i give up
ha i got you its the er
cant remember
the lighthouse of alexandria built by ptolemy the second in 280 bc
behold the wonder of the modern world borg photographic memory well call this one a draw
brushing up on earths history
captain janeway requested that i research one of her ancestors
shannon odonnel
youve heard of her
who hasnt you mind if i lend a hand
if you wish
sven buttercup hanson
he was one of my progenitors a twenty second century prizefighter the captain encouraged me to investigate my genealogy as well
well your ancestors can tell you a lot about yourself
somehow i doubt buttercup has much relevance to me
the connection could be deeper than you think sven seven
a coincidence
the point is theres some of him in you just as therell be some of you in your descendants
if i choose to procreate
i wouldnt dismiss it so lightly someday you may enjoy a little seven of nine point five running around or not or not
my research has failed i have found no references to this individual
well genealogys a lot like fishing youve got to cast a wide net computer expand record search for subject shannon odonnel to include nonfederation databases er personal archives and photographic indexes as well
reference found
well take a look at this shannon janeway
where in the world did you find this
a ferengi database
ferengi
eleven years ago one of their historians collected massive amounts of data about the origin of space travel in the federation he wanted to market it as a nostalgic gift item
i would have been his first customer
its a handsome family captain
these must be her sons and daughters grandchildren greatgrandchildren
ive also discovered journalistic accounts in the historical archives mostly articles concerning resistance to the millennium gate
the whole town was against her download this image for me will you neelix im going to frame it
yes captain
the citizens of canton ohio greeted millennium gate representatives with a small parade today canton is one of three alternate sites now being considered by gate officials vowing not to bow to pressure henry janeway owner of portage creeks alexandria books says he has no intention of closing down marci collins channel three news
next stop mars i used to be in media relations with nasa as i recall your class came up with that slogan do you mind its a shame you didnt make the cut
not good enough i guess
do you still keep in touch with any of the others
no
i do in fact i made a few calls last night remember lieutenant mcmillan
hows she doing
copilot on the joint mission with the europeans scheduled for 03 four months on the space station
not bad for a girl with claustrophobia
she got over it sorry to hear about your last job all this downsizing in aerospace engineers arent given the respect they deserve
who told you i lost my job
i made a few calls you dont have to live like this borrowing money sleeping in your car
youve got no business checking up on me
actually i do we run a history on all our candidates
are you trying to make me some kind of an offer
we know youve been working closely with henry janeway hell listen to you
oh you want me to talk to him get him to change his mind
if you can
and in return
wed give you a job make you a consulting engineer on the project you certainly have the credentials well
ill think about it
think quickly we cant wait another thousand years
roger that and go ahead
thats one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
morning
morning
i didnt think youd mind youve got some really great games on this
dont worry about it have you tried matrix of doom
oh yeah i got vaporised on level six
try launching a flare before entering the steel fortress
cool coffee
please where is your father
bloomington all the suppliers in town are boycotting us so he went up there to place some orders
he left you in charge
alexandria books may i help you
sounds like youve got it down
i pay the bills too dads not very good at accounting you have any kids
no
not a priority
i wouldnt say that i just never got around to it if you dont mind me asking wheres your mom
she died
oh im sorry
i was really young i dont remember her much dad says none of the great heroes grew up in a nuclear family hercules achilles odysseus they all grew up with single parents
youre in good company you like working here jason
its okay
you know i get the feeling you dont share your fathers enthusiasm about preserving the past
i dont know the millennium gate could be pretty cool
did you ever see the first landing on the moon one small step for man
they showed it in science class one time
i saw it on tv when i was eleven years old the whole world watched it
must have been great
oh it way so do you have any heroes
we are not living in a heroic age thats what my dad says
come on theres got to be somebody
dad i mean hes a pain sometimes but hes pretty cool  alexandria books may i help you thats all right first call in three days and its a wrong number
glorious hector son of priam slips past the greek front lines bringing muchneeded supplies to the embattled city of troy
hey dad youre famous
local business owner topples gate
let it fall any customers this morning
no one here but us galliforms
thats chickens for the nonscientists in the crowd
you two are dangerous together portage creek will thank us one day you dont sacrifice history for a shopping mall
its a little more than that henry
i beg your pardon
i said its not just a mall
have you read the promotional literature over six hundred retail spaces available franchise potential
theres a commercial dimension to the project but thats not its only function
whats your point
ive learned a few details about the millennium gate its a selfsustaining city an experimental biosphere its never been done before
whats wrong with the biosphere were living in now
nothing
exactly
but this project will help scientists learn more about our environment possibly even recreate it on other worlds
other worlds dont we have enough problems on the one were on
yeah which is why id like to get the hell off it one day
i think youre taking this exploring a little too far
and youre so afraid of change you can barely walk out that front door the millennium gate has a lot of potential henry you just cant see it all you can see are these books youre living in the past
sounds like youve been sleeping with the enemy
having a beer anyway
moss
he offered me a job
doing what
consulting engineer
on the millennium gate
i said id think about it
and he said get janeway to sign on the dotted line and youre hired
thats one way of looking at it
and when i say no then what youre going to go with them right to canton ohio or the third circle of hell or wherever it is they decide to build this damn thing
i cant keep living out of my car
you dont have to stay here
no
why not
because i cant
thats not a reason
because i dont want to youve been really nice to me henry but i cant get stuck here
stuck like me
i didnt say that you can live however you want to
and so can you
whats going on
were helping our guest resume her journey
but i thought you were staying here for a while
something came up
we can manage by ourselves i guess saying goodbye isnt that difficult after all
jason jason where you going
aunt pats happy new year
jason jason
it was around 2210 my uncle jack was on a deep space mission to beta capricus
thats when deep space meant the next star over
and that was when they still had to go into stasis so jack put his crew under as soon as they left orbit and piloted the ship by himself for six months
no contact with anybody along the way
there wasnt anybody along the way not back then the transmitter wasnt even subspace it took weeks to get a message back to earth
i would prefer stasis
me too that long alone id probably go a little batty
so six months to beta capricus and when they finally arrive theres nothing there
no planets
no no star no nothing it turns out beta capricus was just an em echo of a distant galaxy
what was his course of action
what else could he do he turned the ship around and headed home
and the crew
he figured there was no reason to bother them theres nothing to see nothing to do so six months later he gets back to earth brings everybody out of stasis and they wake up wondering why they havent left orbit
come in
oh i didnt realise you were in a briefing
not at all were talking about our family histories
oh this can wait may i join you
please
i too come from a distinguished line
his cousins an electric shaver
hardly my programme was compiled from the most advanced holomatrices in the federation my cousin was a prizewinning chess programme
ensign paris you have yet to elaborate on your family origins
well they were a pretty ordinary bunch salt of the earth type people farmers mostly some planetary colonists ah but there was one he was a pilot he flew the first orbital glider over the lower martian plateau
mars your ancestor must have known the captains
she did work on all the early mars projects looks like we go way back mister paris
what was her name
shannon odonnel
odonnel i dont think so
what do you mean
well i know all the mars projects from the 1970s on unmanned manned whos who there were no odonnels in any of them
come in
ships status report
let me guess the holographic engineer is having problems with her programme neelix the cardassian cook is low on supplies seven of twelve is regenerating and captain chakotay is doing just fine just wondering how theyll piece together our lives a few hundred years from now
depends on how big the pieces are
a padd here a captains log there maybe a couple of holodeck programmes it wont be as much to go on as we might think ive gone through dozens of histories written about twenty first century earth all of them biased in one way or another the vulcans describe first contact with a savagely illogical race ferengi talk about wall street as if it were holy ground the bolians express dismay at the low quality of human plumbing and human historians exact same story every culture saw it a different way so i go back to the raw material birth certificates death certificates marriage certificates census surveys voter registration forms housing records medical employment court records its all fragmented and incomplete
so did she exist
her name was shannon odonnel she did train to be an astronaut but she didnt finish she was an engineer but never worked on the mars missions
did she work on the millennium gate
only as a consultant
what about all the opposition you spoke of you said she fought to get the project underway
there was no opposition in fact the millennium gate was greeted with open arms by the local population except for one man
henry janeway
she married him and changed her name but she certainly never changed history
dont be too hard on her she may not have known she was supposed to live up to your expectations
oh ill get over it the question is when we get back to earth how will i break the news to aunt martha
with less than three hours to go henry janeway still refuses to cooperate with millennium gate representatives ill return with live updates as midnight approaches marci collins channel three news
i dont suppose theres any chance hell change his mind
by midnight doubtful
then it looks like well have to scrub the launch at least where portage creek is concerned its a shame how one ignorant man can stand in the way of progress
its not that simple
henrys a very likable guy but hes playing for the wrong team hes looking back this town needs people who look towards the future
well while youre looking forward ill be driving to florida
wait a minute im not about to turn a fellow explorer out into the cold
i didnt hold up my end of the bargain
if we didnt think you had something to add to this project we never would have made the offer in the first place henry janeways pigheadedness doesnt change that we could still use your help just not here
my associate in canton ill tell him youre on the way hell find a place for you
shannon
whats the matter
its dad
see you in ohio
he wont leave the shop theres all these people outside the police are there
your father can take care of himself
please wont you talk to him hell listen to you
no he doesnt jason
where are you going and whats this about ill see you in ohio
ohio florida
whats wrong with this place
it didnt work out
i thought you liked us
i do
then why are you leaving
im sorry
december 31st 2000 eleven fifteen pm ive got ninety five miles of interstate before i have to decide whether i head east or south but those ninety five miles wont be uneventful my guidebook tells me im not too far from leonardo da vincis last supper recreated entirely in corn
the last few days have been memorable to say the least i met henry janeway interesting man liked to talk unfortunately he doesnt listen to anybody but himself he gave me a place to stay though and we had dinner in paris no less he has a son good kid bright like his father
i personally dont regret a single day ive spent in this lovely town and i want to thank you all for your encouragement and support
would you consider extending your deadline
excuse me im sorry
no further
im afraid thats not possible wed like to express our deepest regrets to the town of portage creek and on behalf of excuse me
get this
let her through
were closed
its me
i said were closed
thats not what the sign says damn it henry its cold out here
whos with you
nobody but us galliforms
thought youd be in ohio by now car break down again what the hell are you doing
get your things were leaving
im not going anywhere
do i have to drag you out the front door
you can try
henry
i wont leave
its over
then ill have to ask you to leave
half the town is out there youre on the news maybe youll go down in history you have made your point
obviously i havent because if i had you wouldnt be asking me to sign my life away
maybe if youd looked up from your books once in a while youd see whats in front of you
oh please no more speeches about the future
as long as i dont have to hear you pontificate about the past
its a deal glad we had this chat goodbye
its almost midnight henry
exactly ive won
what have you won the right to hide behind these shelves for the rest of your life
its worked so far
well it isnt working for your son or this town or me
look i know youve got a job to do
oh this isnt about the job
then why are you here
it was the cookies
cookies
i was on the interstate i stopped for gas and i bought a bag of chocolate chip cookies in a convenience store its a little ritual of mine whenever i get back on the highway i like to treat myself
i see well er what does this have to do with anything
they didnt taste good henry it wasnt the same i just kept thinking about you and how i wish youd been there
actually i prefer oatmeal cookies im allergic to chocolate
oh you dont know what youre missing its been a long time but im starting to feel like maybe i found a place where id like to stick around for a while with you and jason
and wed like to have you
but i cant work in a bookstore for the rest of my life ive been given a second chance henry and i cant lose that im stuck in the future youre stuck in the past but maybe we could get unstuck in the present
i i dont see how with without sacrificing my
you know mister moss offered me a job in canton even though i failed to keep up my end of the bargain i guess he felt sorry for me but im prepared to turn him down if you want me to stay with you
i suppose i could reopen my shop in that monstrosity you want to build
well ill have a few connections i could probably get you a nice remote location so nobody would bother you
not much profit in that you sure you wont drive away again
no but if i do well make the trip together
what time is it
a minute to midnight
then were not too late
neelix to captain janeway
yes
captain would you mind coming to the mess hall
is there a problem
no no emergency but i need to speak with you a personal matter
give me a minute
happy ancestors eve
happy ancestors eve captain
whats all this
its april 22 ancestors eve its a holiday first established er well er today actually with the captains permission
neelix
i think hes onto something captain an evening of reflection in honour of those who came before
here here uncle jack would approve
it got me out from under a warp conduit im all for it
i appreciate what youre trying to do but
neelix the gift
what gift
shannon odonnel janeway circa 2050 we did a little more research this photograph was taken in a small park near portage creek thirty eight years after the dedication of the millennium gate i thought it would look nice in your ready room on the shelf next to your desk
thank you but im not so sure she has a place there any more
you are mistaken captain
oh
her life captured your imagination historical details are irrelevant
i concur with that analysis
if it werent for shannon odonnel you never would have joined starfleet
yeah and i would have never have got you all stuck here in the delta quadrant
it gave us all time to get to know each other
time for a family portrait of our own everyone gather around the captain please face the camera smile
to family
to family
another one for posterity
no no
i think we should get out of here
enough is enough
knock it off kieran thats an order
youre late
sorry sir
whats the threshold of the htwo molecule
fourteen point seven electron volts
third brightest star in orion
viewed from where
earth
gamma orionis or bellatrix if you prefer the original arabic name
not bad now give me a hug katie thats an order
i wasnt expecting a pop quiz
just wanted to make sure all those pips havent made you forget youre a scientist first
how could they i still have nightmares about your fractal calculus final
theres still some work to be done but once the sawdust clears i think youll be impressed voyager may not be as big as a galaxy class ship but shes quick and smart like her captain
seven hundred thousand metric tons fifteen decks and computer systems augmented with bioneural circuitry top cruising speed warp nine point nine seven five
deck one
of course i expect to get that up another notch or two
sounds like you already know your ship pretty well
ive been buried in voyagers schematics for the past three months i could walk the corridors blindfolded
you might not want to shut your eyes just yet
captain on the bridge
as you were its bigger than i expected
schematics never fully prepare you for the real thing
try it on dont get too comfortable i have more to show you
your home away from home
coffee
ah no thanks
coffee black any word from tuvok
not yet
shouldnt he have made contact by now
we know hes aboard chakotays ship hes probably decided not to risk exposure until he has to
catching up with him in the badlands is going to be tricky even in a ship as quick and smart as voyager ive heard about a pilot who might make the job easier
whos that
tom paris
admiral pariss son correct me if im wrong but hes serving a sentence for
hes made some mistakes but everybody deserves a second chance
ill look into it
if its not too late id like to recalibrate the navigational sensors i think i can enhance the range
your coffees not even cold youre already making changes
excuse us ensign i like a ship that knows where its going
i assure you voyager has the best sensors in the fleet
theres always room for improvement
i assume youve read
i have a few changes
the bridge is clear no sign of the weapon
continue scanning
acknowledged
your briefing room
starfleets most up to date vessel and they still cant design a comfortable place to hold a meeting what do you think ensign
captain
whats your opinion of this room
it is an efficient design
well there you have it admiral its efficient i must be wrong carry on
weve added a new system were thinking of installing throughout the fleet
the emergency medical hologram im up to date computer activate emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency
its programmed with over four million surgical procedures
five million and the medical knowledge of over three thousand cultures
impressive
did you call me to chitchat or is there an actual emergency
its personality could use some work
im designed to practice medicine as efficiently as possible small talk only compromises my performance
thank you doctor computer deactivate emh
hello
sir
lieutenant carey i dont think weve met
jameson anna service number eight six zero seven nine zero
im not security im just trying to get to know all the new faces around here what are you working on
i am attempting to realign the eps manifolds
do you need a hand
no
well maybe ill see you in the mess hall later
unlikely
hmm
i am not a member of voyagers crew im on assignment here at utopia planitia
too bad well next time im in the neighbourhood ill drop by and say hello
i wish starfleet would give me more than three weeks with a little more time we could really explore the badlands
you havent changed a bit
main engineering class nine warp drive tricyclic input manifold youll be the first to test it in deep space
ive localised the temporal distortions deck four section thirty nine
ive found the weapon
begin the procedure
problem
one of the eps relays just went offline
voyagers first malfunction
im sorry captain i tested those systems this morning
as you were lieutenant ive been looking forward to getting my hands dirty
the weapon is out of phase youve sent me to the wrong time frame
at least we know where the weapon was placed now we have to determine when
this hatch is locked from the inside
this isnt a secure area none of these hatches should be sealed
im reading some kind of chronoton flux
chronotons
its coming from inside this jefferies tube
patterson to security seal off deck four
ive been detected i must leave
theres too much interference from the weapon recalibrate your temporal transport beacon
understood
we can access section thirty nine through here
scramble the locking mechanism before they get in hurry theyre approaching your coordinates youll need to reset the command controls
stand by were trying to get you out of there
its time pull her out
theres too much interference if i transport her now well damage her bionetic implants
if we dont captain janeways going to find her and itll contaminate the timeline
sir
now
temporal transport in progress
question admiral what causes a chronoton flux of point zero zero three
i dont know
neither do i but whoever or whatever it was its gone now
the subject is approaching the temporal threshold
i told you this was going to happen shes dead
any luck reviving her
no sir
well have to recruit her again
sir a fourth jump she could suffer neural damage even temporal psychosis
unless we repair the timeline shes going to die were giving her another chance to save her crew and herself well go back and retrieve seven of nine a microsecond before the explosion that way no one will notice shes gone tempus fugit lieutenant

follow the light to the left right and up and down hmm
i ran a complete selfdiagnostic
hmm hmm
at first i thought my ocular implants were malfunctioning however after consulting the starfleet medical database i realise it is a flaw in my human physiology
specifically
im experiencing dizziness double vision after considering all potential environmental and genetic factors ive concluded im suffering from albrightsalzman syndrome
a rare neurological condition that hasnt affected a single human being for over two centuries unlikely
human physiology is imperfect susceptible to a variety of disorders
true but in this instance we can safely say that you are suffering from a mild case of sensory aphasia a minor disruption to your neuroreceptors neither rare nor lifethreatening
apparently i was in need of a second opinion
thats the danger of selfdiagnosis patients always assume the worst this should clear it up how do things look now
normal
doctor please report to sickbay
on my way next time your human physiology fails you dont consult the database just call me
you are the database
with two legs and a splendid bedside manner
a curious exercise
yeah pingpong you should try it its a great test of handeye coordination
i dont require testing
yeah so the doc tells me a visual acuity index of ninety nine point six you know youd be great at this game why dont you be my partner in the doubles tournament tonight chapman was supposed to play but hes come down with a nasty case of space sickness
im busy
oh too bad well i guess ill have to tell belanna that you thought you couldnt beat her
youre attempting to appeal to my vanity
is it working
i will consider your request
its yes or no seven the tournaments tonight
yes
great meet me in the mess hall at nineteen hundred hours well get in a little practice first
captain you dont look well come in please
im sure its nothing serious
symptoms
nausea dizziness
it looks like a simple case of space sickness the third one ive treated today
thats odd we havent run into any turbulence
its possible the inertial dampers are out of alignment
even so ive been on some pretty rough rides its never affected me like this
it happens to everyone twenty milligrams of inaprovaline should restore your space legs
ill check the dampers double check your bioreadings see if theres another explanation
yes
point server
its all in the wrist
score
nineteen eighteen
say goodnight harry
what do you call that shot
im reading temporal distortions
report
the temporal distortions are fracturing spacetime throughout the ship
cause
unknown they appear to be emanating from deck four section thirty nine
weve already erected forcefields but theyre not having much effect if we cant find a way to stop them theyll tear the ship apart
how much time do we have
two hours at most
go to deck four and find out what were dealing with lets see if we can find a way to enhance the forcefields
an injection a day keeps space sickness away you try to be funny after treating thirty seven cases of nausea
janeway to sickbay
go ahead
weve found the source of our epidemic temporal distortions
i was beginning to suspect some kind of anomaly ive designed a treatment that seems to be inhibiting the symptoms
keep me posted
aye captain
neelix to the doctor ive got a medical emergency in the mess hall ensign mannus is violently ill
on my way take over here
doctor shall i whip you up a photonic snack
wheres the medical emergency
i hope youre not referring to this pot roast
you called me a few minutes ago you said ensign mannus was ill
i did
yes
ensign mannus is right over there he came in an hour ago and he looks perfectly normal
acute space sickness
good thing you were here
i wouldnt have been if you hadnt temporal distortions
doctor
this is all starting to make sense in sickbay its fifteen hundred hours forty three minutes but in the mess hall its fifteen thirty six
seven minutes earlier
i did get a call from you you just havent made it yet
coffee black  come in before you say anything let me remind you what happens to bearers of bad news
dont kill the messenger
go ahead fire
it looks like these spacetime fractures are growing stronger were detecting temporal paradoxes throughout the ship
paradoxes
internal chronometers show its oh six hundred on deck nine and oh six hundred five on deck thirteen times passing more quickly in some parts of the ship and slowing down in others
maybe that explains why this coffee tastes like its three days old
the same things been happening in the mess hall food replicated less than an hour ago is already spoiled
ive been working on a way to enhance our containment fields to keep the fractures from spreading
ill get a team on it right away in the meantime we should evacuate the affected areas
see to it
theres one other problem
turbolifts two and three are offline so weve been using the jefferies tube
captain
theres a temporal distortion intersecting this room its expanding
time to test your new containment fields
this is where theyre coming from i still cant tell whats causing them
what is it
a piece of technology its emitting temporal distortions
why cant i see it
my ocular implant can detect irregularities in spacetime
torres to bridge weve found the problem
theres some kind of device in junction beta twenty eight
beam it off the ship
i cant get a lock
the distortions are beginning to demolecularise the hull hull breach ventral section fourteen
captain im picking up a strange reading on deck four
what kind of reading
its a chronoton flux point zero zero three
more distortions
i dont think so
dry dock
maam
the first time i saw these readings was five years ago voyager was still in dry dock same readings same location
what caused them
i never found out
were losing structural integrity
multiple breaches all decks emergency systems are failing
the distortions are ripping us apart we have to abandon ship
all hands this is the captain proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship repeat abandon ship
programme the pods for a heading of one seven eight mark four well rendezvous in orbit of an m class planet at those coordinates repeat all hands proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship
identify yourselves
no time
welcome back
why have you brought me here
for some reason i always think youll remember im captain braxton this is lieutenant ducane youre aboard the federation timeship relativity
im no longer in the twenty fourth century
no for you its almost five hundred years later weve brought you here to help us solve a mystery someone we dont know who has planted a weapon aboard voyager its designed to fracture spacetime within a radius of one hundred and fifty metres
why do you need me
your ocular implant it can detect disruptions in spacetime better than our sensors
youre more familiar with voyager and her crew less likely to arouse suspicion so far youve been quite useful
so far
weve recruited you twice before for this mission take a look a force three temporal disrupter your previous attempts to disable it have been unsuccessful
were trying to catch the saboteur before he places the weapon on voyager
do you have a suspect
not yet
do you know when the device was placed
not precisely but weve narrowed the window to a period two years before you joined the crew when the ship was under attack
species three two nine the kazon
our database indicates voyager was boarded twice during that period
the kazon are an inferior species they dont possess the technology to create such a complex weapon
we believe the saboteur infiltrated this time frame because voyagers shields were down it was the perfect opportunity to evade the detection
if i fail you will recruit me again
if necessary thisll be the third time youre going to be removed from your time frame if we do it a fourth there could be certain side effects
side effects
you might experience sensory aphasia it affects the cerebral cortex and can lead to temporal psychosis
but in your case were hoping third times a charm eh
ill do my best
bring her up to date on our protocols
aye sir
when youre finished here meet me in holomatrix one ive prepared a simulation
lets see how much youve assimilated the dali paradox
also known as the melting clock effect it refers to a temporal fissure which slows the passage of time to a gradual halt
the pogo paradox
a causality loop in which interference to prevent an event actually triggers the same event
excellent can you give me an example
the borg once travelled back in time to stop zefram cochrane from breaking the warp barrier they succeeded but that in turn led the starship enterprise to intervene they assisted cochrane with the flight the borg was trying to prevent causal loop complete
so in a way the federation owes its existence to the borg
youre welcome the seven of nine paradox
i beg your pardon
how we do know that my presence on voyager will not alter the timeline
you know youve asked me this every time
whats been your response
that uncertainty is part of the equation we dont know whats going to happen
i dont enjoy uncertainty
neither do i but i trust captain braxtons instincts just as you trust captain janeways
this is a simulation of junction forty nine on voyagers fourth deck thanks to you weve learned that the temporal disrupter was and will be concealed here i gave up trying to keep my tenses straight years ago
how will i disarm it
youve already tried unsuccessfully the weapons out of phase youll have to find the saboteur before he plants it this will detect any chronoton flux other than your own and im authorising you to use whatever force may be necessary
understood
one more thing watch out for the janeway factor
i am not familiar with that protocol
your captain has a knack for sticking her nose where it doesnt belong especially when it comes to time travel
captain janeway is quite resourceful has it occurred to you that she may be helpful
helpful that woman has been responsible for three major temporal incursions
no doubt creating numerous paradoxes
and who do you think had to repair the damage me shes reckless she has no regard for the integrity of the timeline i asked for her help once she refused and i ended up stranded in the late twentieth century have you ever been to that time frame
no
well i dont recommend it after three decades with those postindustrial barbarians i had to go through extensive rehabilitation before i could return to duty avoid contact with janeway thats an order
yes sir
this will occlude your borg implants ready
yes
we have a saying in our line of work theres no time like the past
raise shields time frame stardate 491235621 delta quadrant spatial coordinates twenty one alpha prime by nine three six zeta target uss voyager

another kazon ship is approaching
janeway to engineering we need warp engines
i cant give them to you not until ive repaired the containment generator
time
ill need ten minutes at least
captain im picking up a strange reading on deck four
what kind of reading
its a chronoton flux point zero zero three
any idea whats causing it
not yet
it could be random interference from kazon weapons fire
i dont think so ive seen these readings before
theres no sign of the weapon
any uninvited guests
not yet
the lead vessels been disabled the others are regrouping
belanna status
warp drives online but the containment fields still unstable warp two is the best i can give you
ill take it engage
theyre not pursuing
dry dock
maam
the first time i saw these readings was over two years ago when voyager was in dry dock same readings same location
what caused them
i never found out the signal vanished before we could isolate it erect a level ten forcefield around that section
is this really the time to be chasing sensor ghosts
something tells me this is more than a coincidence seal off deck four tuvok youre with me
theyve erected forcefields around my location i may have been detected how shall i proceed lieutenant respond
whats wrong
the forcefields are blocking our transmissions
compensate seven of nine report
relativity are you there
its no use sir she cant hear us
i dont believe weve been introduced ensign
lower the forcefield
i stand corrected we have met utopia
planitia the briefing room you told me it
was efficient
janeway
youve
mistaken me for someone else
oh i dont think so
so here you are two years later
on the other side of the galaxy imagine that
youre preventing me from completing a vital mission
who are you and what are you doing on my ship
dont say anything
she cant hear you sir
my designation is irrelevant but i assure you i have no hostile
intentions
somehow i dont find that very comforting are you working with the kazon
no i am not
im detecting biomechanical implants they have a borg signature
janeway to the bridge scan the vicinity for borg ships
did you say borg
do it
you will find none
then how did you get here
im no longer borg
then who are you
i cant answer your questions
good
why not
it would be a violation of the temporal prime directive
youre from another time
yes
no
who sent you
i cant tell you that i would be risking damage to the timeline
i dont care if history itself comes unravelled i want to know
why youre on my ship
whats that
you must release me
why
voyager is in grave danger
so weve noticed
not from the kazon from an act of sabotage ive been sent here to stop it the intruder has already boarded the ship please your lives depend on it
youre not going anywhere until you tell me whats happening
my name is seven of nine im a member of your crew rather i will be a member of your crew
ive travelled back in time to try to prevent a disaster that will destroy voyager
get her out of there
im trying
lets see if ive got this straight youre a borg drone attempting to prevent a disaster that wont occur for another three years
three years six months and two days
does this make any sense to you
like most time paradoxes its implausible but not necessarily illogical
captain when you take me from the borg you are going to tell me that part of being human is learning to trust trust me now
lower the forcefield
seven of nine to braxton respond
stay where you are were pulling you out
that would be unwise i am pursuing the saboteur
with captain janeways assistance
tempus fugit
proceed
yes sir the intruder is in junction fifty two beta
take the starboard hatch
aye captain
captain braxton lower the temporal disruptor
its armed ill activate it lower your weapons
janeway
have we met
too many times but you wouldnt remember they havent occurred yet
seven of nine report
i have located the saboteur
who is it
its you
captain braxton
me
more accurately a future you
now let me complete our mission
our mission i dont know what youre talking about
listen
very carefully the circumstances of your life are going to change in the next few years youll be sent into rehabilitation again forced to retire and its all because of voyager
captain i believe your future self is suffering from temporal psychosis
well of course i am you pedantic drone the only way for me for us to recover is to obliterate voyager from the timeline that way none of the events that caused this illness will have occurred
what events
thirty years of exile on twentieth century earth the temporal inversion in the takara sector three violations that i had to repair
can you get a lock on him
negative hes activated a dispersal node i should say youve activated a dispersal node
dont be absurd i have no wish to sabotage voyager
not yet
remodulate the transporters find a way to cut through the interference i gave you an order lieutenant
im sorry sir im taking command of this vessel and im relieving you of duty for crimes youre going to commit
i havent done anything
seven of nine
apprehend braxton
no
relativity hes escaped
im tracking him hes travelled to another time frame two years earlier
transport me to those coordinates
that would be your fourth jump
i am aware of the risks
stand by
thank you for your assistance
theres still some work to be done but er once the sawdust clears i think youll be impressed voyager may not be as big as a galaxy class ship but shes quick
take cover
security report to deck four section twelve erect forcefields around all access points is this part of the tour
ive lost him
hes still on voyager
but hes gone five years ahead
initiate transport
yes
point server
its all in the wrist
score
nineteen eighteen
who are you
bridge intruder alert deck two
explain
no time you must apprehend him hes trying to destroy voyager
seven of nine status
i am incapacitated its sensory aphasia
stand by
im pulling you out
stop him your future depends on it
braxton
i disabled his tricorder hes trapped there seven of nine is pursuing him she is efficient she will succeed
lets hope so because weve run out of options
you again
i dont believe weve met ensign no im wrong we have met captain braxton
not anymore ive lost my rank thanks to you
seven of nine to seven of nine whats your status
weve apprehended braxton how shall we proceed
stand by
long time no see
are you all right seven
i believe weve just prevented voyagers destruction
would you care to explain how you
the timeship relativity
we need your help
this seven of nine stopped braxton but she created several temporal incursions along the way she instigated a phaser fight at utopia planitia she was seen by you and lieutenant tuvok two years before she joined your crew and she interacted with her past self in front of fifteen crew members at a pingpong tournament approximately six minutes ago your time frame of course
of course
needless to say we need to clean up the timeline someone must go back to the beginning and prevent the chain of events from occurring in the first place
i cant make another jump without damaging myself
i get the feeling im about to be drafted
in exchange for leniency captain braxton informed us of the precise moment he boarded voyager to plant the weapon well be sending you to stop him tell her
deck four section thirty eight ill stumble over a wounded crewmember that will be your chance to capture me
dont miss it or well have to do this all over again
wait a minute let me get this straight im going back in time to stop braxton but you already have him
and theres a third one in our brig i arrested him earlier today but dont worry theyll all be reintegrated in time for the trial
and seven
oh i assure you when all this is over therell be just one seven of nine
all right lets get started before my headache gets any worse
captain a kazon torpedo just blew out the containment generator do you want me to reroute emergency power or take the warp core offline
use your best judgment
i thought you were on your way to the bridge
i have to take care of something first now get moving lieutenant
send damage control teams to decks nine through fourteen seal the breaches if you can ill be on the bridge keep me informed
yes maam
oh
come here often
incursion factor point zero zero three six its better than i expected
glad we could lend a hand when do we go home
youll both be returned to your time frame youll be reintegrated with the other seven of nine since none of your time jumps were to your foreseeable future only the past i see no reason to resequence your memory engrams but remember the temporal prime directive discuss your experiences with no one
understood
oh captain braxton was right about one thing voyager shows up on our sensors far too often try to avoid time travel
see you in the twenty fourth century
i look forward to it or should i say backward
dont get started
show mercy
your people have a saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me in other words your credits no good here
ill pay you back double with next months replicator rations
thats what you said when i let you replicate all those pork rinds for your monster movie marathon
let me put it another way this is a life and death situation
hyperbole wont help
im not exaggerating this is the anniversary of my first date with belanna
and you forgot all about it
yes and if i dont come through with some kind of romantic dinner
all right youve made your case
neelix youre a saint okay thatll be one bottle of mouton rothschild a 2342 if its in the database a terrelian pheasant steamed asparagus and a single rose
where do you want it
you can send the food requisition to belannas replicator the wine and the flower ill take with me i cant show up emptyhanded
neelix how about a pot of coffee while youre at it
coming right up
flowers and wine
ah anniversary coffee
bridge duty ive got eight hours ahead of me
sitting in the big chair again
fourth night in a row
youre not fooling anyone
excuse me
you love these night shifts your chance to play captain
im not playing this is an opportunity to get command experience you might put in for some yourself
oh whats the point of trying to compete with an ambitious upstart like you just promise me one thing when you reach the top youll remember all the little people you climbed over to get there you wont make them work night shifts
helm status
same as it was twenty minutes ago
refresh my memory
current speed warp six point three heading oh twenty one mark two permission to speak freely sir
granted
were on the night shift relax
one of these days youll get the call to take the bridge and maybe then youll understand the burden of command
report
its an automated distress call
origin
a class m planet range point seven three light years bearing two six one mark one five
that would be a significant course change
the burden of command is on your shoulders sir of course we could always wake commander chakotay
no alter course
open a channel this is ensign kim of the starship voyager can we be of assistance
im not picking up on any lifesigns i guess they didnt make it
there could be any number of reasons why were not detecting lifesigns well have to go down there and take a look ill inform the commander oh jenkins the bridge is yours
i hope i made the right decision
about changing course or waking me up
sorry sir but i thought
relax harry you did the right thing on both counts hey why dont you lead the away team ill monitor your progress from the bridge
yes sir
the distress call was automated
thats right im hoping whoever sent it is still alive
whos leading the mission
youre looking at him
really
problem
no i just thought given the circumstances a new planet unknown hazards that commander chakotay or tuvok would be in charge
i am a senior officer doc ive been on this ship for five years i think i can handle an away mission
i certainly didnt mean any offence
none taken
of course having me on the team will certainly compensate for any lack of experience on your part
energise
are you sure these are the right coordinates
positive
apparently whoever sent the distress call was rescued
maybe but as long as were here we should make a thorough search spread out
ensign
this is the source of the distress call
what is it
i dont know paratrinic shielding a dense energy matrix bioneural circuitry
bioneural
whoa back off this could be dangerous
no wait its speaking to us
speaking
in duotronic algorithms hold on my translation matrix is interpreting it says its injured it needs our help its asking why it cant see or feel its arms and legs its terrified can you identify yourself its saying that its memory has been damaged it doesnt remember its name dont worry were going to help you crewman lang will remain with you
what do you think an artificial intelligence
one that doesnt seem to realise its artificial
maybe we should tell it the truth try to jog its memory
no i dont want to risk psychological trauma
psychological trauma doc this is a machine
one which is confused and asking for our help we should beam it aboard
not until we know what were dealing with away mission protocols dictate that we
morality dictates that we help it may not be flesh and blood but its clearly in distress
make way for the day shift
hows he doing
well lets see i havent heard from him in almost five minutes so he should be checking in right about
away team to voyager
now
thats our harry if i were you id watch out for your job go ahead ensign
we found the source of the distress call its some
kind of artificial intelligence badly damaged the doctor thinks we should beam it aboard
youre in charge of the away mission ensign what do you think
well i think we should help it if we can but as a precaution i recommend sealing off an engineering bay with a level ten force field and
beaming it directly there
agreed give us a few minutes
were going to transport you back to our ship im voyagers emergency medical hologram a projection of light and force fields guided by an optronic computer programme no technically speaking i suppose im not a real person
hows our patient
complicated it uses bioneural circuitry to mimic humanoid synaptic functions
but its memory core is damaged its suffering from a technological form of amnesia
any theories as to what it might be
it could be a probe or a communications device
whoever our friend is he wasnt alone he claims to have been travelling with a companion
if theres another one down there it might give us a few answers ill be in astrometrics scanning the surface give our guest my regards
of course captain lower the containment field
how are you well thats an interesting question ensign kim and lieutenant torres are attempting to repair your damaged circuitry thats what i wanted to talk to you about youre not an organic being youre technological youre an artificial intelligence embedded in a machine of some kind no theres no mistake we believe the damage you suffered in the crash is causing your confusion look at it this way you and i have something in common just because were not organic beings doesnt mean were in any way inferior well youre metallic over a metre in length cylindrical oh youre quite sleek actually youre welcome
im detecting no further technology on the planet surface
maybe the second device was destroyed when it crashed scan for metallic particulates consistent with our friend in engineering
there are minute traces scattered across the northern continent
isolate an impact crater
it spans a radius of two hundred kilometres
and look at this heavy concentrations of radiogenic decay in the crater walls and the fracture gradients are consistent with a highly focused explosion
evidently weve discovered its function
a weapon of mass destruction
i understand your concerns but the device hasnt shown itself to be hostile
not yet but its only a matter of time before it puts the pieces together
all the more reason we should talk to it explain our concerns ask for help in defusing its explosive components
if its programmed to detonate theres no telling how it will react
agreed we have to neutralise the threat now suggestions
transport the device off the ship and destroy it before it harms anyone
seven this is a sentient being were talking about
very well return it to the surface and deploy a warning buoy to alert other vessels
i refuse to believe our only options are to kill it or abandon it
what if we could separate the bioneural circuitry from the explosive
take the weapon offline but salvage the intelligence
theyre fully integrated where would we store the intelligence once we shut the device down
the answers obvious download its synaptic patterns to a holographic matrix like mine
then what
try to find out where it came from and return it to its people
the device is extremely complex one error and wed risk detonation
saving life often entails risk
harry belanna assist the doctor
thank you captain
at the first sign of danger we transport it off the ship understood
understood
i quite understand i wouldnt like being carried around either of course you are who wouldnt be were taking you to sickbay because were better equipped to help you there
deck five were going to transfer your intelligence to a holomatrix you should be pleased in a little while youre going to be walking around just like me
im not certain ensign kims configuring your physical parameters as we speak im sure youll be quite handsome
are we ready to proceed
whenever you are
dont be alarmed we have to access some of your systems to enable the transfer he says he wants to know exactly what youre doing as you do it
this is a delicate procedure i wont be able to concentrate if i have to give a blowbyblow description
youll have to forgive lieutenant torres shes an excellent engineer unfortunately she doesnt share my bedside manner
harry would you mind
yeah sure er well first were going to be setting up an active interlink between you and the holosystems er now to do that er were going to take your programme offline while we resequence your bioneural circuitry
he says he cant allow you to shut him down
im sorry but theres no other way
its arming itself the detonation sequence has begun
sickbay to bridge the device is going to detonate
beam it off the ship
weve lost the transporter lock
talk to it doctor
please youre going to destroy yourself and us
detonation in twenty seconds
belanna send an em pulse through its power matrix maybe you can short it out
im on it
fifteen seconds
please disarm yourself were just trying to help you
ten seconds nine
initiating the pulse
six five
now
it worked
we shut it down captain
you shouldnt have done that
i know youve gotten a little attached to this thing but
you lied
what are you talking about
you said you were trying to transfer my neural patterns but you were really trying to shut me down
youre the artificial intelligence
it used the interlink to commandeer the doctors programme
sickbay to bridge captain respond hes tapped into the ships systems deactivated the comm
hes locked us in too
you tried to destroy me
we were only trying to disarm you
im a weapon
yes
why didnt you tell me
it was a precaution we were afraid you might be dangerous
obviously we were right
i couldnt let you destroy me i have to complete my mission
you remember it now
yes im a long range tactical armour unit ive been deployed by my people theyre facing a terrible threat a hostile species my companion unit was destroyed but i will reach my target your ship will take me there
look well try and contact your people if you could tell us who they are
i must resume my mission
the weapons been rearmed
security
they still cant gain access to sickbay or any part of deck five for that matter
get a transporter lock on our people well jettison the whole damn section if we have to
i wouldnt recommend that captain if you try to stop me again ill detonate your ship and everyone on it will be destroyed
doctor
hes gone
hes directing us to a system two point three light years from here
is that your home
its my target the course ive plotted bypasses enemy minefields dont deviate from it your ship wont be harmed once weve reached the system youll transport me to my target
we wont help you wage war this crew has a prime directive that forbids us to interfere in the affairs of other species
youve already interfered
we were trying to help you
until you discovered my true nature then you tried to deactivate me
just your explosive components not you
theres no distinction i am what i am now alter course or ill detonate
if you do that youll never reach your target will you
i am programmed to take whatever measures are necessary to obtain my objective failing that im to consider anyone who tries to stop me an enemy now alter course and transfer your sensors to me so i can monitor your compliance
release my crewmen from sickbay first
im not programmed to negotiate theyll remain were they are
lay in the course mister paris transfer sensors to sickbay
a sound tactical decision captain
assemble the staff were going to find a way to outsmart a smart bomb
if we could shut down the force fields around sickbay i could get a transporter lock on it
even if you were successful we cant beam it far enough from the ship to escape the blast
shes right our best option is to disarm it
good luck its got an internal sensor array if we try so much as to loosen a screw boom
commander i think you should take a look at this its a power node i used to enhance the replicator system i acquired it last week on a trading mission it has transkinetic energy regulators and bioneural control circuitry remind you of anything
our friend in sickbay
i didnt make the connection at first but when i overheard a few of the engineers talking about the weapon i went back and i checked the schematics on this its the same technology
who did you acquire it from
a merchant named onquanii
did he say where he got it
no but he seemed eager to trade maybe hed tell us if we made it worth his while
scan for his vessel if you find him send an encoded message tell him about our problem
aye sir
if we could tap into the holoprojectors without his knowing it we might be able to shut him down
he changed all the access codes the second we try to decrypt them hell restart the detonation sequence
do you have a better idea
yeah let the captain handle it the last thing anyone needs is my opinion
this is no time to be feeling sorry for yourself
chakotay lets me make a command decision what do i do i beam a talking bomb on board
the first time i commanded an away mission i led my people into a cave that i thought was a cardassian military installation turned out id mistaken unstable mineral deposits for weapons signatures there was a rock slide and we were stuck there for three days
what did you do
we dug ourselves out with our bare hands where are you going
to dig us out
you dont have to do this you know
its what i was programmed for
youre a sentient being you dont have to be a slave to your programming look at the doctor
hes a tool a holographic puppet
that puppet saved your life if it werent for him youd still be damaged and alone on that planet hes the one that convinced me to beam you aboard and when we discovered what you were and some people wanted to destroy you the doctor defended your right to exist
whats your point
even though he was only programmed to be a doctor hes become more than that hes made friends hes piloted a starship he even sings
despite all of his achievements did he ever stop being a doctor
no but
and i cant stop being a weapon
look at yourself youre already much more than that youve got a body now eyes to see with the second you detonate thatll all be over
thats the nature of what i am
it doesnt have to be we can give you your own holomatrix you can exist for as long as you want accomplish anything you set your mind to
the only thing i want to accomplish is the destruction of my target
what is your target
a military installation on salinia prime grid eleven vector nine three four one
tell me about it whos the enemy
a ruthless violent race thats threatening to destroy my people
what else do you know about them whats their planet like are there forests wildlife schools for the children of this violent race
im not programmed with superfluous data
well lucky for you youre aboard voyager now and you have access to our scanners why dont we take a closer look at your target
a military installation as i told you
but its manned
by soldiers
who are going to suffer because of you remember when you were suffering blind and paralysed do you really want to make others go through that
i have a duty to protect my people i will not betray them now get out before im forced to harm you
nice try
im reading a subspace surge off our port bow
looks like a cloaked ship
it could be him onquanii travels in a cloaked vessel
were being hailed audio only
open a channel
voyager good to see you again
and you sir
i received your message have you an intelligent weapon in your possession
actually were in its possession were being held hostage do you know anything about this weapon
if im correct it was created by a species named the druoda ive studied their technology bring me aboard i can assist you
youve deactivated your comm system
and reinforced the shielding in this section we wont be overheard
id have more faith in your security precautions if you werent already at the mercy of this weapon
we didnt know what it was when we brought it aboard
this particular series has a class eleven intelligence factor its warpcapable fully armoured selfguiding it has a maximum range of eighty light years it can fly through an ion storm or an armada of hostile ships and still find its target
charming how do i get it off my ship
you cant but i can my transporter system employs a dampening field which disables the detonator until my engineers can disarm it
thats a generous offer mind if i ask what you expect in return
the device itself
im not about to hand over a weapon of mass destruction to someone i just met
oh my business is salvage not war ive no intention of deploying it
but you might sell it to someone who does i imagine youd stand to make quite a profit
i can make more profit by selling off its components the energy matrix alone can power a fleet of starships and its intelligence core properly reprogrammed can assist in a variety of things from terraforming to planetary weather control
all right you can have the weapon as long as we keep the energy matrix that way we can be sure no one ever deploys it
im afraid thats unacceptable the energy matrix is one of the most valuable components
im sorry its not open for negotiation
we could offer you a few dilithium crystals in compensation
that matrix worth a thousand dilithium crystals
what if we threw in a plasma manifold
i want the entire weapon or it remains here captain
you seem awfully intent for someone only interested in salvage
im sorry to waste your time well have to find another way to solve our problem
i wish you luck
sorry captain i thought it would help
bridge report
the alien vessel has opened fire weve lost weapons and shields
sickbay to captain whats happening
were under attack
how many ships
one off the port bow
return fire
we cant check your sensors our weapons are offline
the forcefields around sickbay are destabilising hes trying to get a transporter lock on the weapon
remodulate the shields
no effect
what are you doing
the weapons sending an antimatter surge back through the transporter beam
theyve been destroyed
that wasnt necessary
they were an enemy
maintain course
ive studied the weapons schematics my nanoprobes can be adapted to disable its bioneural circuitry however i would need direct access to its primary control port
that means getting you into sickbay without arousing suspicion
we could access the holomatrix controls above sickbay disrupt the doctors programme long enough for seven to inject the nanoprobes
how much time would you need
approximately twenty seconds
run a long range scan on that subspace minefield it warned us about calculate their explosive yield what kind of damage they might do to the ship
aye captain
what have you got in mind
i have a feeling were about to run into some unexpected trouble
weve analysed the alien minefield and calculated the effect it would have on voyager
i think i can simulated the explosions with a welltimed disruption to the inertial dampers of course asking me to give you a bumpy ride is like asking a virtuoso to sing offkey
im sure youll manage the weapon has access to our sensors how do we make sure it wont catch on
weve reconfigured the sensor array to send it false telemetry it will believe were navigating a minefield
at least long enough for us to get seven to sickbay
how
medical emergency
i intend to suffer thirddegree plasma burns during our encounter with the mines
thats where i come in chief cosmetics officer at your service
another hidden talent neelix
i know my way around a dermal regenerator i should be able to simulate a convincing wound
okay we get her inside then what
commander tuvok will be in position to disrupt the doctors programme once that happens i will inject the nanoprobes and disable the weapon
ill inform the captain get started
do well on this mission neelix and maybe the captain will promote you to senior beautician
assist me
with what
im trying to identify the malfunction that caused me to crash but several of my memory files are still damaged restore them
we tried helping it before and look where that got us
when taken captive by a hostile force seek out any opportunity to engage the assailant didnt you ever read the officers manual section one twenty six
i dont think starfleet diplomacy is going to work this time if we cooperate well be giving it the advantage
if theres even a chance that we can convince it to change its mind
its a bomb harry
a sentient bomb
i said assist me
where do we start
there are several disruptions in my memory index including a three minute thirty seven second gap just prior to the crash
a recursive search algorithm might retrieve the missing data there you received a subspace transmission a command to alter course and head toward the planet surface
looks like your landing wasnt an accident
it was an attempt by the enemy to divert me from my target
no your access codes are encrypted
they must have developed an infiltration code
what if it wasnt the enemy
who else would try to divert me
correct me if im wrong but these are the same duotronic algorithms that you use to communicate with
my own people wouldnt try to stop me
maybe they changed their mind
the enemy is ruthless my target is a threat why would my people call off the assault
if we clear up some more of these memory files maybe well find out
your assistance is no longer required
whats wrong you afraid you might find out youre not supposed to destroy that installation
let us finish the job then you can decide what you want to do with the information
proceed
does the name strategic command matrix mean anything to you
thats my control centre they ordered my launch
well it looks like your orders were rescinded see for yourself
all long range tactical armour units terminate mission immediately
keep reading
it says the war is over it ended nearly three years ago my launch was a mistake there was a malfunction in one of the command sensors it activated a series of launch sequencers my people managed to shut most of them down but thirty four weapons were fired including me
i guess this means you can disarm yourself now
no theres no confirmation code here we avoided the enemys minefield so theyre trying to deceive us
the confirmation could be in one of your damaged memory files
or maybe it was you deceiving me to implement your pacifist philosophy
thats not true
you lied to me before why should i trust you now
you dont have to trust us just access those files
no i am programmed to destroy my target i will complete my mission
if the war is over you could end up starting another one how many of your people will die then
sickbay to bridge
report
weve run into a subspace mine we had to drop out of warp
there shouldnt be mines along this course
were detecting thousands of them scattered throughout the region
were plotting a new course to avoid them
transmit it to me this trajectory will delay us for two days
thatll give you time to confirm that the war is over
no proceed as planned im programming a shield enhancement
that will protect voyager
im still going to have to reduce speed
agreed but only until weve cleared the minefield
maintain course mister paris one quarter impulse think he bought it
he seemed to
lets give him another good shake just to be sure
yes maam
that was another mine
the shields will hold
tuvok to bridge i have accessed the holomatrix
acknowledged
janeway to neelix casualty report
im putting the finishing touches on sevens plasma burn and it looks pretty authentic if i do say so myself
good work stand by
time to hit another mine tom a big one commander blow out the plasma relays on deck six
janeway to sickbay we have heavy casualties
maintain heading and speed
thats going to be difficult our astrometrics officer has been injured shes the one whos been guiding us through the minefield
replace her
seven of nines abilities are unique were not going to get past
these mines without her
then treat her injuries and send her back to her post
she has third degree plasma burns she needs to go to sickbay to be treated if you want to reach your target youre going to have to wait
all right captain but im warning you no deceptions
janeway to neelix go
treat her as quickly as possible
theyre in
now tuvok
bridge my holomatrix is destabilising why
we took damage to our secondary systems
repair them now or ill activate the detonation sequence
stand by
whats going on
shes trying to defuse the weapon
seven shes going into neural shock help me
sickbay to bridge your attempt to disable me did not succeed i am designed to repel any
assault on my bioneural circuitry
weve tried to reason with you you left me no choice
and you leave me
no choice you and your crew will abandon voyager immediately
no deal
this is not a negotiation comply or i will detonate
go ahead do it
everyone on board will be killed
but no one else will
captain thirty two vessels just dropped out of warp off our port bow
on screen
one of them is transmitting a message to the doctor
bridge to sickbay weve got company thirty two
selfguided weapons
they detected my presence aboard your vessel they say my target is essential they altered course to ensure that i reach it they are ordering me to transport off your vessel
they will tractor me to my target
mister kim reintegrate its neural matrix and
prepare to beam it off
we cant do that captain
explain
these weapons were fired by accident we cant let them reach their targets
enough captain order him to proceed
harry what are you talking about
captain i need
a minute youre making a mistake your own people tried to disarm you
i cannot be certain of that
yes you can you can check your memory files look for the confirmation code
no more delays
check the files
reintegrate my matrix
no
do what harry says or youre not leaving this ship
youre in no position to give me orders
if you detonate now youll destroy yourself and your companions is that what you want
the confirmation code
coding intersequence four four three vector three nine one two one cessation of hostilities confirmed unauthorised launch confirmed order to terminate mission confirmed
you must disarm yourself and tell the others to stand down
its a deception
this code of yours uses a modulating algorithm it would be almost impossible to duplicate
the enemy is ruthless they are violent
have you ever met the enemy youre just spouting propaganda what youve been programmed to believe
i have a directive
its been countermanded
i am a series five long range tactical armour unit designed to traverse enemy space and circumvent all attempts to deter me
youre a sentient being
i have a duty to protect my people to destroy my target
youve been programmed with intelligence so you could make decisions on your own well its time to make one countless lives are at stake ever since you took the doctors form youve been learning what its like to be one of us now try to imagine what its like to be one of your victims your first victim youve seen her suffering increase that by a factor of one million ten million and thats how much suffering youll cause if you dont end this
theyre asking why i havent left your ship
tell them
im transmitting our orders to terminate the mission they also received those orders but they had already crossed the targeting threshold once were within two light years of our target we cannot be diverted
tell them the wars over
i did
tell them you got the message before you crossed the threshold when you were on the planet surface
they dont believe me
its up to you to make them understand
they only understand their directive they wont listen reintegrate my neural matrix and return me to the others
we wont do that
i have no intention of proceeding to my target i will stop them
how
i am a weapon of mass destruction you want me to see past my programming then you must try to see past your doubts
belanna give me a hand bridge lock onto the weapon prepare to beam it into space
harry whats going on
captain no time to explain just trust me on this one
i hear you loud and clear ensign do it
ive reconfigured the bioneural matrix
ready im sorry
i am simply completing my mission only the target has changed
transfer complete
please state the nature of the what happened how long was i offline
well explain later seven needs your help
bridge energise
theyve gone into warp
maintain long range sensors
im detecting a series of antimatter explosions
in proximity to what
no ships no planets nothing
bridge to ensign kim the weapons have been destroyed
anyone home
ensign feeling well i hope
perfect on my way to the bridge for another night shift i came by to check on seven
you just missed her
whats her prognosis
shell need another week of regeneration but i expect shell make a full recovery
good news
considering i was responsible for her injuries you can imagine my relief
well you werent exactly yourself at the time
thats not what i mean i was the one who asked you to bring that device aboard in the first place i even argued with the captain to keep it aboard after we learned what it was
it was an artificial intelligence like you but i have to admit his personality made you seem like mister congeniality look doc the truth is i never would have gotten through to him without you
from what ive heard i wasnt much help
you were i held you up as an example of how an artificial intelligence could exceed its programming i didnt realise how true that was until today
it seems your strategy worked thank you
id better get to the bridge you never know when ensign kim will be called upon to take command again
voyager could do worse
helm status
current speed warp five heading oh twenty one mark three
anything on long range sensors
nothing to report
as you were
permission to speak freely sir
why would tonight be any different
people have been talking about you
oh
rumour has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb
well not exactly i made first contact with a sentient being all i did was help it understand a few things the rest was up to him
understood actually ive been authorised by the junior staff to thank you for keeping us in one piece
youre welcome any time do me a favour
of course sir
no more distress calls at least not tonight
stay on your course
shields are down to twenty nine percent theyre breaking through
let them
sir
take the shields offline and recharge the emitters thatll bring them up to full power
the charging cycle takes forty five seconds well be vulnerable
well be dead if we dont get the shields back up arm yourselves drop shields recharge cycle
thirty seconds
there
time
ten seconds
federation starship equinox were under attack we need assistance this is captain ransom of the federation starship equinox were under attack we need assistance
ransom he was in command of a science vessel the equinox
this distress call was transmitted approximately fourteen hours ago
distance
three point two light years
try to get a fix on their location
whats it doing in the delta quadrant
perhaps its searching for voyager
the equinox is a nova class ship it was designed for planetary research not long range tactical missions
ive got their coordinates heading two five eight mark twelve
set a course maximum warp go to red alert hang on captain
did you know this individual
only by reputation
he was an exobiologist promoted to captain after he made first contact with the yridians
species six two nine one the collective determined that they were extinct
so did the federation ransom proved otherwise i always wanted to meet him too bad it wont be under better circumstances
i look forward to meeting him as well and his crew i wish to expand my knowledge of humanity
lets hope you get the chance
approaching the coordinates
take us out of warp
ive got them two thousand kilometres off the port bow theyre moving at low impulse
intercept can you get a visual
they are heavily damaged multiple hull breaches warp drive is offline
whats happening to their shields
theyre being disrupted by some kind of energy surges
weapons fire
there are no other ships in the vicinity
were in hailing range
open a channel this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager were responding to your
voyager youve got to extend your shields around our ship match the emitter frequency
are you under attack
shields quickly
do it
were in position
i am attempting to match their shield frequency
do you hear something
interspatial fissure are opening on decks ten six and one
tuvok
stand by shields are holding
the fissures
no sign of them
voyager to ransom captain  assemble rescue teams secure the equinox tuvok youre with me
hello is there anyone here  see if you can bring main power online tom
what happened
some kind of thermolytic reaction its desiccated every cell in that body
commander i cant make heads or tails of this injector manifold and it looks like the dilithium matrix has been completely redesigned
well try to find one of their engineers to help us in the meantime see if you can bypass the core
aye sir
hang on
im commander chakotay uss voyager
but but were the only humans in the delta quadrant
thats what we used to think come on
over here hang on were getting you out of here
i dont believe weve met
ensign kim and this is seven of nine i have to cut him out with a plasma torch talk to him keep him calm
state your name
lessing noah what are you doing on this side of the galaxy
the answer is complicated
do me a favour see if my legs are still there i havent felt them in two days
your limbs are intact
thank you
seven give me hand
do not be frightened
too late for that
im picking up lifesigns hello is there anyone here
no
were here to help you
take cover were under attack
neelix to sickbay
sickbay here
we found another survivor his wounds are not serious but hes suffering from psychological distress
acknowledged
my crew
you took heavy casualties were treating the survivors who attacked you
we dont know we cant communicate with them theyve been attacking us for weeks
easy easy
ive got to secure the ship
leave that to us
no treat me here im not leaving my bridge
i cant pull rank on you captain but youre in no condition to put up a fight
so hows earth
i wish i could say
you werent sent here to find us
im afraid not weve been stranded in the delta quadrant for five years we were pulled here against our will by an alien called
the caretaker
well compare notes later on lets get you to voyager
were here to commemorate our honoured dead lieutenant william yates lieutenant john molar ensign dorothy chang ensign edward regis and crewman david amantes who all served with distinction their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten they will be missed but now there is cause for optimism captain janeway voyager on behalf of my crew thank you
well have time to give the newest members of our family a proper welcome in the days ahead but right now weve got our hands full the equinox is secure but its primary systems are still badly damaged harry belanna make it your priority captain ransom has provided us with data regarding the alien attacks tuvok seven youll be working with first officer maxwell burke to kindred spirits may our journey home together be swift dismissed
we should begin by familiarising you with voyagers defences
can you give me a minute theres someone id like to say hello to first
well be in the astrometrics lab deck eight section twenty nine
see you there
blt
max i tried to say hello in sickbay but you were sedated
i remember i thought i was dreaming so wheres my sweater the blue one class insignia on the back
we went to the academy together
ah
maxwell burke
tom paris
harry kim welcome aboard
first officer impressive the last time we talked you were about to drop out of starfleet
i heard you beat me to it the maquis
for a while until i ran into these two
and its been hell ever since
well i told your resident vulcan id be right with him are you free later id love to catch up
why dont we all have dinner together
sounds great
blt
bacon lettuce and tomato it was a nickname
a nickname
my initials
oh how romantic
we broke up over ten years ago no need to go to red alert
how about yellow alert
youre cute when youre jealous
whos jealous
see you on the equinox
well turkey platter what do you say we go to work
whos jealous
commander ive been assigned to one of the repair crews on the equinox and i was wondering if i could join a different team maybe one on voyager
problem
just a little posttraumatic stress syndrome
bad memories
a few
actually i could use someone with your engineering abilities
well thank you such a clean ship i mean im used to falling bulkheads and missing deck plates
in a few weeks you wont even recognise the equinox youll be happy to go back
unless i stay you said you could use someone with my engineering abilities
i dont think your captain would appreciate that hes got a skeleton crew as it is
engineerings five decks down its a long crawl through the jefferies tubes  deck eleven
i havent set foot in a turbolift in over three months
claustrophobia
if one of those fissures opened up in here where would we take cover
its only a graviton relay nothing to worry about
do i look worried  emergency stop
if you dont mind i think id rather take the jefferies tube
i could use the exercise
ive run a thermographic analysis of our shields it revealed multiple stress points we believe theyre the result of alien attempts to infiltrate our vessels each time a fissure opens within a metre of our shields it weakens them by point three percent
at the present rate we have less than two days to mount a defence
according to your bioscans the aliens can survive in our realm for only several seconds
theyre like fish out of water but they can do a lot of damage in those seconds
nevertheless it is a tactical weakness perhaps we can exploit it
what have you got in mind
if we can show them we have the ability to hold them here theyll think twice before launching another attack
but the question is how do we catch these fish
you build a net
commander
a multiphasic force field to be exact we wanted to see what we were up against so we built a small chamber that could keep one of them trapped for several minutes
if we could expand on that technology we might be able to create a lattice work of multiphasic forcefields around both ships
rudy
if captain janeway agrees
well need to examine that stasis chamber
im afraid that wont be possible its in our research lab that whole section was flooded with thermionic radiation during the last attack itll be days before anyone can go in there
the design schematics are in our auxiliary datacore
ill see if i can download them you give me a hand
i couldnt help but notice your crew calls you by your first name
when youve been in the trenches as long as we have rank and protocol are luxuries besides were a long way from starfleet command
i know the feeling
you seem to run a pretty tight ship
weve been known to let our hair down from time to time but i find that maintaining protocol reminds us of where we came from and hopefully where were going
it seems to work quite well for you
oh weve overcome our share of obstacles warp core breaches ion storms a few rounds with the borg
the borg we havent seen so much as a cube since the day we arrived
consider yourself lucky
have you ever run into the krowtonan guard
never heard of them
thats how we spent our first week in the delta quadrant they claimed we violated their territory i gave the order to keep going i lost thirty nine half my crew
im sorry
we never recovered from that loss it changed everything
what do you mean
when i first realised that wed be travelling across the delta quadrant for the rest of our lives i told my crew that we had a duty as starfleet officers to expand our knowledge and uphold our principles after a couple of years we started to forget that we were explorers and there were times when we nearly forgot that we were human beings
this is a nova class science vessel designed for short term research missions minimal weapons it cant even go faster than warp eight frankly i dont know how youve done it youve obviously travelled as far as we have with much fewer resources
i wish that i could take all the credit but we stumbled across a wormhole and made a few enhancements on our warp engines id like to ask you something captain to captain
mmm hmm
the prime directive how often have you broken it for the sake of protecting your crew
broken it never bent it on occasion and even then it was a difficult choice what about you
ive walked the line once or twice but nothing serious there you are
its a good omen lets put it back where it belongs
i thought id find you here
how could i resist after two years on emergency rations
dont get too comfortable if janeways any indication these people will never understand
theyre going to find out eventually
not if we keep them out of the research lab and away from the warp core injectors and be careful what you say around their crew that includes old girlfriends
understood
mmm not bad
hows my angel of mercy
crewman lessing i didnt expect you to recover so quickly
you have an outstanding emh ours can barely hold a laser scalpel
the doctor is efficient
ive been assigned to help you sort through our biodata you saved my life the least i can do is save you a little time
lateral shields are offline
hows that possible
fissures are opening on decks one eight and eleven
reroute power
what happened
apparently the aliens began to focus their attacks on a single shield vector it collapsed before the auxiliary emitters could respond
it looks like theyve changed their tactics we may have less time than we thought
weve examined the schematics of your multiphasic chamber it can be adapted we intend to create an autoinitiating security grid
the moment an alien invades either ship a forcefield will surround it
once we modify our field generator to emit multiphasic frequencies it will power the security grids on both ships
how long will it take
approximately fourteen hours
we dont know when theyll break through again we may not last that long
we could cut the time in half if we evacuate all personnel from the equinox and focus our efforts here on voyager
remember we are still thirty five thousand light years from earth we should try to preserve both ships
with two vessels wed be able to pool our resources doubling our chances of finding a short cut home
normally id agree but right now one of our ships in vulnerable chakotays right we should make our stand on voyager
i dont want to force the issue but i am prepared to return to the equinox with my crew what is the protocol in this situation we have two captains and two ships who gets the last word
starfleet regulation one hundred ninety one article fourteen in a combat situation involving more than one ship command falls to the vessel with tactical superiority i looked it up this morning
good thinking
in this case protocol recognises my authority
are you ordering me to abandon my ship
id rather not have to
that protocol was written in the alpha quadrant im not sure that it makes much sense out here
the regulation stands
who am i to dispute protocol give captain janeway your full cooperation
rudy
max thats an order well get through this if thats all captain id like to return to my quarters and collect a few mementoes
by all means
intruder alert same old max going through my things that is a command station its off limits without my direct authorisation
i didnt realise are you going to throw me in the brig
i think we can overlook this infraction can i help you with something
just doing some homework studying your propulsion system if theres a chance im going to be stuck on voyager i figured i better learn my way around maybe you could tutor me over dinner
problem is you were never really interested in the work or the meal something tells me you havent changed
youd be surprised im not the what did you once call me
petaq
petaq im not the petaq i used to be let me prove it to you
look max dont get me wrong its good to see you again but ten years
tom paris
tom paris
you could do worse  so were still on for dinner just the two of us
get going or i will throw you in the brig
before we abandon the equinox we should try to salvage any useful components lets start with your dilithium crystals
what we have left of them im afraid we only have a few isograms
thats barely enough to power the sonic showers
can i make a suggestion
please
lets forget about the primary systems theyre too badly damaged lets focus on supplies we picked up a few items i think might come in handy two kilotons of kemacite ore a dozen canisters of mercurium
tell neelix to make room in cargo bay one
right
could you use a synaptic stimulator
depends what is it
its a neural interface you wear behind your ear it taps into your visual cortex and shows you different alien vistas just think of it as a poor mans holodeck
so thats how you kept yourself entertained
beats checkers the ponea gave it to us
never heard of them
we called them the life of the delta quadrant they see every first contact as an excuse to throw a party i wish that we had encountered more species like that youre the first friendly faces weve seen in months im glad we found you
the feelings mutual those modified plasma injectors looked elaborate what were you trying to do
we were experimenting with ways to enhance our warp drive it doesnt work
maybe we should let belanna take a look
it wont work we tried for months
excuse me
oh hello there
commander permission to interrupt
granted
ensign gilmore
thats right
naomi wildman captains assistant
is that so
i wanted to officially welcome you aboard the starship voyager
im glad to be here
if you need anything replicator rations a tour of the lower decks im your man
thank you miss wildman ill keep that in mind
as you were
i didnt realise that you had children on board
only one she was born here
i have a nephew back on earth the same age well not any more i guess hes a teenager by now i probably wouldnt even recognise him
youll see him again
ransom to gilmore
yes captain
report to the equinox bridge
on my way duty calls
assemble a salvage team
aye sir
once we take their field generator well part company
what happens to voyager
they have weapons shields a full crew theyll survive
maybe we should abandon ship try to forget everything thats happened here
a shower and a hot meal i guess thats all it takes for some of us to forget whats at stake here were going home we cant let voyager stop us now not when were this close now were proceeding as planned are there any other objections i need each and every one of you to give me your very best as you always have max
this wont be easy the generator is located on deck eleven next to the warp plasma manifold we cant get a clean lock without boosting the signal marla we need you to set aside your claustrophobia and crawl through the access port and set up the transport enhancers
understood
well have to take the internal sensors in that section offline noah youre elected
you can count on me sir
ill disengage the power couplings from engineering
youll all have time for one last shower make the most of it
theres a minor fluctuation in the security grid
its within tolerance
i believe i can correct it the discrepancy is in the equinox research lab if we can determine the exact frequency of their multiphasic chamber i will tune our field generator to match it
there are times when perfection hinders efficiency
this is odd the lab is still permeated with high levels of thermionic radiation
it should have dissipated by now
i believe i have an explanation three eps conduits have been rerouted to the lab it appears they are emitting the radiation
the lab was contaminated intentionally
any theories
only one ransom doesnt want us to enter the research lab
he has been adamant about protecting his ship i thought it was simply a captains pride i want to take a closer look at that lab if we close off those eps conduits how long will it take to vent the radiation
several hours
i dont want to wait that long send the doctor hell be immune to its effects tell him to look for anything out of the ordinary monitor his progress from astrometrics
shall i notify captain ransom
not yet i want to wait until we test your theory
im in ive found the multiphasic chamber theres some kind of organic mass inside it appears to be a member of the alien species
but its cell structures have vitrified
this is more that just a stasis chamber its some kind of matter conversion technology hold on theres a control port here hmm
doctor
the chamber contains a polaron grid
and a submolecular resequencer it looks like it was designed to convert the alien cell structures into some kind of crystalline compound
that function was not specified in their schematics
ive a feeling theres a lot here they didnt specify ive accessed their research logs theyre encrypted but judging by the file headings theyve performed this procedure dozens of times more of the alien compound but its been biochemically altered theyve extracted the base proteins its molecular structure is most unusual
can you be more specific
it appears to store a great deal of
nucleogenic energy im no engineer but id say they were trying to convert this material into a source of power
im going to miss this ship
once we get back to earth therell be plenty of women status
ready on all fronts the transport enhancers are in place and noahs created a subroutine to mask voyagers internal sensors
power couplings
bypass controls have been routed to our bridge all you need to do is say energise
janeway wants to bring on the security grid at nineteen hundred hours well have to act before then tell the others to be prepared to
max the transporter rooms not far from here keep moving
captain janeway wishes to speak with you
the alien compound ten isograms if i understand your calculations thats enough to increase your warp factor by what point zero three percent for one month unfortunately that boost wouldnt get you very far so youd need to replenish the supply and that means killing another lifeform and then another how many lives would it take to get you back to the alpha quadrant i think you know the reason were under attack these aliens are trying to protect themselves from you
sixty three thats how many more it will take every time i sacrifice one of those lives a part of me is lost as well
i might believe that if i hadnt examined your research these experiments were meticulous and they were brutal if youd felt any remorse youd never have continued
starfleet regulation three paragraph twelve in the event of imminent destruction a captain is authorised to preserve the lives of his crew by any justifiable means
i doubt that protocol covers mass murder
in my judgment it did
unacceptable
we had nothing my ship was in pieces our dilithium was gone we were running on thrusters we hadnt eaten in sixteen days we had just enough power to enter orbit of an m class planet and lucky for us the inhabitants were generous
they were called the ankari they provided us with a meal a few supplies even some dilithium crystals they even performed one of their sacred rituals to invoke spirits of good fortune from another realm to bless our journey but these werent spirits they were nucleogenic life forms our scans revealed that they were emitting high levels of antimatter later the same night we managed to obtain one of the summoning devices in exchange for an energy converter
we constructed a containment field that would prevent the lifeform from vanishing so quickly but something went wrong
get it out of there
we tried to send it back
we cant
but it was too late
we examined the remains and discovered it could be converted to enhance our propulsion systems it was already dead what would you have done we travelled over ten thousand light years in less than two weeks wed found our salvation how could we ignore it
by adhering to the oath you took as starfleet officers to seek out life not destroy it
its easy to cling to principles when youre standing on a vessel with its bulkheads intact manned by a crew thats not starving
its never easy but if we turn our backs on our principles we stop being human im putting an end to your experiments and you are hereby relieved of your command you and your crew will be confined to quarters
please show them leniency they were only following my orders
their mistake
its a long way home captain
doctor return to their research lab and retrieve all the data you can locate on the aliens i want to find a way to communicate with them
aye captain
go to their engine room take those warp core modifications offline
captain
lets try to make first contact the right way
whats going to happen to us
thats up to captain janeway youll be confined to quarters until we can find a way to make peace with these lifeforms youve been killing if its not too late
to be honest im glad you stopped us living the rest of my life knowing what weve done
you could have stopped yourself why didnt you
i dont know when the captain ordered me to modify the warp core i concentrated on the work i tried not to think about how it was going to be used
well think about it now because we need your help
commander
after you
were having trouble making sense of all this
the schematics are encrypted i cant access them
do you know the decryption codes your captains been relieved of command you take orders from me now do you have the codes
yes
proceed
think of it this way ensign you might live with yourself a little easier
you said you wanted to learn more about humanity i guess were not exactly prized examples im sorry
on the contrary youve taught me a great deal
computer i decrypted this data file why cant i access it
emh authorisation is required
is your emh still functional
affirmative
activate him
please state the nature of the medical emergency
i require your assistance
who are you
your counterpart from the starship voyager
wheres captain ransom my crew
in custody
how were you able to leave your sickbay
this device allows me to go anywhere i please in case you werent aware your crew has been running criminal experiments here
i know i designed them
you thats a violation of your programming
they deleted my ethical subroutines
im picking up spatial fissures hundreds of them
looks like theyve stepped up their attacks
reroute all available power to the shields
theyre holding but at this rate it wont be long before the aliens break through
bridge to tuvok we need that security grid
were preparing to bring it online charge the emitters
bridge to the doctor
sickbay here
did you find anything
could you be more specific
neural patterns cortical scans anything that could help us programme the universal translator
er negative i couldnt access the equinox data files they were encrypted
keep studying the information we have see what you can come up with
acknowledged computer locate captain ransom
captain ransom is in crew quarters deck nine section twenty two
chakotay to seven of nine whats your status
ive dismantled the antimatter injectors but ill need several minutes to neutralise the dilithium matrix
we dont have much time
understood
the equinox crew has been infected with a mutagenic virus it may be contagious ive been authorised to inoculate them
youve all contracted a virus ill need to treat you
a virus
doctors orders
its me
activate the grid what happened
i dont understand this should be working im running a systemwide diagnostic
im reading phaser fire on deck nine crew quarters
security seal off deck nine
shields are weakening theyre down to eighty four percent
tuvok to bridge the field generator is offline its power couplings were disengaged
someone reconfigured the sensors so we couldnt detect it
whatever it takes get that grid online
i rerouted transporter control to a panel in the next junction we can
theyve sealed off the deck
dont worry were getting out of here
shields down to fifty two percent
captain unauthorised transport in progress its the equinox crew
block it
theyve bypassed ops control theyre on their bridge
forty percent
janeway to seven of nine
seven respond
damn
what is it
belannas erected a forcefield i cant get a lock on the generator
try overriding the command codes
someones disrupting the forcefield its max hes using one of his triquadric algorithms i taught him how to do that ten years ago
shields are failing weve got less than one minute
open a channel if you dont stop what youre doing well both be destroyed
whats my alternative thirty years in your brig
ill open fire if i have to
weve been through worse
target their power systems fire
max
stand by okay blt lets see if you remember this trick
bridge theyve got the field generator
what do you mean theyve got it
i dont know how but they beamed it off voyager
get us out of here
i cant warp drive is down
bridge to marla report
one of their crew tried to dismantle the antimatter injectors repairs are underway
what about the field generator
im integrating it now
shields are down
arm yourselves
its now or never
generators in place im bringing the grid online
fissures are opening all decks
hold your fire
take it to the lab
sir engines are up and running
set a course for the alpha quadrant
course laid in
maximum warp engage
captain
give me tactical control
good guess i used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields it wont hold for long
bridge to sickbay we have a medical emergency doctor respond ensign
yes sir
casualty reports are coming in two dead thirteen wounded we took heavy damage to the engines
the equinox
theyve gone to warp
any sign of nucleogenic particles
no
then they havent engaged their enhanced warp drive yet keep looking for
report
the shield grid is back in place the aliens are staying clear
are sensors picking up voyager
it looks like theyre under attack
maintain course
captain i found the doctors mobile emitter on deck nine you might want to take it to sickbay
any sign of the doc
ive got him right here
please state the nature of the dont bother
you should start with chakotay ive got him stabilised but hes got internal injuries
we found your emitter on deck nine
i was taken hostage by the equinox crew i deactivated myself to escape did you stop them
no
id ask for a status report but im not sure id want to hear it
harrys analysing the sound weve been hearing he thinks its some form of communication
well i once figured out how to speak with a terrelian seapod this couldnt be that much harder once i get out of sickbay ill lend him a hand
we should all be focusing our efforts on finding the equinox
first things first weve got to stop these attacks
our enemies arent the aliens theyre the humans aboard the equinox its crucial that you dont
who is it
its max ive brought you a visitor
hold on come in
im glad youre okay ive been using this synaptic stimulator i was just taking a stroll along the tenkaran coast youre welcome to try it
state your intentions
you know once we get our enhanced warp drive back online well be on our way home but itll still take months to get there you can spend that time in the brig or you can become part of this crew id prefer the latter
id prefer the brig
you know janeways not the only captain who can help you explore your humanity
you would be an inferior role model
janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew maybe you should learn from that mistake
her only mistake was trusting you
take care of her wound
first degree phaser burns minor lacerations looks like well have to amputate that was a joke youre supposed to smile and make a witty retort
im familiar with human banter yours is crude and predictable
you know seven can i call you seven we dont have many luxuries around here all weve got is each other you might try letting your shields down or else its going to be a lonely trip ill be damned looks like our doctor left us a replacement
seven
we are captives
i was attacked by their emh
looks like he downloaded you into our database good you can treat your friend
priming the injectors
marla to bridge
go ahead
were ready
acknowledged
infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound
aye sir warp drive ready
engage
what happened
the power relays are offline theyve been encoded
give us the codes
no
if she wont give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves
sevens cranial infrastructure is highly complex youll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast
thats why youre going to help us
i refuse
do it or ill erase your programme
be my guest
doctor
dont worry they need me theyd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face now i suggest you
all right doctor now get to work you know what were looking for
very well shell try to resist ill have to restrain her
doctor
i deleted his ethical subroutines hell be a little more cooperative now keep me posted
aye captain this way please
its not exactly shakespeare but it gets the point across
a small olive branch is still an olive branch
run this through to your translation matrix
set your weapons down
commander
somebodys got to start trusting somebody around here
belay that order i appreciate your optimism but in this case weapons
ready to transmit
drop shields bridge only go ahead harry
raise shields
if they understood our message they havent responded
theres your response activate another deflector pulse
shields are holding at sixty two percent
that should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet i suggest we make the most of it focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive weve got to find the equinox
if its all the same to you id like to take another stab at the message if we can reroute
theyre not listening chakotay we should be tracking ransom not tinkering with adverbs
want your first officers advice
allow me our deflectors losing power and when it fails well be defenceless its voyager we should be worrying about not the equinox
youd make a great first officer its advice worth taking
maybe so but we have a crew member trapped on that ship
is this really about seven or is it about ransom
i dont know what youre talking about
youve been known to hold a grudge this man betrayed starfleet he broke the prime directive dishonoured everything you believe in and threw voyager to the wolves
borg hirogen malon weve run into our share of bad guys ransoms no different
yes he is you said it yourself hes human i dont blame you for being angry but you cant compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta
i appreciate your candour now let me be just as blunt youre right i am angry im damned angry hes a starfleet captain and hes decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for hes out there right now torturing and murdering innocent lifeforms just to get home a little quicker im not going to stand for it im going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes no matter what the cost if you want to call that a vendetta go right ahead
why did you bring us here
this planet has a parthogenic atmosphere it will keep us from being detected while we make repairs
we also found a few deuterium deposits
take an away team noah and see if you can localise the ore
you wont be protected from the aliens arm yourselves with phasers at the first sign of trouble well beam you back
aye sir
the ocular nodes connected to the sensory node the sensory nodes connected to the cortical node the cortical nodes connected to the reticular node dont look so gloomy theres a silver lining to all this just think were finally going to see earth
you are obviously delusional allow me to repair your programme
now why would i want you to do that you of all people should understand being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient
status
im going to extract her cortical array it contains an index of her memory engrams but once ive removed it her higher brain functions language cognitive skills will be severely damaged
tell me the codes
no
janeway was right about one thing you are unique it would be a shame to lose you
your compassion is irrelevant
you think this is easy for me the sight of you on that table but youre leaving me no choice
no choice you say that frequently you destroy lifeforms to attain your goals then claim that they left you no choice does that logic comfort you
the codes
youll have to destroy me to obtain them
the reticular nodes connected to the occipital node
come in
you wanted to see me
its not like you to submit recommendations in writing
the last time we spoke you werent exactly receptive
im afraid im not going to be very receptive this time either its an interesting idea but the ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction
i understand that but theyre the ones who introduced ransom to these lifeforms it stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them tell them to call off their attacks
our first priority is to find ransom still no sign of nucleogenic particles
not yet
then he couldnt have gotten far without his enhanced drive his ships only capable of warp six ive been studying his service record hes had his share of runins with hostile aliens it seems that when hes being pursued he tends to hide at epsilon four he ran into a klingon birdofprey played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the klingons finally gave up two years later he eluded a romulan warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant go to astrometrics start looking for the kind of place youd hide if your ship was damaged
yes maam
how was the beach
do these programmes have people in them
no just landscapes why
forget it
im reading a vein of ore azimuth one seventeen thirty metres it could run pretty deep we might need to use phasers to excavate it its funny this reminds me of mckinley park i used to take my sister there when we were kids this place looks just like it as i recall there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there there was a patch of poison ivy next to it when i was ten i walked right through it and i swelled up like a rigellian bloodworm when i get back to earth the first thing im going to do is
four to beam up
were receiving a subspace transmission
from who
i cant tell
i dont see a ship out there open a channel
doctor to equinox respond
we can hear you
voyagers found you theyve entered orbit they polarised their hull to mask their approach
i believe theyve planned an ambush on the away team
janeways been tracking the equinox for a couple
get him back
i cant
ransom to away team noah prepare to beam back to the ship
theyre not down there
all hands to battle stations
thirty thousand kilometres and closing
target their power core
direct hit minor damage
return fire
bridge to torres status
i cant locate their shield grid generator can you divert more power to sensors
stand by
theyve damaged our deflector captain if it goes offline well be vulnerable to the alien attacks
noted target his weapons array
we lost all phaser banks
torpedoes full spread
its belanna shes trying to bypass our security protocols
stop her
computer open a comm link to the equinox workstation thirty three beta
max listen to me
back for round two blt
this isnt one of our games people are dying over here
i wish you didnt have to be one of them
max please
shields are weakening
weve almost got him keep targeting their weapons array one more torpedo ought to do it
captain
fire
weapons are down
janeway to ransom surrender your vessel
we still have thrusters dont we
aye sir
lay in a course through the planets atmosphere sixty degree vector
what the hell is he doing follow him
were crossing the upper thermosphere
phasers
shields are weakening thirty one percent twenty nine
inertial dampers are offline
captain if we loose our shields well be attacked by the aliens captain
break off pursuit
theyre retreating
take us up
they took heavy damage shields propulsion
get us out of here
theyve gone to warp
match their course and speed
we cant not until we restore primary systems
time
well need a few hours
at least we didnt come away emptyhanded
i want ransoms tactical status i want it now mister lessing
or what youll hit me
no crewman ill drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit
that would be murder
you could also call it poetic justice
i suppose the plan is that youre going to come to my rescue now right
theres no plan as far as i know the captains on her own
ransoms status now
no way in hell
we all make our own hell mister lessing i hope you enjoy yours the comm is active well be outside if you have a change of heart
what are you doing
werent you listening
dont do this
hell break
bridge to the captain weve lost shields in section twenty nine alpha
i know stand by
hes a loyal officer hes not going to betray his captain put up the shields
hell break
captain
as you were
level nine authorisation required
damn it kathryn
youre panicking hes going to talk
captain a fissure is opening in that section
understood
okay youve demonstrated your loyalty to your captain fine now lets talk about the ankari
if theres an ankari vessel less than two light years from here why havent we detected it
apparently they use a unique form of propulsion which makes them hard to find
you think theyll be willing to help us
its worth a try mister lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors once you find the ankari ship set a course
aye sir
did our prisoner disclose any other information
im afraid not the rest of you continue with the repairs dismissed
commander
all right were going to try it your way but i want to make one thing clear
our first priority is to get ransom if theres one thing youve made clear its that
weve had our disagreements chakotay but youve never openly opposed me
you almost killed that man today
it was a calculated risk and i took it
it was a bad call
ill note your objection in my log
i dont give a damn about your log this isnt about rules and regulations its about right and wrong and im warning you i wont let you cross that line again
then you leave me no choice you are hereby relieved of duty until further notice
whats happened to you kathryn
i was about to ask you the same question
they are not responding
tractor beam
captain the ankari ship has done nothing
just do it
were being hailed
on screen
starfleet
yes
leave us alone theres nothing of value on our ship
we need your guidance your spirits of good fortune are attacking us
of course they are youve been killing them
we are not the ones responsible
equinox
thats right can you communicate with the aliens
release my ship
i cant do that not until you agree to talk to them
i will summon them but you must talk to them you must convince them
they say they want the humans to die
a difficult place to start a negotiation
will they understand me
yes
we didnt do this to you were trying to stop the humans who did
they dont believe you would harm your own kind
we have rules for behaviour the equinox has broken those rules by killing your species its our duty to stop them
give us the equinox give us the equinox they insist on destroying the ones who are responsible
we will punish them according to our own rules they will be imprisoned they will lose their freedom
all right if you stop your attacks ill deliver the equinox to you
captain
i know what im doing tuvok
these beings would destroy captain ransom and his crew
whats their answer
your behaviour is irrational we could find another solution
ive already confined my first officer to quarters would you like to join him well
they agree
were going to need more fuel weve only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years
fuel is that the euphemism were using now you mean we need to kill more lifeforms
several more
oh my darling oh my darling oh my darling
clementine
how much longer
another hour maybe less you are lost and gone forever
dreadful sorry clementine
what are you doing
her auditory processor we used to practice duets together in fact i taught her this old chestnut light she was and like a fairy
and her shoes were number nine
herring boxes without topses
sandals were for clementine
drove she ducklings to the water
enough
why the long face captain youre about to get your crew home she tried to stand in your way you had no choice
no choice thank you doctor
when this is all over perhaps youll allow me to teach you my repertoire im going to need a new partner
hmm drove she ducklings to the water
you what are you doing here
hiding like you
im not hiding
its beautiful i can see why this brings you comfort
i dont know what youre talking about
but it isnt real
youre not real now leave me alone
its not too late to stop
i dont have a choice
find another way
there is no other way
stop trying to hide
i told you im not hiding now get away from me
end this
no
bridge to ransom
go ahead
janeways found us
on my way
distance
fifty thousand kilometres closing fast
maintain course voyagers approaching at high warp theres a class two nebula less than a light year from here janeways sensors wont be able to track us once were inside i think that we should pursue this course
no open a channel
change of tactics
you might say that its time we found another way home
another way
were going to cooperate with janeway max if shes willing
rudy with all due respect have you lost your mind
just the opposite
theyre within range theyre charging weapons
hail them
belay that order raise shields
youre relieved of duty commander
im taking command anyone who isnt with me speak up now take him to the brig
im sorry
whats the status of our weapons
full complement of torpedoes minimal phasers
open a secure channel to their sickbay stand by weapons
aye sir
im here
were going to need your help doctor see if you can find voyagers current shield frequency
acknowledged ill need a few minutes
they are firing torpedoes
direct hit to our port shields theyre holding
return the favour
this isnt the brig
i know im with you sir lets find a way to end this
well need to access transporter control
weve damaged their port nacelle theyre venting plasma
theyre dropping out of warp
stay with them
doctor to equinox ive got their shield frequency
im transmitting it to you now
theyll try to remodulate keep monitoring
aye sir
theyve slowed to one quarter impulse
prepare a tractor beam
they are launching another torpedo
full power to the forward shields
hull breach on deck four
howd they get through our shields
hard about get us out of range remodulate the shields
theyre retreating
pursuit course maintain fire
they took out the weapons array
tuvok
ive been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds
weve lost impulse engines
were being hailed its ransom
put him through
captain im prepared to surrender the equinox but im no longer in command max decided to stage a little mutiny but i think i can stop him ive isolated transporter control i can beam all of us to voyager you might want to have some guards standing by not everyone here is going to be happy to see you
proceed
maam
hes still a starfleet captain he may have forgotten that for a while but i believe him
someones trying to beam us off forcefields
theyre deflecting our targeting scanners
then beam the others to voyager yourself included ill take care of max
aye sir
computer give me access to the shield grid
well i see youve made yourself at home
what are you doing here
taking back my sickbay
stop where you are ive planted photonic charges throughout these holoprojectors with one command sequence i can blow out your entire
computer delete the equinox emh
the doctors not transmitting anymore
burke to doctor report
im afraid your physicians no longer on call
max this is the captain ive dropped the shield grid
everywhere except the bridge and my current location
the vital systems are exposed
i suggest you beam to voyager while you still can
the core is overloading weve got to get out of here
where voyagers brig
its better than being vaporised
we still have a working shuttle
the shuttle bays two decks down sir the aliens
well make it
this way
theres only one life sign left its ransom
captain
things didnt work out exactly as i planned but youve got everyone worth getting
were beaming you out of there
this ship is about to explode ive got to put some distance between us ive accessed helm control
you can set autonavigation and then transport to voyager
theres no time youve got a fine crew captain promise me youll get them home
i promise
good as new id like you to regenerate for the next few hours itll help stabilise your cortical array
understood
regarding the unpleasantness aboard the equinox i hope you dont think less of me
your programme was altered
its quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into mister hyde
perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols it will prevent such tampering in the future
good thinking
when im done regenerating i will assist you
thanks
you were offkey
i beg your pardon
my darling clementine third verse second measure
thats impossible
your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz i can assist you with that as well
really holodeck two tomorrow sixteen hundred hours just you me and a tuning fork
i look forward to it
the last time we welcomed you aboard you took advantage of our trust you betrayed this crew i wont make that mistake again noah lessing marla gilmore james morrow brian sofin angelo tassoni you are hereby stripped of rank youll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel your privileges will be limited and youll serve under close supervision for as long as i deem fit this time youll have to earn our trust dismissed
repairs
coming along
hows the crew
a lot of frayed nerves neelix is organising a potluck to help boost morale
will i see you there
im replicating the salad
ill bring the croutons chakotay you know you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own
the thought had occurred to me but that would have been crossing the line
will you look at that
all these years all these battles this things never fallen down before
lets put it back up where it belongs
stay on your course
shields are down to twenty nine percent theyre breaking through
let them
sir
take the shields offline and recharge the emitters thatll bring them up to full power
the charging cycle takes forty five seconds well be vulnerable
well be dead if we dont get the shields back up arm yourselves drop shields recharge cycle
thirty seconds
there
time
ten seconds
federation starship equinox were under attack we need assistance this is captain ransom of the federation starship equinox were under attack we need assistance
ransom he was in command of a science vessel the equinox
this distress call was transmitted approximately fourteen hours ago
distance
three point two light years
try to get a fix on their location
whats it doing in the delta quadrant
perhaps its searching for voyager
the equinox is a nova class ship it was designed for planetary research not long range tactical missions
ive got their coordinates heading two five eight mark twelve
set a course maximum warp go to red alert hang on captain
did you know this individual
only by reputation
he was an exobiologist promoted to captain after he made first contact with the yridians
species six two nine one the collective determined that they were extinct
so did the federation ransom proved otherwise i always wanted to meet him too bad it wont be under better circumstances
i look forward to meeting him as well and his crew i wish to expand my knowledge of humanity
lets hope you get the chance
approaching the coordinates
take us out of warp
ive got them two thousand kilometres off the port bow theyre moving at low impulse
intercept can you get a visual
they are heavily damaged multiple hull breaches warp drive is offline
whats happening to their shields
theyre being disrupted by some kind of energy surges
weapons fire
there are no other ships in the vicinity
were in hailing range
open a channel this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager were responding to your
voyager youve got to extend your shields around our ship match the emitter frequency
are you under attack
shields quickly
do it
were in position
i am attempting to match their shield frequency
do you hear something
interspatial fissure are opening on decks ten six and one
tuvok
stand by shields are holding
the fissures
no sign of them
voyager to ransom captain  assemble rescue teams secure the equinox tuvok youre with me
hello is there anyone here  see if you can bring main power online tom
what happened
some kind of thermolytic reaction its desiccated every cell in that body
commander i cant make heads or tails of this injector manifold and it looks like the dilithium matrix has been completely redesigned
well try to find one of their engineers to help us in the meantime see if you can bypass the core
aye sir
hang on
im commander chakotay uss voyager
but but were the only humans in the delta quadrant
thats what we used to think come on
over here hang on were getting you out of here
i dont believe weve met
ensign kim and this is seven of nine i have to cut him out with a plasma torch talk to him keep him calm
state your name
lessing noah what are you doing on this side of the galaxy
the answer is complicated
do me a favour see if my legs are still there i havent felt them in two days
your limbs are intact
thank you
seven give me hand
do not be frightened
too late for that
im picking up lifesigns hello is there anyone here
no
were here to help you
take cover were under attack
neelix to sickbay
sickbay here
we found another survivor his wounds are not serious but hes suffering from psychological distress
acknowledged
my crew
you took heavy casualties were treating the survivors who attacked you
we dont know we cant communicate with them theyve been attacking us for weeks
easy easy
ive got to secure the ship
leave that to us
no treat me here im not leaving my bridge
i cant pull rank on you captain but youre in no condition to put up a fight
so hows earth
i wish i could say
you werent sent here to find us
im afraid not weve been stranded in the delta quadrant for five years we were pulled here against our will by an alien called
the caretaker
well compare notes later on lets get you to voyager
were here to commemorate our honoured dead lieutenant william yates lieutenant john molar ensign dorothy chang ensign edward regis and crewman david amantes who all served with distinction their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten they will be missed but now there is cause for optimism captain janeway voyager on behalf of my crew thank you
well have time to give the newest members of our family a proper welcome in the days ahead but right now weve got our hands full the equinox is secure but its primary systems are still badly damaged harry belanna make it your priority captain ransom has provided us with data regarding the alien attacks tuvok seven youll be working with first officer maxwell burke to kindred spirits may our journey home together be swift dismissed
we should begin by familiarising you with voyagers defences
can you give me a minute theres someone id like to say hello to first
well be in the astrometrics lab deck eight section twenty nine
see you there
blt
max i tried to say hello in sickbay but you were sedated
i remember i thought i was dreaming so wheres my sweater the blue one class insignia on the back
we went to the academy together
ah
maxwell burke
tom paris
harry kim welcome aboard
first officer impressive the last time we talked you were about to drop out of starfleet
i heard you beat me to it the maquis
for a while until i ran into these two
and its been hell ever since
well i told your resident vulcan id be right with him are you free later id love to catch up
why dont we all have dinner together
sounds great
blt
bacon lettuce and tomato it was a nickname
a nickname
my initials
oh how romantic
we broke up over ten years ago no need to go to red alert
how about yellow alert
youre cute when youre jealous
whos jealous
see you on the equinox
well turkey platter what do you say we go to work
whos jealous
commander ive been assigned to one of the repair crews on the equinox and i was wondering if i could join a different team maybe one on voyager
problem
just a little posttraumatic stress syndrome
bad memories
a few
actually i could use someone with your engineering abilities
well thank you such a clean ship i mean im used to falling bulkheads and missing deck plates
in a few weeks you wont even recognise the equinox youll be happy to go back
unless i stay you said you could use someone with my engineering abilities
i dont think your captain would appreciate that hes got a skeleton crew as it is
engineerings five decks down its a long crawl through the jefferies tubes  deck eleven
i havent set foot in a turbolift in over three months
claustrophobia
if one of those fissures opened up in here where would we take cover
its only a graviton relay nothing to worry about
do i look worried  emergency stop
if you dont mind i think id rather take the jefferies tube
i could use the exercise
ive run a thermographic analysis of our shields it revealed multiple stress points we believe theyre the result of alien attempts to infiltrate our vessels each time a fissure opens within a metre of our shields it weakens them by point three percent
at the present rate we have less than two days to mount a defence
according to your bioscans the aliens can survive in our realm for only several seconds
theyre like fish out of water but they can do a lot of damage in those seconds
nevertheless it is a tactical weakness perhaps we can exploit it
what have you got in mind
if we can show them we have the ability to hold them here theyll think twice before launching another attack
but the question is how do we catch these fish
you build a net
commander
a multiphasic force field to be exact we wanted to see what we were up against so we built a small chamber that could keep one of them trapped for several minutes
if we could expand on that technology we might be able to create a lattice work of multiphasic forcefields around both ships
rudy
if captain janeway agrees
well need to examine that stasis chamber
im afraid that wont be possible its in our research lab that whole section was flooded with thermionic radiation during the last attack itll be days before anyone can go in there
the design schematics are in our auxiliary datacore
ill see if i can download them you give me a hand
i couldnt help but notice your crew calls you by your first name
when youve been in the trenches as long as we have rank and protocol are luxuries besides were a long way from starfleet command
i know the feeling
you seem to run a pretty tight ship
weve been known to let our hair down from time to time but i find that maintaining protocol reminds us of where we came from and hopefully where were going
it seems to work quite well for you
oh weve overcome our share of obstacles warp core breaches ion storms a few rounds with the borg
the borg we havent seen so much as a cube since the day we arrived
consider yourself lucky
have you ever run into the krowtonan guard
never heard of them
thats how we spent our first week in the delta quadrant they claimed we violated their territory i gave the order to keep going i lost thirty nine half my crew
im sorry
we never recovered from that loss it changed everything
what do you mean
when i first realised that wed be travelling across the delta quadrant for the rest of our lives i told my crew that we had a duty as starfleet officers to expand our knowledge and uphold our principles after a couple of years we started to forget that we were explorers and there were times when we nearly forgot that we were human beings
this is a nova class science vessel designed for short term research missions minimal weapons it cant even go faster than warp eight frankly i dont know how youve done it youve obviously travelled as far as we have with much fewer resources
i wish that i could take all the credit but we stumbled across a wormhole and made a few enhancements on our warp engines id like to ask you something captain to captain
mmm hmm
the prime directive how often have you broken it for the sake of protecting your crew
broken it never bent it on occasion and even then it was a difficult choice what about you
ive walked the line once or twice but nothing serious there you are
its a good omen lets put it back where it belongs
i thought id find you here
how could i resist after two years on emergency rations
dont get too comfortable if janeways any indication these people will never understand
theyre going to find out eventually
not if we keep them out of the research lab and away from the warp core injectors and be careful what you say around their crew that includes old girlfriends
understood
mmm not bad
hows my angel of mercy
crewman lessing i didnt expect you to recover so quickly
you have an outstanding emh ours can barely hold a laser scalpel
the doctor is efficient
ive been assigned to help you sort through our biodata you saved my life the least i can do is save you a little time
lateral shields are offline
hows that possible
fissures are opening on decks one eight and eleven
reroute power
what happened
apparently the aliens began to focus their attacks on a single shield vector it collapsed before the auxiliary emitters could respond
it looks like theyve changed their tactics we may have less time than we thought
weve examined the schematics of your multiphasic chamber it can be adapted we intend to create an autoinitiating security grid
the moment an alien invades either ship a forcefield will surround it
once we modify our field generator to emit multiphasic frequencies it will power the security grids on both ships
how long will it take
approximately fourteen hours
we dont know when theyll break through again we may not last that long
we could cut the time in half if we evacuate all personnel from the equinox and focus our efforts here on voyager
remember we are still thirty five thousand light years from earth we should try to preserve both ships
with two vessels wed be able to pool our resources doubling our chances of finding a short cut home
normally id agree but right now one of our ships in vulnerable chakotays right we should make our stand on voyager
i dont want to force the issue but i am prepared to return to the equinox with my crew what is the protocol in this situation we have two captains and two ships who gets the last word
starfleet regulation one hundred ninety one article fourteen in a combat situation involving more than one ship command falls to the vessel with tactical superiority i looked it up this morning
good thinking
in this case protocol recognises my authority
are you ordering me to abandon my ship
id rather not have to
that protocol was written in the alpha quadrant im not sure that it makes much sense out here
the regulation stands
who am i to dispute protocol give captain janeway your full cooperation
rudy
max thats an order well get through this if thats all captain id like to return to my quarters and collect a few mementoes
by all means
intruder alert same old max going through my things that is a command station its off limits without my direct authorisation
i didnt realise are you going to throw me in the brig
i think we can overlook this infraction can i help you with something
just doing some homework studying your propulsion system if theres a chance im going to be stuck on voyager i figured i better learn my way around maybe you could tutor me over dinner
problem is you were never really interested in the work or the meal something tells me you havent changed
youd be surprised im not the what did you once call me
petaq
petaq im not the petaq i used to be let me prove it to you
look max dont get me wrong its good to see you again but ten years
tom paris
tom paris
you could do worse  so were still on for dinner just the two of us
get going or i will throw you in the brig
before we abandon the equinox we should try to salvage any useful components lets start with your dilithium crystals
what we have left of them im afraid we only have a few isograms
thats barely enough to power the sonic showers
can i make a suggestion
please
lets forget about the primary systems theyre too badly damaged lets focus on supplies we picked up a few items i think might come in handy two kilotons of kemacite ore a dozen canisters of mercurium
tell neelix to make room in cargo bay one
right
could you use a synaptic stimulator
depends what is it
its a neural interface you wear behind your ear it taps into your visual cortex and shows you different alien vistas just think of it as a poor mans holodeck
so thats how you kept yourself entertained
beats checkers the ponea gave it to us
never heard of them
we called them the life of the delta quadrant they see every first contact as an excuse to throw a party i wish that we had encountered more species like that youre the first friendly faces weve seen in months im glad we found you
the feelings mutual those modified plasma injectors looked elaborate what were you trying to do
we were experimenting with ways to enhance our warp drive it doesnt work
maybe we should let belanna take a look
it wont work we tried for months
excuse me
oh hello there
commander permission to interrupt
granted
ensign gilmore
thats right
naomi wildman captains assistant
is that so
i wanted to officially welcome you aboard the starship voyager
im glad to be here
if you need anything replicator rations a tour of the lower decks im your man
thank you miss wildman ill keep that in mind
as you were
i didnt realise that you had children on board
only one she was born here
i have a nephew back on earth the same age well not any more i guess hes a teenager by now i probably wouldnt even recognise him
youll see him again
ransom to gilmore
yes captain
report to the equinox bridge
on my way duty calls
assemble a salvage team
aye sir
once we take their field generator well part company
what happens to voyager
they have weapons shields a full crew theyll survive
maybe we should abandon ship try to forget everything thats happened here
a shower and a hot meal i guess thats all it takes for some of us to forget whats at stake here were going home we cant let voyager stop us now not when were this close now were proceeding as planned are there any other objections i need each and every one of you to give me your very best as you always have max
this wont be easy the generator is located on deck eleven next to the warp plasma manifold we cant get a clean lock without boosting the signal marla we need you to set aside your claustrophobia and crawl through the access port and set up the transport enhancers
understood
well have to take the internal sensors in that section offline noah youre elected
you can count on me sir
ill disengage the power couplings from engineering
youll all have time for one last shower make the most of it
theres a minor fluctuation in the security grid
its within tolerance
i believe i can correct it the discrepancy is in the equinox research lab if we can determine the exact frequency of their multiphasic chamber i will tune our field generator to match it
there are times when perfection hinders efficiency
this is odd the lab is still permeated with high levels of thermionic radiation
it should have dissipated by now
i believe i have an explanation three eps conduits have been rerouted to the lab it appears they are emitting the radiation
the lab was contaminated intentionally
any theories
only one ransom doesnt want us to enter the research lab
he has been adamant about protecting his ship i thought it was simply a captains pride i want to take a closer look at that lab if we close off those eps conduits how long will it take to vent the radiation
several hours
i dont want to wait that long send the doctor hell be immune to its effects tell him to look for anything out of the ordinary monitor his progress from astrometrics
shall i notify captain ransom
not yet i want to wait until we test your theory
im in ive found the multiphasic chamber theres some kind of organic mass inside it appears to be a member of the alien species
but its cell structures have vitrified
this is more that just a stasis chamber its some kind of matter conversion technology hold on theres a control port here hmm
doctor
the chamber contains a polaron grid
and a submolecular resequencer it looks like it was designed to convert the alien cell structures into some kind of crystalline compound
that function was not specified in their schematics
ive a feeling theres a lot here they didnt specify ive accessed their research logs theyre encrypted but judging by the file headings theyve performed this procedure dozens of times more of the alien compound but its been biochemically altered theyve extracted the base proteins its molecular structure is most unusual
can you be more specific
it appears to store a great deal of
nucleogenic energy im no engineer but id say they were trying to convert this material into a source of power
im going to miss this ship
once we get back to earth therell be plenty of women status
ready on all fronts the transport enhancers are in place and noahs created a subroutine to mask voyagers internal sensors
power couplings
bypass controls have been routed to our bridge all you need to do is say energise
janeway wants to bring on the security grid at nineteen hundred hours well have to act before then tell the others to be prepared to
max the transporter rooms not far from here keep moving
captain janeway wishes to speak with you
the alien compound ten isograms if i understand your calculations thats enough to increase your warp factor by what point zero three percent for one month unfortunately that boost wouldnt get you very far so youd need to replenish the supply and that means killing another lifeform and then another how many lives would it take to get you back to the alpha quadrant i think you know the reason were under attack these aliens are trying to protect themselves from you
sixty three thats how many more it will take every time i sacrifice one of those lives a part of me is lost as well
i might believe that if i hadnt examined your research these experiments were meticulous and they were brutal if youd felt any remorse youd never have continued
starfleet regulation three paragraph twelve in the event of imminent destruction a captain is authorised to preserve the lives of his crew by any justifiable means
i doubt that protocol covers mass murder
in my judgment it did
unacceptable
we had nothing my ship was in pieces our dilithium was gone we were running on thrusters we hadnt eaten in sixteen days we had just enough power to enter orbit of an m class planet and lucky for us the inhabitants were generous
they were called the ankari they provided us with a meal a few supplies even some dilithium crystals they even performed one of their sacred rituals to invoke spirits of good fortune from another realm to bless our journey but these werent spirits they were nucleogenic life forms our scans revealed that they were emitting high levels of antimatter later the same night we managed to obtain one of the summoning devices in exchange for an energy converter
we constructed a containment field that would prevent the lifeform from vanishing so quickly but something went wrong
get it out of there
we tried to send it back
we cant
but it was too late
we examined the remains and discovered it could be converted to enhance our propulsion systems it was already dead what would you have done we travelled over ten thousand light years in less than two weeks wed found our salvation how could we ignore it
by adhering to the oath you took as starfleet officers to seek out life not destroy it
its easy to cling to principles when youre standing on a vessel with its bulkheads intact manned by a crew thats not starving
its never easy but if we turn our backs on our principles we stop being human im putting an end to your experiments and you are hereby relieved of your command you and your crew will be confined to quarters
please show them leniency they were only following my orders
their mistake
its a long way home captain
doctor return to their research lab and retrieve all the data you can locate on the aliens i want to find a way to communicate with them
aye captain
go to their engine room take those warp core modifications offline
captain
lets try to make first contact the right way
whats going to happen to us
thats up to captain janeway youll be confined to quarters until we can find a way to make peace with these lifeforms youve been killing if its not too late
to be honest im glad you stopped us living the rest of my life knowing what weve done
you could have stopped yourself why didnt you
i dont know when the captain ordered me to modify the warp core i concentrated on the work i tried not to think about how it was going to be used
well think about it now because we need your help
commander
after you
were having trouble making sense of all this
the schematics are encrypted i cant access them
do you know the decryption codes your captains been relieved of command you take orders from me now do you have the codes
yes
proceed
think of it this way ensign you might live with yourself a little easier
you said you wanted to learn more about humanity i guess were not exactly prized examples im sorry
on the contrary youve taught me a great deal
computer i decrypted this data file why cant i access it
emh authorisation is required
is your emh still functional
affirmative
activate him
please state the nature of the medical emergency
i require your assistance
who are you
your counterpart from the starship voyager
wheres captain ransom my crew
in custody
how were you able to leave your sickbay
this device allows me to go anywhere i please in case you werent aware your crew has been running criminal experiments here
i know i designed them
you thats a violation of your programming
they deleted my ethical subroutines
im picking up spatial fissures hundreds of them
looks like theyve stepped up their attacks
reroute all available power to the shields
theyre holding but at this rate it wont be long before the aliens break through
bridge to tuvok we need that security grid
were preparing to bring it online charge the emitters
bridge to the doctor
sickbay here
did you find anything
could you be more specific
neural patterns cortical scans anything that could help us programme the universal translator
er negative i couldnt access the equinox data files they were encrypted
keep studying the information we have see what you can come up with
acknowledged computer locate captain ransom
captain ransom is in crew quarters deck nine section twenty two
chakotay to seven of nine whats your status
ive dismantled the antimatter injectors but ill need several minutes to neutralise the dilithium matrix
we dont have much time
understood
the equinox crew has been infected with a mutagenic virus it may be contagious ive been authorised to inoculate them
youve all contracted a virus ill need to treat you
a virus
doctors orders
its me
activate the grid what happened
i dont understand this should be working im running a systemwide diagnostic
im reading phaser fire on deck nine crew quarters
security seal off deck nine
shields are weakening theyre down to eighty four percent
tuvok to bridge the field generator is offline its power couplings were disengaged
someone reconfigured the sensors so we couldnt detect it
whatever it takes get that grid online
i rerouted transporter control to a panel in the next junction we can
theyve sealed off the deck
dont worry were getting out of here
shields down to fifty two percent
captain unauthorised transport in progress its the equinox crew
block it
theyve bypassed ops control theyre on their bridge
forty percent
janeway to seven of nine
seven respond
damn
what is it
belannas erected a forcefield i cant get a lock on the generator
try overriding the command codes
someones disrupting the forcefield its max hes using one of his triquadric algorithms i taught him how to do that ten years ago
shields are failing weve got less than one minute
open a channel if you dont stop what youre doing well both be destroyed
whats my alternative thirty years in your brig
ill open fire if i have to
weve been through worse
target their power systems fire
max
stand by okay blt lets see if you remember this trick
bridge theyve got the field generator
what do you mean theyve got it
i dont know how but they beamed it off voyager
get us out of here
i cant warp drive is down
bridge to marla report
one of their crew tried to dismantle the antimatter injectors repairs are underway
what about the field generator
im integrating it now
shields are down
arm yourselves
its now or never
generators in place im bringing the grid online
fissures are opening all decks
hold your fire
take it to the lab
sir engines are up and running
set a course for the alpha quadrant
course laid in
maximum warp engage
captain
give me tactical control
good guess i used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields it wont hold for long
bridge to sickbay we have a medical emergency doctor respond ensign
yes sir
casualty reports are coming in two dead thirteen wounded we took heavy damage to the engines
the equinox
theyve gone to warp
any sign of nucleogenic particles
no
then they havent engaged their enhanced warp drive yet keep looking for
report
the shield grid is back in place the aliens are staying clear
are sensors picking up voyager
it looks like theyre under attack
maintain course
captain i found the doctors mobile emitter on deck nine you might want to take it to sickbay
any sign of the doc
ive got him right here
please state the nature of the dont bother
you should start with chakotay ive got him stabilised but hes got internal injuries
we found your emitter on deck nine
i was taken hostage by the equinox crew i deactivated myself to escape did you stop them
no
id ask for a status report but im not sure id want to hear it
harrys analysing the sound weve been hearing he thinks its some form of communication
well i once figured out how to speak with a terrelian seapod this couldnt be that much harder once i get out of sickbay ill lend him a hand
we should all be focusing our efforts on finding the equinox
first things first weve got to stop these attacks
our enemies arent the aliens theyre the humans aboard the equinox its crucial that you dont
who is it
its max ive brought you a visitor
hold on come in
im glad youre okay ive been using this synaptic stimulator i was just taking a stroll along the tenkaran coast youre welcome to try it
state your intentions
you know once we get our enhanced warp drive back online well be on our way home but itll still take months to get there you can spend that time in the brig or you can become part of this crew id prefer the latter
id prefer the brig
you know janeways not the only captain who can help you explore your humanity
you would be an inferior role model
janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew maybe you should learn from that mistake
her only mistake was trusting you
take care of her wound
first degree phaser burns minor lacerations looks like well have to amputate that was a joke youre supposed to smile and make a witty retort
im familiar with human banter yours is crude and predictable
you know seven can i call you seven we dont have many luxuries around here all weve got is each other you might try letting your shields down or else its going to be a lonely trip ill be damned looks like our doctor left us a replacement
seven
we are captives
i was attacked by their emh
looks like he downloaded you into our database good you can treat your friend
priming the injectors
marla to bridge
go ahead
were ready
acknowledged
infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound
aye sir warp drive ready
engage
what happened
the power relays are offline theyve been encoded
give us the codes
no
if she wont give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves
sevens cranial infrastructure is highly complex youll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast
thats why youre going to help us
i refuse
do it or ill erase your programme
be my guest
doctor
dont worry they need me theyd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face now i suggest you
all right doctor now get to work you know what were looking for
very well shell try to resist ill have to restrain her
doctor
i deleted his ethical subroutines hell be a little more cooperative now keep me posted
aye captain this way please
its not exactly shakespeare but it gets the point across
a small olive branch is still an olive branch
run this through to your translation matrix
set your weapons down
commander
somebodys got to start trusting somebody around here
belay that order i appreciate your optimism but in this case weapons
ready to transmit
drop shields bridge only go ahead harry
raise shields
if they understood our message they havent responded
theres your response activate another deflector pulse
shields are holding at sixty two percent
that should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet i suggest we make the most of it focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive weve got to find the equinox
if its all the same to you id like to take another stab at the message if we can reroute
theyre not listening chakotay we should be tracking ransom not tinkering with adverbs
want your first officers advice
allow me our deflectors losing power and when it fails well be defenceless its voyager we should be worrying about not the equinox
youd make a great first officer its advice worth taking
maybe so but we have a crew member trapped on that ship
is this really about seven or is it about ransom
i dont know what youre talking about
youve been known to hold a grudge this man betrayed starfleet he broke the prime directive dishonoured everything you believe in and threw voyager to the wolves
borg hirogen malon weve run into our share of bad guys ransoms no different
yes he is you said it yourself hes human i dont blame you for being angry but you cant compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta
i appreciate your candour now let me be just as blunt youre right i am angry im damned angry hes a starfleet captain and hes decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for hes out there right now torturing and murdering innocent lifeforms just to get home a little quicker im not going to stand for it im going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes no matter what the cost if you want to call that a vendetta go right ahead
why did you bring us here
this planet has a parthogenic atmosphere it will keep us from being detected while we make repairs
we also found a few deuterium deposits
take an away team noah and see if you can localise the ore
you wont be protected from the aliens arm yourselves with phasers at the first sign of trouble well beam you back
aye sir
the ocular nodes connected to the sensory node the sensory nodes connected to the cortical node the cortical nodes connected to the reticular node dont look so gloomy theres a silver lining to all this just think were finally going to see earth
you are obviously delusional allow me to repair your programme
now why would i want you to do that you of all people should understand being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient
status
im going to extract her cortical array it contains an index of her memory engrams but once ive removed it her higher brain functions language cognitive skills will be severely damaged
tell me the codes
no
janeway was right about one thing you are unique it would be a shame to lose you
your compassion is irrelevant
you think this is easy for me the sight of you on that table but youre leaving me no choice
no choice you say that frequently you destroy lifeforms to attain your goals then claim that they left you no choice does that logic comfort you
the codes
youll have to destroy me to obtain them
the reticular nodes connected to the occipital node
come in
you wanted to see me
its not like you to submit recommendations in writing
the last time we spoke you werent exactly receptive
im afraid im not going to be very receptive this time either its an interesting idea but the ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction
i understand that but theyre the ones who introduced ransom to these lifeforms it stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them tell them to call off their attacks
our first priority is to find ransom still no sign of nucleogenic particles
not yet
then he couldnt have gotten far without his enhanced drive his ships only capable of warp six ive been studying his service record hes had his share of runins with hostile aliens it seems that when hes being pursued he tends to hide at epsilon four he ran into a klingon birdofprey played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the klingons finally gave up two years later he eluded a romulan warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant go to astrometrics start looking for the kind of place youd hide if your ship was damaged
yes maam
how was the beach
do these programmes have people in them
no just landscapes why
forget it
im reading a vein of ore azimuth one seventeen thirty metres it could run pretty deep we might need to use phasers to excavate it its funny this reminds me of mckinley park i used to take my sister there when we were kids this place looks just like it as i recall there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there there was a patch of poison ivy next to it when i was ten i walked right through it and i swelled up like a rigellian bloodworm when i get back to earth the first thing im going to do is
four to beam up
were receiving a subspace transmission
from who
i cant tell
i dont see a ship out there open a channel
doctor to equinox respond
we can hear you
voyagers found you theyve entered orbit they polarised their hull to mask their approach
i believe theyve planned an ambush on the away team
janeways been tracking the equinox for a couple
get him back
i cant
ransom to away team noah prepare to beam back to the ship
theyre not down there
all hands to battle stations
thirty thousand kilometres and closing
target their power core
direct hit minor damage
return fire
bridge to torres status
i cant locate their shield grid generator can you divert more power to sensors
stand by
theyve damaged our deflector captain if it goes offline well be vulnerable to the alien attacks
noted target his weapons array
we lost all phaser banks
torpedoes full spread
its belanna shes trying to bypass our security protocols
stop her
computer open a comm link to the equinox workstation thirty three beta
max listen to me
back for round two blt
this isnt one of our games people are dying over here
i wish you didnt have to be one of them
max please
shields are weakening
weve almost got him keep targeting their weapons array one more torpedo ought to do it
captain
fire
weapons are down
janeway to ransom surrender your vessel
we still have thrusters dont we
aye sir
lay in a course through the planets atmosphere sixty degree vector
what the hell is he doing follow him
were crossing the upper thermosphere
phasers
shields are weakening thirty one percent twenty nine
inertial dampers are offline
captain if we loose our shields well be attacked by the aliens captain
break off pursuit
theyre retreating
take us up
they took heavy damage shields propulsion
get us out of here
theyve gone to warp
match their course and speed
we cant not until we restore primary systems
time
well need a few hours
at least we didnt come away emptyhanded
i want ransoms tactical status i want it now mister lessing
or what youll hit me
no crewman ill drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit
that would be murder
you could also call it poetic justice
i suppose the plan is that youre going to come to my rescue now right
theres no plan as far as i know the captains on her own
ransoms status now
no way in hell
we all make our own hell mister lessing i hope you enjoy yours the comm is active well be outside if you have a change of heart
what are you doing
werent you listening
dont do this
hell break
bridge to the captain weve lost shields in section twenty nine alpha
i know stand by
hes a loyal officer hes not going to betray his captain put up the shields
hell break
captain
as you were
level nine authorisation required
damn it kathryn
youre panicking hes going to talk
captain a fissure is opening in that section
understood
okay youve demonstrated your loyalty to your captain fine now lets talk about the ankari
if theres an ankari vessel less than two light years from here why havent we detected it
apparently they use a unique form of propulsion which makes them hard to find
you think theyll be willing to help us
its worth a try mister lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors once you find the ankari ship set a course
aye sir
did our prisoner disclose any other information
im afraid not the rest of you continue with the repairs dismissed
commander
all right were going to try it your way but i want to make one thing clear
our first priority is to get ransom if theres one thing youve made clear its that
weve had our disagreements chakotay but youve never openly opposed me
you almost killed that man today
it was a calculated risk and i took it
it was a bad call
ill note your objection in my log
i dont give a damn about your log this isnt about rules and regulations its about right and wrong and im warning you i wont let you cross that line again
then you leave me no choice you are hereby relieved of duty until further notice
whats happened to you kathryn
i was about to ask you the same question
they are not responding
tractor beam
captain the ankari ship has done nothing
just do it
were being hailed
on screen
starfleet
yes
leave us alone theres nothing of value on our ship
we need your guidance your spirits of good fortune are attacking us
of course they are youve been killing them
we are not the ones responsible
equinox
thats right can you communicate with the aliens
release my ship
i cant do that not until you agree to talk to them
i will summon them but you must talk to them you must convince them
they say they want the humans to die
a difficult place to start a negotiation
will they understand me
yes
we didnt do this to you were trying to stop the humans who did
they dont believe you would harm your own kind
we have rules for behaviour the equinox has broken those rules by killing your species its our duty to stop them
give us the equinox give us the equinox they insist on destroying the ones who are responsible
we will punish them according to our own rules they will be imprisoned they will lose their freedom
all right if you stop your attacks ill deliver the equinox to you
captain
i know what im doing tuvok
these beings would destroy captain ransom and his crew
whats their answer
your behaviour is irrational we could find another solution
ive already confined my first officer to quarters would you like to join him well
they agree
were going to need more fuel weve only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years
fuel is that the euphemism were using now you mean we need to kill more lifeforms
several more
oh my darling oh my darling oh my darling
clementine
how much longer
another hour maybe less you are lost and gone forever
dreadful sorry clementine
what are you doing
her auditory processor we used to practice duets together in fact i taught her this old chestnut light she was and like a fairy
and her shoes were number nine
herring boxes without topses
sandals were for clementine
drove she ducklings to the water
enough
why the long face captain youre about to get your crew home she tried to stand in your way you had no choice
no choice thank you doctor
when this is all over perhaps youll allow me to teach you my repertoire im going to need a new partner
hmm drove she ducklings to the water
you what are you doing here
hiding like you
im not hiding
its beautiful i can see why this brings you comfort
i dont know what youre talking about
but it isnt real
youre not real now leave me alone
its not too late to stop
i dont have a choice
find another way
there is no other way
stop trying to hide
i told you im not hiding now get away from me
end this
no
bridge to ransom
go ahead
janeways found us
on my way
distance
fifty thousand kilometres closing fast
maintain course voyagers approaching at high warp theres a class two nebula less than a light year from here janeways sensors wont be able to track us once were inside i think that we should pursue this course
no open a channel
change of tactics
you might say that its time we found another way home
another way
were going to cooperate with janeway max if shes willing
rudy with all due respect have you lost your mind
just the opposite
theyre within range theyre charging weapons
hail them
belay that order raise shields
youre relieved of duty commander
im taking command anyone who isnt with me speak up now take him to the brig
im sorry
whats the status of our weapons
full complement of torpedoes minimal phasers
open a secure channel to their sickbay stand by weapons
aye sir
im here
were going to need your help doctor see if you can find voyagers current shield frequency
acknowledged ill need a few minutes
they are firing torpedoes
direct hit to our port shields theyre holding
return the favour
this isnt the brig
i know im with you sir lets find a way to end this
well need to access transporter control
weve damaged their port nacelle theyre venting plasma
theyre dropping out of warp
stay with them
doctor to equinox ive got their shield frequency
im transmitting it to you now
theyll try to remodulate keep monitoring
aye sir
theyve slowed to one quarter impulse
prepare a tractor beam
they are launching another torpedo
full power to the forward shields
hull breach on deck four
howd they get through our shields
hard about get us out of range remodulate the shields
theyre retreating
pursuit course maintain fire
they took out the weapons array
tuvok
ive been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds
weve lost impulse engines
were being hailed its ransom
put him through
captain im prepared to surrender the equinox but im no longer in command max decided to stage a little mutiny but i think i can stop him ive isolated transporter control i can beam all of us to voyager you might want to have some guards standing by not everyone here is going to be happy to see you
proceed
maam
hes still a starfleet captain he may have forgotten that for a while but i believe him
someones trying to beam us off forcefields
theyre deflecting our targeting scanners
then beam the others to voyager yourself included ill take care of max
aye sir
computer give me access to the shield grid
well i see youve made yourself at home
what are you doing here
taking back my sickbay
stop where you are ive planted photonic charges throughout these holoprojectors with one command sequence i can blow out your entire
computer delete the equinox emh
the doctors not transmitting anymore
burke to doctor report
im afraid your physicians no longer on call
max this is the captain ive dropped the shield grid
everywhere except the bridge and my current location
the vital systems are exposed
i suggest you beam to voyager while you still can
the core is overloading weve got to get out of here
where voyagers brig
its better than being vaporised
we still have a working shuttle
the shuttle bays two decks down sir the aliens
well make it
this way
theres only one life sign left its ransom
captain
things didnt work out exactly as i planned but youve got everyone worth getting
were beaming you out of there
this ship is about to explode ive got to put some distance between us ive accessed helm control
you can set autonavigation and then transport to voyager
theres no time youve got a fine crew captain promise me youll get them home
i promise
good as new id like you to regenerate for the next few hours itll help stabilise your cortical array
understood
regarding the unpleasantness aboard the equinox i hope you dont think less of me
your programme was altered
its quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into mister hyde
perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols it will prevent such tampering in the future
good thinking
when im done regenerating i will assist you
thanks
you were offkey
i beg your pardon
my darling clementine third verse second measure
thats impossible
your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz i can assist you with that as well
really holodeck two tomorrow sixteen hundred hours just you me and a tuning fork
i look forward to it
the last time we welcomed you aboard you took advantage of our trust you betrayed this crew i wont make that mistake again noah lessing marla gilmore james morrow brian sofin angelo tassoni you are hereby stripped of rank youll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel your privileges will be limited and youll serve under close supervision for as long as i deem fit this time youll have to earn our trust dismissed
repairs
coming along
hows the crew
a lot of frayed nerves neelix is organising a potluck to help boost morale
will i see you there
im replicating the salad
ill bring the croutons chakotay you know you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own
the thought had occurred to me but that would have been crossing the line
will you look at that
all these years all these battles this things never fallen down before
lets put it back up where it belongs
input failure
input failure
input failure
our link to the collective has been severed initiate secondary protocols the vessels transwarp chamber is approaching critical pressure we must evacuate this area
agreed
no directional coordinates available
that way bearing three zero one
agreed
bring that drone
captain
ill be right with you the station manager didnt tell me the vines were prehensile i went to put some water in the pot and it grabbed me
this is a gift from the kinbori delegation i dont know its name only that its used in one of their sacred games and its very heavy
put it down anywhere thank the kinbori for me and give them a token of our esteem
i already gave them a voyager medallion they seemed appreciative
come in doesnt it look like christmas morning in here commander
you have to admit the generosity of our guests is very impressive
as is their proclivity for criminal behaviour this mornings security report
a broken odn line some missing personal items a damaged scanner relay all in all not that bad
there is a second page to the report
oh some of these incidents are a little more serious but on balance i still think we did the right thing
there is a third page
come on tuvok after all the xenophobic races weve run into dont you find it just a little refreshing to meet some people who value openness and freedom
well as far as im concerned opening the ship has been a fascinating experience and an unqualified success im very pleased
me too
i am pleased that you are pleased if youll excuse me
tuvok please accept this token of our esteem
ooh ow its got me by the hair
now its twelve forty five
if youre hungry you may eat without me
you said wed have lunch together
i havent completed my analysis of the stations power conversion matrix
how long is it going to take
several hours
seven you promised
very well
i think its even more crowded than this morning
yes
excuse us excuse us please were trying to get through to the turbolift excuse us
stand aside
thank you
im sorry but theres no more marsupial surprise we only had two kilos of pouches to begin with and its all gone now how about some pizza huh
shes a shivolian right
correct
species five two one
your mother would not approve of you memorising borg designations i dont approve either weve discussed the impropriety of you emulating the borg
sorry
im finished
we just sat down
i do not enjoy crowds
but you were in the collective wasnt that like a big crowd
which is why i do not enjoy them now
oh im sorry i didnt realise that lets go
excuse me are you seven of nine
yes
you okay
these are borg synaptic relays from my original unimatrix
these are yours
where did you acquire them
a trader from orendal five i was told you are a former borg drone and might be interested in acquiring these pieces
ill take them captain janeway will provide you with whatever monetary reimbursement you require
agreed
i must examine these items more closely
okay
whats your name
that was rude
stage two is complete she has the relays
shes going to study them
her regeneration alcove is in cargo bay two
thats where shell go we should prepare for stage three
agreed
theres consensus rendezvous at my coordinates and stand by to penetrate their security
error
explain
we shouldnt be desecrating the body of this drone it is against the will of brothara
who is brothara
brothara supernatural deity worshipped by species five seven one
i am a member of species five seven one
youre being confused by irrelevant data ignore it
you said i am a member of species five seven one do you consider yourself an individual
there are no individuals here we are borg
agreed
resume constructing the communications beacon
it looks like a standard borg synaptic relay
there must be something more when i first came into contact with it i was overwhelmed with images memories sounds
sounds like a perfectly natural reaction to me that was part your old unimatrix right well isnt it at least possible that what you experienced was simply nostalgia you know sentimental feelings about the past
i know what nostalgia is but i have no feelings about the past
okay i think ive done all i can here
lieutenant you were trying to help i appreciate that
anytime oh and er you may not be nostalgic about the past but id say you definitely have feelings about it strong ones
their security protocols are formidable we may not have enough time
im worried about seven of nine we should reexamine the question of simply asking
you know what her reactions will be she wont help us because she
weve been through all that
enough
i need consensus
we cant act without it
i know
so then its up to you do we proceed or not
yes we i apologise for my indecision
apologies are irrelevant
computer begin multipolar analysis
analysis underway
time to completion
five hours seventeen minutes
shes regenerating
begin rerouting their internal sensors
rerouting sensor input to secondary processors
hold
what have you got
theres a power fluctuation in the security grid
all we know is that weve got a security breach we dont know where
ready insert the interlink module
ready
hes still worried about injuring her
if we fail well never become individuals we have to remember that
there is consensus
ive found her memory files
shes aware of our presence
shes trying to regain consciousness
we must abort
no were too close
i will not comply
i have performed this action before i was with my father he was a tall man
i have a similar memory but i was in a house and the fire was in the hearth
the biomatter is ready
it tastes similar to a bird i once ate
i used to prepare food for my parents they lived in a small building by a river
i used to be afraid of the dark
just before i was assimilated i was eating with a group of men we worked in numbers mathematics i calculated equations for another man
i have a name its marika marika willkarah willkarah
hello marika willkarah
her designation is three of nine
i have a name pchan son of dornar and ansha my primary function was to care for them
i was married we were on a starship the excalibur i worked in engineering
this is not my hand
my parents are dead the borg killed them i hate the borg
this is counterproductive we must delete all irrelevant data
i want my hand back
i was on duty the night watch when the borg came oh my god look at what theyve done to me these these things they put in my body what have they done
command override cease this interaction comply we will not access these memory files again initiate the prescribed maintenance and survival protocols only no further communication is required until we are rassimilated into the collective
agreed
agreed
agreed
but whoever removed their implants was a poor surgeon their internal organs were damaged during the procedure and their bodies are covered with scars
you said you recognised them
not at first but when they attempted to access my memory files i was momentarily linked with them two of nine three of nine four of nine we were all members of the same unimatrix
do you know why they were trying to access your memories
no
how long have they been disconnected from the collective
three or four months however they are still connected to each other somehow the left parietal lobes of their brains have been transformed into organic interlink nodes theyve become linked together into a sort of collective triad
revive them im captain janeway we know who you are and we know what you were trying to do what we dont know is why
she has information we need
what kind of information
we want to become
individuals
you want to break the neural link between the three of you
wouldnt you none of us is alone with our own thoughts our own feelings
every day of my life is spent hearing their two voices in my head
when were asleep we experience each others dreams
hows that different from life in the collective
in the collective there are billions of voices they become white noise
but with only three
each voice comes through clearly
it has to stop we must break the neural link
doctor is there anything you can do
the modifications are too extensive their neuronal pathways have been fundamentally altered
you hold the key
why
you were there with us
planet one eight six five alpha you must remember
eight years ago our vessel crashed the four of us were the only survivors
when we were reassimilated
we found wed been linked together somehow
we were a subset within the collective
its like having three voices whispering in one ear
and a crowd screaming in the other
we had to break free so we worked together we finally escaped
we had our implants removed on inavar prime
but they couldnt break the neural link
we need to find out what happened eight years ago after the crash
the night we were reassimilated into the collective we need to know how the link was created but our memories are
fragmented disorganised we hoped that you would know
i dont however i am willing to attempt to retrieve the data come with me
are you ready
yes
data search complete do you remember anything further
no my last memory
is of us standing
around the campfire
and yet the data files in your cortical processor appear to be intact i see no evidence that would explain your lapse in memory
what about you why dont you remember what happened
i dont know ive found no evidence of damage to my memory files either i remember the campfire and then waking up in the collective there is an obvious gap but no indication of why
why do they still call you seven you should have a name
it is my name
no its a designation youre an individual now
i decided that my former name was no longer appropriate prepare to reinitialise the memory cascade
i cant wait to use my real name again
there is nothing preventing you from doing so
except that most of the time i dont know whether my name is marika pchan or lansor the names the memories
the memories even the thoughts flow from one to the other
i cant love or hate or laugh
or cry without sharing it with them
how can any of us take a name for
for ourselves
were not individuals
were not borg
were nothing
begin the memory cascade
a friendly game
well thats how it started
i see perhaps you could explain to me how this friendly game turned into a street brawl
well harry and i wanted to explore the station we wanted to broaden our understanding of alien cultures and er
skip the recruiting speech you were looking for a bar then what
well we found one and we met a pair of kinbori who told us about this game they play with these big oddlooking rackets
you mean one of those
yeah
in any case they challenged us to a game and we accepted but i guess we werent quite aware of all the rules
because youd been drinking
yes maam you see we thought it was a version of tennis but as soon as we hit the first volley this kinbori jumps over the net and starts attacking us with his racket
so we figured we were supposed to fight back
yeah
and then er well things got a little out of hand
a little out of hand seven voyager crewmen including two bridge officers along with thirteen kinbori and one morphinian café owner all arrested the charges range from disorderly conduct to assault on a security officer
that last ones not true
thank you mister kim ill note that exception in my log youre both confined to quarters until further notice after you report to sickbay thats all well did you win
oh yes maam
we kicked their rackets
good dismissed
any progress
ive determined that we all have exactly the same gap in our memories it seems unlikely that it would be a coincidence
so you believe the collective deliberately wiped your recollections of the reassimilation process
it is the most likely explanation
but
the collective would not care that four drones remember being reassimilated
something must have happened during the process something they wanted to hide from you lets look at this from a different perspective why would the collective lock them into a neural triad in the first place
i dont know there is no advantage to having three drones linked together in this manner
they obviously did it for some reason and i get the feeling that if we can answer that question the rest should fall into place but i wish we could find a way to close the gaps in your memories
there is a way
i assume theres a reason you didnt mention it before now
it would involve linking my neural interface to theirs together we may be able to restore the missing data however i would again be part of a group mind
youre not eager to revisit that experience hmm
theres also the possibility that i could become trapped in the neural link
turning the triad into a quartet i wont ask you to take that kind of risk
i do feel compelled to help them but i am uncertain as to the correct course of action
let me ask you something do you think of these people as family
is it relevant
theres an old saying blood is thicker than water it means that the ties of family run deeper than any other kind of relationship well often do things for members of our family wed never dream of doing for anyone else
seven seven
naomi wildman
i heard about the drones did they hurt you
i am not damaged
what do they want
they are seeking information from me but i am uncertain whether i can help them
oh be careful
naomi wildman do you consider me to be family
i i dont i mean yes is that okay
i have no objection
do you think of me as family
yes
ill be monitoring your neural readings while youre in the link but im not certain ill be able to counter the effects if you become trapped
i know youll do your best
its never a good sign when the patient feels the need to comfort the doctor good luck
ready
ready
ready
ready
you are damaged i will assist you dont worry everything will be all right
the collective has located us a borg vessel is on its way
we will be one with the borg again
no i do not want to rejoin the collective
agreed
that is in violation of all established protocols
forget the protocols youre not a drone youre a person like us
you have a name a life all you have to do is embrace who you really are
no i do not exist i am only part of the greater whole
thats what they want you to believe thats what they want us all to believe
we are borg our primary function is to serve the collective
not anymore
error input failure
they may know what planet were on but without the beacon itll be far more difficult to locate us
if we can remodulate our cortical implants we might be able to elude their sensors
we must leave this place
this discussion is in violation of all established protocols
you stay here and be reassimilated if you want to i wont
what are you doing
the nanoprobes will create new interlink nodes in your left hemisphere resistance is futile
i will not comply i will not comply
state your designations
two of nine primary adjunct of unimatrix zero one
three of nine auxiliary processor of unimatrix zero one
four of nine secondary adjunct of unimatrix zero one
what is your primary function
to serve the collective
you will repair the communications beacon
it was you you were responsible what have you done to us
you linked us together
youre responsible for our suffering
how could you do it
if you didnt want to return to the collective
you didnt have to
you dont understand what happened
somebody help me
whats happening
somehow they broke their link with seven theyre malfunctioning help me get them to sickbay
when they broke the connection with you it must have overloaded their cortical implants they went into neural shock
and yet i was undamaged
i think i know why you said you remembered injecting them with nanoprobes eight years ago
yes it created an interlink between them it was the only way to prevent them from escaping the collective
well it seems to have had an unfortunate side effect their higher brain functions were somehow tied into the interlink when they broke their connection with you in the cargo bay the shock to their cognitive systems was too great
can you revive them
i can remove the microcortical implants that would break the link binding them together but it would also kill them theyd only live a matter of weeks a month at the most
what are the other options
they could be returned to the borg if they were reassimilated into the collective they would regain consciousness and then live out a normal life span
as drones
as drones but theyd be alive seven
they have no hope of surviving unless they return to the collective
not exactly a happy ending is it
no
back on that planet why do you think you reacted so differently from the rest of them why were you so afraid of becoming an individual
when i was first assimilated into the collective i was a child they were assimilated as adults when our individual memories began to resurface
yours were of being a little girl a scared little girl
i let that fear control me after i saw the drone die in the swamp i panicked i began to envision my own death alone without even the sound of another drone to comfort me so i forced them to return i infiltrated their left cerebral hemispheres with nanoprobes and created a new interlink network one that they couldnt resist and then i eliminated the evidence of what i had done
you were overwhelmed by feelings you couldnt begin to understand youre not responsible for that
because of what i did theyll be forced to live the rest of their lives in the collective for that i am responsible
theres a difference between surviving and living theyll survive in the collective but they wont really be alive you know that better than any of us
there is no alternative
how long would they survive if the doctor deactivated this interlink network you created
a month at most
a month as an individual or a lifetime as a drone which option would you choose
survival is insufficient
i beg your pardon
eight years ago i forced them to return to the collective i wont make the same mistake again they deserve to exist as individuals we must terminate the link between them
i understand that you feel a certain responsibility for these patients but as their physician so do i its my duty to preserve their lives for as long as possible even if that means
i will not return them to the borg
are you thinking of whats best for them or for you
clarify
you said it yourself you made a mistake and seven of nine doesnt like to make mistakes she strives for perfection i want you to think about the motivation behind your decision are you doing whats right for those three people or are you trying to alleviate the guilt you feel over what happened eight years ago
the damage i did can never be repaired and my guilt is irrelevant i simply want them to experience individuality as i have as you have at one time you were confined to this sickbay your programme was limited to emergency medical protocols in some ways you were not unlike a drone but you were granted the opportunity to explore your individuality you were allowed to expand your programme your mobile emitter gives you freedom of movement your thoughts are your own if you were told you had to become a drone again i believe you would resist
yes i suppose i would
they would resist as well they would choose freedom no matter how fleeting only you and i can truly understand that
survival is insufficient
its so quiet
i had no idea you were going to say that i dont know what either of you is thinking
id forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own thoughts im leaving
where will you go
i want to see the space station to meet new people to fill my life with life again in the time i have left
im leaving as well theres an uninhabited planet only a few lightyears from here id like to spend my final days in the open air
my people dont believe in holding grudges i wish you well seven of nine
thank you
its nice to be on a federation starship again id like to stay aboard voyager
the captain said you may stay as long as you wish
you mean as long as i have i cant forgive you for what you did to us but i do understand why you did it
naomi wildman
i thought you might like some company
why
because of what happened with the drones
i see that word travels quickly
its a small ship i thought maybe you might want to spend some time with family
torres to voyager i could use a little help here
whats your status
im approaching your position but that ion storm blew out my deflector field ive lost helm control and im venting plasma from the port nacelle
were modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down
acknowledged
the arresting fields are in place youre clear to land
hold on belanna this is going to be bumpy
belanna are you alive
you tell me
youve got a mild concussion
thats the best thing thats happened to me all day
when i give you an order i expect you to follow it i told you to return to voyager not chase the probe into the centre of an ion storm
we only have one multispatial probe i didnt want to lose it
we only have one belanna torres i dont want to lose her either
understood
lanna im glad you made it back in one piece
did you just call me lanna
i suppose i did
thats what my mother used to call me
well then im in good company
come in
feeling better
ive felt worse
i found something you might be interested in its what my ancestors called a monkey wrench it was lodged in your port nacelle
how did it get there
judging by your sensor logs it looks like you ran into it after your deflector field collapsed but the big question is how did it get in this quadrant
what do you mean
what its klingon
and its old thats about all we know looks like the klingons beat starfleet to the delta quadrant by a few hundred years you may be holding the most important archaeological find in klingon history
remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the empire you know the simplest explanation is that the borg assimilated a bird of prey somewhere in the alpha quadrant and they blew it out an airlock on their way home
maybe so in any case it makes a nice souvenir
harry it bled ut screamed theres got to be some explanation
hey ive got one for you you hit your head harder than you thought
i wasnt hallucinating now run a submolecular scan
how many more scans are we going to run theres nothing there no fluid or vapour residue
we may find some irregularities at the atomic level
its a hunk of metal what you heard may have had nothing to do with this artefact maybe the comm system picked up some stray signal from a pulsar i dont know
a pulsar that speaks klingon
okay belanna there probably is some explanation for what happened but its oh three hundred hours im tired youre tired lets just stick this thing in a containment field and deal with it in the morning
ah just the daughter of the empire ive been looking for i wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your discovery of the klingon artefact
neelix i ran into it with a shuttle
some of the greatest discoveries in klingon history were accidents when sarpek the fearless unearthed the knife of kirom he was searching for his lost targ isnt that amazing ive been doing some research
why
well im planning a celebration this must be the treasure
neelix look i appreciate your enthusiasm but since im the only klingon on board theres really no point in throwing a party
oh nonsense this artefact isnt just a testament to klingon spirit its a piece of the alpha quadrant a symbol of voyagers home and thats just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old knife
the mans got a point
and besides ive already replicated five barrels of bloodwine im not going to let them go to waste festivities begin at nineteen hundred hours oh er i almost forgot as guest of honour youre going to be expected to say a few words on behalf of your people
it sounds like youve got a big day ahead of you you should probably get some rest
all right all right lets call it a night
thank you
do not underestimate the power of the mind the artefact was a catalyst for your already active imagination it served as an unwelcome reminder of your ancestry the selfloathing you experience when you look in the mirror and see a klingon
who said anything about selfloathing
you despise being klingon its no secret what you experienced in your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred the blood in your veins the voices of your ancestors all symbols of your klingon heritage
and when the blood disappeared that was what me trying to vaporise that part of myself
yes but the essence of who you are the artefact itself remained
and the moral of the story is
quite simple that despite your efforts to become something else whether it be starfleet or maquis your klingon nature continues to assert itself
thats an intriguing theory
perhaps we should forego your meditation in favour of a different exercise
fine by me
this should be interesting
feel the weight of the batleth in your hands describe the first thought that enters your mind
its a clumsy weapon overstated like everything else klingon
you cant see the elegance of its design because of your hatred
i dont hate klingons
its a warriors blade crafted for precision and balance observe
is this your idea of therapy
listen to yourself whine like a ferengi
petaq
youre not worthy of the blood in your veins a true klingon would try to kill me where i stand
what the hell has gotten into you
this exercise is over you are dismissed lieutenant and take your dishonour with you
ej humtah ej dechtah iw and the blood was ankledeep ej doq sodtah ghospa sqral biqtiq and the river skral ran crimson red
i fail to see the merit of learning a klingon drinking song
its not about drinking seven its about saluting the noble deeds of our ancestors and honouring those who fell in battle think qapla think long live the empire
think again
okay so im overdoing it a bit but try to get into the spirit of the occasion
very well ej humtah ej dechtah iw
ej doq sodtah ghospa sqral biqtiq e pa jaj law mo jaj pus jaj qeylis molar migh hohchu
gagh anyone sop joq jih yuv gagh drek
he said eat this or hell force it down the gullet of your corpse
no offence
oh none taken so this is replicated right
unfortunately
and how do you get it to move
i used a kinesthetic agent to give it a little oomph
is it just me or has everyone gone klingonhappy
oh come on belanna theyre all doing this for you
well then they dont know me very well and if you even think of joining in on this embrace your heritage nonsense i swear ill rip out your tongue and wear it as a belt
oh no theres not a lot of klingon in you
i inherited the forehead and the bad attitude thats it she would have loved all this
your mother
she was so obsessed with klingon ritual myths it used to drive my father and me crazy did i ever tell you that she put me in a klingon monastery
youre kidding
it was after their marriage ended she pulled me out of the federation school in order to teach me honour and discipline
out of the plasma cooker into the fire
she prayed to kahless every day to guide me in the ways of the warrior i guess he wasnt listening
ladies and gentlemen could i have your attention please i hate to interrupt the festivities but before i turn the floor over to our resident klingon id like to say a few words this is a great day for the klingon empire a day when we honour their ancestors those warriors whose deeds of valour and glory led them to the delta quadrant
may they live on in song and story
captain
legh soh va grethor
where am i
silence the dead ask no questions
computer end programme

let go of me

no wait
she wont take the mark
what the hell is going on
qusdaq ba qusdaq na ghah
where am i
you should know youre half klingon
enlighten me
this is the barge of the dead our dishonoured souls are being taken to grethor
klingon hell is a myth
thats what i thought just a foolish superstition imagine my surprise
but i was on voyager with my crew
that was the naj the dream before dying when we cant accept that weve died we create the illusion of life to hold on to
he slaughtered my friends
no he slaughtered the dream he dragged you from the illusion of life this is where you belong
hijqa mag hoshonah nesa grethor jih neh jih ghaj nug soh neh jih qhaj nug soh nug soh los vav nuqdaq sho nuqdaq oh puchpae

belanna are you there
lieutenant can you hear me
help us find you
tom chakotay
its not your friends
there are things here worse than death
you
is this the mongrel child you spoke of
yes the one whose face would not bear the mark
belanna daughter of miral its not your time
how do you know my name
youve come close to boarding this ship many times i remember the first you were a child your mother took you to the sea of gatan your curiosity was as deep as the water
i fell in i almost drowned
when your mother breathed life back into your lungs she told you about me
so youre supposed to be kortar
ah you remember me
i remember the myth of kortar the first klingon he destroyed the gods who created him
and as punishment i was condemned to ferry the souls of the dishonoured to grethor
i may have believed in you as a child but not anymore
if you didnt still believe you wouldnt be here
foolish girl
you cannot harm me im already dead
whats happening
the soul of another dishonoured warrior is being delivered
kotmah soh grethor
mother
its all right youre safe
your shuttle was drifting on the trailing edge of an ion storm you lost life support we found you just in time
but i got through the storm i remember crashing into the shuttlebay
when we tractored your shuttle back to voyager you were in a coma
we almost lost you
the klingon artefact
artefact
my hand
you took quite a beating out there more than your fair share of cuts and bruises
come in
how are you feeling
er a little out of place
would you like to talk about it
yes and no
let me know when you decide
i dont know how to say this without sounding crazy
try
do you believe in an afterlife
i accept there are things in the universe than cant be scanned with a tricorder what happened to you out there
i think i died i died and i was on the barge of the dead in the klingon afterlife
klingon mythology has been ingrained in you since you were a child its not surprising you experienced some of those images while you were unconscious
i saw my mother chakotay if it was real then shes dead
belanna your mother the barge of the dead those are just symbols its your subconscious mind trying to tell you something
tell me what that my mother is going to hell
you need time to digest what you experienced you have to interpret the symbols and search for their meaning
what if there is no symbolism to interpret what if the afterlife is real im an engineer my whole life ive immersed myself in science and schematics but what if its time to start looking beyond that
my grandfather used to think he could transform himself into a wolf so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm it was real to him as real as what your experience was to you but that doesnt mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all fours
my mother has been on my mind a lot lately we just had a big anniversary its been ten years since we talked but it was so real i could taste the blood in the air i could feel the wind i was seasick from the rocking of the boat
hi
hi
what are you reading
the paqbatlh its a sacred klingon scroll
find anything
you dont want to know
oh come on it cant be that bad
you want to bet i found out why my mother is on her way to grethor its because i sent her there
what do you mean
the sins of the child shes being punished for my dishonour i turned my back on everything klingon and now she has to pay the price
belanna you cant even be sure your mother is dead much less blame yourself for what happens to her in some afterlife
look at this the eleventh tome of klavek its a story about kahless returning from the dead still bearing a wound from the afterlife a warning that what he experienced wasnt a dream the same thing happened to me
belanna
and the only reason kahless was in the afterlife to begin with was to rescue his brother from the barge of the dead and deliver him to stovokor
okay
dont you see i have a chance to rescue my mother if i can accept responsibility for her dishonour before she passes through the gates of grethor i have to go back
well wait a minute what do you mean go back
i cant let her suffer for what ive done its the only way
belanna i respect what you believe in but youre starting to scare me
im scaring myself
its a controlled procedure ill be under constant supervision the doctor can simulate the conditions of the ion storm hes agreed to help me but only with your permission
im still not inclined to grant your request
are you telling me that i cant pursue my spiritual beliefs
belanna im not going to let you turn this into a debate about freedom of worship
but thats what it is
theres a limit to how far ill let religious practices go aboard this ship if your belief system required you to sacrifice a child to your gods i wouldnt allow that either
thats an absurd example
you want to simulate a near death experience so you can revisit the barge of death and youre telling me whats absurd bottom line belanna im not going to let you risk your life for this
captain please
request denied
what i do with my own life is one thing but to know that i have condemned my mother that because of what ive done shes
i appreciate what youre trying to say belanna but whatever you experienced it wasnt real
it doesnt matter if you think it was real it was real to me whatever it was it changed me i cant ignore that i need to confront whats happened
im sorry
you know youre just like her
lieutenant
my mother youre as dedicated to starfleet principles as she was to klingon honour i know that we havent always seen eye to eye but despite our differences you helped me become a good officer and id like to think that youre proud of me for it
i am
my mother never had the chance to be proud of me id like her to know me the way you do i dont want her to die thinking of me as a disgrace you have to let me do this
i cant believe the captain is allowing this one minute youre in a coma the next youre a bornagain klingoni just dont get it
im not sure i get it either i just know this is something i have to do
there must be an easier way for you to explore your spirituality go to church or something
it wouldnt be enough
look ill read the scrolls ill learn klingon well figure this out together
next time
i just hope there is a next time
there will be
report
ive examined the sensor logs from the shuttle mission i should be able to recreate the exact conditions that triggered her neardeath experience
good belanna
im ready
be careful
youll have an hour to do whatever it is you need to do at the first sign of trouble were bringing you out understood
computer erect an isolation field around the surgical bay decrease oxygen concentration within the force field by twenty seven percent begin ionising the enclosed atmosphere to five thousand particles per cubic metre shes unconscious

shes still alive her lungs are taking in just enough oxygen to keep her brain from necrotising
qapla belanna
susa g grethor qay
mother
stay away you are an illusion youre a koskarii trying to lure me away
mother its me its me
belanna then you died as well
ive come to lift your dishonour
but you dont believe in stovokor
a lots happened since the last time i saw you ive changed
not enough it was you who brought this damnation upon me
if you hadnt tried to force me to become a warrior
i tried to guide you in the ways of a klingon
you tried a little too hard
if you had listened to me when you were younger we wouldnt be on the barge of the dead you were always running away
you drove me away the same way you drove away my father
he abandoned us
you pushed him to the point where he couldnt bear to be around anything klingon including me
i wanted to give you honour and if you had understood that i would be not be on my way to grethor
were on the barge of the dead and were still having the same argument we were having ten years ago look if i have dishonoured you i am truly sorry
are you you have too much anger in your heart to be sorry
oh we dont have time for this if were going to perform the transference
is that how you intend to lift my dishonour by taking my place
oh dont worry i have no intention of being on this barge when it gets to grethor weve got just enough time to perform the ritual before my crew resuscitates me
oh i should have known youd choose the easy way
what are you talking about do you know the risks ive taken to save you
you still understand nothing about being a klingon i would rather face damnation with what little honour you have left me than cheat my way into stovokor
there she is bring them
the mongrel child has returned
im here to take my mothers place
belanna
you wish to claim her dishonour as your own
yes
youre willing to die for her
yes release her to stovokor
no
keep her quiet
silence
its not your decision she has the right to reclaim your honour once weve reached grethor and you are within its gates i will release her
no now
youre very impatient time must be slipping away in the living world youre concerned that your friends will revive you before you complete your deception did you really think that i could be fooled so easily
i will die for her no tricks no games i will take her place honourably like a klingon
if you choose this path your friends will not be able to save you
no i forbid it
i understand
your dishonour has been lifted stovokor awaits you
i will not abandon my daughter
she has made the choice go
daughter of miral embrace your fate
her neural patterns are breaking down
im initiating emergency resuscitation vent the ionised particles twenty milligrams cordrazine now
im deactivating the forcefield
welcome to grethor
this isnt grethor
oh i assure you it is youve taken your mark
what is this some kind of a joke
this is no laughing matter
youve met mister neelix our ambassador to the recently deceased questions comments suggestions hes your man
if youll follow me
by the way ill be performing an aria from berliozs faust tomorrow night in holodeck two feel free to stop by
fifteen decks computers augmented with bioneural circuitry top cruising speed warp nine point nine seven five not that youll be going anywhere
no feklhr no cavern of despair
dont need them
i dont consider voyager hell
are you sure have you ever been truly happy here if you thought fifty years aboard this ship would be difficult try eternity
ej humtah ej dechtah iw ej doq sodtah ghospa sqral biqtiq e pa jaj law mo jaj pus
this is a great day for belanna torres a day when we pay tribute to her dishonour
shes not responding to the cordrazine
neural activity at forty eight percent thirty seven
were losing her
we have to stabilise her synaptic functions im attempting a direct neural resequencing
belannas misdeeds have led her to grethor she comes with no valour no glory nothing to celebrate in song and story
you really have no one to blame but yourself
youve kept us all at arms length even tom who you claim to love
hear hear
i tried to assist you in making engineering more efficient but you resisted youre stubborn
she inherited that from her mother along with the forehead
what do you think of the afterlife so far
its not exactly what i had in mind
are you interpreting all the symbols searching your subconscious for their meaning
lieutenant torres defend yourself
captain
what are you still doing here i released you to stovokor
you cant free me until you free yourself
i dont understand
you never did
i did everything that the ritual told me to do i came back for you
forget the ritual its meaningless
meaningless i died for you
no you didnt its not your time you still dont understand this journey
then tell me
request denied
what do you want
who are you asking
you kahless the tooth fairy anybody who will tell me what i am supposed to do
you are the only one who can answer that question choose to live belanna
neural activitys at twenty three percent
initiate cortical stimulation pulses at fifty millijoules
no effect
increase to seventy millijoules
come on belanna
defend yourself
you want me to fight you want me to be a good little klingon is that it
youve let your anger consume you now its consuming us
shes condemned us all
misery loves company
get away from me
or what youll kill us where we stand
tell me what you want me to be a good starfleet officer a good maquis lover daughter just tell me what you want from me
we dont want anything from you belanna
we only want you
were not your enemies
defend yourself
i dont know how im so tired of fighting
we know
youve taken the first step of your journey
and what about you
we will see each other again
in stovokor
yes in stovokor or maybe when you get home
mother oh god im alive
welcome back

eeery illogical illogical illogical
bravo bravo
doctor
doctor hello
maybe id better run a diagnostic on your hearing subroutines
my hearings fine i was just letting my mind wander thats all
if youre not working on anything you should deactivate yourself save us the energy
wait a second i thought i was scheduled to go on the away team
well the planet looks safe on the long range sensors any medical problems and we can use the transporter but take a look at those scans and see if theres anything we might have missed
lieutenant i wanted to go on the away team theres a canyon on that planet id like to investigate
ive already handed out assignments next time if youd like ill snap a few images for you
dont bother
suit yourself
ill just use my imagination
where did that come from
good question it didnt show up on sensors until a few minutes ago
t class nebula a thousand kilometre diameter hydrogen helium argon
nothing too dramatic
if you want some drama take a look at this
to captain kathryn janeway starship voyager from emergency medical hologram starship voyager topic status of emergency medical hologram starship voyager
hes filing a formal grievance
regarding
his treatment by the crew theres also a paragraph about his future on voyager and a proposal for his advancement
failure to acknowledge sentience rude behaviour whats this a request to be made captain in the event of a catastrophic emergency hes serious
dead serious and he wants a formal response for the record
protocol allows for commander chakotay or myself to address his demands if the captain would prefer
no ill take care of it i dont want anybody to be uncomfortable on this ship i guess we should all try to be more considerate of his feelings
captain he does it to himself hes chief medical officer is it our fault thats not enough for him
resume course toward the planet chakotay you have the bridge ive got a formal response to draft
what category did i assign that vessel
unacceptable risk
correct and what was my justification for that decision
the ship appears in none of our databases initial attempts to scan the interior failed
then why are you wasting our resources
i think i can penetrate the hull using a microtunnelling sensor
and observe the interior one molecule at a time there are other potential targets that must be surveyed
if i could tap into a data transfer conduit id be able to reach their main computer core that would tell me all we need to know about their tactical systems in theory
we could be detected they may not like being spied upon
i think ive been very careful avoiding it ill take every precaution i promise
unacceptable risk
ive already transmitted my proposal to the hierarchy they should be responding momentarily
do you have something youd like to say
no
the hierarchy cannot be bothered with every illconceived notion that you
theyve approved id better get started
youre too confrontational hell report you
huh acceptable risk
the layer of antonium runs right along the edge of the canyon
my scans show geological instability within one hundred metres of the target location
i could put the flyer down just outside of that
i dont know tom that might be a little too far
whats the matter neelix afraid of a little exercise
i think we could handle a hundred metre stroll
i have to agree
maybe getting there its coming back im worried about well be loaded down with ore if the ground is unstable
i suggest limiting the team members to twenty kilograms preliminary scans indicate the crust is dense enough to support that weight
you might try carrying a transport enhancer to the site
thats not a bad idea well beam the ore back to the delta flyer and we wont have to carry anything
you know this mission is starting to look a little more dangerous than we thought maybe we do need the doctor to come along if one of us fell through the crust there could be injuries
i require his assistance in astrometrics
what for
thats none of your business
i think it is
oh
whats wrong captain
its nothing really an old academy injury it flares up every now and then ive learned to live with it but maybe you should stay here and have a look right there
get away from him
you are dismissed doctor doctor
yes captain
lets talk about these demands of yours
ive given you a great deal of freedom on this ship
im not disputing that
but youre not satisfied either
i should be allowed to participate and advance according to my abilities like any other member of this crew
you should also know your limits
my programme can be expanded indefinitely i dont have limits
maybe but we all have primary responsibilities yours is sickbay
im a computer programme multiple tasking is second nature to me
this proposal of yours to be made a what what did you call it
ech emergency command hologram
in principle its an interesting idea a backup captain in case im incapacitated and the command structure breaks down but expanding your programme would take months of work
the lives of the crew may depend on it someday
im afraid the answers no doctor however as part of my formal response i have recommended that starfleet assign a team of engineers to consider your proposal when we get back to the alpha quadrant ill pass it along
thank you captain
thank you doctor
ladies and gentlemen id like to introduce the emergency command hologram
ive tried to access their internal sensors but i couldnt get past the security encryption so i found something even better a holographic crewman ive tapped into his cognitive subroutines we can now monitor everything hes experiencing
its like having an agent on board
to the ech
captain this is such an honour but if you dont mind my saying hardly a surprise
allow me to introduce the doctor hes a computer programme a sentient piece of holographic technology and he is voyagers medical officer
voyager
thats the name of the ship ive only been observing the doctor for a matter of hours and ive already learned more about this vessel than i did in three days of sensor sweeps
elaborate
the reason voyager is not in our database is because they are not from this quadrant theyre lost alone
no backup vessel
uh huh
no one to contact for help
precisely another few hours of observation and i will know all we need to know about them defences weapons crew complement everything
from monitoring one individual unlikely
actually it is very likely the social structure on voyager is is much different than ours
how so
this is my observation post i have a single function but the doctor does much more than just practice medicine he has access to the entire ship and he seems to be an expert on everything in fact the captain just gave him authorisation to command the bridge it was a very exciting moment
why arent you monitoring him now
the link drops out intermittently but it should be reestablished in a few minutes
maintain your surveillance
thisll take care of any potential allergens in the planets atmosphere ill monitor your medical status from the bridge but i dont anticipate any problems since im not going i wonder if youd mind snapping a few holoimages for me while youre down there
gladly
tell me something mister neelix do you daydream
on talaxia we have a saying the dream dreams the dreamer
care to translate
we like to think that fantasies and daydreams come from someplace else another land they slip into our minds and whisper about things we never imagined
a strange notion
do you daydream doctor
of course not im a computer programme i prefer wide shots mister neelix if youre feeling creative throw in a little ultraviolet
will do
voyager to delta flyer report
were approaching the canyon whew what a view
im sure it is
put us in a synchronous orbit above their landing coordinates
voyager mayday
whats wrong
weve been hit im taking us into the canyon
harry
i dont know what happened to them
i am picking up a vessel captain its borg
red alert on screen battle stations
captain you must relieve me of duty at once
an assimilation virus has penetrated our defences
were becoming drones
hard to starboard reinforce the shields
incoming fire
doctor
computer activate the ech
acknowledged
transferring all systems to your command you have the bridge
indeed shields to maximum photon torpedoes full volley fire computer report
enemy shields are intact
we are the borg
i know very well who you are stand down your weapons
state your designation
emergency command hologram at your service
designation unknown
not for long
doctor
warning primary shields are failing
this is the last time im going to ask you stand down your weapons turn back while you still can
you will be assimilated
over my dead programme computer activate the photonic cannon
the photonic cannon is online
fire
doctor can you confirm the readings doctor
um er er readings er confirm of course er the away teams physiologies are within acceptable parameters all life signs stable
youre okay to proceed tom
understood well contact you again when we reach the site
voyager will not be an easy target it is armed with something called a photonic cannon i watched them destroy a borg sphere with a single volley
there are no reports of borg in this region
i saw it with my own eyes
did you check for debris
the ship was annihilated there was nothing left for the sensors to pick up
continue
their captain was disabled in the attack the hologram is now in command hes an impressive individual a physician an engineer a warrior and very attractive to the females we must at all cost try to avoid a direct confrontation with him i recommend a type three stealth assault
the hierarchy approves prepare for a stealth assault type three scan for borg we dont want any last minute surprises or mistakes
doctor can i have a word with you
i know i let my attention drift a little on the bridge but i assure you
are you kidding that was incredible i just wanted to congratulate you
for what exactly
the borg will have to think twice about attacking voyager again nice work
computer locate commander chakotay
commander chakotay is in his quarters
something wrong
what were you trying to do
ive been experimenting with introducing a new function into my programme cognitive projections daydreaming i wanted to be able to daydream
an inefficient activity
we all do it now and then seven why not the doctor
my thought exactly
so whats the problem
the algorithms are malfunctioning im starting to daydream whether i want to or not
they say a doctor who operates on himself has a petaq for a patient
i can help him
im sure you can
the doctor and i are going to sickbay
any excuse to be alone with him eh seven
assimilation is an unpleasant fate
is that a threat
this isnt possible the warp containment field is failing
warp core breach in thirty seconds
try stabilising the antimatter flow
the control linkage is down
warning warp core breach a lot sooner than you think
weve got to get someone inside the warp core try to eject it manually
no one could survive the current level of plasma radiation
the doctor
this isnt real is it
doc youre the only one who can help us
warning last chance to be a hero doctor get going
heres the problem the new algorithms werent isolated properly theyve branched into his perceptual subroutines doc why dont we take a closer look at the matrix and what are you doing
i have to eject the core
what
deactivate his programme
no it will damage his matrix
dont try to stop me
lets take him to sickbay
i have to i have to save the ship i have to save the ship i have to save the ship
you look lovely tonight seven where shall we go that sounds wonderful
the new algorithms have completely taken over his programme
ambassador
so now hes daydreaming constantly
its a photonic cannon i designed it myself
he seems to be randomly jumping from one to the next
pardon me miss
i routed his subroutines to holodeck one so harry and seven could monitor his fantasies
do you think thats appropriate theyre his fantasies and i promised him wed show a little more consideration
itll give us a better idea of whats going on help us fix him
mister neelix how thoughtful you baked me a cake this wont get you out of your checkup
kim to sickbay
go ahead harry
you might want to have a look at this
were on our way
keep still please
anything you say doctor
he does the hands very well
apparently hes had a great deal of practice look at these
i see
computer activate the emergency command hologram
this is the part i like
nice touch
bring the photonic cannon online
photonic cannon
a weapon of mass destruction invented by the doctor of course
of course
in many of his fantasies he takes command and saves the ship
i see
which means that particular algorithm is more easily accessible than the others
so if we can isolate it we might be able to stabilise his programme
why do you torment me like this
that was never my intention
it wasnt
i want you to be happy belanna
without you
what
shush
ill always be fond of you that will never change
you cant just leave me i couldnt bear to be alone
arent you forgetting someone he needs you belanna now more than ever
forget him hes not half the man you are
ive seen enough of this
all right lets go back to sickbay and try to isolate that algorithm
congratulations
thank you for this opportunity captain all i ever wanted was to live up to my full potential to hone all my skills expand my abilities to help the people i love
whats the status
i lost the signal again i dont know what happened
two assault vessels are on course to join us accurate information is essential
the more i learn about voyager the more i wonder if its worth the trouble
clarify
launching an attack against such a heavily armed vessel carries a great risk and for what a little antimatter and some dilithium
your survey indicated large quantities of both weve already committed substantial resources to mounting this assault were you mistaken
no not at all im just sounding a note of caution
if our boarding party doesnt find voyager exactly as youve described it the hierarchy will be informed
i understand there has been no mistake
then well proceed
ive made a terrible mistake
how terrible
the doctor was appearing in a different location every few seconds it didnt seem possible so i investigated a little further and i havent been monitoring his perceptions ive been watching his dreams or his his imaginings im not sure which but none of this is real what am i going to do
i came to check on your patient
hes doing just fine captain it took lieutenant torres half the night to stabilise my matrix but i havent had a single flight of fancy since i apologise for altering my programme without permission
at least there wasnt any permanent damage
im afraid there was ive been exposed humiliated turned inside out for all the world to see if ive lost your respect
that will never happen certainly not because weve seen a few random fantasies we all daydream doctor it helps us imagine other possibilities in life just hold off until weve figured out a way for you to do it without damaging yourself all right
come in
ships status report federation law thinking about a career change
in a way not for me though ive been going over the legal precedents for granting command positions to holograms there arent any
captain this ship needs its doctor he should focus on what he was programmed for medical care
i think weve underestimated him because of our own human limitations his full potentials unknown chakotay
would you be comfortable handing over your ship to a computer programme
well i dont know if id take it that far
you might have to he probably wont settle for less
oh no
allow me to shake your hand congratulations
doctor may i please have a word with you
i dont recall dreaming you up
you didnt im transmitting a simulation of myself into your programme but i am real
doctor to the bridge im daydreaming again somebody deactivate me
voyager is about to be attacked
of course it is unless the valiant doctor swings into action right
yes yes precisely
a common theme in all my fantasies
i reactivated your cognitive algorithms i put you back into this fiction
im ready to pose again tonight
here
why
it was the only way for me to communicate with you
im listening
im a long range observer on an assault class vessel i scan passing ships for technology and raw materials when i find an acceptable target we raid it
youve been spying on us
more to the point on you for several days ive been using a long range tunnelling sensor to tap into your programme you were supposed to be our eyes and ears on voyager instead i got this
my daydreams you tapped into my daydreams thats why my algorithms have been destabilising
my fault im sorry
tell me about this attack
my ship is less than an hour away i can help you avoid a confrontation but you must do exactly what i say
why should you want to help us
you dont understand the hierarchy does not tolerate mistakes or misinformation if they learn of my error ill lose my livelihood
well thats what you get for being a peeping tom
but i also care about what happens to you i feel like ive got to know you over the past few days
youve been spying on my fantasies not me you dont know me at all
but i do i know how your mind works what your hopes are you created all these possibilities my species were very different our thinking is confined but i cant help but admire you i dont want you to be harmed
then i suppose we should swing into action
captain were about to be attacked alien vessels are approaching
theres nothing on the sensors doc
the vessels are cloaked
how do you know this
one of the aliens contacted me
ive detected no transmissions
he spoke to me in a daydream
i dont want to hear it however i would like to know why youve disobeyed my direct order
i can prove it to you the alien told me how to reconfigure our sensors to compensate for their cloaking field
hes right im picking up three ships out there distance six hundred million kilometres headed right for us
on screen maximum magnification
the alien wont help us unless we help him
what if this is all part of their attack a ruse
hes already helped us compensate for their cloak im inclined to believe him
so am i but id just as soon set a course away from here at maximum warp
that will only delay a confrontation they have vessels hidden throughout the entire sector
did your friend have a plan
he said theyre running whats called a type three stealth assault they wont decloak until theyre right on top of us at which point theyll fire a warning shot across our bow then come the demands for supplies and technology if we dont comply theyll destroy us fortunately the alien promised to transmit the resonance frequencies of their phasers
and in return
in return he mistakenly informed his superiors that i was in command of voyager to keep himself from being demoted he wants us to maintain that fiction when they open the channel i have to be sitting in the captains chair im sorry captain but he insisted
well i guess its time to turn fantasy into reality
im in over my head what if i fail
you sound like i did when the captain put me in command of the night shift that chair looked so big i thought id sink so far into it that nobody would be able to see me
but you had your academy training to fall back on
yeah well sounds like youve had plenty of practice
that wasnt real
listen doc the whole reason you wanted to be able to daydream was to test out possibilities right consider this a field test
why isnt there any hull damage from the borg attack
they repaired it
so quickly hmm prepare for type four assault
type four that would cause a huge drain on our energy core a waste of resources do you really think thats necessary
what i think doesnt matter your long range surveillance indicated an attack by borg on closer inspection that appears to be doubtful your report on this vessel could be mistaken i think caution is in order the hierarchy agrees proceed to type four
captain on the bridge
it wont bite
what i wouldnt give right now for a whoopee cushion
a what
ancient technology
captain were ready to proceed
acknowledged commander
the internal comm link is active no one will be able to hear you but the doctor
doctor are
you ready
no but do i have a choice
ill be with you every step of the way just remember im still the captain
understood
im receiving a transmission on a secure channel audio only
must be the doctors friend lets hear what he has to say doctor
hello voyager here its me
doctor something terrible has happened theyve ordered a type
four assault our phaser frequencies will be rotated
continuously i wont be able to help you
evasive manoeuvres
three vessels are decloaking off the port bow
that didnt feel like a warning shot
direct hit shields are holding
theyre hailing us
this is it doctor on screen
see there he is be careful he hes dangerous
the hierarchy controls this region of space
your ship has supplies and technology that we require
tell him well defend ourselves
they wont get what theyre after
well defend ourselves they wont get what theyre after
huh
i mean you wont get what youre after not in a million years not if i have anything to say about it
dont improvise doctor
sorry
an exchange of fire would damage both of our ships but we have support nearby you are alone take your weapons offline and prepare to be boa
excuse the interruption commander i have found a potential weakness in their shields but ill need time to reconfigure our phasers
keep him occupied doctor on screen
this is my final warning
dont rush me
take your weapons offline immediately i wont ask again
you appear to be suffering from a physioemotive disorder youre impatient quick to anger do you have any idea what that does to your vascular pressure you may want to see a physician
firing phasers
direct hit
ha how do you like that huh a taste of your own medicine
tone it down doctor
sorry
our phasers are offline
prepare to be boarded
its time to negotiate doctor tell
tuvok
activate the photonic cannon tuvok that was an order
activating the photonic cannon sir
id rather not give the order to fire
my sensors are showing no activation sequence
of course not the photonic cannon is impervious to sensors
the borg couldnt detect it either thats why they were destroyed
the borg
the hierarchy its all the same to me just another bully who didnt know when to back off
well be vaporised
the hierarchy suggests retreat
theyre moving away at maximum impulse
go ahead doctor youve earned it
seven of nine to the doctor
go ahead
i require your assistance in the mess hall
ill be right there
surprise
dont worry doc youre not dreaming
captain
for your imaginative defence of this ship and her crew im awarding you the starfleet medal of commendation congratulations
thank you
ive also reconsidered your request im going to authorise a research project to explore your command abilities youre a natural
congratulations doctor  that was a platonic gesture dont expect me to pose for you
noted
all right all right hold on if you were married in 2304 and your daughter was conceived in your eleventh pon farr that would make you a hundred and sixty two years old
incorrect
come on tom the mans not a day over one forty we know you were at least a hundred when you joined starfleet the second time so im guessing youre around one thirty three
also incorrect im afraid you both lack sufficient data to reach a logical conclusion
come on tuvok tell us
i see no reason to enlighten you
dont tell me vulcans are embarrassed about their age
on the contrary we value the wisdom that comes with advancing years
in that case how wise are you
wise enough to end this inquiry
saved by the bell
ive got a fleet of ships two hundred thousand kilometres dead ahead
can you identify them
negative
im reading multiple hull configurations
raise shields red alert
report
weve detected a large group of vessels directly ahead
hostile
possibly im charging weapons
on screen
im counting sixty two ships and a few hundred pieces of ships all dead in space
its a junkyard congratulations tuvok you just saved us from a flotilla of hostile trash
were being hailed
lets see what they want
welcome to abaddons repository of lost treasures whether youre in the mood to buy or simply browse were always open take a look you may find something you never knew you wanted
mister abaddon
the name was passed down from my father and his father before him not a very imaginative lot but ill answer to it just the same
im commander chakotay this is mister neelix
welcome to voyager
neelix is it you wouldnt be a fellow trader would you
what makes you say that
cheerful demeanour furtive eyes its obvious youre a man of commerce
youre very perceptive mister abaddon
a useful skill in my line of work
ill admit there was a time when i dabbled in commerce but these days i focus my efforts on food and diplomacy
well whether youre interested in a new isoconvective oven or a slightly dated translation matrix youve come to the right place my inventory give or take a few items after twenty years its hard to keep up
looks like you have an item or two we might be interested in
ah the question is what are you looking for in return
artificial gravity plating plasmabased power induction impressive
those are integrated systems unfortunately we couldnt trade them to you without dismantling our whole ship
commander dont we have some spare duranium sheeting in cargo bay one with a few modifications it could be converted into gravity plating
good idea why dont you show mister abaddon our inventory report back when youre done
yes sir mister abaddon follow me please
this guys collected more technology than the borg
and almost all of it is useless
wait whats that
ensign
grid forty nine alpha oh shes beautiful
its just an old rust bucket
are you kidding look at those lines its a work of art that ship wasnt assembled it was sculpted i think im in love
that makes fifteen power regulators in fair condition and three more we could salvage with a little work seven has some doubts about the ion exchange rods
well take a chance add them to the list what about these cultural artefacts
oh just a few items i thought might have some historical value they dont cost much
looks like a good haul if thats it
oh yes there is one other item a small vessel that could be an asset
weve already got a full complement of shuttles not to mention the delta flyer what do we need with this derelict ship
chakotay this ship is a diamond in the rough sure its got some scrapes and scratches but here take a look at these systems it has a neurogenic interface that allows it to react directly to the pilots thoughts that gives it the potential of being quicker and more manoeuvrable than anything weve got including the delta flyer
add to that an optronic weapons array
i get the picture are you sure youre not just looking for a new toy
no absolutely not even belanna thinks restoring this ship is worthwhile
maybe if we had the manpower to restore it
no ill do all the work myself on my own time and if i need a hand harrys offered to help
i have
what will it cost us
abaddons agreed to give it to us for three used power cells and toms interactive record collection
my jukebox
all right one slightly used alien ship dont make me regret this
you wont
remember just one seat not much storage she was designed for speed not hauling
understood
make sure you go easy on the thrusters she doesnt like being manhandled
temperamental
sensitive she demands respect like any fine piece of machinery
sounds like youre sorry to let her go
well in some ways shes like the daughter i couldnt marry off but that doesnt mean id trade her to just anyone ive got a feeling youre the kind of pilot that she needs someone thatll give her the proper care and attention
im your man
dont worry mister abaddon shes in good hands
well this has been a very productive exchange oh just one more thing
let me guess all trades are final
i still cant get an active readout
heres the reason another damaged power cell
oh come on alice how about it give us a break
alice
well ive got to call her something
how about the lost cause
alice battisti was the lost cause i knew her back at the academy she was smart sexy but she wouldnt give me the time of day
all right alice it is try it again
ive got a pulse
a little snug
as seven would say an efficient design the main computers coming online
theres not much in it just a few schematics looks like somebody tried to wipe the database
probably rolled the odometer back too lets see what this neurogenic interface can do
whoa
whats it like
its kind of hard to describe im tapped into all the primary systems ops tactical sensors
what happened
we just blew out two more power cells
see if you can reconfigure the power distribution grid
look were both tired why dont we call it a night come back fresh tomorrow
come on we can still get a couple more hours in
you can get a couple more hours in im going to bed
all right you win good night alice see you in the morning
good night alice see you in the morning see you in the morning
see you in the morning see you in the morning
tom
belanna
tom
who are you
its me alice
good morning alice
sorry youre going to have to trust me on this youll be a lot happier if we can bypass the eps relays
tom
yeah
who are you talking to
alice shes being very stubborn today no matter what i do i cant get her to bring her propulsion systems online
next question what are you wearing
this is a flight suit design i found in alices database something her last pilot used to wear
for a minute i thought you were changing captain protons look chapter thirty seven
oh the web of pain i completely forgot
no problem ive got another hour on the holodeck
nows not a great time how about tomorrow
thats what you said yesterday
sorry harry alice needs me
so does arachnia
give the queen my regards okay
seven can i get you something
a refund the star charts we obtained from abaddon are inaccurate
really
the computations are based on obsolete data
its not the only item that didnt live up to its advertising
cultural artefacts
according to abaddon theyre lost treasures of the delta quadrant if you ask me theyre worthless trinkets
perhaps not this crystal is beryllium
valuable
beryllium is the standard currency in spatial grid five three nine there are species that would trade an entire fleet of starships for this trinket
if abaddon knew about this hed never have traded it for a few plasma couplings maybe i should return it
need i remind you all trades are final
neelix i need one bottle of champagne if you dont mind
another anniversary
no im christening alice
congratulations ill whip up some hors doeuvres for the crew
oh no dont bother this is a private ceremony just me and belanna
and alice of course
oh yes of course
theres nothing like having your own ship i remember when i first laid eyes on my little freighter baxial
no dont tell me love at first sight
actually i thought she was the ugliest thing i ever saw but she grew on me eventually i couldnt imagine being without her you know shes still down at the shuttlebay why dont we get her and alice together and go on a double date
you pack the picnic basket ill bring the deuterium
so i finally get to meet the other woman
well dont be too critical shes a long way from finished
when have you ever known me to be critical
is that a trick question okay ready
well
its beautiful i can hardly believe its the same ship
yeah most of it isnt ive replaced the impulse reactor navigational array er plasma manifolds the list goes on and on just a few more repairs and shell be spaceworthy care to do the honours
its almost a shame to break this over the hull
you have a point
oh be careful the upholstery
ill send an engineering team down to clean it up to alice
to alice
so whens her first flight
a couple of days if i can round up all the parts i need you want to come with me
sure theres room
itll be a tight squeeze
well manage
hold on
something wrong
its these environmental controls they need recalibrating
it is kind of warm in here isnt it
alice lower the ambient temperature
please specify tom
five degrees should do it
temperature modification complete
thats some voice
it came with the ship are you jealous
maybe i should be i hear youve been sleeping here
when alice lets me sleep
sounds like a real slave driver well if youre trying to make improvements you might want to start with these reactant injectors the deuterium mix is too high
thats how alice likes it no dont touch that
i was just trying to help
well thanks but were fine
we its a ship tom
yeah but shes my ship
well then maybe ill leave the two of you alone
okay ill see you later
thanks for the champagne
ow
oh sorry i need to fix that
thirty metres of eps conduit a broadband sensor matrix a tactical data module tom i appreciate your enthusiasm but i cant spare these parts right now
theyre just lying around cargo bay two
those are emergency supplies and this isnt an emergency
okay what if i just replicated some
that takes energy which isnt exactly in abundance at the moment maybe in a few weeks if we can replenish our power reserve
a few weeks what am i supposed to do until then
your duties which youve been neglecting youve been late for two shifts in sickbay youve been distracted on the bridge maybe its time you gave this project a rest
yeah youre right i guess i have been overdoing it
you look run down maybe you should stop by sickbay and have the doctor take a look at you
no im fine i just havent been getting enough sleep
well your next shift isnt till oh seven hundred why dont you do yourself a favour and turn in early
yeah good idea
one more thing id appreciate it if youd shave and change back into your uniform we do have protocols
yes sir
well get your alice flying just give it some time
sorry alice well have to put the test flight on hold all we need is a few lousy spare parts but to listen to chakotay youd think voyager would grind to a halt without them
but were so close
well he gave me a direct order
since when do you care so much about orders
im already an ensign you want to see me busted down to cadet
dont take that off
well im afraid i have to get back into uniform protocol
forget about protocol once my repairs are complete we can go somewhere together
leave voyager
its been a long time since i met a pilot ive been compatible with we can go anywhere you want
its very tempting alice but i cant just take off
whats holding you back
my job for one thing my friendsbelanna
she doesnt understand you the way i do none of them do
look maybe we can make the test flight in a few weeks and if it goes well im sure the captain will assign us on missions together but i cant leave voyager
all right im sure you know whats best for us
yeah i think i do
you look a little tired how about some rest
sit back relax let me help you with this
what are these
just some modifications i made to your flight suit theyll help us work together more closely ill show you activate the interface just for a minute you wont regret it what do you say we continue with those repairs
hows it coming
this is the last power cell then well just need the data module from section beta twelve
whats wrong
oh these relays are just tricky thats all
youre not being honest with me i thought we agreed to tell each other everything
well its just were compromising vital systems
backup systems
if theres an emergency voyagers going to need them
if your friends had been more understanding we wouldnt have to be sneaking around like this
ive spent the last six years with these people theyre like my family
sometimes you have to leave your family behind theyre not like us theyre trapped by rules and regulations velocity freedom theyll never understand these things the way we do
yeah maybe youre right
of course i am you dont belong here you belong with me youre thinking about your first flight arent you tell me
dad took me up in an old s class shuttle two seats no warp drive manual helm controls i was eight years old and i was scared out of my wits
you couldnt keep the ship level
no not at first but then came this moment of clarity when suddenly everything made sense
the clouds parted
i was flying no matter how many starships ive piloted since then im still chasing that feeling
tomorrow youll catch it only this time there wont be any clumsy controls to get in the way just you me and the stars
hey
i wasnt aware you were assigned to astrometrics
i was just passing by i guess curiosity got the best of me
are you planning an away mission you were charting a course
oh that no i was just taking a peek at whats ahead of us all yours
youve modified your garment
adapted actually i made a few tweaks to enhance alices neurogenic interface you know the merging of man and machine
perhaps you should learn more about this interface before you attempt to use it
convince her its safe
i ran diagnostics of every system on board that ship theres nothing to worry about
perhaps i should examine it
make an excuse and leave
its nice of you to offer but its really not necessary i have to get back to work
power fluctuations down to four point seven percent looks like abaddons regulators might work out after all
keep at it the last thing we need is a temperamental power supply
bad day at the office
bad night with tom paris youre his best friend right
so he tells me
so maybe you can explain why every time he finds a new hobby i go right out the airlock
i wouldnt take it personally the ferengi call it the five stages of acquisition infatuation justification appropriation obsession and resale seems like you only got one stage left before he loses interest in that ship and hes all yours again
until the next infatuation weve got a point zero zero three drop in the warp field output
thats within parameters
not on my watch somebodys removed four power cells from the secondary warp assembly without authorisation
whoever it was tried to cover his tracks by rerouting power from adjacent cells should we tell tuvok
dont bother this is an open and shut case
tom paris
well alice looks like youve been borrowing my things without permission
hey computer open the hatch
unable to comply warning life support failure
torres to the bridge torres to chakotay anybody
belanna what are you doing here
let me out of here
what the hell happened in there
your ship tried to kill me
thats ridiculous
it sealed the hatch vented the atmosphere
you must have accidentally tripped environmental controls
dont you try to tell me this was an accident
what else could it have been
how about pilot error
are you saying that this was my fault
whats gotten into you youve been stealing components tom i found the power cells
a few spare parts youre overreacting
am i
where are you going
to talk to the captain
wait
theres something wrong with you
listen to me
are you out of your mind
stay out of this belanna
or what youll sic alice on me again
let her go
what were you thinking you could have killed her
she broke into my database she was going to discover our flight plan not that it matters now
what is that supposed to mean
keep your voice down once your girlfriend talks to the captain theyll drag you straight to sickbay one neural scan and theyll know all about us
well maybe its time they did
think you can just walk away
watch me
so i guess this is the real tom paris life throws up a few roadblocks and he heads for the nearest exit
get away from me
i need you
you should have thought of that before you tried to kill belanna
sickbay
remember how you felt when you first saw me you knew we were meant to be together
i was wrong
think of how it feels when youre sitting at the helm and the interface is active
its over alice one way or the other im getting the hell away from you
im sorry you feel that way
argh what are you doing to me
convincing you to do the right thing take us the shuttlebay were leaving voyager
no argh
please tom i dont want to hurt you the shuttlebay now
deck ten shuttlebay
this isnt the first time you and tom have had an argument about how he spends his free time
this wasnt a lovers quarrel captain he practically assaulted me
well that doesnt sound like tom
it wasnt tom it was alice
now youve lost me
thats the name that hes calling this new ship ever since he started working on it he hasnt slept hes become irritable irrational its not just me chakotay and harry have noticed the same thing
this new ship it has some kind of neurogenic interface
exactly it must be having some kind of an effect on him
all right ill have the doctor take a look at him but in the meantime i want you
captain we have an unauthorised launch in progress
seal the shuttlebay doors
too late hes out
his shields are up i cant get a transporter lock
tractor beam
theyre trying to tractor us
stop them
i cant
youll be able to manoeuvre much better if you complete the interface
how
activate the connector sequence
were one now tom think of what you want me to do and ill do it
we can disrupt their tractor beam with an optronic pulse
good you have access to our weapons use them
hes charging weapons
full power to the shields
hes disrupting our tractor beam
increase power to the emitters well drag him in by his heels if we have to
hes broken free captain
janeway to paris stand down and return to voyager immediately
im with alice now captain let us go
you know i cant do that tom
shell do anything to get you back i dont blame her for that but we have to stop her
how
you know
hes coming about
hes charging weapons again direct hit
return fire
hes gone to warp
track him
he masked his warp signature hes gone
and daedalus fashioned wings from wax and feathers and used them to escape his prison
thats one of my favourite myths
i know
but you left out the part where icarus flew too close to the sun and his wings melted
poetic license besides if we get too close to a star we have multiphasic shielding to protect us what is it
my arms they feel numb
who need arms when you have wings youre becoming a part of me now our potential is unlimited forget the old tom paris he doesnt exist anymore
you know my policy
were not looking for a refund just some information
thats one commodity i dont keep in stock i suggest you look elsewhere
not until we get some answers
youll find im prepared to deal with disgruntled customers
captain im reading active weapons signatures on three of the derelict ships they are targeting voyager
before we take actions we both might regret mister neelix has something to show you
i wanted to say thank you for this lost treasure
a beryllium crystal
im surprised a trader of your distinction would let this slip through his fingers i could say all trades are final but wed be willing to give it back in exchange for some cooperation
haunted
thats what the haarkonian told me when he traded her i blamed his wild stories on isolation sickness and then took the ship off his hands
did you ever notice anything odd about the ship
odd you could say that i tried turning her into a towing vessel she was cooperative at first but then she began to require constant oh
i hope you havent forgotten me
mister abaddon
where was i
constant repairs
right please i wasnt going to tell them anything
who were you speaking to
no one i i i have to leave now ill return the items you traded for the ship leave me alone i did what you told me i found you a pilot
what is it what are you seeing
its her shes right in front of me
theres no one there
transport me back now argh
janeway to sickbay medical emergency
he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage fortunately i was able to repair the damage in time
what caused it
it appears his neural pathways were recently restructured i detected a neurogenic signature
looks like alice got to him too wake him
she was here
the woman you saw was an hallucination created by the derelict ships neurogenic interface ive given you a cortical suppressant she wont be bothering you anymore
tell me what does this ship want with our crewman
she cant fly herself she needs a pilot a biological entity to work in tandem with her programming
well if all she needed was a pilot why didnt she just recruit you
i wasnt compatible she said my reflexes were too slow that i was as useless as the junk that i traded and i couldnt get her to where she needed to go dont ask me for the coordinates she never told me just insisted that i get her a real pilot im sorry i didnt warn you before i couldnt resist her
seven of nine to captain janeway please report to astrometrics
ive managed to reconstruct the data ensign paris was working on my suspicion was correct it is a course trajectory
lets see it
it terminates in spatial grid eight six seven
looks uninhabited
its empty space with the exception of a small anomaly
a particle fountain the federation lost more than a dozen ships examining a similar phenomenon in the alpha quadrant relay the coordinates to the bridge
take us out of warp can you see it now
yes what is it
home
distance
six million kilometres
decrease speed to one quarter impulse full power to shields
im detecting a vessel off our starboard bow
its tom hes headed right for the anomaly
can you get a transporter lock
no maam not with those multiphasic shields in place
are we in hailing range
opening a channel hes responding
keep your distance captain or well open fire
tom listen to me the neurogenic interface is affecting your judgment drop your shields
and let us beam you aboard
ignore them keep going
hes not responding
target his propulsion systems and fire
direct hit the vessels shields are holding
doctor to the bridge
cease fire ensign paris neural readings are fluctuating his synaptic functions have become linked to the ship if we keep firing we could injure him severely
acknowledged
tuvok stand down
weve got ten minutes until he reaches the particle fountain
is there any way to disable their shields without firing weapons
if i could access their main computer and transmit a shutdown sequence
problem is tom and alice would detect it theyd compensate
unless we find a way to distract them bridge to the doctor
go ahead
any progress on your analysis of the neurogenic interface
not yet captain
would it be possible to tap into the interface using a comm signal
i believe so but i dont know what that would accomplish
youve got five minutes do it
and tell belanna to prepare for an away mission
captain
were four minutes away
bridge to sickbay
status
stand by captain im making the final adjustments
im not sure how i feel about getting inside toms head
maybe youll be able to explain a few things when you get back
i knew you were the one no ones ever got me this close before
ill have you home in just a few minutes
i promise you wont be disappointed
dont believe her
wheres alice
there is no alice shes a pile of circuits in the ships computer core youre letting a programme delude you
doctor to bridge shes in
now
accessing their main computer
you dont understand this is what ive always dreamed of
youre still dreaming and when you wake up youre in for a big surprise
alice needs me
so do i
nice sentiment but its a lie your family will do anything to keep us apart dont listen to them
tom its me belanna alice is an illusion
im giving you what you always wanted something they can never do does that sound like an illusion
i cant think leave me alone both of you
theyve accessed our systems theyre trying to disable my shields stop them
focus on me listen to me
my shields are failing do something
its time to come home
tom
no
hang on were going to get you out of here
tom
no
ive got it captain their shields are down
beam him to sickbay
theres too much interference from the particle fountain
im boosting the confinement beam try it now
weve got him
alice is losing helm control
resume course to the alpha quadrant
youll need a few days to fully recover think you can manage to stay off your feet for that long
if he doesnt ill break his legs
well then ill leave you to belannas tender mercies
ive got something for you its a get well card from naomi wildman its a pretty good likeness of you but i dont think she quite captured my eyes
im sorry for everything
it wasnt your fault
but i remember all of it everything i said everything i did it was like i was sleepwalking
the important thing is you woke up
yeah thanks for being my alarm clock
any time
from now on i promise no more affairs with strange ships
what about the delta flyer
were just friends
mister neelix
sorry how about a game of species starship or anomaly
surely you could find something more productive to occupy your time
come on tuvok itll be fun you think of something species anomaly or starship and i have fifteen questions to guess what it is come on come on come on come on
i would prefer some peace and quiet
how about a riddle
mister neelix
come on itll be fun
i have no desire for fun
okay forget fun a good riddle can stimulate the mind now no selfrespecting vulcan could say no to that
very well one riddle
okay here goes a lone ensign finds himself stranded on a class l planetoid with no rations his only possession a calendar when starfleet finds him twelve months later hes in perfect health why didnt he starve to death
it is a theoretical possibility that such planetoids contain hot water springs which could sustain the man for several weeks
but not for a whole year
i concur logic dictates that the ensign in question would perish
ah ha ha ha i stumped you as a matter of fact he not only survived but his belly was full why because he feasted on dates from the calendar
your answer is merely wordplay it has no basis in reality now if youll excuse me
where are you going
to find some peace and quiet
have fun
tuvok to neelix
miss me already commander
did you activate the aft tactical station
no
why
there appears to be a download in progress
thats odd
im detecting
anomalous readings
what sort of readings
im not certain but i believe its a cloaking frequency that
argh
commander
tuvok delta flyer to voyager mayday tuvok what happened
report
hes in neuraleptic shock ill need another twenty milligrams of synaptizine
ill get it
its not working ill need to try direct cortical stimulation initiate a neurostatic pulse on my mark
right
now again
his vital signs have stabilised for the moment anyway but he suffered severe neurological trauma
do you know what caused it
some kind of alien weapon
by the time i reached tuvok whoever had attacked him was gone
what about the surrounding space any indication of cloaked vessels
between trying to tend to the commander and piloting the flyer i had my hands full i i didnt think to scan for cloaked ships im sorry
you saved tuvoks life neelix you have nothing to be sorry about how do you plan to treat him
i wont know until ive run a series of neurological scans but it would certainly help to know something about the weapon
neelix these kesat you were negotiating with any reason to believe they might know something about this
it couldnt hurt to ask
time to reopen diplomatic channels
deputy investigator naroq kesat security captain janeway commander chakotay ambassador neelix
youve done your homework
i familiarised myself with the facts on the way here
were hoping you can help us shed some light on what happened to our crewman
i believe i can based on the information you provided it is my opinion that he was a victim of the baneth
ive never heard of them
im not surprised in my language their name means shadow people theyre a species obsessed with concealing their identity extremely paranoid and xenophobic
well that explains their cloaking technology
its my belief theyve been responsible for several unexplained attacks similar to this one
why wasnt i warned about them during my negotiations with your government
because my governments official position is that the baneth do not exist most people think theyre a myth
theres nothing mythical about what happened to mister tuvok why is your government so sceptical
because thereve been so few encounters with the baneth and well no ones ever actually seen one
how many encounters are we talking about exactly
before this incident twelve
i guess were lucky thirteen
youre lucky i gave my supervisor two bottles of kesatian ale to get this assignment any other inspector would have simply attributed commander tuvoks injuries to unexplained phenomenon
no offence mister naroq but what makes you so sure the baneth arent just a myth
this incident fits the pattern captain all of the alleged encounters have occurred aboard vessels foreign to this sector i believe theyve been attempts by the baneth to assess the technology of new arrivals
they were trying to download tactical data
and commander tuvok suffered severe neural damage thats also consistent with previous attacks the baneth were making sure he would not tell anyone what he saw
maybe thats why tuvoks tricorder was destroyed they didnt want us to see the cloaking frequency hed found
he found a cloaking frequency
apparently
captain i dont blame you for finding my theories a bit eccentric im used to it its why im still a deputy investigator but ive brought equipment to help your investigation let me examine commander tuvok and run scans on the vessel where he was attacked i may finally be able to prove my theories
with all due respect were more interested in saving tuvoks life
if we work together maybe we can do both
his cognitive memory and logic centres have all been severely damaged
but he still has brain activity which is more than i can say for any of the previous victims
vulcan neural tissue is extremely resilient i have no doubt that a brain from a lesser species would not have survived
if you could only tell us what you saw mister tuvok
i dont think well be hearing from him any time soon
keep working ill let you know if we find anything that might help ill take you to see where the attack occurred
something i can do for you mister neelix
i want to help
unless you have a degree in vulcan neurobiology that im not aware of theres nothing you can do
there must be something
my advice is to return to your quarters and get some rest
theres no way that im going to be able to sleep knowing that tuvok is lying here like this
there have been rare cases in which comatose patients responded to external stimuli aromas touch voices
so youre saying that if i stay here and and try to talk to tuvok i might be able to provoke some sort of response
if anyone can provoke tuvok mister neelix its you
good morning tuvok i brought you a few more items from your quarters to help liven up sickbay your kaltoh game in case you decide youre ready for a match oh and i also thought that you might enjoy a recitation of that classic protovulcan drama clash on the fire plains ill be performing all twenty three parts myself i also brought you some flowers from the airponics bay oh thats fragrant isnt it perhaps youd enjoy some vulcan incense how about some music computer access vulcan audio file selection fifty six alpha
mister neelix what is that dreadful noise
the chants of the monks of tpanit personally i think its dreadful too but its one of tuvoks favourites
i appreciate your efforts mister neelix but im trying to analyse his latest neurological scans and this music is very distracting
you said i was supposed to stimulate his senses
i said stimulate them mister neelix not annihilate them
computer pause music
thank you
doctor tuvok youve had an accident youre in sickbay
relax commander i only want to scan you
dont worry tuvok hes only trying to help you its only a tricorder see it wont hurt you
now try it
well done mister neelix
commander chakotay says youve found something
that captain is an understatement listen
what is it
the sound of history being made
less poetry mister naroq more facts
the sound youre hearing indicates the presence of veridium isotopes
residual particles from the baneths cloaking field
youve detected these isotopes before
yes but only after theyve decayed you see veridium has a very brief halflife less than seventy hours the previous sites ive studied have been months sometimes years old
but these isotopes are still active
we can use mister naroqs photolytic converter to illuminate them
so you see captain why this is an historic moment we may finally learn what the baneth look like
well lets see what weve got
you dont know how long ive waited to meet you
so the baneth arent a myth after all
this is the clearest image ever captured
perhaps i believe i can adjust our internal sensors to improve it
what are you doing you might disrupt the image entirely tentacles i always suspected they were multipeds
doctor to the captain please report to sickbay
im on my way seven if we can integrate mister naroqs photolytic technology into the deflector array we might be able to decloak a baneth ship
the technology only works at close range we have to find the ship before we can expose it we still need that cloaking frequency
one step at a time
the vulcan brain a puzzle wrapped inside an enigma housed inside a cranium tuvoks neural pathways have begun to bypass the damaged tissue theyre forming new synaptic connections in effect his brain is rewiring itself whether this is due to my neurostatic therapy or neelixs rehabilitation regimen or some combination of the two i cant be certain
is there any chance hell make a full recovery
its much too soon to say but hes alert and hes already regained his basic motor skills
but still no speech
its only a matter of time captain look how far hes come already
i hope youre right neelix but if he could talk he might be able to tell us something about that cloaking frequency
were not sure how much he recalls for that matter were not certain he recognises any of us or even knows who he is
im going to take him on a tour of the ship the doctor thinks that familiar sights and sounds might get the old synaptic juices flowing dont worry captain tuvok will be back to his old self before you can say live long and prosper
ive brought a visitor
good to see you up and around
you remember commander chakotay
we were just running a shield diagnostic would you like to take a look
this is tactical station where you work
just keeping it warm for you hope you dont mind thats the shield array this controls the tractor emitters
i think he remembers it
whoa whoa whoa he just activated the photon torpedo banks
thats all right tuvok everybody makes mistakes well be back later
last but not least your quarters you spend a lot of time here reading meditating mister paris once referred to it as the vulcan vault ah look around explore
astrometrics to the bridge mister naroq and i have completed our deflector modifications were ready to test the array
stand by reduce speed to one quarter impulse harry full power to the deflector array
aye
all right seven do it
activating the deflector
id call that a pretty successful test
theyve been watching us all along
hail them
which one theres practically a fleet out there
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager we intend you no harm
theyre charging weapons
shields
theyre scrambling captain in all directions
follow the lead vessel
its okay tuvok im here with you everything is going to be all right youre safe with me
still no response to our hails
i hate to ruin a good chase but the baneth ship is moving out of the deflectors range
seven can you get
their cloaking frequency
theyre blocking our scans
weve lost them
theyre gone now tuvok i told you youd be safe
yes you did
tuvok what tell me what did i do
you told me i wouldnt be hurt
do you know who i am
youre neelix im safe with you
we need tuvok to tell us anything he can remember about the attack
captain he may be talking again but that doesnt mean hes ready to be interrogated hes beginning to experience emotions volatile ones during this last encounter with the baneth he was terrified
well tread lightly i promise
all right tuvok you can come in now
its nice to see you
captain janeway
thats right this is mister naroq please sit down two days ago you were aboard a shuttle with mister neelix you detected a cloaked intruder
he attacked you
yes thats why im having difficulty now
yes and in order to help you we have to find the people who hurt you
before the intruder injured you you managed to scan him with this you recorded his cloaking frequency but the tricorder was damaged and the information was lost can you tell us anything about that frequency
try to remember
i was scanning
thats right what did you see
i i dont remember
try
all right thats enough were done for now
but captain
join seven of nine in astrometrics see if shes made any progress with the baneth
well er we should be going too a few of the crew have offered to help with tuvoks rehabilitation
i thought we might have lunch later just the two of us
i prefer to stay with neelix
oh tuvok im im sure that you would
its all right you two go ahead i have a lot of work to do anyway
the object of the game is to turn this jumble of rods into a perfect sphere we take turns positioning our pieces whoever gets the shape to appear first wins
i like the way it looks now
what do you say we give it a try
this has always been one of your favourite games tuvok it helps keep your logic sharp
ill go first now you
go ahead
i dont like this game
when you first taught me how to play i wasnt very good either but you kept encouraging me and pretty soon i scored my first kaltoh it just takes practice thats all
try again you can do it
i dont like this game
the doctor helped me access my personnel file
nice picture you should see mine its awful
i was an instructor at starfleet academy ive received seventeen commendations for valour im a husband a father
youre an extraordinary fellow tuvok
i was an extraordinary fellow
youre still the same person
then why do i no longer work on the bridge
we talked about that you had an accident
and now im not smart enough
tuvok youve just got to be patient look how much progress youve made already
he could dismantle a photonic warhead in less than thirty seconds i cant even play kaltoh
its going to take time but youll relearn all those things
how do you know that
well because the doctor
the doctor the doctor doesnt know how to make me better does he
well not yet but
ill never be him again
you dont know that the vulcan mind
im not a vulcan not any more
whats going on
its okay doctor i can handle this please tuvok try to relax everythings going to be fine
no nothings fine get away from me
youd better go now mister neelix ill take it from here
oh sorry i didnt mean to interrupt
you didnt
yes i did you were pondering something difficult by the looks of it anything i can help you with
unlikely
try me
how do you find something thats invisible
the baneth
we have the ability to illuminate them but to do so we must first locate them which we cannot accomplish without their cloaking frequency
thats quite a riddle
one that we might be able to solve if commander tuvok could tell us what he saw how is his rehabilitation progressing
oh i thought it was going great but now lets just say that ive got a riddle of my own
try me
all right when is a vulcan no longer a vulcan
when his genetic code is sufficiently altered
no i was speaking metaphorically
in that case a person is no longer vulcan when he has lost his logic
right and how does he get it back
he must be taught
exactly but what if hes braindamaged and emotionally unstable how does he learn
it may be impossible for him to learn what youre trying to teach
well thanks for the pep talk
i was merely suggesting that you adapt to the circumstances
what circumstances are you saying that the tuvok i know is gone that i should stop trying to help him
when i was separated from the collective i too was damaged i was no longer connected to the hive mind i lost many abilities that i had acquired as a drone but i adapted
because captain janeway didnt give up on you she kept trying to help you
but not by restoring me to what id been by helping me discover what i could become
what are you making
a flower its for you
thank you im not sure i deserve a gift
i shouldnt have shouted at you i was angry im sorry
you were frustrated i dont blame you im the one who should be apologising
why
because i was pushing you too hard i was trying to mould you into something you werent
you were disappointed in me because i cant do anything as well as i did before
maybe there are things that you can do better
what can i do better
wellthis for example you wouldve considered it an illogical use of your time
its not good
no its wonderful its creative its a symbol of friendship before your accident you never would have considered that my feelings might have been hurt you would have certainly never have made me a gift
we werent friends
ah we were colleagues and i certainly felt affection for you
but i didnt return those feelings
you tolerated me
i dont understand
you said things like mister neelix please contain your exuberance and mister neelix i have no desire for fun and you never smiled youve got a much better sense of humour now
i like to smile
me too
i dont want to play kaltoh any more or meditate or work on logic problems
you dont have to
what can we do instead
whatever you want
teach me things that you like to do
here we are a triplechocolate wikki fruit sundae with warm fetran sauce
fetran sauce on a sundae
wait till you taste it
you really made this
as neelix says dig in
mmm this is great
this is fantastic
what did i tell you tuvok has a flair for food all morning hes been creating new recipes using combinations of ingredients that i never would have imagined for example a terra nut soufflé jibalian fudge cake with peppermint coulis sweet leola root tart mmm
only desserts how come
they taste good
hey you better watch out neelix tuvok may put you out of a job
from your mouth to the captains ears
she must have heard me
whats all this
were having fun
it turns out tuvok is quite the pastry chef
would you like some terra nut soufflé captain
id love some thank you oh that is delicious
i am pleased that you like it
what are you making now
pistachio cake with parracream sauce
oh parracreams my favourite
then youll have the first piece
tuvok have you remembered anything more about what happened on the flyer
i detected a cloaking frequency
yes thats right can you describe it
i dont know i
did it have a symmetric modulation was the amplitude constant
i dont understand
its all right i dont mean to push you tuvok but maybe if we could
its difficult for him captain maybe you can try again tomorrow
this this is what i saw
what is it
a cloaking frequency
here we go captain a nine million terrawatt cloaking field in grid two one six
nine million terrawatts whatever theyre hiding its huge
alter course mister paris
yes maam
bridge to astrometrics status
the deflector array is ready captain
raise shields
aye captain
were within range
all right seven light them up
its an armed outpostapproximately three thousand life signs twenty two ships
hail them
no response captain
theyre charging weapons
open a channel all subspace bands
theyre firing
cease fire immediately or ill transmit the coordinates of this outpost to the kesat homeworld
that got their attention
several days ago a member of your species attacked one of my crewmen he was badly injured in order to treat him i need to know more about the weapon that was used
theyre responding audio only
we do not share technology
but you take it from others the attacker was downloading our tactical database when the incident occurred
we must assess potential threats
paranoid just as i predicted
in exchange for information about your weapon well provide you with tactical data on several species weve recently encountered you can assess their potential threats all you want
the kesat investigator aboard your vessel cannot be trusted
you know about me
you have been attempting to expose us for years you are a threat you must be stopped
theyre charging weapons again
wait it was my photolytic converter that allowed voyager to decloak you if you give captain janeway what she wants ill give you the converter you can use it to adapt your technology so ours can no longer expose you
i doubt youll get as enticing an offer from the kesat homeworld it would be a shame if you forced me to hail them
we have an agreement
enter
what are you listening to
a selection from toms jazz database it really swings computer pause the music ive been reviewing the holodeck files i wish to visit the risa water recreation park will you accompany me
maybe after your doctors appointment
appointment
the doctors analysed the baneth weapon and hes devised a procedure to treat you you should be proud of yourself if you hadnt drawn that picture on the cake we may never have found a treatment
i wish i never drew that picture
why
because i dont wish to undergo the procedure
youre having preoperative jitters thats all dont worry everyone gets them just think about it in a few hours youll be yourself again
i am myself
but youll be able to do all the things that you used to do work on the bridge advise the captain
i want to be able to have fun with you i wont be able to will i
well you wont call it fun youll call it deriving satisfaction but its basically the same thing youll still experience emotions
but i wont express them
probably not
then how will you know how much i enjoy being with you
youve just told me
well still be friends
of course
even if i merely tolerate you
id be lying if i told you that things between us will stay the same
well why why do you want me to go back to the way i was
because this crew needs its tactical officer on the bridge and i wouldnt be a very good friend if i ignored that just so that youd be nicer to me
mister tuvok i was beginning to think you werent coming
i was experiencing preoperative jitters neelix helped me overcome them
glad to hear it now please lie down
ill see you after the procedure
of course
im going to miss him
me too
hello commander
mister neelix
its good to see you up and about are you feeling better
the doctor has approved my return to duty
thats wonderful news how about a celebratory glass of champagne
tea will suffice
of course im preparing a special dinner tonight in honour of your recovery i dont suppose that youd be interested in preparing one of your famous desserts
i have much more important things to do than engage in the preparation of nutritionally deficient foods
maybe another time
sundaes
i beg your pardon
i have given further consideration to your riddle regarding the ensign who survived by consuming the dates from his calendar it occurs to me that he could also have eaten the sundaes
thats a very clever answer mister vulcan but its not very logical is it
no its not
gedrin gedrin what happened i lost you
thirty seven biopods were damaged i had to disconnect them from the reactor
were they dead
i had no choice the main powers holding the rest of the biopods are secure that leaves us dont look so worried itll be like a simple nights sleep were out of time
do you think well dream
i dont know well get through this
what if theres nothing left
well start again five years
report
weve entered some kind of a subspace corridor
we were cruising at warp six then wham this thing pulled at our warp field like a magnet
where did that debris come from
unknown but the corridor is filled with it metal fragments plasma exhaust organic residue
some of the debris is over eight hundred years old captain
id like to avoid becoming part of this garbage stream can you find a way out
i dont now theres hundreds of corridors its like a maze
well be a good rat and find us the cheese hmm
ill do my best captain
tuvok
it was a vessel sir they are hailing us
put it through
who are you
im captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager and you are
this underspace belongs to us
were here by accident were trying to find a way out can you help us
help you yes well help you
they are targeting our shields with a resonance pulse its altering the harmonics were being pushed out of the corridor
were clear
the vessel has exited the corridor as well
captain were over two hundred light years from where we entered the corridor
two hundred light years in five minutes
hail them thank you for your help theres something id like to ask you weve got a long journey ahead of us and i was wondering if we could negotiate passage through this underspace of yours
lower your shields prepare to be boarded
boarded for what reason
we must purge your computer remove all readings youve gathered in our territory
we pose no threat to you were simply trying
were going to destroy that information one way or another lower your shields
i wont do that
evasive manoeuvres try to disable them
their vessel is highly manoeuvrable its difficult to get a phaser lock
picking up two more ships heading our way 
direct hit our warp drive is offline
shields down to eighty two percent sixty percent
theyre closing
we could use some clever suggestions about now
theres a planet eight million kilometres ahead uninhabited but the atmosphere is charged with radiogenic particles
how radiogenic
three thousand isorems
if we route enough power to the shields we can survive in that but maybe our friends cant
shields at fifty three percent
do it
entering the thermosphere
radiation levels at three thousand isorems and climbing
the alien ships
in pursuit and charging weapons
increase our descent vector
theyre still closing
direct hit to our aft shields
find the highest concentration of radiation and take us through it
proximity radiation at four thousand isorems five thousand six
their shields are weakening theyre breaking off
now all we need is a place to set down and make repairs tom
were clearing the lower stratosphere
on screen
i thought you said this planet was uninhabited
radiation must have interfered with my scans
i doubt its inhabited anymore looks like this planets in the middle of a nuclear winter
agreed gamma radiation levels are highly toxic the impact crater suggests an orbital bombardment
how long ago
from the rate of radiogenic decay eight hundredninety two years
this must have been a city of millions set us down
disengaging engines
stand down red alert assign damage repair teams and tom make sure belanna has enough help in engineering i want those warp engines back online
yes maam
our friends are still in orbit
circling like vultures
well theyre going to go hungry
not if they find a way to adapt their shields and come down after us
captain im detecting faint life signs coming from a chamber several hundred metres beneath the surface
survivors
after nine hundred years
oversee the repair teams
youre going down there
if somebody survived this catastrophe they might need our help get a good fix on those coordinates i dont want to beam into solid rock seven tuvok youre with me
these walls have been reinforced with tritonium they built this place to last
most of the power relays are still active
not bad after nine centuries
the main reactor is drawing energy from the planets geothermal core efficient
some kind of stasis pod
this display indicates that there are more chambers behind these walls some of them have failed
its amazing they survived at all lets see what else we can find
seven what are you doing
ive activated the reanimation sequence he may be able to provide us with answers
we dont know anything about this species they could be hostile
most humanoid cultures are
remind me to reacquaint you with away mission protocols
who
its all right were not your enemy were from a starship we discovered this chamber and revived you
how long was i
in stasis close to nine hundred years
nine hundred jisa help her please
no jisa she was my wife
i wont hurt you
i was drifting in and out of consciousness when they brought me here but i thought i saw you appear out of thin air
im a computer programme a hologram
and the others
flesh and blood like yourself
youre the ones that took me out of stasis i dont recognise your species
human our home planet is halfway across the galaxy
and youve expanded your territory into this space
our ship was brought here by accident were trying to get home
youre borg
how do you know that
dont you recognise my people the vaadwaur
the collectives memory from nine hundred years ago is fragmentary
ive had many encounters with your kind
and lived to tell about them impressive
how did you find us
we needed someplace to hide from the turei after they found us in one of their subspace corridors
their corridors
so they claimed
the corridors were ours it took centuries to map them we were the envy of a hundred species including the turei
are they responsible for what happened to your planet
the turei and a dozen others what one couldnt accomplish the others finally did i would like to look at whats left of my world
we made our final stand there
ive scanned the cavern youve got a thousand more stasis pods down there most of them still active hundreds of ships land vehicles weapons
a single battalion and their families we had planned to come out of stasis after five years we believed that by then the alliance would have been at each others throats
you were going to rebuild
no not here we knew this planet would be poisoned for centuries we were planning to go to another world start a colony hope to find new allies learn from them
your power core is still functioning it was the controls that were damaged in the attack thats why you never came out of stasis
jisa and i lived there in the old quarter we had a garden overlooking the street below its a shame she didnt show more courage at the end
given the circumstances
thats no excuse
pardon me for saying this but that seems a bit heartless
when it rains do you run from doorway to doorway trying to stay dry getting wet all the while or do you just accept the fact that its raining and walk with dignity
rains one thing plasma bombs are something else
but the principle is the same
id bring an umbrella
maybe its not too late to meet a new ally and learn from her
i took the liberty of preparing a large assortment of delta quadrant dishes hopefully theres something here that youll like
youre talaxilzay
talaxian but youre right my ancestors referred to themselves as talaxilzay in the old tongue
the old tongue was new when i met your race
you travelled all the way to talaxia
and farther our corridors took us to many worlds im curious have you heard of us the vaadwaur
oh im afraid there arent many records from that period but vaadwaur is a word in the old tongue it means foolish
your ancestors were wise only fools would let this happen to them
chakotay to captain janeway
go ahead
looks like our friends in orbit have found us
were on our way
report
six turei vessels are in orbit all firing plasma charges
that was two thousand metres to starboard
looks like they cant get an exact fix on our position the radiogenic atmosphere must be disrupting their targeting
nine hundred metres
theyre getting closer
we have the same problem our torpedoes wont lock on
direct hit aft shields down to eighteen percent
captain can you transmit a signal through this atmosphere
weve already tried talking to them
i have no intention of speaking with the turei we put a sentry satellite in orbit directly above the city you could use its sensors to help guide your torpedoes
its there intact and functional
open a channel ill give you the activation code
im a few centuries out of date
you can enter the activation code here its processing our telemetry
triangulate fire
direct hit the lead ship has lost shields its propulsion is down
one more torpedo will finish them
the other ships are retreating
captain why dont you keep firing
we scared them off thats enough for now
but theyll come back with twice as many ships
with any luck our warp drive will be back online by then
the turei may be cowards but their technology has become much more advanced than ours if you leave us we will be slaughtered again
what do you propose
help us off this planet and we will show you subspace corridors known to nobody else you will be free from the turei and you will be a thousand light years closer to your home
lets wake up your battalion
dragons teeth
dragons teeth
an old greek myth after a dragon was killed in a war its teeth were spread out over the battlefield they took root and warriors sprung from the ground to continue the fighting
voyager was pulled into the corridor two hundred light years from here
pulled in
there must have been a break along the radial wall
the corridors occur naturally but theyre very unstable theyre damaged by use
obviously the turei dont have the wisdom to maintain them properly theyll be very difficult to navigate after centuries of neglect
weve only been able to chart a few of the corridors can you provide us with a more complete map
weve never kept written records for security reasons of course weve committed all the corridors to memory every multifold every spatial intersect
wed be happy to plot a course for you but first well need to get past the turei how many vessels are in orbit
eleven
mister gaul tuvok start working on a tactical plan
if we do manage to escape well need to locate a habitable world
seven scan the astrometric database see what you can find someplace out of the way
morin take charge of reviving the rest of our battalion
many of our biopods have been damaged i could use some assistance
our chief engineer will be glad to give you a hand
thank you
well lets get started weve got a civilisation to rebuild
no story tonight naomi i had to cook for two hundred people today
thats okay im tired too
did you get a chance to meet any of the children
i dont like them
why not
i just dont
well thats not good enough im the ships ambassador youre the captains assistant we have to make a good impression on our new friends
theyre not my friends
well not yet listen first thing tomorrow you and i will get together with a couple of the children
no
naomi whats wrong
nothing i dont like them and i dont want to play with them
that doesnt sound like you tell me what happened
they called you names
names
they said everybody from your planet was stupid they said your ears were funny they said just looking at you made them laugh they said
i i i get the idea children can be a little cruel sometimes but theres no need to take it personally besides my ears are kind of funny
i dont want to play with them
no and you dont have to
okay
come on
goodnight ill tell you a story tomorrow i promise
im not happy with these fluctuations we may be trying to reactivate too many ships at once
i suggest we focus on the assault fighters qual tel kpok
thanks when did you learn klingon
just a few phrases i was studying your database the klingons are a noble race
they have their moments
today is a good day to die
pardon
kahless your greatest warrior that was his battle cry
you seem to have taken an interest in klingon history
there are many parallels between our cultures the vaadwaur have also learned to embrace death without fear as children were taught to fall asleep each night imagining a different way to die
i prefer curling up with a good book
computer access my personal database
access established
go into the talaxian linguistic files old tongue dialect find and define the word vaadwaur
vaadwaur archaic adjective primary meaning foolish additional meanings weakminded reckless blind
whats the first known usage
first written example appears in eldaxons collected folklore second edition year of publication 5012 new calendar
computer name the specific folktales that use the word vaadwaur
the demon with the golden voice the tale of the deadly stranger the tale of the boy who lost his head the tale of the bloody hand
not exactly mother goose computer transfer the text of those stories to my quarters
transfer complete
that star cluster in grid fourteen twenty one nearly half the planets are inhabitable
unfortunately they are already occupied by the borg
the borg in my century theyd only assimilated a handful of systems it looks like theyve spread through the quadrant like a plague no offence
none taken
we had a colony near the twin star in grid three one five
that is part of the devore imperium now
and who are they
an authoritarian regime they claim eleven systems across three sectors
i dont suppose theyd be willing to negotiate for a continent or two
the devore are intolerant of outsiders
it doesnt matter we have nothing to negotiate with our technology is nine hundred years out of date
your pessimism is irrelevant we will find a home for you
i hope youre right
sixteen turei vessels are now in orbit long range sensors indicate five more on the way
i can understand that they want the odds in their favour but isnt that overkill
they may have detected us if they know their history theyll come prepared
nine hundred years is a long time to hold a grudge
the turei would like nothing more than to find the rest of our subspace corridors we cant allow that to happen
then i suggest we use the element of surprise at oh six hundred voyager will leave the surface and engage the turei ships in orbit as we draw their fire the more powerful vaadwaur vessels will attack from multiple vectors the rest of the vaadwaur will break orbit from the opposite side of the planet and proceed to the subspace corridors well rendezvous with them afterwards
what if voyager is disabled well be defenceless if we armed my ships with your photon torpedoes
i cant authorise that
why
starfleet protocols are very strict about the transfer of weapons
im not used to putting my life in someone elses hands
there are a lot of things youre going to have to get used to weve faced enemies worse than the turei im confident we can handle them
i need those weapons
im sorry the answers no
if you want access to our corridors
well continue home through open space if we have to
all right our lives are in your hands
we found a planet in a nebula near the junction of corridors three nine and eight seven five wed be isolated and relatively safe
relatively
im afraid the planet is somewhat harsh there are no large bodies of water and the vegetation is sparse
this is absurd
ensign we need a power coupling over here on the double
our plan was to reoccupy one of our former colonies gain allies rebuild our forces take back what was ours
our former colonies are destroyed or occupied by species that are far more advanced than we are
then well find a way to take them back
with what a battalion of obsolete ships and outdated weapons
no with voyager ive been studying their technology the control systems propulsion weaponry we could learn to operate the vessel ourselves
what are you saying
after they engage the turei theyll expect us to assist them instead well attack well put as many soldiers as we can onto voyager and take it into the corridors
this is a mistake if we fail well lose everything
if you like i can return you to your stasis pod inform the others
this is an m class planet in orbit of a type g star weve located a subcontinent with edible vegetation and an underground water supply unfortunately the region is subject to windstorms
not exactly paradise
you will adapt
practical and to the point just like my wife she had a knack for cutting to the truth
she must have been an efficient individual
to say the least you would have enjoyed her company you are not at all like the borg i knew
as a drone i helped assimilate many civilisations now i have the opportunity to help reconstruct one i find the experience gratifying
so do i im curious has your crew ever considered finding a planet of their own a place to settle down
captain janeway is committed to getting voyager back to earth
that could take decades and there are many dangers ahead
we will adapt
i suppose you will
neelix to seven of nine
yes
could i see you in cargo bay two its important
acknowledged
im due for a final briefing with your mister tuvok
ill accompany you to the bridge
im sorry to bother you but ive been doing some research on our new allies and i have found something very interesting in dozens of the ancient folktales of my people theres a common theme they describe a phantom army that appears out of thin air destroys entire colonies and vanishes in the blink of an eye sound familiar
the subspace corridors
exactly gedrin claims theyve been using them as trade routes but im starting to wonder
your source material is folktales mister neelix
but many fables have a basis in reality youve got the collective knowledge of thousands of species you could crossreference my findings itll only take a few minutes
come in
you wanted to see me captain
yes i need a little history lesson
cant it wait until after weve reached the corridors
im afraid not ive just had a conversation with mister neelix and seven of nine theyve been poring through various databases and have come up with some surprising findings
surprising
you told me the vaadwaur were a culture of merchants and scientists who expanded their knowledge by using subspace corridors to travel to other worlds you were the envy of hundreds of species some of whom eventually wanted the corridors for themselves
your point
let me give you another version of events the vaadwaur were an aggressive culture who expanded their territory by using the corridors to attack other worlds until some of those worlds banded together to defend themselves and put an end to the vaadwaur threat once and for all would you care to set the record straight
that was nine hundred years ago
if were going to be fighting side by side i have to trust you i need to be certain you dont have any ulterior motives
our only motive is survival
if i were to take you at your word the ancient talaxians might call me vaadwaur foolish thats what they came to call anyone who allowed themselves to be deceived by an enemy there are hundreds of other references just like it
both versions of our history are true we did use the corridors to explore and on occasion expand our territory but captain we have gone from a population of six billion to six hundred our weapons are archaic do you really think that we are prepared to declare war on the delta quadrant
not yet but right now its voyager im worried about the turei are going to be firing everything theyve got at my ship you might try to take advantage of that
what are you going to do put us all back into stasis
we said wed try to help you make a new start and i want to keep that promise but i cant ignore history mister gedrin
make yourself comfortable mister gedrin chakotay i dont know whether to believe him or not what i wouldnt give for a betazoid about now
if mister neelix is right we should be ready for anything their technology may be outdated but it can still do a lot of damage
agreed maintain a full security alert and have tuvok keep a weapons lock on their primary reactor
are we still proceeding at oh six hundred hours
yes but with a few modifications whats mister gauls location
hes in the central chamber
hail him
captain weve reactivated seventy three assault vessels our pilots are standing by
i need to inform you about a change of plan i want you to deactivate the particle cannons on all but ten of your assault vessels then well proceed on schedule
i dont understand
only ten of your ships are going to engage the turei the others will head directly for the subspace corridors i see no reason for those to be armed
something could go wrong why leave them defenceless
voyager will defend them
what prompted this change
you havent been completely honest about your past and that makes me a little uncertain about the present
gedrin
i suggest you listen to her
request denied captain
its not a request you can call it an ultimatum if you like
unacceptable
im going to leave this planet in one hour with or without you
we did not spend nine hundred years in stasis to take orders from you
contact the battalion tell them to prepare for the attack
i dont know about the rest of you but im ready to get moving whats our status
impulse engines are online
shields at maximum weapons standing by
tom prepare to initiate the ascent sequence in
report
massive energy readings coming from the central chamber
its the vaadwaur theyre launching the first wave of ships seventeen vessels have broken through the surface theyre at an altitude of two thousand metres and charging weapons
maam theyre not ascending into orbit theyre heading straight for voyager
tom
engaging thrusters initiating ascent sequence
vaadwaur ships approaching off our starboard bow
target phasers full spread
were airborne
what altitude do we need on this planet tom before we can go to warp
well have to clear the thermosphere two hundred and eighty kilometres at least
shields at ninety two percent
phasers
weve disabled four of their ships
theyve launched another thirty nine vessels
evasive manoeuvres
its no use theyre closing on all sides
direct hit to the port thrusters
were losing altitude
reroute emergency power we need to get into orbit
targeting sensors offline switching to manual
harry can you open a secure channel to the turei ships in orbit
yes maam but that would give away our position they could lock on with plasma charges
i think its time we reacquaint a couple of old friends hail them
voyagers shields are weakening but theyre gaining altitude again theyre approaching the thermosphere
launch another squadron
weve got nine more fighters on our tail
aft shields down to twenty percent
captain the turei are responding
put them through
what do you want
ive got a proposition for you
no more talk prepare to be bordered
tell me have you been picking up weapons fire
we have detected some unusual energy signatures yes
thats because were under attack by the vaadwaur
impossible they were destroyed centuries ago
some of us have survived
theyve got over two hundred ships they said something about wanting their subspace corridors back i suggest we join forces and try to neutralise the threat here and now whats more important to you deleting the records of a federation ship that means you no harm or defending yourselves against hundreds of vaadwaur fighters who are determined to invade your underspace i suggest you pick your enemy
our sensors cant penetrate the atmosphere how can we fight an enemy we cant see
we have access to one of their surveillance satellites we could use it to transmit their vital coordinates to you
if this is a deception
im having trouble establishing a link with the satellite our sensor array took heavy damage
i could access it from the underground control chamber transport me there not all of my people are stuck in the past captain
tuvok go with him
weve impacted their hull there are breaches in progress on two decks
theyll have to reroute power from their shields to seal them theyll have no choice but to put down have our ground forces ready
weve lost impulse engines and navigation
thrusters are failing were losing altitude
tuvok status tuvok
ive lost the signal
all hands this is the captain initiate emergency landing procedures and arm yourselves if the vaadwaur board this ship well fight them hand to hand if we have to
once weve secured voyager execute the crew
wait we have hundreds of biopods still intact put them into stasis in a few hundred years maybe someone will be kind enough to revive them
what is that
its a plasma charge it came from orbit its the turei theyve isolated our location
how
one of the surveillances satellite has been activated
shut it down
theyre blocking my commands im rotating the carrier frequencies
the chamber is destabilising we must evacuate
not yet if were going to succeed i need to transmit the signatures of our fighters to the turei you go
six vaadwaur ships were just destroyed by the turei the others are breaking off their attack
impulse engines
still offline
how about emergency power
barely enough for life support captain
harry the radiogenic particles in the atmosphere could we use them as a power source
wed have to modify the warp cores conversion matrix it could take hours
what if we drew the particles directly into our plasma manifold
that would give us one hell of a boost
it could also blow out every power relay on the ship
damned if we do damned if we dont open the forward nacelle ports and reverse the pressure gradient take in six hundred kilograms
the chambers collapsing sir
well take as many ships as we can try to reach the subspace corridor
particle concentration at three thousand parts per million
release the manifold
rerouting plasma to the power conduits we have impulse
take us up
thirteen power relays just blew out on deck six
steady
were crossing the thermosphere
any sign of pursuit
none looks like the vaadwaur have their hands full
altitude
two hundred and sixty kilometres two hundred and seventy weve cleared the thermosphere
go to warp mister paris
yes maam
how many ships
astrometrics scans detected fifty three ion signatures entering the corridors all vaadwaur
the underground chambers
they were destroyed by the turei bombardment captain i believe i made an error in judgment
oh
by awakening gedrin i initiated a chain of events that nearly led to our destruction i wanted to help revive a civilisation not start a war
you thought you were acting out of compassion i might have done the same thing but that doesnt make it right seven the repercussions of this could be catastrophic
their technology is nine centuries out of date their plans for conquest are irrelevant
theyre a resourceful species determined theyll adapt i doubt weve seen the last of them
ares four to kumagawa how was the sunrise from down there
beautiful there was a little green mixed in today it was really quite spectacular
sorry i missed it
next time lieutenant
any luck drilling through that lava plain
roger that we broke through the iron oxide barrier and were down to eight metres
we should have some samples by the end of the day if all goes well
on to more important matters received an uplink from houston the yankees won game five of the world series
you owe me twenty bucks
its not over yet theres still game six we wont be the only ones making history today bokai just broke dimaggios record
i dont believe it
if you ask me houstons been manipulating the stats
they do have a few too many kings fans at mission control
well how else do you explain bokai beating out the yankee clipper
commander we lost you for a second there
the ride got a little bumpy stand by picking up some turbulence
at your altitude
checking lidar what the hell
john whats going on
theres an object closing on my position azimuth one twenty one point six whatever it is its huge its over a thousand metres across
how could something that big appear out of nowhere
i dont know but im getting out of its way firing thrusters
its probably just a solar flare
lets hope so
its no solar flare
come in come in
chakotay to the bridge
this is transporter room two
im trying to reach the bridge
your comm signal was routed here sir
can you patch me through
pardon me where patch you through where
neelix
commander
check on the field generators
control seven return to base at once
computer locate neelix
i cant get through to engineering
i see youre making some changes to the computer core
i have enhanced the command sequencers with borg algorithms
well your enhancements are wreaking havoc with our secondary systems
insignificant malfunctions i will correct them
i dont recall authorising any modifications
the computer core is inefficient it needed to be improved
i appreciate your initiative but thats not up to you
ive explained the value of these enhancements on several occasions but lieutenant torres chose to ignore me i thought a demonstration would be more persuasive
well i doubt this ones going to change her mind
clearly voyager is not yet ready for assimilation a joke the doctor suggested that i defuse tense situations with humour
good idea now how about getting these systems back up again so i can get back to my book
we are experiencing a shipwide power drain this is unrelated to my modifications
senior officers to the bridge
its two in the morning ensign this better be more than a little turbulence
you wont be disappointed weve got level nine gravimetric distortions closing on our position
theyre emanating from subspace
on screen shields
its heading right toward us
evasive manoeuvres
captain
say good morning to thirty million terajoules of subspace energy
this thing is following us i cant outrun it at impulse
go to warp
its disrupting our warp field
if it gets any closer the gravimetric stresses are going to rip the plating off our hull
captain i recognise this phenomenon its borg designation is spatial anomaly five two one its attracted to objects that emit electromagnetic energy we have to cut power and reverse our shield polarity
do it
that was close
i recognise this anomaly too its called a graviton ellipse according to the federation database it travels through subspace emerging occasionally without warning ellipses have only been observed a handful of times
ares four
commander
one of the early mars missions the command module and its pilot were engulfed by a similar phenomenon back in 2032
i remember reading about that two astronauts were stranded on the surface for weeks before a rescue ship arrived
no ones gotten this close to a graviton ellipse and lived to tell about it this could be a remarkable opportunity
go to yellow alert keep our power output at minimum levels match its course and speed but maintain a safe distance
aye captain
i suggest we launch a probe see if we can find out what makes this thing tick
make it fast theres no telling when our visitors going to burrow back into subspace
im receiving telemetry from the probe it appears to have entered a stable core within the anomaly the gravimetric forces are negligible
the eye of the storm
an apt metaphor
computer run a multispectral analysis of the anomalys core
analysis in progress
the borg developed shields to get through the gravimetric currents they intended to dissipate the anomaly from within perhaps we should continue their efforts
it would be shortsighted to destroy it we should study the phenomenon
i didnt realise you shared this crews penchant for exploration
i am a starfleet officer
when the risks outweigh the potential gain exploration is illogical
we cant predict what we might find here seven one must allow for the unexpected discovery
core analysis complete
there are more that two point eight billion compounds in the core
fascinating
the computer has isolated several synthetic compounds native to sector zero zero one
titanium and polymer composites these materials date back to the twenty first century they were used in the construction of earths early spacecraft
commander chakotay mentioned a space capsule that was consumed by a graviton ellipse
these alloys are consistent with the hull of that capsule an unexpected discovery indeed
she was forty six metres ninety two metric tons powered by a third generation ion drive and equipped with a transpectral imager
ares four was piloted by lieutenant john kelly his ground team astronauts rose kumagawa and andrei novakovich were close to completing their survey mission when kelly reported an object closing on his position then he and the command module disappeared off nasas lidar scopes
and into the history books that incident almost derailed the mars programme
mankinds first encounter with a spatial anomaly
seven you said the borg were working on a way to get inside a graviton ellipse
shield enhancements
well maybe we could apply the same enhancements to the flyer
captain do you intend to try to find the command module
or whats left of it
by my calculations we have less than sixteen hours before the anomaly goes back into subspace
then we have to work quickly harry belanna help seven modify the flyers shields tom review the database from the ares four mission it might tell us something about this anomaly weve missed were going to need a mission leader
i volunteer
i thought you might lets do it
something on your mind seven
the anomaly is as dangerous and unpredictable now as it was three hundred years ago
but the delta flyers a little more advanced than the ares four was well be taking every precaution
that may not be enough
i appreciate your concern but this is my call
searching for the command module seems more sentimental than scientific
i cant argue with that if scientific knowledge was all we were after then the federation would have built a fleet of probes not starships exploration is about seeing things with your own eyes in this case were exploring the past
how will retrieving this artefact enhance your appreciation of history
by making us part of it in the same way that excavating the obelisks of ancient vulcan or finding the shroud of kahless made those explorers a part of their history heres the crux of it as a borg you didnt study the past you ingested it youve never really developed an appreciation for humanitys history maybe this is an opportunity to do some exploring of your own
are you ordering me to join this mission
lets just say im encouraging you to volunteer
its no solar flare wow
john can you describe it
its at least a thousand metres wide bright
your transmissions breaking up
its generating an electromagnetic radiation interfering with primary systems i cant get away from it activating the transpectral imager ill record as much data as i can its right on top of me ill transmit as much as i can
thats all she wrote
nasa received kellys last telemetry at oh nine twenty two hours october 19th 2032
i thought i was the mars buff you seem to know more about the ares four than i do
the mars missions paved the way for the exploration of space kelly was one of my childhood heroes
mine too
thats dedication the mans life is about to end but he wont stop taking readings
makes you wonder if those oldtimers were made of sterner stuff than we are
you think we have it easy
you kidding warp drive shields transporters were travelling in the lap of luxury
kelly and kumagawa armstrong and glenn they were the real pioneers
am i interrupting
we were just admiring someone fellow explorer
hero worship the glorification of an individuals accomplishment
i guess you didnt have many role models growing up
in the collective personal accomplishments are irrelevant the shield modifications to the flyer are complete were ready for launch
we
youll need someone familiar with borg technology to monitor the shields im volunteering
you dont sound too happy about it
im not but this mission can benefit from my expertise
in that case welcome aboard
im preparing an inoculant to counter the effects of gravimetric radiation of course if you were a hologram youd simply adjust your mobile emitter thats what i did on arakis prime one of my first away missions
i dont recall that
this was before you came aboard such an enchanting planet crystalline glaciers magnesium vapour atmosphere i had to stop my metallurgical scans just to admire the sheer beauty of it to smell the roses to coin a phrase
an inefficient use of your time
perhaps were all finished here except for one thing would you record some images when youre inside the ellipse for those of us not lucky enough to make the trip
you envy my participation in this mission
there isnt a crewman aboard who doesnt
why
i can only tell you how i felt that morning when i materialised on arakis prime i left my footprints in the magnesite dust and thought one small step for a hologram one giant leap for mankind
to coin a phrase
well i know the sentiment isnt exactly original but the fact is i was exhilarated
chakotay to seven of nine report to shuttlebay two
good luck
were approaching the perimeter in five four three two one
were within two thousand kilometres gravimetric interference is increasing
its nothing compared to what theyre going through theyre really getting knocked around in there
their shields have weakened but theyre still holding
harry keep your finger on that tractor beam in case we have to pull them out
theyre approaching the anomalys core weve lost sensor contact
harry
the comm link is still active
the gravimetric shear is increasing
im reading diminished turbulence directly ahead
full thrusters tom punch us through chakotay to voyager were in
i wish you could see this captain its incredible
were all ears
its very calm no gravimetric distortions the em activity is creating a natural luminescence tom called it mood lighting
hey belanna its the perfect romantic getaway
ill take your word for it
weve detected asteroid fragments pieces of vessels matter from every quadrant of the galaxy next time i lose something ill know where to look instead of a graviton ellipse we should call it the kitchen sink anomaly the chemical interactions have even created a primitive atmosphere
nothing youd want to breathe of course
what do you make of it seven
well i suppose its intriguing some of the matter appears to be extradimensional in origin
sounds like this anomalys gotten around
any sign of the ares command module
were picking up traces of the hull but our sensor readings are being refracted by all the debris in here
that was a gravimetric surge caused by the anomaly changing course by point zero zero six degrees
we just had a big jolt out here
we didnt feel a thing
by our estimate you have five hours thirty six minutes before the anomaly returns to subspace
youd better get a move on
understood
im having difficulty isolating the debris from the command module
ill lay in a search pattern it may take a couple of hours to cover an area this large
seven and i can use the time to take some samples get a better idea of where this anomalys been
we should focus on achieving our objective and returning to voyager
were not here just to find a module weve got an opportunity to
explore i am familiar with our mission
in that case lets get started
the fossilised microbes in this ore appear to have had metallic membranes
weve speculated about the possibility of metallic lifeforms but weve never discovered one
youre excited by this discovery
this piece of rock is billions of years older than earth from a time when the galaxy was still forming here
commander
take it youre holding a piece of history maybe even the beginnings of life itself
unlikely
its more likely than you think this anomaly is as old as anything weve ever encountered i could spend a lifetime studying the things its collected
and leave voyager without a first officer
theyd manage palaeontology was always my first love its the reason i joined starfleet
why didnt you pursue it
my sense of responsibility got in the way first the maquis then voyager what i wanted to be always seemed to take a back seat do you remember what you wanted to be before you were assimilated
i was assimilated when i was a child
i knew i wanted to be a palaeontologist when i was six
a ballerina
maybe its not too late
it was a juvenile fantasy
those are the ones that stick with you
heads up folks i think were getting close
ive isolated the module bearing thirty nine mark one five there
it appears to be intact
im reading hull breaches and corrosion but all things considered its pretty well preserved
we werent expecting to find a fragment this big cant just stow it in the aft section
well use a tractor beam to tow it back to voyager
captain the anomaly just made another course change point zero zero three degrees
thats the third one in an hour something has to be attracting it
theres nothing on the sensors
i think it enjoys being unpredictable
we know it has a taste for electromagnetic energy
so what could generate an em field large enough to get its attention but still not show up on sensors
an energy burst from a pulsar a neutrino cloud
dark matter
realign the sensor array to scan for em fluctuations
ive got a spatial disturbance three million kilometres away its a dark matter asteroid
bingo
the anomalys heading right for it
time to impact
four minutes captain we cant predict how the impact will affect the anomaly
but its a safe bet it wont be a gentle nudge
janeway to delta flyer weve
got a problem the anomaly is on a collision course with a dark matter asteroid
weve located the mars orbiter were adapting a tractor beam
give us a minute
you dont have it get out of there
captain
now
is the tractor beam ready
just about sir
lock onto the module and take us out
we dont have time
i gave you an order
commander
were not leaving without that module tom
captain both the anomaly and the asteroid are accelerating
theyre attracting each other like a pair of magnets
at this rate itll impact in fifty six seconds
chakotay youve got less than a minute
acknowledged
the module is slowing us down
maintain tractor lock how long until we clear the anomaly
at our current speed forty seconds
we can do it
thirty seconds to impact theyre still not clear
chakotay status
were on our way
twenty seconds
gravimetric distortions are increasing
the flyer
ive lost the signal
how badly is he damaged
hes got a severe concussion and internal injuries we need to get him back to voyager
that may not be possible communications shields and propulsion are still offline
hes stable for now ill give you a hand
we can repair the shields but the engines are unsalvageable
it cant be that bad
its worse the ellipse showing signs of returning to subspace we have less than two hours
hes regaining consciousness easy easy lie still
it feels like i just went ten rounds with an andorian
more like twenty you were hit with a plasma discharge the gravimetric surge from the asteroid caught us at the edge of the anomaly and tossed us back inside
the command module
its adrift three hundred metres off our port bow
then we can still salvage it
not so fast we cant get engines or shields back online not to mention a tractor beam well be lucky to get out of this in one piece
i can help
youre in worse shape than this ship you want to help lie in the bed doctors orders
another gravimetric surge
ill see if i can reinforce the structural integrity field
you might try drawing power from auxiliary life support
that system was damaged as well
what about the secondary relays
theyre offline
that doesnt leave us many choices try rerouting the phaser couplings
we explored that option while you were unconscious
then maybe you can bring me up to date
theres no time i suggest you recuperate we have the situation under control
it doesnt look that way from here im still in command of this mission i want to know whats going on
very well we were ordered by the captain to leave this anomaly but you chose to disobey that command as a result of your obsession with the module we are now trapped along with it in all probability we wont survive without
point taken now why dont you continue without the attitude
an inventory of the damaged systems read it for yourself
i made a mistake i put the mission at risk
you put our lives at risk
well if we dont make it out someones bound to come looking for us in a few hundred years defusing a tense situation with humour remember
voyager to delta flyer
theyre using a probe as a transmission relay
voyager to chakotay please respond we cant detect you
captain we can hear you
im matching their frequency voyager this is the delta flyer respond
are you all right whats your status
weve sustained heavy damage captain but were alive its good to hear your voice
we could install the same shielding on a class two shuttle and take it in
it took us hours to make the modifications
to the flyer weve only got eighty two minutes before this thing disappears into subspace
it may be possible to modify a tractor beam to cut through the gravimetric interference
youll never be able to get it all the way through to the core
start working on it anyway
you said all the energy conduits are fused
correct
we cant get power to any of the primary systems
if the replicators were working we could whip up a new plasma manifold
and be on our way
what if i could get you an old manifold
excuse me
the command module may be three centuries old but the power distribution system isnt that different from the flyers right here this control panel in the main cockpit it was called an ion distributor with a few tweaks it could be modified to channel warp plasma
even if it were possible we have to obtain the object
before we can adapt it
do you have enough
power to beam one of you to the module
yes maam ill go
not so fast tom if another gravimetric surge hits well need you at the helm seven
are you encouraging me to volunteer again captain
you read my mind
come on just a little closer thats it for thrusters
but i got us within transporter range ready
stand by
ironic youre doing what ive always dreamt of remember when you set foot in that module youll be stepping into history
history is irrelevant
irrelevant do me a favour when youre over there download whatever you can from their database and also take a minute to look around so you can tell us what it was like
there may not be time but ill try
good luck
whats it like in there
dark the ambient temperature is minus two hundred sixty degrees there appear to be fractures in the aft bulkheads
is the cockpit intact
yes
ive brought the main computer online
ive lost contact with the team on the surface and i cant get a fix on my position
what was that
theres an active data file
it appears to contain log entries
can you play them for us
i believe so
consider it my last request
and i cant get a fix on my position but im alive and the cm seems to be intact im inside this
whatever it is
could you hear that chakotay
its amazing everyone assumed he was killed instantly
what ive gotten myself into its very calm like im in the eye of a hurricane its a little spooky but the way i figure it
if theres a way in theres got to be a way out im gonna fire up the spectral imager before i initiate another engine burn collect as much data as i can jeannie i may not be bringing you back the mars rock but i promise you im going to do everything i can to get home
ares four mission record october 23rd im starting to feel like jonah how long was he in the belly of that whale three days i got him beat by a day or two already the em interference is disrupting communications and lidar and i cant see the stars theres no way i can get a fix on my position if this things moving as fast as it was when it pulled me in i could be a long way from mars by now the imagers been working overtime cataloguing all the matter in here but a lot of it defies analysis i think were going to need to make room on the periodic table where the hell am i power levels have dropped another fifteen percent since my last systems check
i think i just saw another spacecraft either that or all this dehydrated food has gone to my head ive got it the hulls made of some kind of alloy i cant make heads or tails of it i shouldnt have been so dismissive
i remember giving kumagawa a hard time when she claimed she saw a ufo over the gulf i told her it was a meteor or another piece of mir i guess i owe you an apology rose ares four mission record october 25th its been a nice place to visit
but im ready to come home ive prepped the ion drive channeled all the thruster reserves into the main tank
i have enough fuel for one last engine burn wish me luck
ignition sequence five four three two im losing pitch control gyros arent responding power failure ive got to abort im not going to make it
all systems go watch me dad im flying boom bad landing call the medevac team ha
paris to seven status
ive located the device but its fused to the hull stand by
make it quick weve got less than fifteen minutes
understood
all systems go watch me dad im flying boom bad landing call the medevac team ha john kellys first flight not exactly aok remember that dad i jumped off the roof with a parachute made of blankets i guess i didnt calculate the aerodynamics of course i was only six i guess
this is john kellys last flight this time i cant blame it on pilot error this time no regrets
oh what ive seen proves we were right to come out here
were not alone i know that now the modules losing power im taking life support offline
rerouting whatevers left to the imager keep it running as long as possible mission control dad whoever finds this do me a favour take all the data ive collected put it to good use i hope you dont look at this as a failure i dont
actually i do have one regret i never found out who won the world series im tired and i cant
paris to seven hows it going over there
i have the distributor im downloading lieutenant kellys database
hurry were running out of time
lock onto my biosignature and my comm badge
seven
energise
delta flyer report
were trying to integrate the distributor stand by captain
how long do they have
four minutes
try bypassing the power couplings
no effect
resequence the ion modulators see if that does it
power conversion in process
we have propulsion shields
the plasma flow is still fluctuating
stay on top of it paris to voyager
go ahead
open the shuttlebay doors were coming home
acknowledged
laying in an escape trajectory
the ellipse is returning to subspace
the flyer
theyre approaching the perimeter two thousand metres eighteen hundred
the anomalys submerging
are we in tractor range
not yet
take us closer
captain
do it
theyre still out of reach another three hundred metres
closer
well be pulled right in with them
just a few more metres
were too close
ive got a lock
reverse thrusters full impulse
space literally it means nothing a vacuum between stars and planets but by the same token it means everything its what connects all our worlds vulcan kronos talax earth centuries ago mankind sent its first wave of explorers into that void astronauts like mister kelly they paved the way for the first colonies the first starships for those of us whove made space our home we commend the spirit and the bravery of lieutenant john mark kelly as we commit his body to space he will not be forgotten
captain i did not know this individual had i encountered him while i was a borg i would have found his technology unworthy of assimilation but we are more alike than one might think in a sense his desire to explore was not unlike a quest for perfection
his contribution helped secure humanitys future and in some ways my own
the yankees in six games
all hands attention honour guard
naomi wildman state your purpose here
i was waiting for you kadiskot remember our weekly game
reschedule for tomorrow im working now
redecorating isnt work
aesthetics are irrelevant im modifying the alcove to function as a cortical processing subunit
that was my next guess
then i wont need to explain its purpose
okay you win what do you do with a cortical processing er
subunit on borg vessels theres one in each unimatrix it downloads newly assimilated data to the drones
but voyager isnt a borg vessel and youre not a drone anymore
voyager collects a great deal of information sensor scans navigational projections engineering updates away team reports scientific analyses
the results of our kadiskot tournament
that too the crew must read and study this information an inefficient procedure these data nodes are downloading the information into the alcove
which is going to download it into you
precisely in a matter of hours i will assimilate several months worth of data
can i try it sometime
your physiology is different from mine
guess ill stick to reading my lessons and listening to neelix tell stories
i will see you tomorrow
can i watch okay tomorrow
warning plate is hot
now you tell me you go for authenticity and what do you get seconddegree burns
 ive been slaving over that replicator programme for hours what was this bizarre rumour i heard about half the crew on deck five getting pregnant
oh that the doctor was running generational projections on the sickbay computer tom paris happened to glance at the monitor and jumped to conclusions wasnt long before neelix was asking me if he could turn cargo bay one into a nursery
word travels fast on this ship hmm
warp ten oh by the way i meant to tell you theres a class k nebula twenty five light years off starboard we should take a look
a major detour for a minor nebula
we are explorers remember
permission granted
main course a recipe ive never tried but we are explorers remember
regeneration cycle complete
seven of nine to lieutenant torres lieutenant torres respond
good morning seven this better be important
i must speak with you at once
im picking up some interesting graviton fluctuations about ten light years away
can you be more specific
not at this distance tom alter course i want to take a closer look
chakotay had his heart set on that nebula were headed for
hell have to wait
captain i need permission to shut down the sensor grid seven thinks a couple of insects are disrupting the power flow
a mating pair of photonic fleas to be more accurate and possibly their offspring
and how did you arrive at this theory
last night i downloaded six months of ship status reports into my new cortical subunit while i was regenerating
learn while you sleep i tried that once it gave me a headache
go on
eight weeks ago an away team encountered a kartelan freighter carrying supplies from sector four nine two a territory that included a former talaxian colony mister neelix used the opportunity to acquire twelve kilograms of amber spice a delicacy among his people
what does that have to do with the sensor grid
on the same day ensign kim was repairing a replicator in the mess hall
i remember that neelix told me to stick around and try something he was cooking
no doubt made with the amber spice which contained the larvae of the photonic fleas
how could you possibly know that
because i also downloaded data regarding their life cycles the larvae flew out of the spice jar in search of their primary source of nourishment plasma particles the conduits within the nearby sensor grid contain an unlimited supply of these particles ensign kim had unwittingly given the creatures access by exposing the grid the now mature creatures periodically tap into the conduit for nourishment when they do the sensor emitters momentarily lose their resolution
a logical though highly speculative analysis
lets find a more suitable home for them
im picking up graviton fluctuations
take us out of warp on screen
anybody want to hazard a guess
they are hailing us
on screen
i recommend maximum shielding there are a few technical issues i havent worked out yet
theres a massive graviton surge coming from that thing
shields to full
your apparatus appears to be destabilising
if i dont find a way to repair this power core theyll be able to see the explosion all the way to er where did you say you were from
i didnt but were from a planet called earth
all the way to earth
can we ask you what its supposed to do
catapult a vessel across space in the time it takes to say catapult a vessel across space itll make warp drive look like a wooden sledge
maybe we can help you with that power core
hmm
the core sends a graviton surge through the projectors which locks onto a ship and sends it hurtling into null space to emerge a few hours later hundreds if not thousands of light years away
im curious why you built this catapult
simple ive been looking for a way to get home
we know the feeling
id been exploring an unstable wormhole before i knew it i was here and my home planet was there i was facing a journey of at least ten years instead i decided to build a catapult
have you tested it yet
two weeks ago i sent a probe nearly six hundred light years but it destabilised the core ive been trying to fix it ever since
we can send an engineering team over to help you
no no its too dangerous i wouldnt send my own crew in there
then we could find a way to adjust the core reaction from here
a few welltimed graviton pulses from our deflector dish might do it
thats generous but i have nothing to give in return
were not asking for anything in return
you could use the catapult after ive made my jump it should still be functional a thousand light years wont exactly get you back to earth
but it would cut a few years off our trip
if youre successful and if im satisfied a jump would be safe for voyager then well take you up on that offer thank you lets get started
good morning
perhaps not the alien mister tash is trying to deceive us his catapult is the same type of technology that was used to trap voyager in the delta quadrant five years ago
i scanned the catapult myself sensors didnt pick up anything unusual you spent the night in your new alcove
processing the same information and crossreferencing it with voyagers database when the catapult destabilised yesterday astrometric sensors recorded a momentary burst of epsilon radiation
unusual but not unheard of
epsilon radiation is one the byproducts of a tetryon reactor according to your own entries in the database your only encounter with that kind of technology occurred five years ago in the alpha quadrant a coherent tetryon beam locked onto voyager and you were hit by a massive displacement wave which pulled you across seventy thousand light years in a matter of minutes the source of that tetryon beam was the caretakers array mister tash claims that his catapult will be able to do something very similar
he didnt want us to send over a repair team
out of concern for our safety its obvious he was trying to hide his tetryon reactor
the first time we met a caretaker we were pulled halfway across the galaxy the second time we were almost killed im not eager for a third round
is this any way to treat a colleague
not so much as a molecule of caretaker dna
thank you doctor theres a tetryon reactor powering your catapult you didnt want us to find it did you unless you answer my questions ill resume course and you can ask somebody else for help
i acquired the tetryon reactor at great cost this territory is full of species who would do anything for such advanced technology including steal it i apologise for the deception but you do understand
we made an agreement to cooperate i see no reason not to continue
thank you captain
keep me informed on your progress
that reactor had to come from somewhere i cant just ignore the possibility of a caretaker nearby keep scanning see what you can find
there is another possibility the reactor may have come from the same array that brought voyager to the delta quadrant
thats a long shot seven
maybe not again according to your own reports you believed the only way to keep the array from falling into the wrong hands was to destroy it its possible the destruction was incomplete
and one of the reactors survived we scanned for debris there was nothing left but some fused pieces of metal alloy
i wish to reexamine the sensor records from that event
in case we were mistaken
yes
go right ahead
computer describe the debris remaining after the array was destroyed
particulate dust and metallic fragments composed of an unknown alloy vapour composed of hydrogen helium mercury and argon
was there anything left of the tetryon reactor
negative
specify the yield of the tricobalt device
twenty thousand teracochranes
who programmed the device
commander tuvok
display the detonation advance the image by point zero one seconds again
isolate grid three seven and magnify
is that a tractor beam
insufficient sensor data
identify its source
insufficient sensor data
identify the isolated section of the array
secondary power core
which contained a tetryon reactor
affirmative
commander ive been reviewing the data on the destruction of the caretakers array unfortunately the sensor records are incomplete
i dont doubt it we were being attacked by the kazon half the ships systems were down
a single kazon vessel
armed to the teeth
commander you fired the tricobalt charge that destroyed the array
correct
under the captains orders did you also programme the charge
yes
under the captains orders as well
not directly i determined the yield
twenty thousand teracochranes
thats correct
according to sensor estimates of the arrays hull integrity a charge of half that yield would have been sufficient
the captain wanted nothing left for the kazon to use i calculated a yield certain to produce that result
something may have escaped the blast one of the tetryon reactors
but we scanned for debris
the charge you detonated tore an opening in subspace
and thats where the reactor went
yes
how
it was pushed there by a tractor beam
do you have evidence of a tractor beam
perhaps
speculation is not evidence there was no tractor beam because there was no ship in the vicinity to generate one unless you can prove otherwise
thank you commander
looking for a midnight snack
i require information im attempting to determine whether the catapult technology was derived from the caretakers array
so i heard a fascinating theory its got my mind spinning
how long were you in the vicinity of the array before voyager arrived
about a year kes was on a nearby planet and er we were getting very close
did you ever encounter the caretaker directly
oh no no no no no no in my opinion any being powerful enough to grab ships from the other side of the galaxy should be avoided
according to voyagers database he claimed he was searching for a genetically compatible mate did you believe that explanation
i had no reason to doubt it though it did seem a bit excessive i mean all those ships
what happened to them
well after he sampled the crews dna he sent them back where they came from i suppose you know kes always thought something more was going on but she had quite an imagination
were there any other ships in the area after voyager arrived
only the kazon
but the caretaker could have pulled in another vessel a cloaked ship perhaps
seven what are you getting at
a third ship hidden from both voyager and the kazon
what was it doing there
preventing the tetryon reactor from being destroyed
kes was right something was going on
voyagers sensor logs were damaged in the kazon attack i cant be certain
maybe i can help the sensor records on my ship werent damaged i can give them to you
the tetryon reaction is stable graviton field is set for a one hundred light year jump
the catapults locking onto him
were being hailed
on screen
ill contact you the moment i reenter normal space thank you captain
my pleasure
catapult is at full power
goodbye to you all
final launch sequence has been initiated
hes gone
how long before we can expect to hear from him
if his vessel survived one or two hours
seven of nine to commander chakotay
go ahead
i require your assistance in the astrometrics lab
on my way
computer seal the doors deactivate all sensors within this room
acknowledged
whats this about
i believe voyagers presence in the delta quadrant is no accident you and the crew have been stranded here intentionally
by whom
captain janeway the captain and tuvok were involved in a federation conspiracy theyre in collusion with the caretaker and possibly the cardassians
i see and the point of this conspiracy
i believe theyre attempting to establish a military presence in the delta quadrant
thats quite a theory perhaps you havent heard of the jankata accord
no species shall enter another quadrant for the purpose of territorial expansion
the federation signed it the cardassians signed it and captain janeway would be the last person to violate it
improbable as it may sound ive found compelling evidence to support my theory
what kind of evidence
ive analysed over thirty million teraquads of data regarding voyagers activities over the past five years its quite clear that weve been the victim of an elaborate deception
i dont have the benefit of a cortical processor why dont you give me the abridged version
in the months before voyagers arrival neelix recorded the appearance of fifty two vessels including this one
a cardassian warship
a remarkable coincidence only days before voyagers arrival the cardassians were already in the delta quadrant
the caretaker was trying to find a mate remember he was pulling ships from all over the galaxy
im familiar with the caretakers actions in each instance he would examine the crews dna and when he failed to find a genetic match he would release the vessel but in this instance neelixs sensors indicated the ship vanished obviously it was returned to the alpha quadrant why
you seem to have all the answers
i believe the cardassians were sent back to deliver strategic information regarding the delta quadrant
conjecture
extrapolation
i can believe the cardassians might be involved in this but not starfleet
there are precedents for unauthorised missions of this type commander according to the federation database the maquis were victims of several of them
all right youve got my attention you said that tuvok and captain janeway were involved tell me how
at the same time the cardassians were meeting with the caretaker your maquis vessel was infiltrated with a starfleet agent
tuvok
your navigator he guided your ship to prearranged coordinates in the badlands where the caretaker locked onto you once you were pulled into the delta quadrant tuvok could have secretly transmitted final instructions to the caretaker a short time later captain janeway guided voyager to the same coordinates and was also pulled into the delta quadrant all of these events took place within a matter of days i find that suspicious
ill admit the timing seems a little convenient but that doesnt mean there was a master plan
why did the captain destroy the array
so the kazon couldnt use it to attack the ocampa
thats what she told the crew but i believe she intended to remain in the delta quadrant all along if the array had remained intact you and all the others would have insisted on using it to return home
she was keeping it from the kazon
the captain ordered commander tuvok to destroy the array he fired two tricobalt devices are those weapons normally carried on federation starships
no
yet they were part of voyagers arsenal why
i cant explain that
i can neither phasers nor torpedoes are capable of creating a tear in subspace a tricobalt device is as tuvok detonated the device a cloaked ship locked on to one of the arrays tetryon reactors and pushed it through the tear into subspace protecting it from the blast and hiding it from voyagers sensors but the captain and tuvok knew exactly where it was going once voyager left the area the reactor was retrieved and began a similar journey carried by a series of vessels until it was finally delivered to mister tash
who used it to build the catapult
he was waiting here for voyager and for the final phase of the mission
which is what exactly
i dont think captain janeway is planning to use the catapult to get voyager closer to home i think shes going to use it to bring in more vessels from the alpha quadrant if im correct this region of space will soon be occupied by a federationcardassian invasion force
youve uncovered some interesting facts but your interpretation is farfetched these are random incidents granted some of them are hard to explain but theres no conspiracy here
stardate 51008 captain janeway allows kes to leave voyager neelix told me that kes had suspicions about the caretaker was the captain trying to silence her stardate 51462 the doctors programme is transmitted to a starfleet vessel on the outskirts of the alpha quadrant an attempt by the captain to contact earth or a secret communiqué informing starfleet of her progress stardate 50984 janeway forges an alliance with the borg stardate 51762 a ceasefire with the hirogen stardate 52861 a nonaggression pact with the terkellians she called each incident diplomacy i believe she was trying to establish a tactical infrastructure in the delta quadrant over the past five years captain janeway has altered course two hundred sixty three times in the name of exploration in reality she was mapping the region and collecting strategic data regarding
i get the point
you still doubt my suspicions but can you be certain im wrong
absolutely certain no
until you are you mustnt allow captain janeway to retain control of the catapult
im picking up a transmission heavily distorted
he made it
can you clear it up
success captain five thousand light years
are you all right
a few systems overloaded nothing serious i had to readjust my shields during midflight almost lost my outer hull im sending you the modifications my catapult is yours captain good luck
get that data down to belanna tell her to enhance our shields
so were going ahead with the jump
i want to run a few more tests launch some probes but if it all checks out i see no reason not to
ive received the telemetry
ill take it to engineering
i want you to add a point zero three variance to these shield modifications
thatll disrupt the emitters
and youll need another six hours to get them back online i know
have you run this by the captain
no and im not going to not yet
shes pulling your leg its got to be some kind of borg practical joke
she wasnt joking
a secret mission starfleet in league with the caretaker its ridiculous
ridiculous seven has some compelling evidence
well then lets go to the captain get a straight answer
good morning kathryn all systems are operational the crews in good health and by the way is it true youve been lying to us for five years im not prepared to make that accusation but i cant ignore what ive heard either
so what do you suggest
i want you to delay those shield modifications thatll give me time to check sevens database take a look at the evidence myself
the captain asked me to work with you on the shields
that wont be necessary ensign
oh i dont mind you know how eager she is to make that jump
harry were fine here
too many cooks harry you know how it is well let you know when were done
download complete
seven of nine to captain janeway
go ahead
i need to speak with you in the astrometrics lab
im on my way
computer seal the door and deactivate internal sensors to this room
acknowledged
seven
i believe chakotay and other members of your crew are involved in a conspiracy to resurrect the maquis rebellion
did chakotay put you up to this
voyager and the federation itself are in grave danger
go on
ive concluded that chakotay intends to use the catapult to launch attacks against cardassian and federation starships
chakotay gave up his allegiance to the maquis a long time ago what youre saying makes no sense
improbable as it may sound i found compelling evidence to support my theory in the months before voyagers arrival neelix recorded the sudden appearance of fifty two vessels including this one
a cardassian warship
ive analysed the hull geometry and warp signature it was one of the same ships that were pursuing chakotay and his crew in the region known as the badlands it was pulled into the delta quadrant by the caretaker during that engagement according to federation records that same cardassian warship was found destroyed in the badlands the investigation revealed that it was attacked by the maquis i believe that for some unknown reason the caretaker had sent this ship back to the alpha quadrant and that commander chakotay attacked the vessel before it could reach its destination he downloaded its computer core and discovered the presence of the caretakers array he realised that the array could be used by the maquis as a weapon to launch surprise attacks against cardassian and starfleet vessels
well i commend you for your imagination but tuvok was a spy on chakotays ship if your theory were true he would have known about it
he does tuvok has been collaborating with the maquis resistance all along
thats not possible seven
with tuvoks assistance chakotay plotted a course toward the next likely appearance of the caretakers displacement wave offering his vessel as bait his ploy almost succeeded but the caretaker was more powerful than he anticipated his crew was taken captive a few days later voyager arrived and facilitated their escape chakotay seized that opportunity to make one last attempt to gain control of the array but then you gave the order to destroy it
circumstantial evidence not proof
who carried out your order to destroy the array
tuvok
using what type of technology
tricobalt devices
he set the yield to twenty thousand teracochranes it was enough to tear an opening in subspace a cloaked ship locked on to one of the reactors protecting it from the blast and hiding it from voyagers sensors the reactor was retrieved and carried by a series of vessels until it was delivered to mister tash who was well compensated by chakotay to build the catapult he was waiting here for voyager so chakotay could complete the mission he was forced to abandon five years ago
id be willing to consider this theory of yours if i didnt know chakotay as well as i do there is no one on this ship i trust more what youve done here is build what we call a house of cards
stardate 48658 commander seska is revealed to be a cardassian spy she defects to the kazon and impregnates herself with chakotays dna was he unaware of the procedure as he claims or were they working together to create a new kazon sect to capture voyager stardate 49522 chakotay recommends establishing trade relations with the kolhari their technology uses tetryon power cells a simple diplomatic overture or was he seeking a source of energy for the catapult stardate 49571
seven
naomi wildman
where are you going
thats not your concern
whats wrong
your father was ktarian
so
the ktarians were officially with the federation but they sympathised with the maquis
what are you talking about
who are you working for chakotay or the captain
seven
tell them its too late go
i picked up a power surge coming from the cargo bay
i detected the same thing you think its the enhanced alcove
could be
lets take a look are phasers standard equipment on board now
must be
the data buffers been activated
i wanted to make sure it wasnt malfunctioning
you should be careful somebody might think you were trying to delete a few files
why would they think that
some of those files could contain sensitive information
if thats true somebody might think you were trying to do the same thing
that catapult out there its a powerful piece of technology if the maquis ever had access to something like it they might have been successful
and if we had your mission to the delta quadrant never would have gotten off the drawing board
what are you talking about
the mission youve been on for the last five years
my only mission is trying to get voyager home
seven showed me the sensor records i saw the tractor beam
she showed me the same thing but she implicated you in some kind of maquis plot
same evidence two different theories
it all started with those damn photonic fleas she was downloading voyagers database
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead harry
i just picked up an unauthorised launch of the delta flyer sevens at the helm
set a pursuit course
acknowledged
chakotay to the doctor
sickbay here
get down to cargo bay two run a diagnostic on sevens alcove
on my way
im glad we got that settled
likewise
chakotay lets keep this one out of our logs huh
gladly
shes altering course heading for the catapult
maintain pursuit open a channel
no response
try to beam her out
shes done something to alter her biosignature i cant get a lock
target her propulsion and weapons fire
our targeting scanners are out of alignment
she must have done it before she took off
shes charging weapons
keep trying
doctor to captain janeway
report
seven downloaded too much data into her cortical implant
shes trying to make sense of more information than she can process
understood beam me onto the delta flyer
im going with you
no i have a better chance of getting through to her alone
this isnt part of your mission is it
is it part of yours
good luck
energise
captain
you came here hoping to stop me youll fail
turn this ship around thats an order
your orders are irrelevant im no longer under your command you deceived me
there is no conspiracy there is no maquis rebellion the federation isnt planning to invade the delta quadrant
i realised that because i finally uncovered your true objective
and whats that
me stardate 32611 the federation sends my parents to study the borg collective they know my family will be assimilated that was their intention stardate 48317 voyager is sent to the delta quadrant with orders to retrieve me when they reach borg space captain janeway negotiates an alliance with the collective in exchange for information regarding species 8472 they agree to give her seven of nine stardate 51030 janeway extracts the implants from my body to remove any knowledge i have of her agreement with the borg stardate 53329 captain janeway finalises plans to use the catapult to deliver seven of nine to the alpha quadrant where starfleet will dissect and analyse the drone to gather tactical data to fight the borg i wont allow you to complete your mission if necessary ill destroy the catapult and myself
youre right seven there is a conspiracy here but i believe its a conspiracy of one ive got a theory of my own your modified alcove threw your synaptic patterns into chaos and your mind cant make sense of all the information so youre generating theory after theory in an attempt to bring order to that chaos
your reasoning is flawed my alcove is functioning perfectly
what about you youre not a drone anymore you cant always predict how borg technology will affect you you should be in sickbay not behind that forcefield let me help you
no i dont believe you
of course you dont anything i say gets woven into your paranoid conspiracies but you should believe me seven because ive never lied to you and im not lying to you now you have to put your doubts aside and trust me stardate 51030 seven of nine is severed from the hive mind the captain tells her not to resist that shell learn to accept her humanity seven complies and slowly begins to embrace her individuality does she regret that decision stardate 51652 the captain encourages seven to develop her social skills seven insists its a waste of time but after further requests she pursues it and begins to develop her first human friendships did janeway lead her astray stardate 52840 the captain orders seven to study her parents journals seven claims theyre irrelevant but eventually she reads them and rediscovers part of her own past stardate 52841 for the first time seven tells the captain thank you
it was stardate 52842 oh six hundred hours in the mess hall we had just finished breakfast
my mistake stardate today janeway beams aboard the delta flyer she reminds seven of the bond thats grown between them seven lowers the forcefield and she decides to come home all im asking is that you trust me again
delta flyer to voyager two to beam out
guess who assimilated three books and ten reports in two days
naomi wildman
thats correct are you taking your new alcove apart
yes
why
my attempt to download voyagers database failed
maybe you can fix it
the alcove functioned within expected parameters unfortunately i did not three books and ten reports is impressive but quantity is less relevant than quality you must be able to interpret the data and enjoy the process regardless you require activities other than assimilating books and reports a game of kadiskot for example
when
go to the mess hall and set up the board ill join you when im finished
i heard the strangest rumour today apparently the captain and first officer almost came to blows
mutiny
first officer walked the plank so i heard
i dont believe a word of it
me neither
seven was malfunctioning we dont have that excuse
youre right weve been through too much to stop trusting each other
you didnt poison the coffee did you
not any more than i usually do
just a minute ill ill be right there
im coming im coming deanna
hello reg
im so glad you could make it its wonderful to see you
would it be all right if i came inside
yeah of course of course come in come in is there something i can get you some er some coffee tea oh wait a minute dont dont tell me chocolate ice cream
you know me too well but just one scoop im watching my figure
why you you look lovely
you always knew how to flatter me would you like me to get it
get get what
the ice cream
right right the ice cream no no no no come in come in sit down make yourself comfortable
its a nice place
thanks one scoop of chocolate ice cream
did you just move in
no no ive been here er almost two years i just havent had a chance to unpack
is everything all right reg
of course why why wouldnt it be
to be honest you seem a little on edge
do i oh its just that im im excited to see you
im excited to see you too i think geordis a little disappointed i didnt invite him to come along
yes well i i was hoping to get get together with him too er before the enterprise leaves orbit but i just wanted to spend time with you first thats all right isnt it
of course it is i hear youve been working on the pathfinder project
well i i was er im not anymore
what happened
oh ah nothing really just got to be a lot of er pressure
well hello
neelix hes not used to company its not polite to eat our guests food if youre hungry just say so deanna neelix
neelix thats an unusual name maybe we should introduce him to datas cat spot i have a feeling you didnt ask me here to reminisce tell me whats wrong
ive lost myself deanna
lost yourself
in voyager ive become obsessed with voyager here you are on shore leave and what do i do i lure you into a counselling session
dont worry about that the important thing is im here now and i want to help
thank you
now start at the beginning
has it ever occurred to you that a tachyon beam directed at a class b itinerant pulsar could produce enough gravimetric energy to create an artificial singularity
i cant say it has
it occurred to me but my supervisors thought it was an abuse of midas
midas
the mutara interdimensional deep space transponder array
reg youre losing me
im sorry
the beginning
the beginning right well i suppose it all started in the holodeck doesnt it always
go on
well i i was running a few simulations
computer boost the gain on voyagers transceiver by twenty percent
transceiver gain is at maximum
apply a narrowband filter to the signal processor
filter engaged
voyager come in come in voyager voyager come in this is starfleet command voyager come in voyager
good good good now lower the filter band by point three kilohertz
reg what are you doing
oh ah er pete i i i was just er
yes running another simulation i can see that what about the transmitter diagnostics
right the diagnostics
you have finished them havent you
er almost
almost isnt good enough weve got admiral paris first thing in the morning
admiral paris
dont tell me you forgot
oh no of of of course not i i i just got the days mixed up
reg
computer end programme now that i think about it its a good thing that admiral paris is coming tomorrow we can brief the admiral on my theory
what theory
ive been going over the interstellar phenomena forecasts from deep space nine they are predicting er a class b itinerant pulsar will pass within four billion kilometers of the midas array in three days
you think the pulsar might damage the array
no no the shields will hold actually i was thinking we could use the pulsar to our own advantage
how
suppose suppose we instructed the array to direct a tachyon beam at the pulsar theoretically we could produce a gravimetric surge powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole we could establish two way communication with voyager
reg youre dreaming again
no no i really think this could work based on my simulations that
based on your last series of simulations we wasted six months trying to develop that transwarp probe
this this is different this
reg i really appreciate your imagination its what makes you such a valuable part of this team but im not about to tell the admiral that weve found a way for him to chat with his son because of some cockeyed theory that only exists up here now please finish those diagnostics
yes sir
and reg remember while the admirals here i do the talking
you do the talking understood
pete was only trying to look out for me but i was sure my plan would work i just couldnt give it up
burning the midnight oil
i i finished er the diagnostics sir
yes i know i looked them over good job now why dont you call it a day
i just er have a few more things to take care of
well see you tomorrow then oh reg why dont why dont you drop by tonight when youre through here
drop by
come to the house have some coffee angies sisters in from boston i er i think she might like you
i i dont i dont think i can er im spending the evening with er neelix
correct me if im wrong reg but neelix is your cat well if you change your mind
thanks ill try
but i couldnt leave not until id strengthened my case for accessing the midas array the meeting with admiral paris was only fourteen hours away and i hadnt come up with anything poring over the data wasnt helping i decided what i needed was er a little inspiration
computer activate hologrid mess hall scenario barclay eleven gamma
hey reg
warning the shark is circling
let the games begin
whatll it be reg
the usual
computer one milk warm
oh thanks harry
just trying to get on your good side so youll go easy on me tonight
you know what i always say  if you cant stand the heat
get out of the warp core
sit down lieutenant and give us mortals a chance to get even thats an order
if you insist commander but i think its only fair to warn you i have no intention of letting my winning streak come to an end now wheres er tuvok
he said its illogical to continue losing to a clearly superior player
oh thats too bad i love to watch that vulcan squirm now you all know the rules deuces one eyed jacks and suicide kings are wild five of a kind beats a straight flush every time
the man is ruthless
hes a killer
now come on guys you know it hurts me to see you lose after all you are my best friends
i hoped that the poker game would help calm my nerves so that i could get a decent nights sleep before the briefing but when i got home that night i couldnt keep my mind off voyager i needed to get back to the holodeck
that feels so good
therapeutic massage can be an effective treatment for insomnia lieutenant but we need to get to the cause of your sleeplessness if were going to find a more permanent solution
its just that every time i close my eyes my mind starts to race
can you be more specific
well i worry about the project have i explored the problem from every angle or is there something else i should be trying am i doing enough
hmm acute work related anxiety perhaps i should speak to the captain about reducing your schedule
something tells me shes not going to be able to help
you are an invaluable member of this crew mister barclay
thank you doctor its nice to be appreciated
turning in reg
yes sir
hey reg
for some reason i never slept in my apartment as comfortably as i did in my holographic quarters i suppose i felt more at home on voyager
good morning everyone
morning reg
youre awfully chipper
slept like a baby
then maybe youve got the energy to whip up one of your famous cheese omelettes
oh yeah im starved
im sorry guys i have a very important briefing at oh nine hundred just have time for coffee
er dont forget about tonight
remind me
you were supposed to teach me how to play velocity
no no way reg and i have a hoverball game scheduled
dont fight plenty of me to go around
reg im sorry to bother you again but im still having trouble with the warp core recalibration
its no problem ill stop by engineering later talk you through
thank you i really appreciate it
velocity hoverball warp core recalibrations reg i dont know how you do it
let you in on a little secret theres two of me
the delta quadrant sector 41751 grid nine voyagers doctor reported this as the ships position when his programme was briefly transferred to starfleet two years ago assuming theyre still on course for earth weve been able to extrapolate a range of likely trajectories estimating an average warp speed of six point two and accounting for various astronomical obstacles we can reasonably assume that voyager is now in one of these three sectors
can we contact them
as you know weve been working with the vulcans on the deployment of the midas array though were still in the testing phase we think it wont be long before we can use this technology to send signals at hypersubspace speeds a message that would normally take years to reach its destination could be received by voyager in a matter of days
impressive will they be able to respond
no sir but at least theyll know were still looking for them well send data on the hypersubspace technology and hope they can eventually use it to return the call
excuse me admiral paris
lieutenant barclay
im sorry commander its just that there may be a way to establish er twoway communication with voyager
now is not the time
its all right mister harkins let the man speak im all ears son
well er you see theres a er class b itinerant er pulsar er and we well as you probably know sir sir neutrino emissions ah oh what i mean to say is that with the array we could open an artificial er s a sing singularity
a wormhole
yes yes sir we could use it as a conduit to to talk to voyager
i cant give you high marks for clarity lieutenant but youve certainly got my attention is there any merit to what hes saying
mister barclay has a tendency to get ahead of himself sir unfortunately what hes suggesting is beyond our abilities
but you havent even
mister barclay
i know that i havent explained myself very well but with all due respect sir what do we have to lose by trying i think were forgetting that there are a hundred and fifty people stranded in the delta quadrant
i have a son on that ship lieutenant i havent forgotten that fact for a single moment
im sorry sir i i didnt er i didnt mean to
take the rest of the day off reg
but
that was not a suggestion
how did you deal with your feelings afterwards
what do you mean
well did you talk to commander harkins after the meeting apologise
well no i wanted to er fine tune my plan so i er just went right back to work
be more specific what exactly did you do
well i needed someone to er bounce ideas off of someone to help focus my thoughts
sounds reasonable i suppose you consulted with some of your pathfinder colleagues
well not exactly
you went back to the holodeck didnt you
theyre the only people that i can talk to
theyre not people
i know but they they help me with my work
poker massages sleeping in holographic quarters sounds more like escape than work
i cant concentrate if im not relaxed
cant you relax with your friends
friends
commander harkins invited you to his home you went to the holodeck instead
its not what youre thinking deanna this isnt a relapse of my holoaddiction
okay tell me how the holograms helped you with your work
well i talked to them about my ideas i worked out technical problems
i need specifics here people
take us through it again mister barclay one step at a time maybe itll spark an idea
weve got our itinerant pulsar weve got our interdimensional transponder array how do we get our wormhole
this one could keep us up all night
we know we can produce gravimetric energy but can we do it at levels high enough to create the singularity
were talking about a massive subspace reaction
maybe thats the problem
reg
maybe we need to think smaller
youre losing me
and how much bandwidth do we really need the average wormhole is huge but if we compressed the datastream
we wouldnt need a conduit anywhere near as big
whats your idea
a microwormhole
impressive
youve outdone yourself this time reg
ill still need er help with the details
put together a team use whatever resources you need
a power ratio of approximately sixty terawatts should do the trick
you think thats enough
should be but then we have to compensate for gravimetric interference
and how do we do that
i was thinking what if we applied a narrowband filter to the transponder signal
barclay strikes again
whats going on here
commander
whos your friend reg
yes arent you going to introduce me
computer delete characters
i thought i told you to go home
i was er working
you call this work youve created holograms of the voyager crew
oh it it it its not what you think its an interactive er diagnostic programme i designed it to help me solve problems
how long have you been in here
since the briefing
the briefing ended ten hours ago
i i know that i embarrassed you in front of the admiral and im im sorry i wanted to refine my idea so that i could present you with a specific plan and ive done that pete you were right about the wormhole idea being too expansive so ive ive scaled it back
all the extra time youve been putting in if i checked the holologs would i find youve been spending those hours in here
well not not all that time
how much of it
maybe er twenty or thirty hours a week
dont you think thats a little excessive
not if it helps us contact voyager
before i brought you onto my team i reviewed your file youve struggled with holoaddiction before from where i stand it looks like youve had a relapse
i know it it may look that way
i think you need counselling
what i need is for you to pay attention to my ideas
i should have been paying more attention to your behaviour i thought i was being a friend by giving you some leeway i didnt realise how involved youve become with voyager
is it really so wrong do you have any idea what it must be like for them to be stranded sixty thousand light years from home do you have any idea how lonely that must be
im sorry reg but until you get some help youre off the project
you you cant do that
youve given me no choice this hologrid and the lab are officially off limits now go home
i wont leave not until youve heard what i have to say
reg dont make me call security
what is it nicole
hes still here
you told him i have a meeting scheduled at fifteen hundred
yes sir he wont go away
send him in
yes sir
admiral er thank you thank you for seeing me
youre frightening my secretary mister barclay you have five minutes
five minutes right
sit down
er first first i i want to apologise for speaking out of turn yesterday its its only because i i i care so much about voyager
yes commander harkins has informed me about your attachment to the crew i understand youve been spending time with a holographic recreation of my son among others frankly i find that rather disturbing
well i understand how how you could see it that way but er that does not negate the fact that i have a plan for communicating with voyager
commander harkins doesnt seem to think your plan is viable
i have refined the idea ive simplified it all im asking for is a chance to try and if im right it could mean a chance to talk to tom
in my opinion commander harkins removed you from the project with good cause and thats his prerogative i wont let my personal feelings interfere with starfleet procedure
i ive broken protocol and i should be punished but the crew of the voyager shouldnt be and neither neither should you i just need access to the lab for one more day after that if i er if im wrong ill resign my commission
ill order a review of your findings if its concluded your ideas are valid ill instruct commander harkins to pursue it
but im the one who knows the
thats the best i can do mister barclay good day
so the meeting went well
no no no it didnt not at all
the admiral said hed review your findings
dont you see he was just trying to get rid of me just like harkins
try to relax
now you understand why i need your help
yes i do
you you have to call the admiral in your official capacity as a starfleet counsellor and tell him that i am psychologically fit to return to work
i cant do that
why not
look at yourself youre experiencing acute anxiety sleeplessness paranoia you did what you could now its time to let starfleet worry about voyager we need to take care of you
there is nothing wrong with me
you said yourself youve become obsessed with voyager
what if i have if an obsession helps me to do my job better its a sacrifice i am willing to make a little instability in exchange for contact with a stranded starship isnt voyager more important than my psychological condition
voyager is important but so are you
that ship that crew theyre all i have
tell me why that is
ever ever since i i left the enterprise things havent havent been the same its as if i lost my family
so you created a new family on the holodeck only theyre not real
i didnt know how else how else to cope
do you remember when you first came aboard the enterprise you had trouble fitting in didnt you but after a while you started to make friends you can learn to do the same thing here on earth
oh i i dont know how
well work on it together
youre scheduled to depart tomorrow
ive decided to ask captain picard for a temporary leave of absence to spend some time with an old friend
oh deanna you you you dont you dont have to do that
try and stop me
im sorry neelix i have to leave no no you cant talk me out of it

im ready for my lesson
ive concluded that teaching you to sing is an inefficient use of my time
but i ive been ive been practicing
in your case practice is irrelevant your vocal chords are incapable of producing basic diatonic tones not to mention your rhythmic shortcomings
i sound so good in the sonic shower
perhaps you should confine your efforts to that location astrometrics to the bridge
go ahead seven
ive detected what appears to be a microwormhole at coordinates one nine four point six by three five
a microwormhole
i believe a message is being transmitted through it on a starfleet emergency channel
lets hear it harry
starfleet command to uss voyager come in voyager
try applying a narrowband filter to the signal processor
do you hear me this is lieutenant reginald barclay
thats it whoever this barclay is he stopped transmitting
the microwormhole is collapsing at a rate of point two percent per second
that doesnt give us much time
to do what
to send a message back through and hope mister barclay is listening
it should have worked i dont understand why it didnt
there you are ive reviewed mister barclays plan i think its worth an attempt
hes already tried sir without your authorisation it didnt work
im sorry to hear that
so am i sir i appreciate your confidence in me but i i dont deserve it
what would you like me to do with him admiral he broke into the lab accessed the midas array and resisted arrest
youve put me in a difficult position son i was hoping that wed be able to
were receiving a transmission
from where
coordinates three four three point six by two seven
the wormhole
starfleet command come in
voyager
reg give me a hand clearing up the signal
lower the filter band by point three kilohertz
this is captain kathryn janeway do you read me
i think shes talking to you
captain
this is lieutenant reginald barclay at starfleet command
its good to hear your voice lieutenant weve been waiting a long time
for this moment
the feeling is mutual unfortunately the microwormhole is collapsing we have only a few moments
understood we are transmitting our ships logs crew reports and navigational records to you now
acknowledged and were sending you data on some new hypersubspace technology
were hoping eventually to use it to keep in regular contact and were including some
recommended modifications for your comm system
well implement them as soon as possible
theres someone else here who would also like to say something
this is admiral paris
hello sir
how are your people holding up
very well theyre an exemplary crew your son included
tell him tell him i miss him
and im proud of him
he heard you admiral
the wormhole is collapsing
i want you all to know were doing everything we can to bring you home
we appreciate it sir keep a docking bay open for us
we hope to see you
thats it theyre gone
you did it reg im sorry i doubted you
why the long face mister barclay
because because its over sir
no lieutenant id say that project voyager is just beginning thanks to you
anyone know this barclay
i took the liberty of reviewing his personnel file hes had a rather colourful career not to mention an unusual medical history hes recovered from a variety of maladies including transporter phobia and holoaddiction
well whatever his problems he certainly came through for us
starfleet should give him a promotion
i finished analysing the data mister barclay sent the hypersubspace technology is promising i believe we can look forward to future communications with earth
well that calls for a toast
care to do the honours tom
to my dad its nice to know hes still there and to the newest honorary member of the voyager crew reginald barclay whoever you are
here here to mister barclay
congratulations
well im not not sure i deserve congratulations
why not its quite an accomplishment
i i couldnt have done it without your help
what did commander harkins have to say about it
well i think i think he was pleased
why wouldnt he be youre quite a catch
well not everyone would want a sisterinlaw to date someone with my history
its a new era so tell me all about the lucky lady i want details
well her name is hope
youre kidding
no and and and she loves cats
good morning tom
good morning grace
so where you heading
sullivans care to join me
ah i wish i could but theres a bit of a problem
oh really
well you see tommymeboy the good lord blessed me with a fine wife ill never forget the day i met her i was on me way to the fair in dooleen or was it kilkee theres some fine trout fishing to be had in kilkee this time of year
who said anything about trout
timothy ryan god rest his soul he was one for the trout the poor mans been dead a fortnight some say he had the croup but dont you believe it the widow moore gave him the evil eye
and your point
me wife and i well weve hit a bit of a rough patch a better woman never walked the face of the earth
she threw you out again
with nothing but the clothes on me back
how much
a shilling or two should suffice
keep the change
god bless you tommymeboy
harry werent you supposed to meet me at sullivans
sorry i got distracted by the er scenery this is maggie
weve met could you excuse us
charmed to have met you harry
charmed whats the hurry
a word to the wise stay away from maggie ohalloran shes promised to a pig farmer with a very large rake
does she have a sister
wooden teeth
nothing an adjustment to the holomatrix wouldnt fix
no no im not changing a thing fair haven is perfect just the way it is
tommy boy you forgot the leprechauns
no no leprechauns no aliens no starships i want this to be a place where the crew can unwind
morning lads
ah heard any good confessions lately
doctorpatient confidentiality mister paris
harry hasnt seen sullivans yet you care to join us
dont mind if i do ill need to leave no later than thirteen hundred hours
medical emergency
not exactly im working on my homily for sundays mass and i expect both you sinners to be in attendance
hes kidding right
you wanted authenticity
everybody place your bets
three bob on liam
three bob it is
five shillings on liam
youre going to hurt harrys feelings
very well two shillings on mister kim and ill pray for a miracle
excuse me father but im needing a bit of counsel
im off duty right now
but ive broken the fifth commandment again
say ten our fathers and call me in the morning
gentlemen
come on come on mister kim show him what for you can do it
whatll it be
im looking for some friends of mine
were all friends here
well then have you seen tom paris
hes right over there with young harry poor sod im afraid no ones whipped liam in three years
theres a first time for everything
an optimist are you
a realist
come on ensign try try
come on me boy push push
im trying
come on try harder
you got him you got him
youre losing
what in gods name come on liam push
yes yes
i knew you could do it ensign
so this is the programme ive been hearing so much about
welcome weary traveller
you have outdone yourself this time everything is authentic except for one tiny detail
oh
the harp on the sign its backwards
oh everybodys a critic
as i recall the captain is quite an aficionado of irish history
i hate to break up the party but we have some business to attend to theres a neutronic wavefront approaching class nine
class nine
sorry boys duty calls
ah wavefront now what in the name of god is that
er a wee bit of bad weather
oh
borg classification three four seven nine two particle density anomaly
whered it come from
i believe it was formed by the collision of two neutron stars the wavefront is travelling at a velocity of two hundred thousand kilometres per second and it extends for three point six light years
how long before it hits
approximately fifteen hours
were already feeling its effects the neutron radiation is disrupting plasma flow we cant jump to warp
impulse power wont be enough to outrun that thing
then well have to ride it out well generate an inverse warp field and drop anchor that should protect us from the turbulence
what about the radiation itll only get worse
have the doctor prepare inoculations for the crew go to yellow alert tom belanna get started on converting the warp core
yes maam
lets batten down the hatches
captain
just burning the midnight oil
midnights come and gone
then its time for a break
do you mind
i could use the company this approaching wavefront is bringing back some unpleasant memories
how so
you know i grew up on a farm in indiana we used to have some terrible thunderstorms during the summer months at the first bolt of lightning id bolt under the bed
we had some pretty nasty weather on talax too i always enjoyed a good ion storm
give me clear skies any day
now that you bring it up i am concerned with keeping up morale over the next few days the crew is not used to sitting still
suggestions
everyone seems to love fair haven i was thinking we might initiate an open door protocol on the holodeck keep the programme running twenty four hours a day let people come and go as they please
permission granted fair havens just become our port in the storm
im heading down there myself if youd like to join me theres a charming little inn called the ox and lamb the owner offered to share some of his recipes
no thanks i still have work to do
okay
whatll it be
a cup of tea would be nice
i just made one cream
please
so what brings you to fair haven miss
kathryn im just passing through on my way home
how long have you been on the road
five years almost six
you must be homesick
no sometimes thank you
cead mile failte
translation
a hundred thousand welcomes its an old irish saying were all friends here
i had an aunt who used to have a saying like that a stranger is a friend you just havent met yet
definitely irish
she had an irish temper too she and my uncle had a place not far from here in county clare
ah then youre closer to home than you think katie oclare
you know its later than i thought and ive kept you long enough
oh no stay awhile didnt your auntie teach you that its impolite to leave without playing a game of rings
i really cant but thanks for the tea
afraid youd lose
i rarely lose
prove it
one game
ill set them up
another ringer
and im not surprised you stepped over the beer stain
i did not
you did too by half a boot and then you moved back hoping i wouldnt notice
these boots are half a size too large so in reality my toes never crossed the line your turn
for luck
getting sweet with the rings isnt going to help you
well see damn
devil wont help you either
well maybe rings arent my forte after all would you care to arm wrestle
thats not a womans game katie you could get hurt
im stronger than i look
ah thats quite a grip you have
not bad yourself
i couldnt help but notice that you have your leg braced against the bar
well how else do you expect me to win
will we call it a draw
sounds good to me
shall we run a foot race down to the station and back its good to make a new friend you have a nice way about you
flatterys the food of fools
another pearl of wisdom from your auntie
no jonathan swift
swift never heard of him
he was an author
i was never one for reading
thats too bad some of the greatest writers in the world are irish
well they say that doctor gilroy has a library of books and well next time i see him ill ask him can i borrow one or two
good morning
good morning oh my god will you look at the time frannie come here theres someone i want you to meet katie oclare this is my wife frances
pleased to meet you
i hope michael hasnt been bending your ear all night long
my ear my elbow
we were arm wrestling
such a gentleman
thank you very much for your hospitality and now i really must be leaving
and er drop in again before you leave town
i will
if you experience any dizziness report to sickbay immediately
thank you
good morning gentlemen
i believe its afternoon oversleep
holodeck
fair haven
welcome weary traveller
even i have to admit mister pariss latest effort is quite a tour de force
ooh high praise from a hologram
oh i was thinking captain now that weve got this open door policy maybe i could expand fair haven into holodeck two it would give me some room to create the seacoast
by all means
speaking of revisions i was hoping i could give my character a more active role in the period youve created the village priest was the most prominent member of the community held in the highest regard
thats a great idea doc we could send father mulligan on a retreat to a nearby monastery where he takes a vow of silence and never speaks again
try it and youll be saying hail marys till saint patricks day
time
thirty seconds
lets see it
all hands this is the captain secure your stations and brace for impact
weve cleared the leading edge turbulence is decreasing shields are holding
damage
weve got a ruptured plasma conduit deck nine
send a repair team maintain yellow alert lets hope that was the worst of it
computer display fair haven character michael sullivan adjust his parameters to the following specifications give him the education of a nineteenth century third year student at trinity college
modification complete
now access the characters interactive subroutines make him more provocative
specify
give him a more complicated personality
specify
more outspoken more confident not so reserved and make him more curious about the world around him
modification complete
good now increase the characters height by three centimetres remove the facial hair no no i dont like that put some back about two days growth better oh one more thing access his interpersonal subroutines familial characters delete the wife
modification complete
pleased to meet you mister sullivan
are you ill commander
i am experiencing a slight loss of equilibrium and some gastrointestinal distress
space sickness
unlikely i am not prone to that condition
perhaps you should go to sickbay
ill be fine
im telling you we should add more fog
fog is depressing
its authentic
its dangerous
all right we could add a lighthouse
its fair haven harry sunshine
tuvok what do you think irish sea coast fog or no fog
i have no opinion
he hasnt visited our little paradise yet
nor do i intend to
i think youd like it commander its a great place to meditate
imagine yourself sitting high on a bluff overlooking the ocean the salt air the rhythm of the waves rising and crashing against the rocks a tiny fishing boat bobbing on the water below up and down up and down
i get the idea ensign thank you
mutton creamed cabbage or blood pudding
explain
im preparing a traditional irish meal at the ox and lamb this afternoon and i can not decide on a main course
blood pudding you cant lose
that was my first choice too but replicating the lambs intestines it it could be tricky and every time i try to heat the blood it coagulates in the milk
if youll excuse me i think i will consult the doctor
excuse me maam have you seen michael sullivan
oh you might try the pub
i just came from there
oh then hell be at the train station
yeah
thank you
sure
excuse me sir is the train to galway running on time
um im afraid youve just missed it have a seat wait for the next one do you know jane eldon
eldon no ive never met her
id be terrified if you had shes been dead seventy years no i was er i was thinking about her poetry its too pastoral for my taste dont you agree
im not familiar with her work
really well what about sean gogarty they have similar rhyming schemes
youve some catching up to do well im here every afternoon you should join me sometime i tried talking poetry with seamus but all he can do is recite limericks
id love to strange place to read though
not at all i love the sound of the trains coming and going it gets me thinking about places id like to visit have you travelled much yourself
as a matter of fact but theres one place i havent been yet castle odell
its a steep climb but from the top of the battlement you can see all the way to dublin wed better be moving
they say when the sun goes down the king of the faeries reclaims the castle
maybe hell invite us to supper
eh youll be dining alone without me one taste of the faeries banquet and youll never return to this world
oh dont tell me you believe those stories
believe no but i do respect them can i ask you something katie
please
have you a man waiting for you at home
no
are you looking for one
why do you have somebody
in fair haven not unless you fancy a pig farmer
oh not my type
what about a barkeeper who reads poetry in strange places
captain i thought that was you
just getting in the spirit
i can see that i dont believe weve met
sullivan michael sullivan
chakotay
thats a fine tattoo are you off a ship
you could say that
were on the way up to the old castle youre welcome to come with us
thanks but er im meeting neelix at the ox and lamb you two have fun
is it my imagination or did he call you captain
did he
looks like the worst is yet to come
commander
i just came from astrometrics sevens found an increase in the neutronic gradient at the trailing edge of the wavefront its going to be a rough ride when it hits
weve still got two days start working on a new shield modulation
yes maam
that could explain my recent space sickness vulcan physiology is highly sensitive to neutronic gradients
youd make a good barometer tuvok every time you get queasy we go to red alert
thanks for your report commander
dont mention it hills most green hearts unseen
yes jane eldon catching up on a little reading
those hills and hearts wouldnt happen to be in ireland
you can wipe that smirk off your face its not what you think
i wasnt thinking anything but now that you mentioned it
i have an interest in irish culture
its understandable theyve produced great writers for hundreds of years not to mention great bartenders
hes a hologram
i couldnt help but notice he seemed a little taller than the last time i saw him
yes i made a few modifications
in the interest of irish culture
exactly
you seemed embarrassed when i ran into you there was no reason to be it was nice to see you having a little fun
he is rather charming isnt he too bad hes made of photons and forcefields
i never let that stand in my way
the boys are getting tired
them or you
faster boys
computer remove all characters except for michael sullivan
can i ask you something katie
please
would you mind if i kissed you
i might even kiss you back
theres no point in waiting any longer is there
oh i think ive waited long enough
is there something wrong
no
computer recycle
come in
i thought youd like to know weve organised a rings tournament tonight at sullivans
thanks neelix but i have work to do
the doctors going to sing something called danny boy and mossie donegans promised to bring his talking pig
well lets just say id rather stick to reality right now
nineteen hundred hours if you change your mind
thank you
saints preserve us
i possess superior handeye coordination
thats not all thats superior the lily and the rose are staging a competition in your face
clarify
the fullness of your lips and the paleness of your cheeks its enough to make a man faint
then in that case perhaps we should sit down
i dont believe it
its called oldworld charm harry
whatll it be gentlemen
nothing for me temperance is a virtue
wheres michael
over there
thats strange i programmed him not to drink
must be a glitch in his subroutine
are these seats taken
sit anywhere you like
vile its been fifteen years since i touched the stuff
you making up for lost time
i was hoping it might ease the pain
are you in discomfort
agonys more like it how could you do this to me lord why dont you ask him youve got his ear dont you
well
three days the happiest three days of my life i was a fool to think she felt the same i was such a fool
aw sit down sullivan
shut your mouth man or ill shut it for you
oh you will will you
hey hey take it easy why dont you tell us what happened
we we spent a perfect day together by the lake i drifted off to sleep and when i woke up she was gone where is she tom
who
katie oclare who else
katie oclare
your friend
are you sure you didnt misinterpret her interests i mean were all friends here maybe she was just being friendly
are you calling me a liar
no no not at all
i thought katie and me were in love
i may have to do some reprogramming
whats the matter you dont think im good enough for her
no i i didnt say that
well tell me where shes gone
i dont know
well i think you do
gentlemen please love thy neighbour
lets see i remember trying to reach the holodeck controls then er somebody grabbed my leg
maybe it was the talking pig
if it was he had one hell of a left hook
whats all this
im afraid theres been some trouble in paradise an altercation in the pub this afternoon several crewmen were injured nothing serious
arm wrestling get out of hand boys
not exactly
it was michael sullivan captain he was  looking for someone
why dont we take a little walk
let me guess that someone is me
i dont mean to pry captain but weve got a brokenhearted hologram who believed that the two of you were in love
oh i was sure hed be on to the next lass by now i hope hes all right
far from it the fight spilled out onto the street before long hed climbed up a tree and began shouting your name mister neelix managed to talk him down
it could be a malfunction in his behavioural subroutines
ive already checked that his subroutines are fine but i did notice youd made quite a number of alterations to his programme
minor improvements
to make him more appealing
youre starting to pry doctor
i apologise for overstepping my bounds but im worried about you michael sullivan is a hologram his broken heart can be mended with the flick of a switch your feelings however are a little more complicated
im not going to be climbing any trees if thats what youre worried about
if you decide you want to talk ive been hearing a lot of confessions lately let me know
you want a confession doctor all right ive become romantically involved with a hologram if thats possible
tell me what happened
well you know the story girl meets boy girl modifies boys subroutines
did you have intimate relations
thats none of your business lets just say it was a memorable three days
i dont see the problem
dont you michael sullivan is exactly my type attractive intelligent we share the same interests and if theres something i dont like i can simply change it
ive noticed that humans usually try to change the people they fall in love with whats the difference
in this case it works we had a picnic by the lake yesterday afternoon michael drifted off to sleep his head was lying on my shoulder and i remember thinking this is close to perfect then he began to snore did i nudge him with my elbow hoping hed roll over and stop did i whisper in his ear to wake him no why bother when i could simply access the computer and alter his vocal algorithms and thats exactly what i was about to do when i realised that everything around me was an illusion including him so i left i almost wrote him a note to say goodbye can you believe that a dear john letter to a hologram
i understand your trepidation but youre the captain you cant have a relationship with a member of your crew theyre all your subordinates so where does that leave you the occasional dalliance with a passing alien voyager could be in the delta quadrant for a very long time a hologram may be the only logical alternative
hes not real
hes as real as i am photons and forcefields flesh and blood its all the same as long as your feelings are real he makes a joke you laugh is that an illusion he says something that makes you think does it matter how his molecules are aligned did it ever occur to you that its not just a question of whether or not hes real
what do you mean
i think you should stop trying to control every aspect of this relationship romance is born out of differences as well as similarities out of the unexpected as well as the familiar
maybe i just needed to be sure that hed love me back
but isnt that the risk you always take hologram or not all i know is michael sullivan was up in that tree shouting your name
ive never been afraid of taking risks
then perhaps next time you should just let him snore
the neutronic gradients rising thirty million terajoules forty million
shields
holding
sixty million
torres to bridge the inverse warp fields destabilising were losing our anchor
acknowledged how long before were clear
at least another five minutes
thats about four minutes too long the gradients rising fast ninety million
stabilisers are offline
thrusters
no effect
shields are failing
how close are we to the perimeter
a thousand kilometres but were being pulled along with the storm
what have you got in mind
the deflector beam we might be able to cut a path through the wavefront
its possible but wed have to route all available power to the emitters
that wont be enough primary systems are down
then transfer all secondary power sources transporters replicators holodecks
captain theres not enough time to go through the hologrid shutdown sequence wed lose most of fair haven
do it
hull fractures deck six and seven
youve got all the secondary power tuvok is it enough
negative
siphon energy from the plasma network every last deciwatt
deflector beam active
were approaching the perimeter five hundred kilometres four hundred
deflector output is dropping
give him everything weve got life support environmental controls scrape the residual ions off the sonic showers if you have to
doesnt look good tom with this much photonic decay well be able to save five maybe ten percent
so much for the luck of the irish
it might be easier to start from scratch
it wouldnt be the same its like trying to rewrite a novel after the only copy of the data file has been deleted all the details the nuances theyre all gone
morning lads
hey seamus
looks like a storm brewing
a storm
heading in from the west could be a big one
oh right
i dont suppose you could spare a shilling or two me wife and i made up last night and i wanted to buy her a new parasol
the grids destabilising wed better get started on those repairs
so what do we try and save the ox and lamb the church maggie ohalloran
theres someone i should talk to before we decide
come in
fair haven didnt fare too well
ill break the news to the crew
with your permission id like to try to reconstruct the programme
how long will it take
six or seven weeks harry tells me that we should be able to save about ten percent of the existing elements i thought you might have a suggestion or two
computer is fair haven character michael sullivan still intact
affirmative
activate him hello
you disappeared on me katie i woke up and youd gone
i had some thinking to do
are you done
yes im leaving fair haven
why
because
thats not a very good reason
the situation is complicated
another man
no
your friends they dont approve of me
they think youre charming
are you not ready to settle down yet
im as ready as ill ever be
youre not making any sense
no i guess im not
i have a feeling that you wont be forgetting us that easily fair haven has that effect on people but theres one thing i want you to know i love you katie
i might actually be passing this way in six or seven weeks maybe ill stop by the pub
see that you do
oh computer end programme wait i want to make one more modification to the character
specify
deny kathryn janeway any future access to his behavioural subroutines
modification complete
save programme
thats one planet that never showed up on the multiple choice exam
its gravimetric readings are similar to that of a collapsed dwarf star it also resembles a quasar in that it has a high rate of rotation approximately fifty eight revolutions per minute
shall we take a closer look
thats what were here for
tom put us in a high orbit
aye
our warp drive is offline
why
unknown
back us off
our impulse engines arent responding
the use the auxiliary thrusters
were in some kind of gravimetric gradient its pulling us toward the planet
the new one is brighter than tahal or any of his brothers in the sky
what does he want from us
to answer that we must learn the nature of this god we must understand the reason for his arrival you were making an offering to tahal
i placed the firefruit on his altar then the ground shook i looked up and the new one was there
the firefruit where is it
the new one doesnt want tahal to have the firefruit make an altar for him as big as tahals the firefruit is only for the new one no more for the people it is his alone ground shaker light bringer take this today and every day accept our offering do not harm us
report
were in synchronous orbit fifty seven thousand kilometres above the planets equator
good work tom now lets see
youre patting the wrong guy on the back
explain
our thrusters went offline halfway through our descent and then we just stopped like we were caught in something
im picking up a strong tachyon field along the hull it could be whats holding us
seven of nine to the bridge
go ahead seven
please report to astrometrics theres something you must see
on my way chakotay
the planet has a tachyon core its produced a subspace particle field which runs between the poles voyagers arrival disrupted that field
it looks like the ships been caught in an eddy of some kind
its worse than that voyager seems to have become the planets third pole
the imbalance is affecting the outer crust ive picked up indications of highfrequency seismic activity
caused by our presence
possibly
does anybody live down there
the atmosphere is having a scattering effect on our sensors
is that vegetation
according to sensors yes
the tachyon core has created a spacetime differential between the planet and the surrounding space were watching the seasons change in a matter of seconds
for each second that passes on voyager nearly a day goes by on the planet
scan for inhabitants
i cant isolate individual lifeforms itll take time to correct for the spacetime differential
a couple of hundred years maybe if our orbit starts to decay voyager will begin to feel the effects of the differential and well begin aging hundreds of times faster than we would in normal space
unless we want to live our lives in the blink of an eye i suggest we find a way out of here
hows our warp core
the matterantimatter reaction is still active but this field were stuck in is raising hell with the nacelles until we break orbit warp drive is offline
without warp drive well never leave orbit
it does pose a bit of a problem doesnt it
maybe the key is to learn more about this planet in case were missing something
sensors arent having an easy time of it either
then lets modify a classfive probe for low orbit see what we can pick up configure the programme to scan along all subspace bands and set it for visual images every ten milliseconds
snapshots why do i get the feeling youre not just interested in tachyon fields
this could be the greatest anthropological find of my career if theres an intelligent species down there well be able to track their development not just for days or weeks but for centuries
watch them discover new and better ways of beating each other over the head
they wont necessarily follow the klingon model
as opposed to the human model itll take a few hours to make the adjustments
a few hours we might miss the rise and fall of a civilisation
so well watch the next one
oh oh protector
youre late
well the hill is steep and i im not as young as i used to be
more heat
there are grave matters of state here that cannot be delayed
protector what exactly are you doing
im sending him a letter
him sending who a letter
the ground shaker the light bringer
had you been more attentive to my lessons when you were a boy you would not be so gullible as a man
on the contrary you taught me well our ignorant ancestors believed every star was a deity you taught me how foolish that was superstition you called it
and thats exactly what it is
hungry
its bad fortune to eat the firefruit
according to whom our ancestors dont tell me you believe that old superstition perhaps we shouldnt completely ignore the old beliefs no matter how strange they may seem today ground shaker ground shaker isnt it possible the name was not given arbitrarily that this star is indeed responsible for knocking down our walls and making us stumble as we walk
oh yes i heard about that my condolences
you heard what
well that you stumbled in front of several important people during the last ground shake uh very embarrassing im sure
i did nothing of the sort
well my hearing is not as good as it used to be nor my memory either now what were we talking about
we were talking about ancient superstitions now i dont believe for a moment that the stars are gods but then what are they
a great mystery to which there is no answer
i believe the sky is full of people just like ourselves
what oh nonsense
prove me wrong i say each star encompasses a city and the ground shaker rules one of these cities a fellow protector if im correct then hell listen to me one protector to another your pen
i kelemane
kelemane
son of kelemane ruler of the good people of the land below you demand that you stop what youre
demand
would hope
ah better much better
would hope that you might consider putting an end to whatever it is youre doing that shakes our ground if this causes you inconvenience im willing to offer a recompense
a recompense
i await your reply
the next series of scans is coming through im downloading them into the display buffer
no doubt about it theres a city down there
elevated levels of carbon monoxide ammonium thats progress all right
theyve developed internal combustion technology since the last few scans look at those radial lines it looks like a system of roads
well one thing hasnt changed the geological disturbances that voyager seems to be causing the probe recorded half a dozen each month still no way to tell how severe they are
look at the amount of iron being used in that city thats ten times what youd expect to see in a culture at this stage of development
do you think theyre using it to support their buildings
if you lived on a planet that wouldnt stop shaking you might be doing the same thing if theyve reached this stage of industrial development they must be observing us
the probes impulse thrusters are starting to fail at its present altitude its been operating for over two hundred years its orbit is becoming decayed
initiate selfdestruct
it disintegrated in the upper thermosphere if they saw anything it just looked like a shooting star
any response to our transmission
nothing
no visual change either
surprised
send it again
the entire sequence how about just the prime numbers
youre tired
so are you
the prime numbers and the elemental constants then well stop
an acceptable compromise its not as if theyre going anywhere if they even exist in the first place
do you doubt that
i doubt everything
so you werent one of those children that had the entire series of sky ship friends
actually i had them all even the duplicates you couldnt walk into my home without tripping over a friend or two
not in our home my grandfather wouldnt allow it he told us that the sky ship was a palace where an evil protector lived he said that bad children were sent there to be punished at this point id be happy to see anything evil or not can you boost the signal
were already at maximum maybe if we switched to a different carrier wave to
if there is somebody up there they dont like us very much
any beings capable of building that sky ship could have destroyed our world long ago theyre not causing the tremors on purpose
what if theyre all dead
if you truly believe that why did you join this project
i doubt everything remember even my own doubts i hope someone is up there
so do i
if they wont respond to mathematics perhaps we should try a more personal approach here say hello
how could they possibly speak our language
theres only one way to find out
what what should i say
oh glad to meet you where are you from please stop shaking our planet
an ultra high frequency signal is being transmitted from the surface the modulation is unfamiliar its doppler component is
any signal from the surface will be accelerated when it reached our time frame the frequency would be thousands of times higher than normal
i will attempt to slow it down
again amplitude modulation its a radio transmission
its a numerical sequence
prime numbers theyre sending a list of prime numbers
followed by a sequence of mathematical constants and what appears to be a vocal modulation
slow it down again a little more
good friends in the sky ship i call you that hoping at least youre not enemies
theres nothing on our world that resembles your technology so we assume you came here from a nearby planet or a distant star our ancient mythology describes your arrival centuries ago coinciding with the tremors that continually shake our planet and destroy so many of our accomplishments i hope that was never your intention but the result is the same respond if you can or if you wish come down from your sky ship and visit us
well weve got to let them know were not doing it on purpose
inadvisable the prime directive still applies this transmission was made with primitive radio technology they are not a warp capable civilisation
to hell with the prime directive that man deserves an answer
dont forget the temporal differential that man has been dead for a long time
nearly a century by now
okay so we send a message to his great grandchildren ill gladly do the honours
ancient mythology that means weve already insinuated ourselves into their culture why not take the next step
first contact with a prewarp society
weve already made first contact they know were up here
theyve known for hundreds of years which means our presence has been tempered by time weve gradually become part of their mythos meeting us could throw that belief system into chaos
but were destroying their planet you heard him
a first contact face to face might give us information we could use to leave orbit that would stop the damage its worth the risk
we dont even know if an away team could survive the transition to their time frame doctor correct me if im wrong but the physiological stress could be fatal
for one of you perhaps but not for me my holomatrix would be unaffected
youd be going only as an observer youre not to make contact
i localised the source of the transmission to a subcontinent in the southern hemisphere
the central protectorate
how do you know that
ive been looking at the data from astrometrics sevens picked up a few of their local transmissions i can tell you the names of all twenty six states on the planet
and all the best places to eat
just about
so is this central protectorate a good place to send the doctor
probably judging from the transmissions they seem to have a tolerant society
hmm well just to be on the safe side ill find him an isolated spot
im giving you access to your facial and epidermal parameters you should be able to mimic the appearance of whoever is down there in a matter of seconds
what if theyre big purple blobs of protoplasm
then youll be the best looking blob on the planet im keeping you down there for three seconds doctor that will be almost two days in their time frame gather whatever data you can seismic charts meteorological records anything that might give us a clue about how to break orbit
understood
this will speed up the scanning rate of your programme allow you to make the transition
see you soon
energising
one two three
the confinement beam is destabilising
its the temporal field well have to recalibrate
every second hes down there hes in danger of being discovered
locking on again
weve lost him
im scanning within a one hundred kilometre radius of where we sent him nothing
he couldve moved across the continent by now or to the other side of the planet
increasing radius to one thousand kilometres
chakotay to seven of nine
go ahead commander
have you picked up any information regarding opera houses or concert halls
the cultural centre of the state runs along the shore of the eastern lake
got him belanna stand by for the coordinates
acknowledged
ive reinitialised the confinement beam its holding
locking on
captain lieutenant i thought id never see you again
are you all right
oh ive had a few close calls over the years but all in all
years
its been over three but at least i knew you hadnt left me behind all i had to do was look up and there you were the brightest star in the sky
well what do they know about us
only that we arrived here centuries ago they blame us for the seismic tremors but everything else is pure speculation and let me tell you they like nothing better than to speculate about voyager doric would go on and on sky ship this sky ship that
doric
the owner of the building i lived in until the war started
there was a war
oh the neighbouring state decided to lob a few cannon shells at us our tactical air command responded and a new treaty was signed in a matter of weeks but not before my apartment was in ruins
oh so they have aviation technology
theyre hardly savages captain in fact theyre making great strides technologically thanks in part to voyager
what do you mean
from the moment our ship arrived in the sky theyve been trying to make contact our presence has encouraged invention religion science art even childrens toys theyre all variations on a single theme voyager mareeza even composed an aria based on the sky ship i sang the lyric
mareeza
she was my roommate three years is a long time captain one needs companionship
youll get no argument from me but did you learn anything that might help us break orbit
its all in here
meteorological records for the last three hundred years ive committed them all to memory some are inaccurate almanacs but the more recent ones include detailed seismic analyses
get that information to astrometrics see if you can find any pattern to the quakes might help us figure a way out of here
see you in sickbay ill download the data from your programme and well do a little cosmetic surgery too
lieutenant
unless you prefer looking like that
of course i completely forgot if some of the people on the planet had their way those weapons would be pointed at voyager luckily the ship is still out of range for now
i guess i cant blame them
theres something of a space race going on between the various states who can get to the starship first with a rocket
are we talking about a capsule with an astronaut or a missile with a warhead
i cant answer that but at their present rate of development we wont have to wait very long to find out
how does this sound the weird planet where time moved very fast and so did the people who lived there by naomi wildman thats what im calling my report for astronomy class neelix said i should choose a planet to write about so i picked this one
your title is verbose i suggest you try to condense it
the weird planet
better but it lacks precision the weird planet displaced in time
perfect
seven of nine to the bridge im transmitting my calculations directly to the helm
acknowledged
whats happening
the doctor brought back data regarding the planets graviton field were using it to realign our thrusters
thatll be great for my report
all hands this is the captain secure your stations and prepare to break orbit
brace yourself our altitude is increasing fifty metres sixty seven of nine to the bridge our attempt to leave orbit is increasing the seismic activity we must abort
agreed
is the planet okay
minimal damage along the equatorial coastline nothing serious
seven do you think well ever be able to leave
eventually
i hope so i need a way to end my report
orbital one to launch control were ready to ignite second stage propellants
proceed
secondstage propellants depleted
final stage ready
ready to ignite final stage propellants launch control we are awaiting your commands to proceed what was that
theres nothing wrong with the transponder
orbital one to launch control we are not receiving your orders
everything else is working perfectly ignite the final stage we have to proceed with the mission
final stage propellants depleted
initiate deceleration thrusters
thrusters active
watch your pitch angle
correcting
distance check
were in rendezvous range
rendezvous sequence locked in
moving into final position
distance check
were within scanning range
lets take a look
the scanners wont penetrate their hull
i guess well have to go inside
were not authorised to do that
our orders were to learn as much as possible about the sky ship thats my intention i saw something that looks like a transfer port it might be a place we can dock move in closer
wait wait
are you all right
a little disoriented lets keep going
i dont understand
her skin feels warm
it might be some sort of metabolic stasis but then why does it look like theyre just going about their business
this isnt right we shouldnt be here we were never meant to be here
try and stay calm
weve seen enough please we have to leave
youre the best pilot we have thats why youre on this mission this is no different than flying your favourite
oh its different
i cant argue with that another few minutes then well go back this looks like their command centre
this is not metabolic stasis
could the laws of physics be different here
maybe theyre just a little slower
whats wrong
intruder alert security team to deck one
captain im picking up a ship at docking port one it just appeared there
bridge to sickbay medical emergency
what can you tell me
the transition to our time frame was a little rough for them im afraid his colleague didnt make it
how is he
recovering lucky for him im as good as his family doctor after three years of poring over their medical journals i know as much about their physiology as i do yours easy
wheres trina
she didnt survive the transition im very sorry
transition to your time frame
you understand whats happened to you
im beginning to
voyager exists in the same spacetime as the rest of the galaxy your planet is different
so you really havent been watching us for centuries
actually we just got here and were hoping you can help us find a way to leave
so if what youre saying is true everyone i know everyone i knew is gone
thats correct
captain im an accomplished pilot thats why they chose me for this mission i dont have the courage of the others they made a mistake choosing me
i have to disagree for someone whose life has just been turned upside down i think youre doing fine
when i was a young child the toys hanging above my crib depicted the sky ship its the first thing i ever remember seeing even before my mothers face and now im the only one that knows its name voyager i suppose itll be the last thing i see as well
thats up to you i have no intention of keeping you here against your will the doctor spent some time on your planet collecting data that we hoped would help us find a way to leave orbit we need you to assist us in interpreting that information however the longer you stay on board the more difficult it will be for you to go home your culture is changing every second youre here by the time you go back you might find it more alien than ours
star of the night star of the day come to take my tears away make my life always bright its a childs prayer
to voyager
yes
i hope youre not disappointed
how often does your very first dream come true of course ill help you
the information i brought back is in voyagers database seven of nine has been trying to make sense of it shell welcome your assistance
mountain or lakeside
mountain of course dont tell me youre a lakeside supporter
you really were on the surface
how are they doing this season
not good five wins twelve losses
i dont believe it whos guarding for them
torelius
any relation to the torelius
his grandson
i saw the original defend for mountain in the playoffs against red river
that was before i was born
he would have gone into voluntary exile after a 512 season
this information is out of date we were far more advanced than this when i left i can help you correct it
very well
lets start with the geological data the seismic detectors back then were off by a variance of three point eight
a simple conversion will compensate for that
does every planet look like ours
none that ive seen your world appears to be unique
if were so out of step with everything else well never be able to explore space the way you have
youre a highly adaptable species your scientists will find a way to compensate for the temporal differential
theyd better do it before you leave without the sky ship up above them my people might lose interest in progress there wouldnt be anything left to reach for
perhaps theyll miss voyager so much theyll do everything they can to follow us
maybe so what was that
an antimatter implosion your world is experimenting with warp technology the sensors detected an early test another test six weeks later and a third more controlled each time theyre learning quickly  too quickly
what was that
unknown but our shields are down to eighty two percent sixty four percent
i dont know whats causing it theres nothing on sensors
janeway to seven of nine
go ahead captain
are you picking up
anything in astrometrics
the inhabitants appear to have developed antimatter torpedo technology
i believe were under attack
another direct hit shields at forty nine percent
captain i apologise for this attack they have no right
unfortunately theyve got every right
let me talk to them
weve already tried to hail them it doesnt look like theyre able to receive our transmissions
they still dont know about the time differential
a logical assumption shields down to thirty four percent
the torpedoes are being fired at three day intervals theyre making refinements each time increasing the detonation yield
captain isnt it time we returned fire
weve done enough damage to these people over the last thousand years
youve got to go back its the only way make them understand who we are you have the specifications of this ship your scientists might be able to use them to help free us at the very least get them to hold their fire
captain the transporters are offline
is his vessel still intact
the docking port hasnt been hit yet
good luck
this will accelerate your metabolic functions help you make the transition
thank you for everything doctor
it was a pleasure to treat a fellow citizen would you do me a favour
certainly
find out what happened to a boy named jason tabreez he lived in the central protectorate
jason an unusual name
yes he was my son
but youre a hologram
its a long story hes dead by now but perhaps you could discover what happened to him maybe he had children or grandchildren you could tell them about me
i will
orbital one to launch control please respond launch control please respond
who is this
pilot first rank gotanaretz
clear the channel or im going to report you to the command centre
is this launch control
im the weather coordinator for station zero zero four youre in violation of transmission regulations
please listen to me im trying to reach launch control
let me guess you finally decided to come home youre gotanaretz
gotanaretz yes now please transfer me to launch control
launch control became the tactical command centre fifty years ago youre dead
ive been inside the sky ship
then its a good thing you decided to leave theyre about to shoot it down
ive got to speak with them
tactical command frequencies are classified now get off this channel
if you ever wanted to report more than the weather now is your chance tell them to clear central lake of all traffic orbital one is coming in for a landing
shields at twenty three percent seventeen percent shields are down
what was that last one
a tricobalt device
what will they think of next
damage reports coming in imminent hull breeches on decks eight nine and ten life support is failing
our astronaut should have made it by now
based on his descent velocity he landed about ten minutes ago
thats a year and a half
then he must have failed
im picking up another launch two massive energy signatures
tricobalt devices
unknown
brace yourselves
were in some kind of tractor beam
captain if i alternate thrusters i might be able to break us free
no lets give our friends the benefit of the doubt
theyre pulling us away from the planet
weve broken orbit
try hailing them
its good to see you all again
looks like somebody down there listened to you
im sorry it took so long
now we can make first contact the proper way
unfortunately that wont be possible a temporal compensator it allows me to exist in your time frame without actually leaving my own but only for a few minutes im afraid itll be a while before my people actually join the rest of the galaxy
captain well be able to bring the warp drive back online in approximately two hours
very good thank you
i feel like im saying goodbye to an old friend
stay away
if you dont cooperate i cant treat you
when we agreed to be examined by this ships medical officer we didnt know that you were a primitive computer matrix
i assure you there is nothing primitive about me i am programmed to perform more than five million medical procedures
does that include bloodletting
no but ill be happy to add it to my repertoire
we are ready to return to our ship could you contact one of your superiors
doctor to the captain please report to sickbay
already on my way
the captain is coming here now if you want to talk to her you can have a seat
it is a very irritating programme
maybe we can disable its speech subroutines
youre not authorised to do that
how are our guests
their injuries are minor unfortunately i cant say the same for their lack of manners
doctor
what is the status of our ship
to be honest were having a little trouble understanding your technology
the problem is your technology interference from your antiquated scanning devices shut down our propulsion system
forgive us captain we live in a closed system we are not accustomed to interacting with other species especially inferior ones
well then i guess well leave the repairs in your superior hands
our injuries will have to be treated first is there someone other than this hologram who could help us
no one whos better qualified
very well
try to bear with our deficiencies just a little longer
this way please  ive been working on the railroad all the live long day ive been working on the railroad just to pass the time away
what is that
this a hypospray
no what you were doing
preparing your medication
no with your voice
you mean singing
singing
do it again
yes do it again
someones in the kitchen with dinah someones in the kitchen i know someones in the kitchen with dinah strummin on the old banjo and singing fee fi fiddly i o fee fi fiddly i o fee fi fiddly i o strummin on the old banjo
it is a unique mathematical variation
difficult to quantify
how do you suppose the algorithms are generated
maybe its a fractal
or waveform calculus
do you mean to say a culture as superior as yours has never heard music of any kind
there are other kinds of music
of course the little ditty i just sang is an early american folk song but countless cultures have produced thousands of types of music instrumental choral orchestral
what is the purpose of this music is it an encryption code of some kind
there is a mathematical component to music but primarily its a form of artistic expression
artistic expression
using sounds and images to convey ideas and emotions
why would anyone do that
well to communicate their feelings
cant they do that through speech
yes but music is much more expressive and entertaining
you mean to say that this music is recreational
it does have other applications as a matter of fact ive recently been doing some research into its therapeutic properties but yes primarily we use it for enjoyment
we you mean to say others aboard your ship are capable of producing this phenomenon
well maybe not with my level of expertise but there are quite a few members of this crew who possess musical skills
maybe we judged this culture too quickly
our database contains the works of thousands of musicians and composers if youd like i could download some selections for you
could you sing them for us
harry can you make sense of any of this
were picking up thousands of subspace transmissions all encrypted differently
between the satellites and the spacecraft its like navigating an obstacle course
with all this traffic the qomar might not even know were here
apparently they do we are being hailed
captain you now have the privilege of meeting prelate koru
welcome to the qomar planetary alliance
thank you prelate were looking forward to learning more about your culture
our civilisation is no doubt intimidating well do what we can to avoid overwhelming you during your stay
i appreciate that i understand were not as advanced as you but were fast learners and wed like to
we want to learn more about the algorithmic expressions you call music
were prepared to give you complete access to our musical database as well
your emergency medical hologram wed consider an exchange of technology if you give us complete access to this device
i believe hes made some recordings
no not recordings
how about a recital
recital
a live performance we can put together a programme of various styles of music
will the emergency medical hologram sing
hell be the star attraction
dio che nellalma infondere amor volesti e speme desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta
thank you youre very kind that was a selection from the opera don carlos composed by giuseppe verdi a towering figure in earths musical history another human musical form is called jazz which has flourished since the early twentieth century mathematically youll find the rhythmic structures quite interesting particularly the use of syncopation which is said to make the music swing you may also notice some fascinating trigonometric functions in the counterpoint but i suppose im going off on a tangent arent i
so without further ado i give you harry kim and the kimtones
we wish to hear the doctor
yes the doctor
doc theyre dying up there youve got to do something
pick up the tempo  that old black magic has me in its spell that old black magic that you weave so well those icy fingers up and down my spine the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine the same old tingle that i feel inside and then that elevator starts its ride and down and down i go round and round i go like a leaf thats caught in the tide
well if you like jazz youre going to love rock n roll it was one of the twentieth centurys greatest inventions
does the doctor sing rock n roll
i wouldnt say its his favourite genre
no hes more of an opera man
as am i
arent you one of the musicians
harry kim
vinka
welcome aboard voyager er if youd like to see the rest of the ship id be happy to give you a tour
maybe later i was wondering if you could introduce me to the doctor
congratulations doctor you stole the show
thank you captain but i cant take all the credit there was something in the air a certain magic it was one of those rare moments when audience and performer become one
doctor
prelate tincoo
i will introduce your singing to more of our people
im flattered
you will perform on our planet
id consider it an honour but youll have to negotiate the terms with my representative
i dont understand
i believe the doctor is referring to me prelate another concert would mean extending our stay when would you want to schedule the performance
as soon as possible
the doctor could perform in one of the lecture halls at the university
im not sure a lecture hall would meet the acoustic requirements
ill help you make whatever modifications you think are necessary
sounds like youve got yourself a booking doctor
id like to reproduce a backdrop which was used in a production of pagliacci at teatro de la scala earths most famous opera house
its beautiful
your taste in design is as refined as your taste in music
well replicate it for you
excellent but we still have the problem with the sight lines
whats wrong with the sight lines
if you consider the height of the average qomar its obvious that anyone seated in the back five rows will have an obstructed view
youre right they wont be able to see anything but the top of your head the glare could blind them
youll have to excuse lieutenant torres her appreciation of music is limited to a smattering of klingon drinking songs well have to increase the rake of the floor by five degrees
you really think theyre going to redesign an entire building just to appeal to your vanity
vanity has nothing to do with it lieutenant im concerned about my audience
we are prepared to make whatever changes the doctor thinks are necessary
thank you tincoowhile were at it lieutenant ill need some help with my wardrobe
im an engineer not a costume designer
id like you to make an adjustment to my mobile emitter that will allow me to make quick changes between songs
that sounds exciting
oh it will be i plan to segue from don juan to rigoletto in the blink of an eye it will be a triumph of
arrogance and selfabsorption just trying to help
your crewmates dont seem to appreciate your abilities
youve noticed that too
that must be very frustrating for you
you have no idea
well be starting in two minutes
id better get into costume
how do i look
you look perfect
i wish i had a subroutine to eliminate preshow jitters
i could help you add one to your programme
youre very sweet im just a little nervous
why
im about to expose your entire culture to music for the first time the responsibility is enormous
your performance tonight will be transmitted to hundreds of millions of people
is that supposed to help me relax
its time
report
i didnt order red alert captain
well someone did
the command originated in astrometrics
seven of nine to the captain ive found evidence that the qomar are attempting to sabotage voyager
on my way
what have you got
i believe the qomar are attempting to disable our comm system
how
by overloading it with millions of teraquads of irrelevant data
what do you mean by irrelevant
theyre transmissions all addressed to the doctor
precisely ive only been able to decipher a small fraction of them so far but they include invitations to social and scientific functions requests for personal encounters and cloying tributes to the doctors talents
computer stand down red alert this isnt sabotage seven this is fan mail
fan mail
people who admire performers are called fans
the word i believe derives from fanatic
exactly
why would the doctor inspire fanaticism among the qomar
music is new to them clearly theyre very excited about it
this glorification of the individual is irrational the doctor is merely reproducing the work of others why do his fans fixate solely on him
i suppose hes the embodiment of what they admire he can do something they cant that makes him special
perhaps but that doesnt explain their interest in the minutiae of the doctors life what does he do in his spare time to how many decimal places can he calculate pi this one wants to know his favourite quadratic equation
people have always fantasised about knowing celebrities personally i suppose its a way of making themselves feel more important
tuvok to janeway
go ahead
we have a security problem on deck two
on my way just think seven as personal friends of the doctor were the envy of millions of qomar
our efforts to accommodate them have gotten out of hand
i guess their interest in the doctor is greater than we expected
much greater i recommend we refuse all further requests for transport from the surface
agreed
and we should evacuate these visitors immediately theyre interfering with normal ships functions
tuvok when have functions aboard this ship ever been normal
dio che nellalma infondere amor volesti e speme
desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta
desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta
thank you for coming please accept this eight by ten by four singing replica of me
one at a time one at a time now please do not touch the doctors mobile emitter captain isnt this exciting
im not sure thats the word id use for it excuse me sorry excuse me
im sorry captain but youll have to wait your turn like everybody else
im not here for an autograph we need to talk
im glad youre enjoying yourself doctor but this is getting a little excessive
im only doing what i can to ensure that first contact with the qomar goes smoothly
does that include using our replicator reserves to create miniaturised versions of yourself
i would never do such a thing as a matter of fact the qomar have devoted an entire holoprocessing plant to manufacturing them for me
i see well in any case youve been neglecting your sickbay duties i havent received a report in three days
oh come now kathryn its not as though theres been a flood of medical emergencies
i wasnt aware we were on a first name basis
i i meant captain im sorry
oh thats perfectly all right doctor or do you prefer maestro
oh please either is acceptable
well then let me make it clear to both of you maestro youre finished for today doctor report to sickbay now
well well well if it isnt the wandering minstrel
whats the nature of their medical emergencies
apparently these two young ladies became dizzy and disoriented while waiting in line to see you
ill take over from here
be careful doc you seem to be hazardous to the qomars health
im vinka
im azen
hmm neither of you appears to be ill
we wanted to meet you in a more intimate setting
so we told your security officer we were sick
sickbay is for medical treatment only im afraid youll have to leave
but theres so much about you we want to know
yes youre a very stimulating hologram
if youre here for a replica theyre available in the mess hall
we dont want a replica
we want the full sized version
im flattered really but if you dont leave now ill have to call security
ill bet you can calculate pi to over a thousand digits
security to sickbay
have you ever balanced simultaneous equations
computer deactivate emergency medical hologram
here you are
i needed to find some peace and quiet
i want to show you something
whats this
you inspired me to create my own musical composition its based on the intersection of two fractals
tincoo this is extraordinary
i created it for you
i dont know what to say
will you sing it
im not sure i can its very complex the melodys lovely but some of these notes are well beyond the human vocal range
you are not human
no but
i can help you reconfigure your vocal processors
i dont think theres time my last concerts tomorrow
why does it have to be your last concert
because voyager is scheduled to depart
stay here with us
i have responsibilities on voyager
theyre a resourceful crew im certain they will find a way to compensate for your absence
im not so sure about that but even if they could voyagers the only life ive ever known the crew are my friends
but they dont appreciate you the way we do you know that you could have a new life here as a performer surrounded by people who admire and respect your talent
its very tempting but
by any mathematical standard the medical care of a hundred and fifty people cannot compare to the cultural enrichment of millions
you cant always explain things with an equation tincoo
what about the simplest equation of them all one plus one
i dont understand
the time you have been here has been the most stimulating of my life
i feel the same way about my time with you
then stay here with me
youre resigning your commission
ive been asked to stay
when this all started i thought you might have a little harmless fun and that youd be responsible enough to keep it in perspective i can see now that i was mistaken
this isnt harmless fun for me captain its a once in a lifetime opportunity to realise a dream
what about your duty to voyager
i take that very seriously but
youre a part of this ship
you sound as if youre talking about a piece of equipment
thats not what i meant
then shouldnt i be given the same respect as any flesh and blood member of this crew
every member of this crew is expected to fulfil his obligations
if harry kim met an alien woman on an away mission fell in love and decided to spend the rest of his life with her raise a family instead of continuing on this journey you wouldnt stand in his way
youre not harry kim youre an emergency medical hologram
then you do see me as a piece of technology
i have given you extraordinary freedom to explore your creativity to go on away missions to pursue personal relationships but enough is enough
why because you dont see me as an equal and you never have admit it
i am responsible for the medical needs of this crew if i let you leave what kind of captain would i be
every other starfleet officer chose to be here but i never had a choice until now ive given this crew everything for five years isnt it worth anything havent i earned the right to selfdetermination youve lost other systems before and always managed to find a solution youll manage without me
what about you will you manage without us
the qomar are a technologically advanced species i have no doubt that my maintenance requirements will be met
now which one of us is looking at you as a piece of technology im not talking about your maintenance needs im talking about your emotional needs youve got people on this ship who care about you
the qomar certainly seem to care about me
and when their tastes change
what makes you think thats going to happen
fame is often temporary
this isnt just about fame
oh really
if you must know theres a woman involved one who appreciates me in a way no one on this crew ever has
well it sounds like youll have everything you need
i believe i will
i hope so doctor because once voyagers gone you wont be able to change your mind
thats a risk im willing to take
as your captain i should refuse this resignation but as your friend it wouldnt be right to stand in your way
and you cant let the captain ignore her health shes notorious for finding any excuse to miss her appointments
ill send her weekly reminders
and when mister neelix becomes convinced that hes suffering from the toluncan ague which he does every flu season dont argue with him just give him a placebo
doc ive been assisting you for three years i know the drill
yes i suppose you do remember ill be within comm range for at least another month so if any problems should arise
doc youre not really going to do this are you
i would have thought you of all people would be glad to see me go
are you kidding who am i going to torment after youre gone
well ive got some more goodbyes ill check in with you before i leave
ill be here redecorating your office
hello seven i wanted to see you before i left ive downloaded some social lessons we havent covered yet there are seventeen new chapters
does one of them include instructions for ending a friendship
our friendships not over seven
it will be difficult to maintain if we never see each other again
i know itll be hard for you when im gone
i will adapt
yes i suppose you will but itll be hard for me
why youre getting everything youve ever wanted
i thought youd be the first one to understand my desire to grow as an individual
what i dont understand is why you cant do that aboard voyager
i feel ive accomplished all i can here oh theres the occasional medical mystery that challenges my programming but mostly its become routine and frankly i feel my talents are often taken for granted but when im standing on that stage performing and i see those rapt faces in the audience i feel i finally know what its like to be made of flesh and blood
you simply crave attention applause fan mail
what if i do
those things are irrelevant
to you maybe but to me it makes me feel appreciated even loved not for what ive been programmed to do but for who ive become
doctor youre receiving a transmission
route it to cargo bay two
doctor this is tincoo i want to see you immediately i have something to show you
what is it
a surprise i think youll be very pleased
ill beam down as soon as i can seven
you shouldnt keep your fans waiting
thank you for being so prompt
of course whats the surprise
i had an inspiration
another musical composition
better
whats this
ive solved all our problems
i wasnt aware that we had any
well you were reluctant to leave your ship and you also doubted your ability to sing my composition so i created a superior holomatrix
i dont understand
its simple now you can stay aboard voyager and he can sing for us listen
you cant make a superior singer simply by creating a new matrix
i beg to differ my vocal processors are enhanced with polyphonic sequencers i am not only capable of singing notes well beyond your limited range i can produce multiharmonic overtones through the use of amplitude vacilla
why did you do that
tincoo music is more than mathematics and i am much more than a programme with musical subroutines all of my experience all of my passion goes into every note that i sing when you listen to me when my singing moves you youre not just hearing notes youre hearing my artistry my soul
ive duplicated that too
i thought you wanted me
i did but now ive developed a far more sophisticated piece of technology
technology
i thought you would be pleased you seemed reluctant to leave your ship
you told me that the time you had spent with me was the most stimulating of your life
it was you inspired me to do my greatest work
but i thought
yes
that you and i
what
well i suppose im no longer on the bill tomorrow
of course you are it will be your farewell performance
of course
you wanted to see me
i need your clearance code to delete my medical database
you sure you want to do that if you give one of your fans a heart attack you wont be able to resuscitate him
i need more space in my matrix
for what
to expand my musical subroutines so that i can sing this composition
well im surprised youre asking me for help i recall your saying that my appreciation for music was limited to a smattering of klingon drinking songs
please belanna im asking you as a friend everything depends on this
whats so important about this composition
tincoo wrote it for me
your girlfriend
i wouldnt call her that
dont tell me you two had a fight
lets just say she doesnt appreciate me quite as much as i thought she did but that will all change once i perform this she will see me for the artist i truly am
look doc i dont know anything about this woman or why she doesnt appreciate you and i may not be an expert on music but im a pretty good engineer i can expand your musical subroutines all you like i can even reprogramme you to be a whistling teapot but if i do that it wont be you anymore
tonight i was planning to perform a song composed by one of your own people when you consider she heard music for the first time only a few days ago its an extraordinary accomplishment but although its a very beautiful composition im afraid its beyond my abilities so instead im going to sing an old neapolitan ballad its a song about lost love  sotto la grónda della torre antica una róndine amica a lo sbocciar del almondo or lui tornata ritorni tutti lanni sempre alla stessa data monti e mari sa varca per tornar solo amore quando fugenda lontana sper invano ma non torni piu sper invano ma non torna piu
thank you doctor that was fascinating it is because of your inspiration that i can now present to you a new and exciting musical programme a singing holographic matrix designed specifically to extend the range of humanoid vocal capabilities singing my own musical composition
come in
good morning captain
whats this
a formal request to be reinstated
so youve taken off your tails and put them between your legs
yes maam
you offended a lot of people who care about you
i know i was a fool im sorry and im willing to do whatever i can to rectify the situation starting with the deletion of all my musical subroutines
permission denied
but captain
no buts doctor youre expected to follow orders just like every other flesh and blood member of this crew resume your normal activities all of them
yes maam
dismissed
oh seven i didnt see you i suppose youve come to gloat
i have something for you
what is it
fan mail
delete it i dont want to read another word
then ill read it for you
seven
dear doctor i regret that your last performance was not as successful as youd hoped there are still those who appreciate your unique talents and admire you as an individual ill always consider myself your loyal fan
whos it from
its signed seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one
ive been working on the railroad all the livelong day ive been working on the railroad just to pass the time away cant you hear the whistle blowing rise up so early in the morn
who left their dirty plate in the replicator tom
it wasnt me
its a biohazard
take it easy well decontaminate you when we get back home
if i ever volunteer for a two week away mission again would somebody please confine me to sickbay
too much togetherness for you harry
nothing personal commander
to tell you the truth ive enjoyed our little junket together its given the four of us a chance to bond
the bonding stopped when the sonic shower went offline
thats all part of the experience the adventure think of the great explorers that came before us they survived without creature comforts
i wouldnt want to bunk with them either
now theres a sight for sore eyes
delta flyer to voyager were on our approach
weve kept a candle burning in the window for you
forget the candles break out the champagne
i take it the mission was a success
fifteen planets scanned in fourteen days weve got a cargo hold overflowing with dilithium ore
thats the kind of news i like to hear
the explorers return
welcome home
i should go away more often
im not going away for a long long time
homesick harry
lets just say im looking forward to a hot shower and a comfortable bed
dont forget to stop by sickbay for your checkup
checkup for what
away team protocol crew members are required to submit to a physical if the mission lasts more than two weeks now whos first
ill let you know in the morning doctor
why put off till tomorrow what you can do today commander mister paris
ive been working on a little surprise for you
oh naughty or nice
close your eyes
i like it already
come on so what do you think
oh a television set
circa 1956 i replicated the components but i assembled it myself this is the remote control you select what you want to watch by pressing this button
a slight problem there were no remote controls in the 1950s
i took a little poetic license
cartoon
i found them in the ships database
vacuum action mop mop dont stop
whats that
that is called a jingle according to the research i did they inserted them into the entertainment programs i know its confusing but i kept them in for authenticity i even replicated popcorn
everything is perfect except for one tiny detail
what
you forgot the beer
i can fix that
you didnt miss much while you were away the doctor gave a lecture on insects indigenous to the delta quadrant
ah ha
it was pretty boring until ensign farley started snoring and then no one could keep a straight face of course the doctor wasnt at all amused
ooo hockey
it was a shame that we had to cut the lecture short but the warp core overloaded and then the borg invaded and we were all assimilated
mmm hmm
you havent heard a single thing ive said have you
oh look at that
maybe this was a bad idea
this is eliot ness come out we dont want any trouble
were under attack stay down keep moving somebody cover me
we need a medic over herestay down move it stay low
i said hold your fire
i need a medic
keep moving
tom
tom tom  it must have been one hell of a dream
i was i was in the middle of a battlefield i was grazed right right here they always said television was a bad influence
how about a nice cartoon that should chase away the nightmare
no no i think ive had enough
it sounds like you had an anxiety attack
ive never been claustrophobic before
theres a first time for everything
do you know what could have caused it
lets see you spend two weeks on an away mission working eighteen hour days then as soon as you return to voyager you become ensign eager back on duty and raring to go
i had work to do there was a plasma leak on deck five
plasma leak or no plasma leak youre suffering from exhaustion im recommending you take the next two days off
but i
i can always make it three
you win i guess i am pretty tired
welcome back
oh hello
did you have a good trip
wonderful thank you
you look tired
do i just a little shuttle lag dont you have a geometry lesson you dont want to keep your teacher waiting
seven of nine assigned me a special project im supposed to build a tetragon but i have to use everyday things im not allowed to use a replicator i was thinking about using some vegetables from the airponics bay carrots and celery neelix
carrots and celery a good idea
will you help me
i dont think ill have time today
tonight
i dont think that ill have time then either lot of work to do
then why dont i help you whats cooking  ouch
let me see your hand
im okay
your hand weve got to get you to sickbay
im fine
sickbay
get down stay behind me
what
i said get down
im hit
someone help me with this please
keep moving move out to the left contingent
try not to move
get away from me
i can help you
i dont want your help
hold your fire i said hold your fire
were under attack sir
saavdra where is he
i think hes at base
lets move out
we were supposed to evacuate the colony not destroy it
that was before the nakan started shooting
theyre civilians
civilians with particle weapons
tuvok to commander chakotay
commander please respond
go ahead
we have a security breach in the mess hall
im on my way
tell them to call off the attack
put down your weapon neelix let us help you
stay away i wont let you hurt her get back
he appears to be hallucinating
neelix this is commander chakotay let naomi go no ones going to hurt her thats an order
no not until saavdras called off his attack
theres a back entrance to the galley if you can distract him perhaps i
i want to try something first neelix listen to me its okay saavdra ordered a ceasefire the colonys secure the battle is over
why do i still hear weapons fire
its just a few soldiers theyre celebrating the battles over
neelix please
ill protect naomi
how do i know you wont trick me
because im on your side i want to end this conflict as much as you do let her go its safe now the killings over
i gave him a mild sedative
any idea what caused the delusions
his norepinephrine levels are three times what they should be neurochemically speaking hes suffering from a form of posttraumatic stress syndrome
i dreamed i was fighting in an alien war the same war neelix seemed to be reliving
harry kim was in earlier he had an anxiety attack i havent spoken with mister paris yet
three members of the same away team did you run into any kind of trouble while you were gone
none the mission was by the book
your engramatic activities contradict that commander these are real memories not mere dreams or hallucinations
maybe you were abducted manipulated into fighting our memories have been tampered with before were going to retrace your mission start reviewing the delta flyers sensor logs see if you come up with anything unusual how long before neelix is back on his feet
i can wake him now if youd like
do it each of you seems to hold a piece of the puzzle lets see if we can start putting them together
i dont remember much just bits and pieces i dreamt i was on a planet in the middle of a battle i have no idea how i got there i cant remember
when i was in the jefferies tube i heard weapons fire screams people were screaming i got so frightened
of what
i i dont know
i remember getting shot
theres no evidence of a wound
if our memories were wiped our physical injuries could have been masked as well
do any of you recall who you were fighting
it was dark i couldnt see them very well
they were firing at us
the nakaa the nakana
the nakan they were called the nakan
right right they they lived in a remote colony we were trying to evacuate them
but they were fighting us
why couldnt they just do what they were told
we had no right to be there
it was for their own good
gentlemen stay focused you said you were trying to evacuate their colony why
those were our orders
who gave them
saavdra
commander saavdra
he was in charge of our unit we were part of an attack force
you were coerced
no no i volunteered we all did
i find that difficult to believe you were obviously manipulated somehow
no no no no no i remember now we held a briefing to plan the evacuation you were there commander mister paris
it was a command post
thats right it was night oh two hundred hours
wed been awake for days we were exhausted
what do our spotters report
the nakan are unarmed they wont put up a fight
once weve disabled their shield generators well deploy units five and six they may be unarmed but they wont be happy to see us dont provoke them i want to come out of this with zero casualties on both sides
understood
the perimeters the weakest in sector fourteen the terrains very flat
its an ideal landing spot for transports
once weve secured the village take the colonists there get them aboard do your best to reassure them make them understand that this is a temporary relocation that theyre going to be back there in a few weeks understood
aye aye sir
problem
just one this unit could use a little sleep i suggest we wait until daybreak
i promised command wed have this colony secured today
it can wait a few hours
im sorry but when this missions over how does a week on toranius prime sound
never been there
compared to this place its paradise
the mission proceeded as planned we disabled their shield generators and entered the colony
we were rounding up the nakan to be honest i expected them to give us a little more trouble
but then we came to the last enclosure do you remember the last enclosure it was empty where were they they were supposed to be there
twenty four colonists unaccounted for we thought the spotters had made a mistake we should have known something was wrong we should have gotten out then
this way stay in line keep moving
evacuation detail to base were ready for transport
transports on approach
i have to find my husband
dont worry hell be on one of the transports
which one
i dont know but well find him
everybody down base were under attack repeat were under attack
those missing colonists they were armed they fired the first shots it wasnt our fault
we cant be sure of that it could have been one of our own people fatigue a phaser malfunction you just dont know
either way it doesnt justify what we did
what did you do what happened down there
keep moving stay together hold your fire
stay down
stay together
stop running stop
get down get down get down get down stop running stop running
we didnt have any other choice
like hell we didnt
they were wiping us out
that didnt give us the right to murder civilians
i tried to protect the children but i couldnt stop them from running away
i ran too sounds of phaser fire people shouting i had to get out of there
please dont hurt us
move where i can see you move
please please hes no threat to you
tell me how i can get out of these tunnels and ill leave you alone tell me
go back the way you came at the second fork take the tunnel to your left follow it to the end it will lead you to the river
he was going to kill me
easy harry
they wouldnt listen why why wouldnt they listen
we killed eighty two civilians that night no one was left alive
yeah yeah
missed you at breakfast
i wasnt hungry
sleep a little
five six minutes
i found another episode of the untouchables elliot ness captures somebody named al caypone
capone maybe later
well youve got to eat something pizza
look i appreciate what youre trying to do but id rather just be alone
tom
no i dont want to be comforted right now
i know the last few days have been difficult
difficult difficult doesnt quite cover it i helped murder eighty two innocent people
you dont know that
i know what i remember
the doctor says your memories could have been altered
i was there when i close my eyes i can see the bodies i i can hear the weapons fire i can feel where i was shot
then why isnt there evidence of a wound
i dont know
all im asking is that you consider the possibility that this didnt happen well keep investigating there are sensor readings on the delta flyer that we havent even analysed yet
i cant concentrate on sensor readings right now
try
i cant stop pushing me i dont want your help
im sorry
you know where to find me
this was your first stop on the away mission a class m planet with one natural satellite
did you send anyone to the surface
no we only scanned for dilithium deposits we were in orbit for less than an hour
next
you came into contact with this vessel en route to your second destination
captain bathar of hodos
photogenic
hes a merchant claimed to have a formula that stops the aging process
oh you didnt happen to buy any did you
it was only a tripolymer enzyme it makes a great shoe polish though
moving on
your second stop
tarakis the planet its called tarakis ive been here
what the hell are you doing
stand aside
theyre already dead
they were never here we disabled their shield generators entered the colony and they were gone
no ones going to believe that
they will if we all keep to the same story
i wont lie about what happened here
then you say nothing
we murdered these people
in self defence
if that were true you wouldnt be vapourising the evidence you dont have to listen to him weve got to let people know we panicked theyll understand
no they wont move away i said move away
oh how long have i been here
three hours you started hallucinating in astrometrics im afraid i had to sedate you
i was there i was at the colony with saavdra
youre not the only one thirty nine crew members have begun to experience the same memories
it appears that the entire crew has been affected
their symptoms are identical increased engramatic activity nightmares
i can imagine the away team being pulled into an alien conflict but these people werent anywhere near this system
weve analysed voyagers sensor records if we did participate in a war all evidence of it has been erased
the dream was so vivid as real as anything ive experienced but i refuse to believe that we could
real or not the memories are having a deleterious effect on the crew the syndrome began to spread once we entered this system i suggest we reverse course before it gets worse
no if this massacre really happened someone is to blame i want to be certain that it wasnt us
with all due respect your judgment may be clouded by feelings of guilt about an incident that never occurred the danger to our crew here and now is indisputable
ive seen you looking better ensign
yes maam
ive felt better myself but were going to get through this the massacre took place on tarakis go to red alert and set a course
aye captain
a neural suppressant it will help keep the memories from resurfacing
your favourites talaxian stew and terra nut soufflé the soufflé has collapsed slightly but its nutritional content is intact
thank you it looks delicious
when naomi wildman is sad she consumes desserts she claims it improves her emotional state perhaps you should try it
naomi must be terrified of me after what happened in the galley
shes concerned about you she told me she wants to visit you
no not like this i might do something to scare her again
ill give her your regards
seven when you were a borg you were involved in some unpleasant activities
i helped to assimilate millions
i dont mean to be insensitive but do you ever feel shame about what you did
frequently
how to you manage to keep going knowing that youve done such horrible things
i have no choice
guilt is irrelevant
on the contrary my feelings of remorse help me remember what i did and prevent me from taking similar actions in the future guilt can be a difficult but useful emotion
its certainly difficult is that chocolate mixed in there with the terra nuts
i altered the recipe slightly i hope you dont object
not at all
tarakis dead ahead
shields stand by weapons on screen scan for vessels
there are none
take us into orbit
maam
do it mister paris
life signs
the planet appears to be uninhabited
looks the same as it did a few days ago when we scanned for dilithium deposits
signs of weapons fire or phaser residue
negative
run a full spectral scan look for anything unusual
nothing on geometric sensors
hold on im picking up a power signature
source
i cant tell the signals erratic but its coming from the northernmost continent coordinates one seven two mark five
phasers
call it an educated guess but i dont think this looks like a war zone
theres something familiar about it though i recognise those mountains
those trees werent here
search the area
ensign
the tunnel its nearby the one where i er
howd you get into it
there was a rock formation it hid the opening
a faint energy signature this way
over here
theres your physical evidence
i suggest we proceed with caution stand guard
i i i cant
remain calm slow deep breaths
they were over there
ive found the remains of two humanoids but you were not responsible for their deaths they died over three hundred years ago
i think weve found our war
the structure contains a synaptic transmitter i believe it was designed to send neurogenic pulses throughout this system
so anyone passing through would experience the nakan massacre like we did
precisely
try running those symbols inscribed on the base through the translation matrix  words alone cannot convey the suffering words alone cannot prevent what happened here from happening again beyond words lies experience beyond experience lies truth make this truth your own
its a memorial we werent victims of a conspiracy we were witnesses to a massacre
more than witnesses by being forced to relive those events half the crews been traumatised
maybe that was the point i certainly wont forget what happened here
anything in that database that might tell us who built this thing
no the technology has been neglected for more than two centuries its power cells are deteriorating
that could explain why our memories were so fragmented it was probably designed to transmit the experience in sequence
fascinating now lets try to shut it down so nobody else has to go through this kathryn
yes of course
even if we do shut down the transmitter im afraid your memories of the massacre are permanent
but well prevent this from happening to other passing ships
if we do that all record of what happened here would be lost
the monument will still be here
but that doesnt really tell the story someone put a lot of time and care into building that transmitter we cant just deactivate it we dont have the right
did they have the right to force us to relive all that
they wanted others to know what it was like in the hopes that nothing like it would happen again
why should anyone have to experience an atrocity they didnt commit
because thats how you learn not to make the same mistake if we destroy the evidence were no better than saavdra
maybe he had a point
it wasnt our fault
given the danger involved its only logical
this isnt about logic its about remembering
some things are best forgotten
not this i stood by once before and did nothing not again
captain
i watched while saavdra vaporised the bodies
no offence but those were other peoples memories
the obelisk at khitomer the fields of gettysburg those are other peoples memories too but we dont honour them any less the eighty two colonists who died here they deserve their memorial
captain
were not going to shut down the transmitter is that clear is that clear
are you suggesting we leave it intact
im suggesting that we repair it recharge the power cells i want that monument to function properly for another three hundred years well place a warning buoy in orbit anyone who enters this system will know what to expect dismissed
were ready captain
i know this was hardest on the four of you but if you hadnt stopped at this planet all the people who died here would have been forgotten and if they could i know theyd thank you janeway to voyager stand by to initiate power transfer five to beam up
you may want to run a diagnostic on the shield generators its way overdue
consider it done
and dont forget to keep tabs on neelixs little project in the mess hall
hes still trying to enhance the plasma burners in his stove
with some of sevens borg technology i dont want him accidentally turning the galley into an assimilation chamber
ill assign a security detail to keep tabs on him unless you think we need to take more drastic measures
and most important be sure to tell your captain when shes being overprotective
ill do that
thanks again for minding the store
even the captain deserves a vacation once in a while
and her first officer
hes looking forward to putting his feet up on your desk
chakotay
fun last night wasnt it
theres another match scheduled at fifteen hundred
ive got a systems diagnostic
correct me if im wrong but youre in command until the captain gets back
whats your point
delegate i happen to know that harrys free this afternoon
lieutenant youre not suggesting i abuse my power
tell me thats not lunch
its leola ointment for my skin
what happened
i was so excited to visit one of those beautiful norcadian beaches that i forgot to take my dermaline hypospray i fell asleep under two suns
ouch
a little more colour than i was hoping for but itll be a beautiful amber before you know it hows your shore leave been
well weve spent the last few days at the tsunkatse matches
tsunkatse i heard some crewmen talking about that during breakfast
its exciting a real test of strength and agility
you should come to the match with us this afternoon
from what ive heard tsunkatse is crude and pointless
well i guess we wont be saving you a seat
what about you tuvok you appreciate the martial arts
i have other plans theres a micronebula approximately one point six light years from here on the verge of collapse
wed like to take a shuttle to study it
an away mission during shore leave
commander tuvok and i dont require recreational activities
the borg wouldnt know fun if they assimilated an amusement park
its your shore leave but try to enjoy yourselves thats an order
heres the navigational data you asked for
thank you
how long are you planning on being gone
approximately forty eight hours
just like belanna
clarify
she overpacks too
i havent overpacked i simply wish to be prepared for any contingency
and what contingency is this for
thats an isomodulator enhanced to correct hull ablation in the event we encounter a meteoroid stream
couldnt you just replicate an isomodulator
i prefer this one
oh i get it you like to have your own things with you belannas the same way you know shed never admit it but she still takes a stuffed animal with her whenever shes going to be away for more than a day toby the targ
can toby the targ correct hull ablation your comparison is flawed
just the person i was looking for
you require my assistance
your company i was wondering if you care to join me on a tour of norcadias cultural hot spots i hear their museums are among the finest in this sector
im busy
with what
commander tuvok and i are leaving to study a collapsing micronebula
during shore leave i thought wed discussed this shore leave is a perfect opportunity for you to spend time with other members of the crew to develop your social skills
then i suppose ill have to develop them with commander tuvok
vulcans arent exactly known for their winning personalities
youd prefer i spent my time with sociable individuals such as yourself
you could do worse
in that case perhaps youd care to join us
to study the micronebula
you can assist us with our analysis of veridium oxide particulates
on second thought you and tuvok have a good time
ill give the commander your regrets
do that and if the nebula isnt as riveting as youd hoped try to remember lesson thirty six pleasant parlour games to pass the time youll need it
two hours thirty seven minutes thirteen seconds thats how long weve gone without verbal communication
why is that remarkable
the doctor encourages me to engage in conversation during awkward silences
did you find the silence awkward
no
nor did i
theres a vessel approaching on an intercept course the hull configuration is unfamiliar
distance
approximately three hundred thousand kilometres
hail them
no response
tuvok to voyager
the vessel is emitting some kind of dampening field weve lost engines weapons shields
its an explosive device of some sort
transporters are down i cant beam it off
ill try to disarm it
borgenhanced physiology you should possess superior strength agility stamina and visual acuity welcome to tsunkatse since the games inception our audience has never had the pleasure of seeing a drone compete you are going to be a very popular attraction
where is commander tuvok
your comrade from the shuttle im afraid he was injured in the explosion
i wish to see him now
certainly you will learn nothing is more important to me than the comfort and happiness of my fighters
yes penks generosity is legendary
quiet hes envious because ive found a new favourite
i have no intention of participating in your game
aggressive i like that
he requires medical attention
that can be arranged
then arrange it
you havent won a single bout and already youre making demands like a champion
will you treat him or not
will you fight
do not comply my condition is not severe
spoken like a true competitor willing to ignore his injuries for the sake of the contest schedule a bout for him a red match against the pensarkan
a red match does not end until one of the competitors is killed your friend would not survive
but you might
give her a blue match penk you wouldnt want to lose your new favourite her first time in the pit
yes we should start you off slowly
treat him and i will comply
what about the seventh match
im picking the vensiddian
he lost his last two times out
but hes undefeated against lefthanded fighters
you should trust him harry chakotay knows a thing or two about southpaws
he was twenty three and oh as a light heavyweight
twenty three and and one actually a nausicaan with a mean right hook
you think thats bad try taking a parrises mallet to the ribs
i didnt know you played
three time academy champion now thats a tough sport
i boxed a few parrises players in my day
and
lets just say they went back to playing parrises squares after that
oh was that a challenge commander
i wouldnt want to put my ops officer out of commission now would i
i can take a punch
careful harry legend has it that the tattooed terror has put more men in sickbay than the ankaran flu
yeah you wouldnt want to bruise your clarinet fingers
hey you want to go a few rounds or all you all talk
any time any place
oh you punch like a ferengi
i dont care what harry says the pensarkanbendali match is too close to call
ill let you know how it turns out
excuse me
i rearranged the duty schedules this morning youve got the bridge starting at fourteen hundred hours
youre sticking me with that shift so that you can go to the fight
im delegating
me and my big mouth
i thought youd be pleased that i took your advice
words fail me now remind me the reason that you have to see that fight is because
im an anthropologist
what does that have to do with tsunkatse
its a cultural phenomenon
youre having an allergic reaction to your leola ointment i hope youve learned your lesson talaxian homeopathy is no substitute for medical science this should help with the swelling and discoloration
ow
but youll have to stay out of the sun
what about the rest of my shore leave
i suggest you limit it to indoor activities
commander chakotay and belanna invited me to the tsunkatse matches i guess ill go
im disappointed in you mister neelix cheering for one individual to inflict serious injury on another hardly seems like an activity youd enjoy
well commander chakotay says that its a wonderful demonstration of athletic prowess
you seem to be forgetting that commander chakotay is an aficionado of boxing arguably the most barbaric sport in earths history surely you can find some way to occupy your free time that doesnt involve alien fisticuffs
do you have any suggestions
as a matter of fact i was planning a visit to the norcadian museum of entomology this afternoon theres a fascinating exhibit of beetle larvae from the equatorial subcontinent youre welcome to join me
hmm alien bugs or alien fisticuffs ooo thats a tough one
tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat
you were right commander this is exciting two opponents alone in the pit with only their strength and agility to protect them
im glad youre enjoying yourself
i still dont understand the rules
its simple a tsunkatse fighter wears a polaron disruptor on both hands and feet each disruptor delivers a bioplasmic charge when it comes in contact one of the opponents target sensors
so there is strategy involved
a fighter has to attack his rivals sensors without exposing his own
are you two going to talk or you here to watch
he looks like he could pick up a shuttlecraft
hes a pendari theyre known for their superior strength
and their bad temper
i hear they have a tendency to throw their opponents into the stands
be ready to duck
seven
seven seven
youre no bigger than a tarkanian field mouse penks insulting me by putting you in the pit to face me
i must warn you i possess superior strength
im trembling
seven seven
seven
i assure you resistance is futile
so is all your talk
seven
its no use she cant hear us
chakotay to voyager
come in
calling to give me a blowbyblow description of the match commander
seven of nine is in the pit
what
no time to explain beam her out of there
i have no desire to inflict further damage
im afraid i cant say the same
im locked onto the coordinates of the pit sevens not there
im looking right at her
not according to these sensors
maybe their lifesigns are masked
try recalibrating the bioscanners
acknowledged
theres nothing to lock onto the only readings im picking up are photonic
holograms
theyre transmitting the fight from another location
transmission to one of the arenas on norcadia prime is being disrupted compensate
tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat
voyager four to beam up
weve scanned the norcadian surface captain theres no sign of them
any luck tracing the transmission
were trying but its not easy
there are transmissions being sent to every planet in the sector
i guess you arent the only ones who enjoy this sport
it could take days before we can figure out where seven and tuvok are being held
what about diplomatic channels
neelix is meeting with a group of norcadian officials
well lets hope he gets their cooperation
when can we expect you back
im at the outer rim of the pendari system at best im forty eight hours away
sorry to cut your vacation short
thats okay commander keep me informed janeway out
stay away from me
its a dermal regenerator the pendari you fought injured you now keep still its almost out of power
i prefer that you use it to treat commander tuvok
i already have hes sleeping
why are you helping us
i recognise fellow hunters when i see them
im no hunter
i saw your match today your skills are impressive
the pendari would disagree
you almost defeated him but at the last moment you hesitated you questioned your desire to destroy your prey
i have no such desire
dont you i thought i saw it in your eyes with the proper training you could become a champion
until our ship comes to rescue us my only goal is to survive
do you know the difference between a survivor and a champion here there isnt one
i wanted to be the first to congratulate you
i lost
exactly theres a great deal of hostility toward the borg in this sector whenever the pendari landed a blow our audience grew were getting tens of thousands of requests to see you fight again
she needs time to recuperate to prepare for her next bout
i agree theres a red match scheduled for the day after tomorrow the pendari was supposed to compete but ive entered you in his place if three billion people paid to see you hurt imagine how many will pay to see you die
survival may be more difficult than i imagined
you will win the match
what makes you say that
i know your opponent i know his weaknesses i can train you to defeat him
i told you i will not kill anyone in that arena
consider the alternative
teach me
youre letting your elbow fall exposing your target
youre mistaken my arm is positioned properly when executing the tanyk defence the blocking elbow must remain parallel to the median sensor
ah the book of tsunkatse
commander tuvok borrowed it from one of the other fighters
it is obvious youve studied it well
im attempting a defence against any
that was not one of the thirty three sanctioned manoeuvres
there must be thirty four
i was unprepared for your attack
is that what youre going to say to your opponent stop thinking like a drone sanctioned manoeuvres perfecting defences you cannot assimilate tsunkatse from a book you must live it feel it in here your movements must become instinct an attack can come at any time from any direction you must learn to improvise
like this
ive observed you often favour your left side
very perceptive its a wound i sustained in one of my first matches after nineteen years it still hasnt healed properly
youve been here a long time
i was taken during my sons first hunt he was so proud to be with his father watching every movement i made imitating my gestures but instead of bringing home his first trophy he saw his father become someone elses prey
do you know what happened to him
i never saw him again all penk would say was that the boy was too small for competition
perhaps he managed to return home
you let down your defences why
i was
what feeling sorry for me and my tragic past
yes
you must never sympathise with your prey unless you accept that you will die well continue
how did it go
oh the norcadians were shocked to learn that offworlders might be participating against their will
the ambassador promised to begin an immediate investigation
you dont sound too convinced
im not i spoke to one of the pendari delegates according to him a huge percentage of the planets revenue is derived from tsunkatse nobody wants to do anything that might interfere with the game
so they turn a blind eye to the recruitment tactics
were not going to get any help through official channels its hard to believe a civilisation whose favourite pastime is cheering while innocent people fight each other
if seven and tuvok hadnt been abducted we might still be cheering too
what have you got
well one of the reasons we were having trouble isolating the source of the transmissions was because they never seem to be coming from the same place twice at first we thought the matches were being held in various locations
but when we connected the dots we realised that the pattern conformed to a flight path
one that spanned the entire sector
theyre transmitting the fights from a ship
like a travelling carnival
oh this is no carnival five million metric tons reinforced hull plating protected by covariant shielding neutronic weaponry
its way out of our weight class
the bigger they come lieutenant transmit these coordinates to the captain tell her we could use a hand
excellent when your opponent enters the arena what do you see
my prey
and what do you do to your prey
hunt it down and kill it
go rest before your match
thank you
thank me by winning
penks guards are making their inspection rounds progress
both the dampening field and the shielding of this vessel are tetryonbased but without access to the control interface i cant disable either your training
complete
are you adequately prepared
the hirogen is an efficient instructor he believes ill win
that troubles you
the idea of killing someone for the entertainment of others is detestable
is the idea of losing your own life for the entertainment of others more palatable as a drone you took many lives
i was acting as part of the collective
youre worried you wont have the strength to accomplish the task on your own
im worried that i will
its time
do whatever it takes to survive
you knew
yes
training me was a deception you wished to familiarise yourself with my weaknesses
i was helping you to overcome them
why
nineteen years is a long time ive grown tired
you wish to be killed in the arena
i want a death my son would be proud of
i wont be the one to provide it
then ill be forced to kill you
approaching the vessel
take us out of warp raise shields and charge weapons any sign of tuvok and seven
our sensors cant penetrate their shields
hail them
this is not a convenient time
im commander chakotay of the starship voyager youre holding two of my people
youll have to be more specific
commander tuvok and seven of nine return them now
the borg drone and her friend im afraid shes occupied at the moment
you have thirty seconds before i open fire
a fighter i respect that but youre no match for me
we can still find another way out of this
there is no other way youre still dropping your elbow
make a choice hunter or prey hunter or prey
direct hit to their aft shield generators
still no sign of seven but ive got a lock on tuvok
beam him to sickbay keep targeting those generators
transport complete
bridge to tuvok
go ahead commander
do you know sevens status
shes being forced to fight to the death i believe theyre on the uppermost deck
that sections protected by multiphasic force fields i cant penetrate them
shields down to forty percent thirty two percent
youre getting weak i should have found worthier prey
youre imperfect
is that the best you can do
shields are down
evasive manoeuvres harry
still cant get a lock
should i get us out of here before they knock out our propulsion
not yet if we cant beam her out maybe we can shut down the transmission
if nobodys watching then why continue the fight
start targeting their signal generators
hull breach on deck eleven
seal it
weve lost weapons
another vessel is approaching
great now theyre bringing in reinforcements
no this ones on our side its the delta flyer
good to see you captain
nothing like getting back to work after a long vacation
we need you to target their signal generators
understood
weve lost more than half our audience reroute power to transmitters five and six
theyve reduced power to their forcefields ive got two lifesigns in there seven and a hirogen but i cant get an individual lock
transport them both if you have to tom
aye sir
tsunkat tsunkat tsunkat
never let your prey suffer kill it
seven stand away
its all right this fight is over
we located an hirogen hunting party three light years away theyve agreed to rendezvous with us
im grateful
would you excuse us
very well but if you should need anything an analgesic a phaser rifle dont hesitate to ask
i apologise for the doctor hes very protective of me
he doesnt realise how well you defend yourself
a trophy
what will do you now search for new prey
no this time i will be searching for my son
if he is as clever as his father he may be difficult to locate
ive been wondering would you have killed me
i dont know
fortunately you were right there was another way out
i thought you might require assistance
thank you
i realise we share an affinity for silences but in this instance i feel compelled to speak if you hadnt offered to take my place in the arena its likely i would have been killed
i made the logical choice as you would have
still i owe you a debt of gratitude
assisting me with these recalibrations will be sufficient thanks
have you fully recovered
im experiencing minor pain beneath my occipital implant the doctor believes it is temporary
i wasnt referring to your physical condition
when the hirogen referred to me as weak he was correct
but you overpowered him
because i lost control
given the circumstances your behaviour was understandable
ive spent the last three years struggling to regain my humanity im afraid i may have lost it again in that arena
youre experiencing difficult emotions
guilt shame remorse
then you havent lost your humanity you have reaffirmed it
heart heart heart just one more heart
you might as well be showing us your hand neelix this is a game of strategy deception
never let the opponents know your hand
right
bah
ten
i see your ten and raise you twenty
neelix
im thinking twenty another twenty ha
if i didnt know any better id say were being hustled
ensign
oh im not buying the innocent talaxian routine
i dont know what youre talking about ive ive this is the first time ive played what is it called
poker
look why dont we make things a little more interesting forget the chips lets bet on tomorrows work detail all right whoever wins this hand gets the morning off
im in
im in
sounds good to me
what have you got
two pair
does that beat a flush
i knew you were bluffing
that beats me tom
battle stations
and i had a full house
i cant shake them
return fire
why didnt our sensors detect them
looks like they used a dispersal field to mask their approach
warp drive
no luck too much damage to the plasma injectors
harry get down there and see what you can do
shields down eighteen percent
harry status
i need time to clear the injectors
sir the cubes power output is fluctuating
then were still in the game bring us about target their propulsion matrix
weve lost phasers
arm photon torpedoes fire when ready
we knocked out their main propulsion system
good now get us out of here tom
theyve got us in a tractor beam
harry
we need warp power now
we lost two more relays i cant
harry harry
engines are offline
we are the borg your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own resistance is futile
neelix
neelix
commander
its all right you were unconscious but i dont think youre injured
i was dreaming youd been assimilated
your subconscious was jumping the gun but not by much from the look of this room id say were in an assimilation chamber
wheres harry
hes not here
well weve got to find him
we need to get our bearings first figure out whats going on
were in a borg cube and harrys missing thats whats going on
sir
nobody we know
some kind of botched assimilation
from the looks of it
what are they waiting for theyve got three more potential drones here
stay calm
calm were in a chamber of horrors or havent you noticed
were not drones yet if we keep our heads maybe we can find a way out theres a forcefield around this room lets try to disable it
their ion trail ends directly ahead
im detecting another vessel bearing three zero mark one one two its a borg cube
red alert alter course to intercept adjust shields to rotating frequencies have they detected us
unclear the vessels holding position
as soon as were within sensor range start scanning for the away team on screen
their propulsion system is offline the damage is not that severe the drones shouldve repaired it by now
lucky for us they didnt or wed never have caught up with them any sign of our people
not yet
they are targeting our warp core shields are holding
return fire aim for their weapons array
now theyre going after our impulse engines that one was meant for our sensors they cant seem to make up their minds
their attack strategy is erratic inefficient
and finished weve disabled their weapons
that was too easy
maybe theyre in worse shape than we thought
im picking up nonborg life signs one of them is definitely talaxian it looks as though they havent been assimilated yet
try to get a transporter lock
their shields are interfering
target their shield generator and fire
captain i believe i can explain the unusual behaviour of these borg there should be thousands of drones manning the vessel but im picking up only five signatures
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
it doesnt sound like theyve lost their confidence
their shield generators are too deep inside the vessel our weapons cant reach them
open a channel borg vessel this is the starship voyager youre holding our crewmen were willing to cease firing if you return them
negotiation is irrelevant you will be assimilated
not today and not by you agree or ill resume firing
they are scanning us
we will return your crew members in exchange for specific technology
talk about unusual behaviour the borg negotiating
what technology
your navigational deflector disengage it from your secondary hull
mute audio
if we surrender our deflector well be dead in space we wont be able to go to warp
what would they want with it
when their communications array was damaged it severed their link to the collective they intend to adapt our deflector to regain it
and call for reinforcements thats the last thing we need well have to stall them until we can find another way out of this
ill consider the exchange but first i want to be certain my crewmen are unharmed and alive
you have scanned our vessel
our scans were inconclusive we want to see them for ourselves
you may transport one individual
seven
proceed to grid six three subjunction zero one
state your designation
seven of nine these drones have not fully matured where are the others
there are no others the drones aboard this vessel were
deactivated we are the borg seven of nine a borg designation
shes like us
not like us shes damaged her infrastructure has been removed
we could fix her
you will add to our perfection
you are neonatal drones you should still be in maturation chambers
weve matured long enough
doubtful your thoracic nodes havent formed yet youre incomplete youll continue to malfunction you must return to your maturation chambers comply
dont listen to her
we tried to go back in the chambers were offline
what happened to the adult drones
we dont know
irrelevant dont tell her anything
that wasnt the agreement
ive modified the agreement i didnt realise id be dealing with children your behaviour is erratic i cant be certain that you
no modifications we show you the hostages you give us the deflector comply comply
take me to them
if she tries to resist assimilate her
do you have a designation
second
you were the second to emerge from the chambers
no the first i could not establish order i became second and he became first
were a collective
a collective of five on a vessel normally run by five thousand what makes you think youll survive
when we reestablish our link with the borg they will come for us
commander weve got company
i wish to see if theyre injured
seven
dont let their appearance fool you they are in control of this vessel and all of its armaments are you injured
nothing serious a previous tenant
we were trying to perfect our assimilation techniques
you failed
one of these captives was attempting to disconnect the security field
actually i was just trying to
that was unnecessary
he is not permanently damaged
he learnt his lesson
the borg are prepared to negotiate for your release i will return for you
give my regards to harry
the deflector array
im not authorised to give you technology i must report back to captain janeway
agreed
i also need to take an adult drone and a data node back to voyager for analysis
why
something happened on this vessel that none of us understand if it happens again it could endanger all of you
no sign of harry yet but there are parts of the cube that we still cant scan
could the drones be holding him in another location
unlikely seven said they didnt seem to be aware of his presence
if he ejected in an escape pod we would have detected his beacon by now
try to activate his comm badge match the carrier wave to a borg interlink frequency they shouldnt detect it
aye captain
what have we learned from our friend here
the bigger they come the harder they fall behold the david that slew our goliath
a pathogen
a spaceborne virus that adapted to borg physiology its inert now but in its virulent state it attacked the drones and killed them
why werent the juveniles infected
the maturation chamber is designed to protect developing drones malfunctions caused by the deaths of the adults led several of the chambers to open prematurely
does this pathogen only target the borg
the borg and other cybernetic organisms it encounters youre not thinking of using it as a biological weapon
if we can revive the pathogen and reintroduce it we could neutralise the drones without harming the away team
neutralise you mean murder dont you captain theyre children
need i remind you that these children have committed murder themselves in their futile attempts to assimilate others
seven tell me something you saw them talked to them do you think theyll kill the hostages if we dont give them what they want
yes
i want that pathogen as an option doctor but i wont consider using it until ive seen these drones for myself think you can arrange that then youre with me
computer identify the source of this comm signal
starship voyager
i need to respond on the same carrier wave
that procedure will require significant modifications
well dont worry im way ahead of you
why are you here
i wanted to make a new proposal
weve already negotiated youve seen the hostages now give us the deflector as agreed
maybe its hard for you to accept but you dont have to rejoin the hive our doctor can remove your implants you can come with us you were individuals yourselves not long ago children with families you were abducted and assimilated i recognise your species youre brenari and youre norcadian do you remember your world
a theta class planetoid population two and sixty million binary suns
and what did it look like when those suns set each night can you remember that
irrelevant the deflector now
we need more time that deflector array is essential to our
no give it to us
or what youll assimilate me that wont solve your problem i cant give you voyagers deflector but maybe we can repair your technology
clarify
seven knows a good deal about borg systems
you have two hours
i dont know the extent of the damage it could take longer
two hours or your hostages die dont come back here captain
i bought us another two hours the pathogen
it should be ready by then
did you see the away team
im afraid not but seven assured me our people havent been harmed
i cant believe were negotiating with adolescent drones
theyre not exactly drones mature borg are predictable theyll ignore you or assimilate you but these juveniles theyre unstable
they are contemptuous of authority convinced that they are superior typical adolescent behaviour for any species
its a transmission from the cube
seven
no its harry im clearing it up now
delta flyer to voyager respond
were receiving you ensign where are you
still in the flyer its locked up in some kind of hanger bay along with two alien ships
ive isolated his coordinates
how close is he to their shield generator
roughly eight hundred metres
harry are there any plasma charges aboard the flyer
yes maam
in that case how do you feel about going for a little walk
i could use the exercise
tuvok will guide you to the shield generator if you destroy it you wont have to make the trip back
understood
i have the technology youve requested
thank you
you were a drone for eighteen years
correct
i accessed your data file
why
i thought it might be relevant
what else did you learn
you were assimilated as a juvenile like us
my parents were scientists studying the borg they took me with them my childhood was short
childhood
the years between birth and physical maturity when humanoids adapt to their roles as individuals perhaps you have memory of yours
i dont know
what about your parents do you remember them
no no memories
your subvocal processor is malfunctioning i can repair it for you its a slight adjustment it wont be painful
the first told me my malfunction could not be repaired until we reconnected with the collective
this colour my mothers hair was this colour
i thought we agreed no irrelevant discussions what is the punishment for disobeying the protocols
deactivation
i engaged him in this discussion
return to your station
i found some unsettling information i examined their communication records the collective did receive the drones initial distress call
how long before they arrive
a vessel was not dispatched the collective declared the neonatal drones irrelevant and severed their link to the hive permanently
they see them as damaged unworthy of reassimilation
precisely
are the drones aware of this
no they dont have the ability to decrypt the message
once they learn theyve been rejected by the hive they wont need our deflector they might be willing to release the hostages
normally when drones learn theyre irrelevant they deactivate themselves but these neonatal drones are unpredictable they may not adhere to borg protocols
there is another option we could invite them to voyager when they realise they have no place else to go
if youre suggesting transforming them into individuals that would be extremely difficult
you turned out pretty well seven
thats because i was prepared before you encountered me
what do you mean
when i was first captured by the borg i was young and frightened i watched my parents assimilated then i was placed in a maturation chamber and the hive mind began to restructure my synaptic pathways purge my individuality when i emerged five years later the turmoil of my forced assimilation had been replaced with order you may not be aware of this captain but that order continues to be a source of strength for me i could not have regained my humanity without it
i appreciate your insights but just because they didnt have the benefit of your borg upbringing doesnt mean were going to turn our backs on them there has to be another way
not all drones can be saved captain
continue the repairs aboard the borg cube well hold onto this information for now
yes captain
they do have one thing going for them you if theres anyone who can reach them its you
three of hearts on a transwarp conduit
ensign
king of clubs on a power coupling im marking my route with playing cards in case i have to come back the same way
you shouldnt distract yourself mister kim
i need a little distraction this hike is bringing up some bad memories
an earlier visit to a borg cube
no a haunted house my parents took me to when i was six
borg vessels may be forbidding but they are not haunted
tuvok
turn left ensign
nine of diamonds on a data node
the resonance field collapsed itll take an hour to reinitialise
these delays are intentional
im working as efficiently as i can examine my work for yourself if you have doubts
this datas flawed
more likely its your understanding of quadric field theory thats flawed
ignore her shes trying to divide us
they rely on you yet you lack the skills necessary to ensure their survival
weve managed so far were borg youve forgotten what that means
the unity of the collective common goals the quest for perfection i have not forgotten but you dont need to remain drones to experience those things come back with me to voyager
thirty eight minutes youre wasting time
another maturation chamber is malfunctioning
its autonomic nervous system is failing
its borg it will adapt
its not adapting let seven help
we can modulate the stasis field to stabilise its functions at least temporarily assist me the field is degrading we need to transport it into an incubation pod quickly
why is it doing that
its respiratory system is impaired and this incubation pod is malfunctioning we must transport this infant to voyager
no the drone is part of our collective
not if it dies
tetryon levels are rising im getting closer
the shield generator should be directly ahead
i see it the first charge is in place tuvok hello
you left these
i like her she looks like seven of nine
is seven your friend you know shes my friend too maybe someday we
your weapon wont work here dampening field
how long has it been since you lost contact
four or five minutes
his biosigns
doctor to the captain please report to sickbay immediately
on my way keep looking for him
whats the emergency
i thought you should see for yourself somebody left a bundle on our doorstep i turned around and there she was lying on a biobed
seven must have beamed her here
good thing too a few more minutes and i wouldnt have been able to do anything for her its hard to believe she could grow up to be a drone
hold her for a moment while i take some readings oh i guess she just wanted to be held oh the pathogen i finished synthesizing it
start working with tuvok on a way to deploy the virus
captain you dont seriously plan to use it
if i have to lets just hope your brothers and sisters dont force my hand
you complain of delays then you interrupt my work
can you identify this
its a plasma charge
you tried to deceive us
nanoprobes were injected into his bloodstream he wont survive without medical attention call your captain tell her to give us the deflector
that wont be necessary i only need a few more minutes to repair the
no more delays no more deceptions the deflector resistance is futile
comply
return harry kim then well talk
weve talked enough your requests are irrelevant comply or well assimilate the others
itll take us at least an hour to dismantle the deflector and transfer the components
now
i cant give it to you now its complex technology thats part of our ship we cant simply remove it and no amount of threats from you is going to change that
theyve locked a tractor beam onto the deflector
theyre trying to tear it off hull stress is increasing breaches on decks ten and eleven
increase shield strength and randomise the harmonics
theyre adapting
even with voyagers deflector your efforts to return to the hive will fail
theyll come for us
no they wont the borg received your message but chose to ignore it they consider you irrelevant
irrelevant
we are damaged they dont want us
ignore her its another lie
their reply is in data grid four two six use decryption protocol theta three
return to your station its another deception shes manipulating us
the transmission is authentic
its a mistake
the collective does not tolerate imperfection
then well assimilate more species prove were worthy
hull stress is reaching critical levels
reroute all emergency power to structural integrity
thatll buy us another minute at most
captain i have found a fluctuation in their shield grid near a plasma duct its too intermittent to beam out the hostages but we could use it to deploy the pathogen captain
not yet
there is no alternative
theres always an alternative we just need to find it their tractor beam draws power from the same grid as their shield matrix if we use the deflector to send a feedback pulse along the beam it could disrupt their shields do it
rerouting warp plasma if this doesnt work itll do more damage to us than the cube
itll work prepare to fire
you have no future with the borg but you do with voyager a chance to reclaim your real lives
what do you know about real lives
does he speak for all of you you should make your decisions yourself as individuals
they are sending a feedback pulse through our tractor beam its overloading our shield matrix
adapt
their tractor beam is fluctuating their shields are dropping
ive got a partial lock on the away team boosting the confinement beam ive got three of them
confirmed chakotay paris and neelix are in transporter room two
what about seven and harry
they must be in a section thats still shielded
amplify the feedback pulse
the other captives are gone
the shields around this chamber are failing instructions
lower your shields lower the shields
no
leave her alone
get back to your station do what i say
what you say i thought we were a collective
one mind one voice
i protected you gave you order
your order your rules
their feedback pulse is overloading the induction grids
this vessel will be destroyed we must evacuate
no assist me
youre damaged lie still
we have to resist the collective will come for us
his cortical implants are depolarising i cant help him
well find a new home youll see
we are borg
yes we are borg
lower the shields
weve sent out calls to any brenari and norcadian ships that might be in the vicinity but we havent gotten any responses so far and were still trying to figure out where the other two came from it may take a while
they could use the time they have a great deal to learn
it might help if they had someone around who knew what theyre up against
ive never been responsible for children mister neelix would be a wiser choice
from what ive seen youre the one theyve established a bond with theyll be looking to you for guidance
perhaps i could help them avoid some of the obstacles ive encountered
do we have to regenerate now
yes but first
i was able to salvage your assimilation profiles they include your names and some limited biographical data
icheb my name was icheb
your name is icheb
i remember now it was my fathers second name
my designation is mezoti its a pretty name
yes it is and its all yours azan and rebi ill tell you more about them tomorrow
computer decrease ambient lighting by sixty percent good night sweet dreams
get out of the way sorry
tommymeboy youre a little fast there
did you hurt yourself tommy boy
i think i zigged when i should have zagged
well maybe you ought to stick to a horse and carriage still shes a beauty the world must be treating you well to afford such a thing
er just dipping into my inheritance
oh come into some money did you so whos passed on
er my grandfather on my mothers side an aristocrat god rest his soul
sounds like he was a fine man id drink a toast to him if i had a shilling to me name
here its on me
itll take three pints to do a proper job tommy boy and this isnt even enough for two
there thats all ive got
youre a generous man care to join me at sullivans
oh i wish i could but im on my way to castle odell
nights coming and they say when the sun goes down the queen of the faerie folk reclaims the castle
ill give her your regards
dont say i didnt warn you
computer replace damaged tyre
saints preserve us
i thought i would die from the shock of it
now seamus youre not a great one for telling things the way they were
ill admit ive been known to add a little colour to stories from time to time to liven things up but with god as my witness i saw tom paris using unnatural powers to fix that wheel of his
tommy boy practicing unholy magic next thing youll be telling me is you want to pay for your own drinks
make fun if you like but he was heading up to castle odell only an hour before dark
oh leave it alone seamus cant one day go by without you making an ass of yourself
but that tom paris is an odd one coming and going through town as if he built the place
thats right and where does he go
oh hes a shifty one and for that matter so are his friends
if youre talking about katie oclare youd better watch your mouth
well you know what they say sullivan birds of a feather
they also say superstition is the religion of fools
killmannin 1846
what
old patsy down in county meath spoke of a band of spirit folk who came to killmannin in 46
killmannin did you ever hear of it doc
no this is the first
ah you wont find it on any map not any more
it was a town mot much different than fair haven that is until this group of strangers arrived the townsfolk welcomed them with open arms after all a stranger is just a friend you havent met yet but they regretted their hospitality soon enough
the cows stopped giving milk the potatoes grew rotten in the ground
then people started to go missing
oh go on
its true
what happened to them
they were taken to the other world
when winter came and the nights grew longer the entire town vanished every post every nail poof into thin air never to be seen again
are you suggesting that fair havens going to go the way of killmannin just because we have a few new folks in town
im suggesting you keep an eye on tom paris and his cohorts not to mention that lady friend of yours
so katies some kind of goblin now is that it
shes certainly cast a spell on you
well if you ask me
shush
katie
am i interrupting
aw just some nonsense seamus is up to his old tricks again
good day to you katie
oh its good to see you whatll it be
the usual please
well one cup of tea coming right up did you snatch any children on the way into town katie
what
never mind i missed your smile what have you been doing with yourself
nothing terribly exciting just helping my aunt and uncle out on the farm theyre not as spry as they used to be although theyve got a goat that could argue mossie donegans talking pig under the table
youll have to bring him into the bar the next time youre up well arrange a debate
ill see that i do i hear they opened a nickelodeon in dooleen i thought it might be nice to go to a show
ive got to tend the bar i wish youd let me know you were coming i would have made arrangements
thats all right we can go some other time
no i mean youve already made the trip itd be a shame if you had to leave
well i could be convinced to stay if youd be up to a game of rings lets go
computer one dozen broadway lilies
something tells me thats not lunch
i already ate
ah who are they for
a friend
oh and this friend wouldnt happen to be a lovely irish lass now would she
arent you due on the bridge
ah youd better watch yourself harry these country girls arent as simple as you think maggie ohalloran could be a little more than you can handle
heard about your little traffic accident
that was a clutch malfunction it wasnt my fault
if you ask me that whole programme is an accident waiting to happen youve been running fair haven around the clock just yesterday i had to replace three holoemitters
i ran a full diagnostic this morning everything is fine
whatever you say but when your quaint little seaside town starts to depolarise dont come running to me
if youll excuse me im late for a moonlight stroll
are you sure you dont need a chaperone
not with your driving record
i think i know just whatll make his date just a little more interesting
just dont blow out any more holoemitters
what are we doing out here seamus skulking about in the dark spying on folks
whats the matter milo you got a case of the willies
well what if youre right what if this tom paris is some kind of demon if were caught hell cast a spell on us
then stop your squawking or hell catch us for sure come on man hes getting away
a captain is only as good as his crew
it must be lonely out there on the sea with only the stars to guide you
sometimes during the night watch with the timbers creaking and the dark water stretching out as far as the eye can see you can believe youre the only man in the world
maybe you should think about settling down on dry land
oh believe me i do as often as i think of you
can i ask you something harry
of course
would you like to hold my hand
if you promise to hold mine back
look hes got some sort of contraption in his hand
maybe were going about this the wrong way we should go down to saint marys and tell father mulligan the whole story
hes not going to listen to talk of the supernatural
och if you fill his collection box hell listen to anything
thats true
i thought you were promised to ray euan
not anymore can i ask you something else harry
please
would you like to kiss me
is that a trick question
holy mother of god
tom dont you have anything better to do
boy she really turned on you
ha ha very funny i could have been trampled
relax the holodeck safeties are on theres nothing to worry about
all right all right youve had your fun now change her back
chakotay to paris and kim report to the bridge
on our way
hey what about maggie
shell be fine let her graze
let her graze did you hear that
amen
please be seated i recently heard a tale of two farmers who shall remain nameless for the sake of this sermon it seems one broke the others plough and refused to replace it his comeuppance was served to him not by the hand of god but by the other farmer in the form of a clogged irrigation ditch now do you think their disagreement stopped there of course not they go on just as the heathen did of old after all one spiteful act deserves another right wrong what these sinners have forgotten is that they are neighbours
hes in love with the sound of his own voice
whether we are man or woman parent or child flesh and blood or photons and force fields it has been said
on the other hand perhaps hes been nipping at the sacramental wine
and as such our community is everything it is our world and we are a part of it just as a branch is part of a tree do you see branches tearing leaves off one another no do you see roots hoarding water from the trunk no do you see
easy maggie whoa easy now
father
did you make a wrong turn on your way to the milking shed
werent nothing like that at all father something terribles happened
what now
this was maggie ohalloran the spirits have turned her into a cow
maggie ohallorans been eaten by a cow
did you see these spirits
that we did tom paris and harry kim
i hate to disappoint you but it sounds as though youve been the victim of a practical joke tom paris is a known prankster
oh it was unholy magic i tell you we saw it with our own eyes
when did this alleged transformation take place
last night
well then that settles it this couldnt possibly be maggie ohalloran i saw maggie this morning on my way into church she was at her cart tending her flowers shes probably there now well i i think thats enough excitement for one morning this mass is over go in peace er leave the cow
oh all right father excuse us maggie
take care maggie
maggie
well good morning boys
is everything all right youre looking a little out of sorts this morning
yes well i must admit im not quite myself today
oh
well this is going to sound very odd but i feel like i just woke up from the strangest dream and i dont remember going to sleep
youre right that does sound odd
do you remember anything about last night
well i was out with harry kim he chatted me up at the ox and lamb and we were off on a walk before i knew it
what did you do on your walk
we talked what kind of a girl do you think i am
now maggie we werent implying anything
no
do you recall anything else about the evening
er did anything out of the ordinary happen anything at all
i dont remember
well tell us about the dream then
oh it was most unpleasant i was walking around town with nothing but a bell around my neck well somehow i wound up in church everyone was staring at me you were there seamus and you too milo the next thing i knew i was tending my flowers just as you boys walked up
well thats quite a story maggie
can we get a quick one
maybe just a wee taste
so i said to young harry im not one for rainy days and grey skies as soon as the words were out of my mouth he called up the spirits to do his bidding a second later there wasnt a cloud in the sky
i was up near ballahick farm with little mary she was playing near the well somehow she lost her footing and fell in i was so frightened i didnt know what to do so i ran to the colbys to get some help but when we returned there was mary in the meadow talking with katie oclare there wasnt a scratch on her katie said i mustve been mistaken when i saw her fall there was no mistake
i saw something strange too well i hesitated to say anything for fear youd think me mad but after listening to your stories today i feel youve a right to know
well speak up
last sunday after his sermon i saw father mulligan vanish into thin air
hes one of them right enough father mulligan tommy boy katie and the rest theyre spirit folk
well what about that neelix fellow who runs the ox and lamb well if he doesnt look like a leprechaun i dont know who does
theyre all probably up at castle odell conspiring against us
now thats enough i cant deny theres been some unusual goings on but what are you proposing that we run katie and her friends out of town or maybe we should line them up in front of a firing squad is that what you want these people have been our neighbours weve become friends lets not forget that
well we cant just sit here and do nothing while they take over fair haven
im not saying we do nothing but lets go about this like civilised people
what do you suggest we sit them down and discuss it over tea
youre looking lovelier than ever katie
thank you
open it
the faerie queene by edmund spenser thank you michael
its the longest poem in the english language and the first to use a nine line stanza
ill start reading it tonight i love epic poetry
really i didnt know that it seems as if theres a lot of things i dont know about you i thought youd want to know theres been some talk about you and your friends strange things have been happening around town folk are saying youre to blame
what kind of strange things
people using unholy magic vanishing into thin air changing the weather
by any chance would all this have anything to do with your reading suggestion
as a matter of fact
dont tell me they say im the faerie queene
frankly they could tell me youre the devil himself and i wouldnt care
ill try not to take that personally
the sad truth of the matter is i dont know who you are
what do you mean
youve been lying to me katie ive been doing some checking with friends of mine in county clare seems nobodys heard of you there
its a big county
and ive got a lot of friends youve been evasive from the day we met i was a fool not to see it where do you go when you leave here thereve been times i wanted to talk to you tell you about my day about a book id read just to say hello but i cant because i dont know where to find you whatre you hiding katie
ill admit i have misled you about some things but never about anything important and i wasnt lying when i said i care about you
i wish i could believe that
you can i didnt want to deceive you but under the circumstances i had no choice
what circumstances
michael there are things about me you may not be able to understand
try me who are you katie where are you really from the truth
computer end programme
how did he know those are questions no holodeck character should be asking what exactly did you do to that programme
well i i just added a few bells and whistles to make the characters more realistic nothing too fancy
well somethings gone wrong the people of fair haven arent simple country folk anymore
report
it looks like weve worn out our welcome
its the first time weve tried running a holodeck programme nonstop were lucky it lasted this long
there are damaged subroutines in all of the character files
so much for my open door policy
shut it down and repair the damaged systems
as i recall everything was fine until someone started turning people into cows
computer display fair haven character michael sullivan
tom
where am i wheres katie
he shouldnt be aware that hes in the lab
ive isolated the damaged subroutines
i said where the hell am i
its all right michael take it easy
what is this place
try to relax
if someone doesnt tell me where i am im going to start busting heads
his perceptual filters are malfunctioning
whatre you saying whats a perceptual filter
its its okay were trying to help you
there look at these those are the algorithms designed to keep him oblivious to anything outside the programmes parameters
theyre offline 
give me a minute that should do it
how are you feeling michael
never better harry liams been looking for you youre the only man in four counties to beat him at arm wrestling he wants a rematch
tell him hes got one
ill do that
ha well that was easy enough
yeah unfortunately it looks like all the other characters have the same malfunction
dont tell me were going to have to go through every one of them
if we reactivate the programme use the primary control port in sullivans pub we could reset all the perceptual filters with a single command sequence
i guess well be seeing you later
looking forward to it
computer resume fair haven programme in holodeck one and transfer michael sullivan back to his bar
danny danny
yes
come here fetch doc fitzgerald tell him to meet me in the church go on hurry lad
we thought wed reset his perceptual filters until we took a closer look at his subroutines turns out he was just playing along
never underestimate an irish hologram
well have to reprogramme michael when we do the others
lets just hope he didnt share the experience with too many others
got it these resequenced algorithms should do the trick
good luck
what the hell was i thinking
a minor malfunction
well thats the problem ive got a boyfriend who malfunctions
tom and harryll fix him
and if they cant
one piece of advice youve always given me tell the truth
hate to break the news to you michael but im a starship captain and youre a three hundred deciwatt holodeck programme i couldnt do it
in that case youll have to get creative
im not a superstitious man doc but ive been seeing things i cant explain
youre not the only one at first i thought we had an epidemic on our hands but this is no fever
no its not last night i was talking to katie and the next thing i knew i was being spirited away to god knows where
they took you where
maybe it was the other world i dont know tom paris was there young harry too
what did they want with you
im not sure they were talking about me like i wasnt there saying things about fair haven that we knew too much about them
oh lord
and thats not all they were saying something about coming to the pub tonight to change the town somehow
what does that mean
im damned if i know
how did you get away
with all the talk about us knowing too much about them i figured that if i pretended nothing was out of the ordinary they might let me go and sure enough thats exactly what they did
i wonder if this is how things started in killmannin back in 46
im not sure what they have in mind but wed better be prepared
were in luck nobodys home
if were going to fight them weve got to use the right ammunition biddy ramsey gave me this before she passed on she knew a thing or two about faerie magic and how to fight it everything she learned she learned from this book
i doubt if it says anything about using rifles
youd be surprised how many things a bullet will stop
i dont like this one bit guns seamus
under normal circumstances id agree with you michael but these arent normal circumstances
maybe youd still like us to be acting civilised where did that get you before a ticket to the other world thats what
we dont know what the spirit folk have in store for us
thats just it we dont know much about anything do we and weve got milo here acting like a holy war has been declared
relax sullivan the rifles are only a last resort besides weve got incantations which are more lethal to spirit folk than any weapons forged by man thats how were going to force them back into their realm and weve got red twine to stop them from changing shape
and dont forget about the ash berries
ash berries right thats how you keep them from using their powers against you theyve been walking amongst us for weeks now pretending to be our friends lying to us making mischief whats next
yes what is next seamus
i for one am not going to stand by and let them run roughshod over our town
no
we cant rest until weve driven every one of them out
theyre here tom paris and harry kim theyre in sullivans right now
whos with me
seamus let us explain youre making a mistake
the only mistake we made was letting you into fair haven whats that
shoot it
no wait wait thats a delicate piece of technology
warning holodeck controls and safety protocols are offline
a voice from the other world
emergency overrides are malfunctioning
computer freeze programme
sixty two percent compliance
theyre getting away after them
computer exit
gunfire
two shots directly at the primary controls we cant deactivate the programme or get the safeties back online
where are tom and harry now
saint marys looks like some of your parishioners are holding them captive
we cant blame them for being frightened they must think were some kind of sorcerers
well we could use a little magic right now because thats about the only way were going to get our people back
transporters
too many stray photons we cant get a lock
we should enter the holodeck with a security team and take them by force
need i remind you the holocharacters have weapons as well wed be risking armed conflict
well then lets just pull the plug cut power to the hologrid
that would purge the programme from our database
exactly
but wed lose fair haven and all its people
theyre not people theyre holograms
and they werent programmed to be violent i dont believe theyd harm anyone
you cant be certain
well i am certain and id like to find a less drastic solution
with all due respect captain michael can be reprogrammed tom and harry cant
one problem at a time belanna the people of fair haven may not be real but our feelings toward them are i wont destroy these relationships if we can find another way now if we could attach transport enhancers onto tom and harry would that be enough to cut through the interference
i believe so
good then we just need to get someone close to them doctor
a few words of inspiration should get me within reach
i suggest you use your mobile emitter itll isolate you from the malfunctions
good idea stand by to cut power to the hologrid in case things get out of hand
aye captain
in the meantime i believe your flock needs tending
ex labis caelestium sanctorum super ad aures atrorum larvarum mentientium from the lips of the heavenly saints above to the ears of the dark and lying spirits may your spectral forms be cast back to the other world back to the other world there must be some trick to these incantations
what do you make of this seamus
we should just tell them the truth
oh good idea harry do you want to tell them theyre only holograms or should i
i see you left your box of charms at sullivans i believe this is the talisman you used on maggie maybe we should turn them into cows
no no theres been a misunderstanding we are not spirit folk
i think weve heard enough of your lies tommy boy i say we tie them up to the lamp post in the square and show them how spirit folk were dealt with in the olden days
leave them alone its bad enough youve got them trussed up like christmas turkeys theres no need for foolish threats
youd better watch whose side youre on youre not above suspicion yourself
oh so were going to start turning on one another now is that it
we are if youre choosing them over your own people
sinners sinners all of you you have the audacity to turn a house of worship into a prison this is where we gather to pledge our love for our fellow man not condemnation you should all be ashamed of yourselves
quite a rousing sermon father but im afraid youre not going to find too many takers tonight
not after your little vanishing act it seems grace declan saw you disappear into thin air on sunday
aye id say that sounds a wee bit unholy youre in league with them arent you tie him up with the others
listen to yourselves youre letting confusion and fear get the best of you doctor to janeway
whats this
fire and brimstone dont seem to be working
look here seamus another talisman
quick get it off of him
beam him out of there
his programs been disengaged from the mobile emitter
and what were you planning on doing with these
those are the devices that will allow us to leave you just put them on our coats and well be on our way
youd like us to believe that wouldnt you
something tells me these are spirit charms we pin them on you and god knows what powers youll have
this is no charm its some kind of a machine
it doesnt matter they wont be telling us the truth about any of it
oh theyll tell us the truth all right theres more than one way to pluck the wings off a pixie well induce a trance give me biddy ramseys spoon keep your eyes on the silverware father
i hope you know this is blasphemous oh this is ridiculous i cant be hypnotised
i cant isolate the doctors programme
hes been integrated into the fair haven matrix hes vulnerable
tell us the words how do we banish the spirit folk to the other world
there is no other world only voyager
voyager
federation starship intrepid class registry number ncc74656
youre from some sort of vessel
mmmhmm
hes talking gibberish
maybe hes not this ship of yours is that where you took me
look here it says if you can get a spirit to reveal his true name youll render yourself impervious to his charms
what is your true name
i havent decided on one yet
katies on that ship isnt she tell me where to find her so i can get to the bottom of this
im sorry michael i cant do that
then i guess im asking the wrong person  tell me how to get to voyager
what are you doing sullivan
no man whos gone to the other world has ever come back
i have how do i get there
captain the mobile emitter has been activated
lock onto the signal
i had a cousin went to america he saw some strange things but nothing like this
youre not in america this is a starship its called
voyager i know
should i transfer him back to the holodeck
no my name isnt katie oclare its kathryn janeway captain kathryn janeway its going to be difficult to explain maybe its best if i just show you
youve seen my world it seems fair that i should have a chance to see yours
captain
so this really is a starship but how can that be possible
have you ever read the time machine by h g wells
are you telling me youve travelled back through time
in a manner of speaking
thats patrick gibson and his cousin frank they work on the wharf theyre in my pub every saturday night for the rings tournament
youll find a lot of familiar faces on voyager weve been visiting your town for months
why
were explorers
im not letting you off the hook that easy kathryn janeway there must be more interesting places to explore than fair haven
can you think of any place youd rather be
i guess that leaves but one question how long are you planning on staying
well that depends if were still welcome
my door is always open but youre the captain of a starship im a barkeep
just because were from different worlds doesnt mean we cant care for each other
tuvok to janeway
go ahead
the situation has escalated
the townspeople have started to pile kindling at the base of three lampposts
in the village square
stand by
take them outside now
stay back
what are you doing
that might not be michael sullivan a demon could have taken his shape
its me milo ive been to the place they call voyager and ive brought katie back with me
ive come in hopes that we can resolve our differences peacefully
peacefully im sure thats what you told the people of killmannin
they had nothing to do with what happened in killmannin if it happened at all
were truly sorry for whats happened here we never meant to frighten anyone
seamus you were right about one thing they are quite different from us but not in so many ways that we cant be friends
and were not spirit folk some of our technology may seem like magic but i assure you its not
katie showed me things that are beyond our comprehension they have machines that i cant begin to describe but not once have they used them against us quite the opposite in fact milo you said you didnt like the rain and young harry kim made it go away edith mulchaey herself said that katie oclare pulled her daughter from the well and out of harms way these are not the deeds of spirits and mischief makers
but they turned maggie into a cow
thatll never happen again i swear
there you see we have his word and if we cant trust a mans word in fair haven what can we trust
if you want well leave and never bother you again but wed prefer to find some way to keep our friendship alive
captain
i for one would like to keep playing rings with harry and tom keep having neelixs steamed cabbage at the ox and lamb keep taking walks with katie lets not turn our backs on these good people if we do were only punishing ourselves just because were from different worlds doesnt mean we cant care for each other
if were going to retain the programme we cant keep running it around the clock
not until weve repaired these damaged systems
not ever weve pushed the limits of holotechnology and they pushed back if we try it again were just asking for trouble
im afraid were going to have to close your open door policy
yes maam
what about the characters should i purge their memories of the last few days
no leave them
they think were spacemen from the future it wont exactly be like old times
we learn to accept alien species with new technologies lets hope the people of fair haven will learn to accept us but before we shut down the programme and begin repairs what do you say to one more round at sullivans my treat
you may be from the moon tommy boy but ive got three shillings that says i can still whip you at rings
oh youre on
hello harry
ill catch up with you later
tommy boy ive been told theres a pot of gold somewhere in glen abbey would you be able to find it with one of those fancy machines of yours
just follow the rainbow seamus
rainbow eh
i didnt think youd ever speak to me again
well i suppose i can forgive and forget its not that often you meet a handsome young man from outer space
whats this christmas come early
it has for you open it
a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court by mark twain ive read some of his books but not this one
its about two people from different times who fall in love among other things
sounds familiar maybe i have read it thank you katie or kathryn now is it
och
they say if you know a spirits true name that it renders you impervious against her charm do you think theres any truth in that
not a word
im glad to hear it
tamvitte meiote rel mestal
mestal teiote senve
siote vensuil bekta
tamvitte meiote sendaya voyager federation starship voyager if you can hear me please respond
if you can hear me please respond voyager please respond
come on voyager i know youre there
hello
voyager are you receiving this transmission
my designation is mezoti
you sound a little young to be working the comm
im eight
i see are there any grownups i could speak to
my species is six eight nine
norcadian what species are you
thats a complicated question
explain
i dont know how long i can keep this channel open
i need you to patch me through to captain janeway
ill try but my height may be insufficient
hello voyager
mezoti you are not authorised to be in here
are you going to report me to the captain
considering this is your first offence a warning will suffice
what were my instructions
to wait in the cargo bay until you returned
why didnt you comply
you left the children unsupervised
lieutenant torres required my assistance in engineering i was gone for less than ten minutes
we told her not to deviate from your instructions she wouldnt listen
when the captain asked you to take charge of these children you assured her that you could maintain order
controlling them is proving more difficult than i anticipated theyre highly unpredictable
meditation helps vulcan children to control their emotions you might consider
mezoti
im trying to talk to the woman
what woman
the one transmitting from spatial grid two three six nine
shes made contact with a small ship approximately three light years from here
alien vessel this is the starship voyager respond
tuvok its you isnt it
this is lieutenant commander tuvok
sounds like someone got promoted i want to hear all about it but first i need to speak to captain janeway
youre a sight for sore eyes captain you too harry
im sorry but do we know you
im ensign lyndsay ballard i was a member of your crew of course im not surprised you dont recognise me
i dont know who you are but im not amused ensign ballard died almost
it was on stardate 51563 i cant blame you for being sceptical captain but if you let me come aboard i can explain everything
well beam you to sickbay
im sure youll want me behind a level ten force field
no offence
none taken im just glad to be home
captain what do you think
she seems to have intimate knowledge of this ship and its crew i think we should find out who she is
captain id like to come with you i was very close to lyndsay and if somehow its her ill know
harry and i were on our way to a class m planet in the vyntadi expanse to recover dilithium ore wed detected a few days earlier when we landed we realised it was a trap set by a hirogen hunting party theyd reconfigured a power cell to give off false dilithium readings
thats exactly what happened
go on
harry and i headed back to the shuttle we were ten feet away when i was hit with a neural disrupter harry said my injury wasnt that bad he always was a terrible liar
i tried to get lyndsay back to voyager but she was already dead we buried her in space
go on with your story
i woke up on a ship in a stasis chamber surrounded by aliens they told me theyd used their technology to reanimate me i didnt believe them when they said id died but they showed me visual scans of my own corpse lying in the torpedo casing id been buried in the kobali said id been drifting for weeks
kobali
if you ever met them youd remember they look just like this after the reanimation process they spent months altering my dna they were constantly scanning me injecting me
just to make you look like one of them
thats how they procreate they salvage the dead of other races i was given a kobali name and placed with a family to help me acclimate
you were a prisoner
at first i wanted to contact you to tell you i was safe but the kobali wouldnt let me they said you were part of my kynsteya my my past life and that i needed to forget you all of you so i spent two years letting my new family think id accepted them when i finally earned their trust i stole a shuttle and started looking for voyager that was six months ago theyve been chasing me ever since
in spite of her appearance im detecting traces of human dna ive compared them with the genetic samples from ensign ballards file they match
its certainly a convincing story
but your starfleet training is telling you to consider all the possibilities maybe im some sort of hybrid clone or telepath who accessed ensign ballards memory somehow believe me i was suspicious myself at first but i am lyndsay ballard
until we find evidence to the contrary welcome home
captain could you give us a minute
doctor
so its really you
in the flesh so to speak
ive missed you too
i know youre all as eager as i am to welcome ensign ballard back shes a fine officer whos shown a lot of courage and determination over the past few years and were lucky to have her with us again lets do everything we can to make her feel at home
tom and i have already taken the liberty of removing lyndsays personal effects from storage
and whenever youre ready your old shift is waiting for you in engineering
thanks lieutenant
before we get ahead of ourselves lets not forget the kobali are still out there
it seems they want her back as much as we want to keep her well need to take precautions in case they track her to voyager
ive run preliminary scans on the kobali shuttle i believe i can adapt our systems to counter a possible attack
very good well if theres no further business
thank you for saying those nice things about me
you seem surprised
to be honest i never thought you noticed me
my mistake
so you still playing the clarinet
actually ive taken up the saxophone
ambitious i bet youre good at it
you always were my biggest fan
please no past tense
sorry this is a little strange for me
really its been a perfectly normal day for me
deck two
it just so happens that hearing you play music again is number twenty six on my list
list
something i made up to pass the time while i was away i tried to think of everything i would do if i got back to voyager including some things i wasnt able to accomplish the first time i was here
like showing up for duty shifts on time
thats number twenty seven
theyre here
ah why dont you and i have a cup of tea while the children play
thank you but they require my supervision
i like your braid
i could show you how to do it
mezoti
something wrong
ive allotted one hour for recreational activity theres no time for irrelevant conversation
its not irrelevant
adhering to our schedule will allow us to use our time more efficiently well be able to participate in
a wider variety of activities
fun will now commence
green grid three thirteen
counter grid ten
theyre cheating
how
azan is using his neural interface to share information
is this true you will exercise punishment protocol nine alpha
if they cannot participate neither will i
you are encouraging disorder
and you never let us do what we want
you will exercise punishment protocol nine alpha
no i wont
there you go
i cant believe you saved all this
tuvok thought i should recycle everything but i just couldnt bring myself to do it
my skates and i thank you from the bottom of our hearts
do you know how long it took me to fold those
same old harry
whats that supposed to mean
youre still sort of obsessive
im tidy
is that why you used to request baryon sweeps of your dorm room
when you live across the hall from a slob
hey show some respect for the dead did i say something wrong
its nothing
just because ive been gone for three years doesnt mean i cant still read you like a book
i gave the eulogy at your funeral
oh whatd you say come on its everyones fantasy to hear their own eulogy
absolutely not
its probably for the best you always were a terrible public speaker i just hope you didnt stutter too much
i told them you had a favourite saying something you got from an old klingon battle cry
own the day
i said that you always believed in attacking each day possessing it and that that was what made you so much fun to be around
is that when everybody burst into tears
i said that if youd been there you would have told them to own that day to attack it make it their own and plan to do the same thing tomorrow
pretty strong stuff
you were a strong person
not always these last six months havent been easy there were plenty of times when i could have given up
but you didnt
you know why you i wanted to see you again hmm guess i wont be needing this anymore
sickbay to ensign ballard ive finished analysing your bioscans
im on my way
my scans identified a genetic pathogen in your bloodstream it appears to have converted most of your human dna into a kobali protein structure
is there any way to reverse it
the biochemical changes have affected every system in your body im afraid there isnt enough of your original dna left to make you human again but i believe i can affect some cosmetic changes
are you saying you could make me look like me again
yes the alternations would literally be skindeep and it may take several treatments but ive devised an inaprovaline compound which should do the trick physiologically youd still be kobali with a multispheric brain a binary cardiovascular system
but id look human
oh yes
ive lived with this face for long enough lets do it
have a seat you may experience some dizziness
ill hang onto harry for support if he doesnt mind
thats what im here for
what something wrong
see for yourself
here we are one jibelian berry salad
i have been looking forward to this for a very long time
it was number six on her list
there isnt much variety in the kobali diet i ate the same grey paste for three years it doesnt taste the way i remember it
whats wrong too sweet
no offence but its got sort of a metallic flavour
seems fine to me
i guess my taste buds are still kobali
can i get you something else
thanks but i need to take care of number sixteen dazzle lieutenant torres
one minute early
theres a first time for everything
an alignment error has been cropping up in the dilithium matrix we cant seem to figure out whats causing it i i know that youre still settling in so ill give you a couple of days to
its a vyktiote
excuse me
oh a kobali word to describe a certain kind of wave phenomenon its hard to translate
try me
literally it means crumpled dance all i need to do is vyqtal the qendioqe matrices stabilise the percheya teztel se menna chambioque what
you were speaking kobali
i didnt realise im sorry
well whatever you did the alignment error is gone nice job
thanks
i think there might be a few crumpled dances in the warp core too feel like taking a look
any sign of the kobali
none
the latest tactical reports from tuvok
commander i no longer wish to serve as guardian to the borg children
whats the problem
their behaviour is chaotic my attempts to apply discipline only result in further disorder
well kids and disorder usually go hand in hand
neelix issued a similar warning prior to my taking this assignment which is why i devised an activities schedule to promote focus and unity oh seven hundred hours the children emerge from their alcoves nutrients are ingested in the mess hall prior to proceeding to the science lab to begin classes at thirteen hundred hours nutrients are consumed a second time before reporting to the holodeck where theyre studying comparative alien physiology
doesnt sound like theres much time for fun
on the contrary ive scheduled recreational activities
you cant always schedule fun seven sometimes it needs to be spontaneous
according to my research children require structure
i agree but not to this extreme youre treating them like theyre still on a borg cube
youre comparing me to the collective
you have all four children functioning as one they do the same things together at the same time
so that each child has the same opportunities to learn
theyre individuals maybe theyre rebelling because you dont let them express themselves
then grant my request choose a more suitable crew member to instruct them
sorry seven permission denied
well i see youre finally going to try my hockey programme
actually im taking lyndsay skating
oh you two sure have been spending a lot of time together lately
dont start
oh now lets see for those of us keeping score harry kim has fallen for a hologram a borg the wrong twin and now the dearly departed
were friends just like before all right maybe there was a time when i thought of pursuing lyndsay but i closed the door on that when we both got assigned to voyager
hmm dont look now but that door is creaking open
what do you think
you look great
doctor thought i should stick to my original colour but this seemed more exciting
hair is one of my specialties despite evidence to the contrary
its just too bad that beneath this beautiful red hair still lies the sixlobed brain of a kobali
well are you feeling human enough for a little skating
id love to but i already have a date
who with
the captain shes invited me to her quarters for dinner
in six years i have never been invited to the captains quarters for dinner
well ill give her your regards
oh damn
come in formal dress wasnt required ensign
well i just i figured dinner with the captain
id hardly call this dinner my replicator decided to liquefy the pot roast
it looks fine to me
stop trying to get on my good side and grab a slice of bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches i hope you dont mind
not at all i lived on them at the academy
so how was your first day back on the job
pretty good i think lieutenant torres called my work competent
trust me thats high praise coming from belanna commander tuvok finished his analysis of your shuttle and presented me with thirty seven different ways of repelling a kobali attack
did he include your pot roast im sorry i didnt mean i cant believe i just said that
why it was funny were not on the bridge lyndsay you have permission to speak freely
do you really mean that
i wouldnt have said it otherwise
then theres something ive wanted to ask you for a long time why me
im sorry
why did you choose me for that away mission
why i suppose i thought you were best suited for the job
no i wasnt dilithium extraction was always lieutenant torres specialty and tuvok had far more experience conducting away missions but you didnt send either one of them was it because they were closer to you
you blame me
no no thats not what i meant
its okay lyndsay
no its not
im not offended
no you dont understand never harbour anger toward those who brought you death for they gave you the chance to live again in letting me die captain you gave me life im sorry
lyndsay
im sorry i shouldnt have come
youre late
we expected you hours ago
for what
your farewell party
you werent supposed to come back
you dont belong here anymore
harry whats going on
lyndsay ballard beloved friend and crewman does that sound right
what
for your eulogy does that sound okay
harry im not dead
denial one of the final stages
it was illogical for you to return
please i dont want to go
i couldnt save you before lyndsay what makes you think i can save you now
jento kasiote jhetleya
come in
whats wrong
bad day i guess
belanna told me you did great in engineering
i solved a simple problem
didnt sound so simple to me
any kobali can discern simple wave distortions and even if belanna was impressed the others were staring at me
im sure it was just your imagination
and then to make matters worse i started babbling in front of the captain
i used to get pretty nervous around her too dont worry im sure she didnt take it personally hey i know this isnt easy but ill help you through this
you have always been far too nice to me why is that
you really dont have any idea do you think about it i rearranged my schedule at the academy just so wed be in the same classes i let you teach me how to skate even though i hate the cold im crazy about you i have been since the day we met
why didnt you ever tell me
i was never good at public speaking remember but i figure how often do you get a second chance which is why id very much like to kiss you now
own the day
sorry
you are creating disorder seven will be angry
i dont care
theyre cubes
i can see that
precisely one one thousandth the size of a borg vessel
well done
a twenty six sided polyhedron composed of hexagons octagons and squares
impressive whats this
cant you tell its you
i dont see the resemblance
look heres your ocular implant your nose your mouth
you were instructed to create a geometric shape
i reminded her of that she wouldnt comply
this was more fun dont you like it
it is crude however it does demonstrate ingenuity and individuality
she deviated from your instructions arent you going to implement a punishment protocol
no resume your disorder
lyndsay
theyre coming
red alert raise shields
were being hailed
on screen
ive come for jhetleya
if youre referring to ensign ballard shes made it clear that she doesnt want to go with you
shes my daughter please ive come a long way i only want to speak with her
you dont have to see him you know they cant make you
i want to harry its time to stop running
i appreciate this captain
im willing to oblige as long as you understand that this meeting is over as soon as ensign ballard says it is
what have they done to you
given me my life back
you were so beautiful its good to see you jhetleya
my name is lyndsay
why did you leave us
i wanted to be with my people again
these people the same ones who set you adrift in space
we jettisoned her body in accordance with our customs
you abandoned her
you had no right to tamper with her remains
we were acting in accordance with our customs
you mutilated her
ensign
the reanimation process usually results in extensive memory loss which makes the transition less painful unfortunately some remember their former lives more than others jhetleya for example
i told you to call me
lyndsay ballard shes dead she has been for three years forgive me for being so blunt but when we found her she was a lifeless corpse we salvaged that raw material to create a new person my daughter whom i love
im not your daughter
you may have altered your appearance but do you still think like these people even now the first words that come into your head are they in their language or mine i realise this place is familiar to you but its not where you belong your sister misses you
tynsia
she keeps asking when youre coming home what should i tell her
tell her that her sisters dead
ill escort you to the transporter room
i wont give her up captain
she made her wishes clear
shes confused
thanks to what you did to her
i dont want to fight you
your ship is no match for voyager
every life is precious to my people captain i wont be coming back alone
midnight snack
kobali cuisine at its finest
so i was giving some thought to number thirty two make tuvok laugh he has this holoprogramme the temple of tpanit i thought we might tweak it so that instead of vulcan prayers the monks recite ferengi limericks youre not laughing
sorry i cant stop thinking about qret
i cant believe he had the nerve to call himself your father ill bet professor ballard would have had something to say about that
who
your dad doesnt he teach at some university
i dont remember i dont remember anything about him
lets get down to the holodeck weve got some monks to tweak
sure
whats wrong
why did she start to revert all of a sudden
our old friend the pathogen its adapting to counteract my treatments its possible shell suffer occasional relapses for the rest of her life
you said you could maintain my appearance
i can but it looks like ill need to increase the frequency of your treatments youll have to see me at least twice a day
how am i supposed to do my job if im in here all the time how am i supposed to do anything
please try to understand
stoigia netstaika pendaeli shevaob im sorry
wow this place sure is lived in
if youre here to lecture me about cleanliness
im here to ask you to stop the treatments
you know what happens if i do
youll look kobali again so what i thought you were cute bald i dont care if youre human kobali or bolian i just want you to be happy
i wouldnt fit in
are you saying tuvok and neelix dont fit in
thats different they got to grow up in their own cultures they know where they come from who they are
wherever they come from theyre part of this crew now just like you
lyndsay was part of this crew if i stop the treatments i wont be lyndsay anymore
you dont honestly believe that
since the day i got back here i havent felt right at first i thought it was voyager things had changed so much i thought if i just gave myself more time id get used to it but its me ive changed and the more i try to deny it the more i feel like a ghost im sorry harry but i cant keep fighting anymore
what about us
the girl you were in love with died three years ago
shields down to forty eight percent
target the lead ships weapons array
life supports failing on decks six through ten
reroute power to compensate
shields at twenty percent
hail them tell them youll surrender me
dont listen to her captain
i appreciate the gesture lyndsay but im not giving you up
its not a gesture i want to go i dont belong here
shes not well she doesnt know what shes saying
i know exactly what im saying
shields at thirteen percent
im detecting power fluctuations in the lead vessels warp drive a polaron burst could overload the core
that would destroy the ship
theyre not leaving us much choice
whatever we do we have to do it fast
youre sure this is what you want
captain i can fire that polaron burst myself
stand down ensign
we cant just let them take her
even if you stop them i cant stay on voyager
i dont want to lose you
you already did but at least this time weve been given the chance to say goodbye
vienke debala jhetleya i taught myself to say a few words in kobali
thats very sweet of you but you just told me the comets are tiresome
i guess id better work on my pronunciation im sorry you didnt get to finish everything on your list
i think i took care of what really mattered
thats pretty
it belonged to a friend of mine would you like it
your friend wont mind
i think shed be happy knowing i gave it to someone with such pretty hair
sevens letting us go to the holodeck by ourselves she says we can run any programme we want do you want to come
have you ever heard of the temple of tpanit its a vulcan programme
sounds boring
dont worry well make a few tweaks
why potatoes
their first idea was to clone naomi but i suggested they start with something smaller
quite a feat of engineering
its a teirenian ant colony i infused the soil with a blue ion dye so itd be easier to see the insects
theyre luminescent
the drones produce a fluorescent enzyme thats activated by the queen
drones and queens i thought we were trying to get these children away from the borg
the project was mezotis idea i didnt want to discourage her individuality
i like bugs
well done let me know before you take up beekeeping
what have we got here
its kataris
your fathers planet
ive been learning all about it
naomi programmed the geophysical and atmospheric conditions
theres quite a storm in those mountains
the arpasian range is known for high winds and hail
ill remember to bring my coat now this looks impressive
its a highresolution gravimetric sensor array
ambitious
itll augment our ability to scan for the neutrino flux associated with wormholes it could help voyager find a faster way home
the engineering principles are sound
i expected these projects to be interesting but this is truly exceptional
thank you captain i am very interested in astrophysics
well youve obviously got a knack for it well done
how did you think of scanning for neutrino fluctuations
ive been studying starfleet records
hes a remarkable young man
he hopes to earn a permanent posting in astrometrics one day
im afraid that wont be possible
captain the boy has a unique talent
its not a question of merit weve made contact with his parents and ive set a course for their planet
my scanner is calibrated to pick up changes in neutrino trajectories
thats good news
youve exceeded your scheduled time here by one hour
im almost finished
your work will have to wait theres something we need to discuss
look at this its a star forming in the orpisay nebula
the orpisay nebula is out of range of our sensors
i increased the resolution of the long range scanners
impressive
when i was on the cube i never thought about what was outside pulsars quasars nebulas but here in this lab i feel i can see the entire galaxy what did you want to talk to me about you said there was something we needed to discuss
yes thats correct its time for you to regenerate
come in
id like the data youve collected on ichebs species so i can prepare him for reassimilation
maybe we could refer to it as getting reacquainted with his family
if you prefer
ill transfer the files down to astrometrics
thank you
howd he take the news you havent told him
no
why not
it wont be easy for him to accept hes adapted to life on voyager
and youve adapted to having him here
my feelings are irrelevant
are they would you like me to tell him
its my responsibility but i am uncertain how to proceed
well youve already helped him make one difficult transition how did you do that
by giving him the benefit of my own experiences encouraging him to be resilient in the face of obstacles
sounds like a good strategy
is your alcove malfunctioning
im calculating neutrino trajectories
you need to regenerate
very well
wait weve located your parents voyager is due to arrive at their planet tomorrow
do i have to stay with them
theyre your parents
i dont remember them
after my parents were assimilated i never saw them again youre fortunate to have this chance
what about the others
we havent been able to locate their families yet
thats not what i mean what will happen to them if i leave they depend on me
theyll adapt
ill never see you again
ive been studying brunali culture its very different from what youve become accustomed to on voyager
in what way
theyre an agrarian society their technological resources are limited
are they capable of space travel
yes but most of their vessels were destroyed by the borg
how will i continue my studies
i dont know
icheb
im detecting scattered enclaves on the northern continent all with populations of fewer than ten thousand
judging from the residual gamma radiation it appears theyve suffered numerous borg attacks over the past decade
thats not surprising theres a borg transwarp conduit less than a light year away
not exactly prime real estate
tuvok run continuous scans for borg activity tom put us into synchronous orbit
yes maam
seven youd better get icheb
according to these scans youre in perfect health
then why does my stomach feel so strange
oh i should have known youve got butterflies in there
i never assimilated butterflies
its an expression used to describe anxiety or apprehension both of which are perfectly natural reactions for someone about to meet his long lost parents if its any comfort im sure theyre just as nervous about meeting you
parents are irrelevant
really do you think naomis mother is irrelevant to her
i have seven of nine to assist me in my education i have you to care for my medical needs
your parents can nurture you in ways this crew cant they can explain the brunali culture share their experiences with you
you didnt have parents
no but
you adapted to serve a vital function about this vessel forged relationships with its crew all without the benefit of parents
i had my programming to fall back on
and how would your programming respond if you were asked to live with strangers
are you damaged
hes fine i was just giving him a last minute checkup
its time
the butterflies will go away
hello im captain janeway
icheb
youve grown
he spent several months in a borg maturation chamber
this is seven of nine
thats a borg designation isnt it
like your son i was liberated from the collective
seven has been instrumental in helping icheb make his transition
then were very grateful to you im leucon ichebs father this is his mother yifay
how are you
fine
do these hurt you
no
were very happy to have you back with us mala remi yivel
welcome home icheb
i would like to return to voyager now
thank you for coming
wheres icheb
i thought it might be better if we talked ourselves first
what exactly is there to discuss
how to make this transition easier for your son please sit down
it wont be easy for him to give up the luxuries of your ship
its more than a question of luxuries icheb has special medical needs
we have a physician in our settlement
we should arrange for him to consult with our doctor
he also requires daily regeneration
im sure you can adapt some of our technology to make that possible
what about his educational requirements
our children go to school
will he be able to continue his studies in astrometrics and spatial harmonics
if icheb has an aptitude for science im sure hell find that we have a great deal to teach him
for example
weve developed sophisticated techniques in agricultural genetics which allow us to grow crops in an inhospitable environment
icheb has expressed no interest in agriculture
im sure once hes been exposed to the subject hell find it quite challenging
theres still the issue of his safety
were perfectly capable of protecting our son
your proximity to a borg conduit makes you extremely vulnerable im curious if youve ever considered relocating
seven
no its all right captain this planet is our home we will never leave it we will defend it against the borg or anyone else who threatens us
your courage is admirable but unrealistic
wait for me in my ready room
captain
now
i apologise for her behaviour she and icheb have grown very close but thats no excuse for rudeness
wed like to see our son now
please be patient if we rush things your next encounter with him may not go any better than the last stay aboard voyager for a while itll give icheb a chance to get to know you in an environment thats familiar to him ill have neelix do everything he can to make you comfortable while youre here
your attitude is making a difficult situation worse
i was simply attempting to insure ichebs wellbeing
by insulting his parents
those issues needed to be discussed
you could have done it with a little more tact
perhaps but that doesnt alter the fact that those individuals may not be suitable guardians
those individuals are his mother and father
which is no guarantee that theyll be able to care for him hes far more likely to flourish if he remains on voyager
are you ordering him off the ship
thats not what i said
so that he can be assimilated again
what makes you so sure thats going to happen
they shouldnt remain on that planet
its their home
its not worth protecting
who are you to decide that
anyone who values their own goals over the safety of their children is irresponsible
are we talking about ichebs parents or yours
both
its not like you to admit to something like that
it would be naive for me to claim objectivity in this case but im not prepared to return icheb to parents who may be as careless as my own
i know what its like to feel protective towards someone youve helped through a difficult period but icheb is an individual now you have to give him a chance to form his own opinions
if i do and he decides to remain on voyager
then itll be my problem
is your mother pretty what are they like
im busy
i never met my father
i dont remember ours
neither do i
are you going to stay with them
if you leave who is going to help us with our science projects
if you dont stop asking questions im going to put all of you in a cargo container and transport you back to the borg
come with me
where
to dinner with your parents
im working
you can continue your work after the meal
i dont have anything to talk about with them
then it will be a very quiet evening
im not going
your attendance is not optional
enjoy your meal
come sit down
i prefer to stand
mister neelix let me use his galley to prepare some poma
im not hungry
it was your favourite food when you were little
im not little anymore
no no youre not
your mother worked hard on that meal couldnt you at least try it
good isnt it
nice to see the family back together again isnt it
when you were little you would only eat the inside
the borg didnt leave us much to work with but we didnt need much just a little ingenuity everything you see we built with our own hands our homes cultivation bays
whats this
a genetic resequencer we use it to alter the dna of certain plants to conform with environmental conditions
you built this as well
we adapted parts from damaged vessels nothings been wasted
efficient
efficiencys one attribute we share with the borg in our case its a necessity i know our settlement seems primitive compared to voyager but i promise you that will change
what about space travel
someday well have ships that rival voyager but we need the dedication of young people like you to help us
icheb how are you
well thank you
maybe later you can join us up on the field for a game of pala
i dont remember how to play
it will come back to you
you used to be quite an athlete you can make a difference here icheb
i dont know anything about agriculture or genetics
it wont take you long to learn not with a mind like yours
its time to return to voyager
i am staying here tonight
they dont have a regeneration unit
were going to have to install one eventually might as well do it now
as far as i am aware he hasnt decided to remain here yet
but he has asked to stay tonight
return with me to the ship well prepare a regeneration unit
ive adapted this neural transceiver to interface with the portable regenerator it has enough power to complete one full cycle
well have to devise a way of recharging it
if icheb decides to stay
my wife and i appreciate everything youve done for our son its obvious you care about him
hes a unique individual
yes he is to get him back is well a miracle
how was he taken
since the borg first attacked us weve taken great pains to hide whatever new technology we develop
so the passing cubes wont be attracted to your planet
unfortunately we havent always been successful one morning about four years ago icheb heard me talking about a new fertilisation array wed constructed in the lower field he wanted to see it i told him id take him the next day but he was impatient the way boys can be i never even realised hed wandered off when the alarm sounded it turns out the borg were just as interested in our new technology as icheb was they took him and assimilated everyone in the area if only id kept a closer eye on him
icheb has a mind of his own
but still its hard not to blame myself your parents mustve felt the same way when they lost you
my parents were with me when the borg attacked
i cant imagine what that must have been like for them watching their daughter being assimilated helpless to defend her
its important that icheb regenerate for six uninterrupted hours
i understand
he may resist he doesnt like to waste time ive had to contend with his lack of patience as well
theres a star called kelsin three to the west is the orlitus cluster there just above it when you connect those six stars they form what we call the great horn
i see it
you inherited your love of the stars from your father
being on that starship youve learned much more about astronomy than i have our little window cant compare to voyagers astrometrics lab
no but its nice
you see we have everything we need right here a warm fire good food that we grow ourselves and people who love us
icheb has people on voyager who love him too
youve grown attached to the crew on that ship havent you
theyve provided for me given me opportunities
theyre good people people whove experienced hardship themselves seven of nine told me about your science project she said it might prove very useful
its designed to detect wormholes
how will that benefit them
it may help them find a way back to earth
why is that so important to them
its their home
interesting isnt it
what
with all their technology their opportunity to explore the galaxy the thing they want most is to get home
good morning
did you regenerate successfully
yes and i slept under the stars you should try it
you werent in class this morning the others missed you
i was helping my father there is something we need to discuss
what is it youve decided to stay with them
yes
youre certain
this is my home i have a responsibility to help them rebuild it
ill inform the captain
thank you
im sure youll want to say goodbye to the other children
inside youll find padds containing data on a variety of subjects that will allow you to continue your studies ive also included a highresolution telescope its a poor substitute for astrometric sensors
i will use it every day
goodbye icheb and good luck
thank you captain i hope you find a way home
warning regeneration cycle incomplete
what is it
i cant regenerate
warning regeneration cycle incomplete
explain
i miss icheb
so do i but well adapt now return to your alcove
if you find my parents will i have to go with them
well discuss that when and if the time comes
i hope you dont find them
regenerate
seven
yes
what if the borg try to assimilate icheb again
his people lack resources the borg have little reason to return to their planet
but what if ichebs on a ship
unlikely
he was on a ship last time
youre mistaken he was on the surface when he was assimilated
no he wasnt a class one transport was detected in grid six four nine one lifeform species brunali
this better be important
it is
sorry i dont read borg youll have to translate
this is tactical data from the cube where we found the children it says that icheb was alone aboard an unarmed transport vessel when the borg took him
oh why are you telling me this at oh three hundred hours
ichebs father told me the boy was assimilated on the planets surface
is it possible you misunderstood
no he was very specific
that cube was disabled by a deadly pathogen it suffered extensive damage isnt it possible these records were corrupted
perhaps but i found another inconsistency in leucons story he told me icheb was assimilated four years ago but further analysis indicates the borg attacked three times during the last decade nine years ago six years ago and again last year
all right lets assume your information is accurate what does it prove
his father was lying
why would he do that
im not certain but we have an obligation to find out
what are you proposing
that we return to the planet demand an explanation
those people have been through enough do we really need to interrogate them
we have a responsibility to ensure ichebs safety
he chose to stay with his parents
maybe he didnt have all the information
just because they werent completely candid with you doesnt mean theyre unfit parents at some point you have to let go
i know what youre thinking that im having emotional difficulty accepting my separation from icheb and youre correct but if theres a possibility hes in danger even a remote one i have to do whatever i can to protect him if i dont ill be no better than my own parents
couldnt we at least wait a few days
what would that accomplish
hes just getting settled
the longer we wait the harder itll be for everyone you know that
why do it at all theres nothing compelling us to go through with it
its what he was born for
hasnt he been through enough why not give him a chance at an ordinary life
hes not an ordinary child
no but he can help us in other ways hes bright hes hardworking
leucon his return was a gift we cant waste it
i dont want to lose him a second time
to survive we all have to make sacrifices you taught me that
we won three games in a row
sit down icheb we need to talk you know that youre very important to us
yes
what you dont know is why
what do you mean what is that
if you relax it wont hurt you
father
youd better hold him
what are you doing to me
no
prepare the launch
hail them
we didnt expect to see you again captain
wed like to ask you a few questions if you dont mind
questions
regarding icheb and the circumstances of his assimilation
weve already discussed that
the story you told me was inconsistent with our data
we dont owe you any explanations
in that case id like to talk to icheb
hes not here
where is he
thats not your concern
scan for his biosigns
he is not in the settlement
im detecting a brunali transport vessel distance nine million kilometres its heading for the coordinates of the transwarp conduit
according to these readings that ship is travelling at warp nine point eight
it only looks that way its been designed to emit a false warp signature strong enough to penetrate subspace
theyre using it as bait to attract the borg
ichebs on that vessel isnt he
hes fighting for his people
alone on an unarmed transport
we dont have particle weapons or powerful starships at our disposal were forced to use the only resource we have
your children
no our genetic expertise
ichebs not bait hes a weapon the first cube that captured him was infected by a pathogen icheb was the carrier wasnt he
every time we try to rebuild begin to make progress the borg come and take it away from us
tom set a course for that transport vessel full impulse
aye captain
you have no right to interfere
were trying to save our civilisation
by taking away ichebs future
if we dont stop the borg the brunali have no future
captain a borg ship will emerge from that conduit at any moment youll be destroyed
well take our chances end transmission red alert battle stations
were coming within range captain
im picking up ichebs life signs bioscans indicate hes unconscious
transport him to sickbay
i cant theres some kind of interference
its the conduit by my estimate a borg vessel will emerge in less than forty seconds
transfer auxiliary power to the transporters
i still cant establish a lock not at this distance
thirty seconds
tom get us closer to that ship
yes maam
the conduits opening twenty seconds
seven
still out of range
you heard her tom
when that borg ship comes through im going to have a hell of a time getting away from it
one problem at a time
ten seconds nine eight
ive got a lock
seven
transport in progress
five
hes in sickbay
three two one
get us out of here maximum
target their tractor beam generator
phasers targeted
fire
no effect
we are the borg you will be assimilated resistance is futile
perhaps not there is a way to get a weapon through their shields
im listening
transport a photon torpedo to the brunali vessel set it to detonate soon as its inside the sphere
that will occur in approximately twenty seconds however voyager will be inside less than three seconds later
tom full reverse thrusters it might buy us a couple more seconds do it
transport complete detonation in ten nine
five
tom go to warp on my mark
three two
all hands brace for impact
now mister paris
the borg vessel has taken heavy damage they are not pursuing
are you saying his parents reinfected him
no they merely sedated him
i dont understand
he was genetically engineered to produce the pathogen from birth
bred to kill borg
is he in danger
i can suppress the pathogen hell be fine physically
hes going to need help coming to terms with whats happened
captain i
use your maternal instincts they worked before
i thought you were studying spatial harmonics
my parents suggested i might have an aptitude for genetics as well
i see what have you learned
this is the genome of a typical brunali male and this is my dna theyre nearly identical but do you notice the differences in the third thirteenth and seventeenth chromosomes
yes
my parents made microgenetic alterations so i would produce the pathogen quite ingenious
its also barbaric
they were trying to defend themselves their way of life preserve their species
i know how difficult it is to acknowledge your parents faults but what they did was wrong you dont have to forgive them
do you think they will ever forgive me
for what
i could have destroyed that sphere i failed them
you would have been reassimilated
i know but
but what
maybe it was my destiny
maybe in the future you may choose to fight the borg but youll do it in your own way youre an individual and you have the right to determine your own destiny its time to regenerate
and if i prefer to continue studying
its your decision
come in
seven of nines shipwide efficiency analysis
did we get a passing grade
barely she wants to present it to the senior staff
put her on the schedule
well be passing by a class t cluster in the next couple of days gas giants radiogenic sources im not sure its worth altering course
at the very least we should send the delta flyer for a look and lets get a full range of sensor scans as we get closer
well go to a level three analysis of the cluster tom get the flyer ready and assemble an away team harry start continuous scans
kim to seven of nine
proceed ensign
any chance you could increase radiogenic resolution in the long range sensors
the captain wants to get a cleaner look at that cluster coming up off starboard
acknowledged take these specifications to lieutenant torres
right away
deck eleven
whats our borg queen want now we need to route at least another five terawatts to the sensor array
deck fifteen
hello
sorry to interrupt
im about to disprove schlezholts theory of multiple big bangs of course i had to demolish wangs second postulate to do it
power transfer requisition
youre standing in the way of cosmological history
the cosmos is sixteen billion years old it can wait another few minutes
schlezholt would thank you for the reprieve
billy billy wake up
what do you want
i need help
good night
billy dont you dare go back to sleep
whats the problem
im in trouble
go
to sleep
help me first
with what
this level three sensor analysis ive got four hours of subspace infrared to interpret
long range scans on that cluster up ahead
yes
its too complicated
to do over the comm either we meet in the mess hall or we wait until tomorrow
i dont want to get dressed
and it cant wait until tomorrow
your only options
ive given operations an efficiency rating of seventy six out of a possible one hundred
not exactly flying colours
the crewmen you assigned to the night shift are frequently left with little to do once the ships course has been locked in
the devil finds work for idle hands
religious metaphors are irrelevant perhaps you should consider assigning them additional tasks
whats this im guilty of failure to utilise expertise
crewman mortimer harren he has five advanced degrees in theoretical cosmology but youve assigned him to the plasma relay room his talents could be put to better use
belanna
believe me ive tried when i give him more responsibility he doesnt do the work harren wants to be down on deck fifteen it gives him more time to repostulate the origins of the universe
as you can see security is functioning at nearperfect efficiency however commander if you arrange the phasers in the weapons lockers so that the smaller rifles were in front they could be more easily removed in the event of an emergency
ill look into it
crewman william telfer
billy he certainly ruined my score
he visits the sickbay almost once a week complaining of illness invariably you examine him and find nothing wrong
mister telfer is a hypochondriac id treat him for it but hes afraid of medication
have you tried counselling
hes afraid of that too all i can do is scan him and offer him reassurance
wasting your time and medical resources
what about astrometrics looks like you could use some improvement yourself seven
you are correct unfortunately tal celes sensor analyst grade three her work must be constantly double checked she should be removed from astrometrics and reassigned elsewhere perhaps to engineering
forget it ive got my own problems to fix remember
thatll be all seven thank you dismissed
captain
theyve never been on an away mission mortimer harren william telfer tal celes none of them
they get off the ship whenever we have general leave
i mean a working away mission
harren never volunteers celes cant get past the proficiency requirements and telfer always seems to get a note from his doctor
somethings got to be done about this
what can we do there are always a few who dont make it past their first year on a starship normally theyre reassigned but in our case maybe we should relieve them of duty and let them pursue their own interests it certainly wouldnt hurt general efficiency
they arent drones chakotay we cant just deactivate them is the delta flyer ready
flightchecked with provisions for a seventy two hour away mission what have you got in mind captain
three people have slipped through the cracks on my ship that makes it my problem
the analytical aspects of the subspace infrared algorithm are fourfold
unfortunately i have a threefold brain
you just have to break it down think of it as four smaller algorithms
okay but whats the sequence
its zero g is fun as you were zeta particle derivation gamma wave frequency ion distribution flow rate of positrons zgif zero g is fun thats how you remember the sequence
thank you captain ill try
good because where were headed youre going to need it ill be briefing you this afternoon in astrometrics we leave first thing in the morning
deck fifteen
captain on the deck
at ease junction room sixteen
over there captain
of course crewman mitchell how have you been
never better maam yourself
not bad not bad at all
ah to the left maam
thank you
crewman harren
captain janeway are you lost
i was for a minute ill be briefing you this afternoon
well theres been a mistake
excuse me
you have me assigned to an away mission i have my duties here i prefer not to leave my post
ensign culhane will cover for you the preflight schedule is all there
if this is charity captain i dont want it
i didnt ask you what you want im taking the delta flyer on an astronomical survey mission and your expertise is needed
what do you know about my expertise
as much as i need to
well then you might be interested to know that im about to disprove schlezholts theory of multiple big bangs
really wangs second postulate has more lives than a cat doesnt it once you think youve eliminated it bam it pops up again ill give you a hand if youd like when the away mission is over
once we reach the cluster well drop out of warp and maintain one quarter impulse on the sweep through the protostars ill be piloting the delta flyer celes youre going to run an ongoing sensor analysis providing data for your colleagues mister harren youll be looking at subspace particle decay for anything new we might learn about star formation and mister telfer your job will be to look for signs of life a long shot in this environment but if its out there im sure youll find it youll have the rest of the evening to familiarise yourselves with the mission
excuse me captain if we find a planet were not planning on exploring the surface are we
thats a stellar nursery any planets will be gas giants
they may have moons
dont worry well run a complete scan for pathogens before we set foot anywhere and the delta flyer is fully equipped to deal with medical emergencies well be fine shuttlebay one oh six hundred hours dismissed
celes is unreliable her sensor analyses will be full of errors you could be putting your lives at risk
dont worry seven ill check her work
this mission could be better served with a more experienced crew
no not this mission ever hear the tale of the good shepherd if even one sheep strayed into the wilderness the shepherd left the safety of the flock and went after it
so youre intending to rescue them
in a manner of speaking maybe all it will take will be some personal attention from their captain maybe something more but i wont abandon a member of this crew no matter what their problems might be
oh poor guy rotting away down on deck fifteen counting the years till we get out of this godforsaken quadrant its a shame he doesnt have a superior officer who cares
its not my job to make everybody who works for me happy some people just dont want to fit in
ill bet you havent said two words to him
two words exactly we collided in the corridor during a borg attack i said excuse me since we were at red alert and about to be destroyed i think it was very considerate of me
well mister considerate why dont you go over there right now and offer him some encouragement his first away mission im sure he could use it
brushing up on the delta flyer specs
im not a mechanic
oh then what are you doing
very interesting
what do you find most interesting about it
your creative use of the minus sign
i see you have an appreciation for multivariate analysis maybe you missed your calling its a shame i imagine it gets tedious up at the helm
i enjoy the view
well
i invited him over to watch our television set tonight you dont mind do you
celes celes respond celes respond
youre not sick
yes i am
no youre not
really
i am
we have to sleep
i cant go on this mission
yes you can
no i cant
yes
no
bye
wait
see
its nothing
its a fever
your temperature is point two degrees above normal
thats right
a typical deviation easily prompted by emotional stress
or a multiphasic prion
you have not been infected by a prion
they attach themselves to the mitochondrial walls and they just
ive already scanned you
you can barely see them
they arent there
if they migrate to my cell membranes while im on the away mission they could rupture and i
crewman i am not giving you a medical excuse not this time try to get some sleep you shouldnt even have a medical tricorder believe me youll be so caught up in the excitement of exploration there wont be any time for worrying about infections mitochondrial or otherwise theres nothing like an away mission to remind a person of why were out here
im going to one quarter impulse
should i start the sensor sweeps
we dont want to miss anything
engine status
within parameters that wasnt us
anything on sensors
point zero zero five fluctuation in the spatial continuum it looks like simple background noise
i agree
anybody for lunch
are you volunteering william
yes maam
ill help what would you like captain
mortimer
even my mother didnt call me that
well then mister harren are you hungry
no thank you
ill have the pasta soup it should be listed under neelix six five one
maybe ill try that too
im sure youll like it
im sure i will thanks for the suggestion id better get back there
neelix six five one two servings
neelix six five one two servings whats wrong
the captain checks every single thing i do
oh thats just standard procedure
then why isnt it standard procedure for you or harren
maybe shes giving you special attention
yeah because she knows i need it i wish i could go back to voyager
me too theres always the escape pods
can you imagine
i understand you grew up on vico five no wonder you became a cosmologist
wildest sky in the alpha quadrant
so they say ive never been there
do you really believe that childhood environment is more important than genetically driven behaviour patterns
just making conversation
conversation filled with unspoken assumptions which i dont agree with im a product of my nucleic acids where and how i was raised are beside the point so if youre trying to understand me better questions about my home planet are irrelevant
all right then hows your thirteenth chromosome missing a couple of base pairs in gene one seventy eight
i signed on to voyager because i needed a year of handson experience it was a requirement for getting into the institute of cosmology on orion one if we hadnt gotten lost in the delta quadrant id be there right now
sorry to have delayed your career plans but all of us have had our lives interrupted thats the nature of space exploration its unpredictable
which is why i dont like space exploration stumbling from star to star like a a drunken insect careening toward a light source is not my idea of a dignified existence pure theory is all that concerns me
well im not trying to change that im simply trying to get every member of my crew working to their full capacity that includes you mister harren
you dont feel responsible captain for having three misfits aboard your ship well if theres anything i can do to help relieve your guilt please let me know
ill keep that in mind
maybe i will join my colleagues for lunch all this exploration has given me an appetite
computer identify the source of that spatial fluctuation
source unknown
red alert aft section report report
captain are you all right
we need to get propulsion back online and figure out what hit us whats out there
i dont know but whatever it was it tore a plating section off the outer hull
ninety percent of our antimatters been neutralised the reactions cold
so much for warp drive
im bringing the impulse engines online but theyve been damaged well be able to do one eighth impulse no more
that should get us to the rendezvous point with voyager in about ten years think theyll wait for us
is the subspace transmitter online voyager this is the delta flyer weve been hit by an unknown phenomenon and taken heavy damage we require immediate assistance repeat we require immediate assistance transmit that continuously on all subspace frequencies anything on active scans
not yet
it was a darkmatter protocomet
i read a paper on that phenomenon once
written by me
well enlighten us mister harren
i hypothesised that a tertiary product of stellar consolidation would be a cometlike assemblage of dark matter it would be attracted to any source of antimatter and neutralise it upon contact
so one of these things detected the antimatter in our warp core
the term detected suggests a consciousness this is a mindless astrophysical phenomenon nothing more we should eject our remaining antimatter or we could suffer another impact
i cant do that not on the basis of an unproven hypothesis
the forces involved are nontrivial if were hit again we could lose our entire outer hull
eject the warp core and we lose any hope of getting warp drive back i need more evidence and right now sensors arent talking
maybe they are talking but somebody doesnt know how to listen to them
youre out of line crewman
this isnt the time to be worried about her feelings captain were in trouble
captain that hull plate its less than ten kilometres away impact from a darkmatter body might have left a quantum signature in the alloys
thats the evidence were looking for do we have transporters
yes ive locked onto the plate
beam it directly to the aft section celes youre with me continue the repairs
no sign of burns or plasma residue it seems to have been sheared off download this into the main computer
captain im sorry
for what
i thought that spatial fluctuation we ran into was background noise some noise
i saw the same sensor readings you did and came to the same conclusion you dont have to doubt yourself all the time
yes i do and you should too youre right to always be looking over my shoulder
we all make mistakes even me
every day every time you report for duty on voyager it doesnt matter because nothing i do is that critical seven doesnt trust me with anything important the crew is protected from my mistakes by the people around me but out here i could get us killed
you went through starfleet training courses
i had to cram for every exam
at the academy i was infamous for my allnighters
every night because thats what it took thats the only way i made it through not to mention the sympathy votes the conflict on bajor worked in my favour the federation was so eager to have bajorans in starfleet that my instructors gave me the benefit of the doubt so did you when you accepted my application
you showed evidence of unconventional thinking i liked that not everybody would have thought to retrieve that hull plating
well just dont trust me with the analysis i guarantee ill get it wrong
well with that attitude im sure you will
this has nothing to do with attitude captain you and i are wired differently to you this is nothing but data to me it its a monster with with fangs and claws in my nightmares i am chased by algorithms my brain just wasnt built to understand this
we can find you another post on voyager
there isnt another post on voyager not for me unless you need a waitress in the mess hall
you know theres more to duty than the ability to manipulate algorithms everybody on voyager has showed a courage far beyond what i could have expected so have you
if we were still in the alpha quadrant would that be enough to keep me on board
i cant answer that
i dont deserve to be on your ship captain and im not really a part of voyager i just live there
pressures increasing the eps relays are fused cut the plasma flow cut the plasma  i could have been killed whats wrong with you
everything
if you want something to fantasise about try imagining how itll feel if our hull is breached and we die of vacuum exposure our blood will vaporise and our cell membranes will rupture surely you know the symptoms better than i do
lets not talk about it all right
nothing disagrees with me more than having to put theories into practical use but theres no choice so pay attention to what were doing here you can check yourself into sickbay when we get back
and you can go back to deck fifteen
thats right where i dont have to rely on you or your intellectually deficient friend
at least i have a friend dont you ever get lonely down there
in the company of my own thoughts never
i dont believe that spend some time with us when we get back you might enjoy yourself
a hypothesis that would require testing im a theoretician remember
our scans of the hull fragment were inconclusive we found some displaced positrons that could indicate a darkmatter impact
but could have been caused by something else
proof enough
not enough for me not enough to jettison the remaining antimatter theres a gas giant only a few hours from our current position t class surrounded by orbital rings including one thats radiogenic we could use those particles to reinitialise our warp reaction
with ten percent of our antimatter left wed only be able to make warp two but it would be enough to get us back on the road
set a course
another spatial fluctuation
can you localise it
its somewhere within the distance of ten thousand kilometres another one closer about seven thousand kilometres
its being drawn toward our antimatter eject the core
open a channel all hailing frequencies this is captain janeway of the federation vessel delta flyer we are on a mission of peaceful exploration please identify yourself
no response
of course not its a natural phenomenon captain we only have a few seconds
im firing a photon torpedo theres enough antimatter in the detonation chamber to draw that protocomet if thats what it is
the torpedos away distance one thousand kilometres one thousand five hundred
no spatial disruptions
find the source of that sound
oh no
thats not possible
where is he
i cant locate his biosignature
hes not out there hes not in space not in subspace it doesnt make sense
inside me
activate the transporter try to get a lock on whatevers inside him tricorder isnt picking up anything
but i can feel it
i cant get a lock its like something is there but its not there
oh its there
unfortunately i have to agree
obviously whatever hit us was no protocomet i was wrong
maybe you werent not entirely sensors cant scan it and transporters cant lock on to it maybe this is some kind of darkmatter lifeform
its impossible molecules that complex would collapse under their own weight they could never support life
it might be time to revise your theory where did they take you
i dont know it was dark god i could feel breathing all around me
did anyone try to communicate with you
i couldnt see i tried to say something but there wasnt enough air i tried to move but something was pressing down on me hypospray tetrovaline it will put me out
if i sedate you it could lower your immune response and you need to stay conscious do you understand
billy if it wanted to kill you it would have done it by now it never would have sent you back here maybe it was trying to scan you or something
if it wanted to get to know me better it should have just asked me out for a drink
celes keep an eye in him harren
im setting a course for those rings shunt as much power as you can to the impulse engines
we never should have left voyager
ive got news for you crewman voyager isnt exactly a safe haven weve been chased across the quadrant by far worse than whatevers out there the vidiians species 8472 the borg but i guess if somebodys hiding down on deck fifteen they might not be aware of it
i wasnt meant to be an explorer
and i wasnt meant to guide a ship across an unknown quadrant
then were both victims of circumstance
oh ive seen things ive never imagined grown closer to people than i ever thought possible i wouldnt call myself a victim and i wouldnt trade the last six years for anything
then youve been deluded by the inexhaustible human capacity to avoid the truth youre the one hiding not me ive got you three more percentage points of impulse
ill take it setting a course isnt there any part of you that feels a bond with the rest of us when we escape from the borg or discover a new type of star dont you feel some pride of accomplishment when youre in the mess hall alone at your table in the corner dont you see the friendships around you and wish even for a microsecond you were part of them
you dont know me at all
no but id like to that was the whole point of this mission but i guess it hasnt worked out like id planned
incoming transmission
source
its a starfleet frequency must be voyager
voyager this is the delta flyer weve been hit by an unknown phenomenon and taken heavy damage we require immediate assistance repeat we require immediate assistance
subspace echo
maybe not theres a point zero zero five deviation in the carrier wave
thats the same degree of spatial fluctuation left by our pursuers theyre sending our distress signal back to us
modified they might be trying to communicate
theyre taunting us
not necessarily try to adjust the universal translator for
captain he went right through the forcefield
billy what are you doing
its activating my motor neurons i cant make it stop im sorry captain youve got to stop it
its okay billy its okay its okay
its in here
its tapping into our systems
wait it may be trying to communicate
its into our environmental controls weve got to stop it
hold your fire
what the hell is wrong with you
it was trying to kill us
you dont know that
we were at risk
i gave you a direct order
what if you were wrong
i could hear its thoughts
explain
when it left me i could hear what it was thinking do not belong thats what it said do not belong
we dont belong here
or it didnt belong in the delta flyer
maybe thats why it was tapping into the environmental controls it was trying to survive in a place it didnt belong
thats speculation
based on direct observation you murdered an alien being and destroyed any chance we had to make first contact
we just lost another section of hull
how far are we from the gas giant
two hundred thousand kilometres
im taking the flyer into the radiogenic ring with any luck they wont follow
we cant survive in there for more than a few minutes
that should be enough to reinitialise the warp core
start continuous transport of radiogenic particles directly into the reaction chamber when its approaching critical mass let me know watch for any sign of pursuit how are you doing
i always had this alarm in my head sort of an internal red alert it was like a warning system that would tell me i was sick or dying or something mitochondrial prions food poisoning a head cold it was always there
and now its not
its gone i dont understand
maybe i do when i was a girl i was afraid of the ocean i liked to swim but in a pool or a pond where i knew exactly what was beneath me but in the open water with no way to know what was down there it scared me to death it wasnt until my first year at the academy after i went through zero g training in the coral sea that i finally got over it i think you just came up from your first deep dive
theyre in pursuit
three minutes twenty seconds to intercept
well need twice that to reinitialise warp reaction
get into the escape pods
captain
plot a course away from the planet im going to fire a phaser volley and hopefully set off a chain reaction of the radiogenic particles it might be enough to disable our friends
youll be disabled too
not if i go to full thrusters and keep in front of the shock wave if i dont make it head for the l class moon in the next system you could survive there for weeks if you have to enough time for voyager to pick up your distress signal now get moving
no youll have a better chance if were with you
go
we might not have contributed much on voyager but what we do here matters were the crew here and the crew does not abandon its captain
all right its your choice
then ill be going alone
good luck
charge phaser banks stand by to divert all power to thrusters
escape pod one is occupied and ready captain
launch pod one
escape pod away
how close are our pursuers
sixty five seconds to intercept
stand by to fire
captain the escape pod is altering course its heading for the aliens
janeway to harren
what are you doing
if they have to deal with me it should give you a few more seconds to get away thats my theory anyway
resume your escape course now
its too late for that
you made a mistake harren dont make another one
im done hiding captain
a few seconds of exposure to real life maybe ill understand what ive been missing
he closed the channel
get a transporter lock on that pod
i cant were out of range
more power to the thrusters celes
were still not close enough
thrusters at maximum
got him
fire
shock wave approaching contact in four three two one more or less
my crew
easy theyre sleeping no serious injuries everyones all right though you gave us a good scare for a while we received your distress call we found the flyer drifting above a gas giant you were all unconscious
any sign of another vessel or some kind of entity
no what happened
the good shepherd went after some lost sheep and ran into a wolf
did she find them
i think she did
youre late
there was a problem with the pulse drills on level four
theyre going to be here any moment i want to make a good impression
youre certain we should be doing this
orek will be pleased that we took the initiative
i hope youre right
welcome to telsius
thank you im captain kathryn janeway this is commander tuvok were from the federation starship voyager
we have several mines like this on earth
im not familiar with earth
thats because its thirty thousand light years from here
thirty thousand three hundred forty two point four to be exact
youre a long way from home
its difficult sometimes then i close my eyes and think of the farm in indiana where i grew up for a moment im home again shall we get down to business
yes weve had a shortage of dilithium for the last two months if we cant replenish our supply we may be forced to suspend work
our chief of mining operations has gone to the grenna system
yes but we are authorised to conduct trades in his absence
what are you prepared to trade
im afraid the only commodity we have is er bolomite
we really dont have much use for that
on the contrary captain bolomite is used in omega radiation therapy the orphans on narva
orphans
the settlers on the narva colony were exposed to toxic levels of omega radiation the entire adult population was killed
were doing all we can for the children all right twenty kilotons of dilithium for an equivalent amount of bolomite
we only have ten kilotons left
then ten it is
captain i must point out that dilithium is worth nearly twice as much as bolomite
tuvok these people need our help im not going to quibble over a few tons of ore
perhaps we should celebrate
i wish we could but theres a neutronic storm approaching our ship we should be leaving orbit
give us an hour to finalise the arrangements
well be waiting to hear from you
before we leave would it be possible to tour your facility its our duty as starfleet officers
unfortunately the storm wont wait maybe on our next visit
live long and prosper
ugh this hair is so uncomfortable
i find it aesthetically pleasing
the negotiations
it wouldve been perfect if tuvok hadnt decided to improvise
i was portraying my character as truthfully as possible
once we finish a transaction we leave is that clear
indeed
incoming transmission for captain janeway
ready this is captain janeway
the bolomite is ready for transport we thank you for your generosity
directive nine twenty seven of the starfleet general order always help those in need
transport complete
weve enjoyed meeting you gentlemen
er captainwe havent received the dilithium yet
oh the neutronic storm seems to be interfering with our transporters if we dont leave orbit immediately we will sustain heavy damage
what about our dilithium
well be back to deliver it as soon as the storm clears
well how long will that be
captain janeway out
lets go
computer activate the sonic shower
oh adjust the frequency
computer deactivate the sonic shower
report
weve got systems failures on eight decks captain
that explains why my sonic shower was a little louder than usual
make that nine decks ive run every diagnostic i know and i cant seem to isolate the problem
gremlins
excuse me
in the early days of aviation engineers blamed imaginary little creatures called gremlins for malfunctions they could not explain
well one of your gremlins just paid a visit to the replicator system
tuvok we saved you a seat
whats wrong
someone has altered one of my holodeck programs again
are you sure it isnt just one of these malfunctions
everything on the ships been affected including the holodecks
the oracle of ktal isnt programmed to wear pyjamas
well maybe he overslept
i am not amused by your practical jokes mister paris
why do you always think its me
mister kim
id like to claim credit but im innocent
the next time i visit the holodeck i expect to find my programme restored to its original parameters
im telling you tuvok we didnt do it
i wonder how the oracle would look in a sombrero
everybody stop eating
captain whats wrong
if i could have everyones attention for a moment we found a contaminant in the replicator system its nothing serious but if any of you start to feel a little queasy report to sickbay immediately in the meantime the galley is closed
i wish i hadnt had seconds
here
well that explains it
dont tell me a simple heating coil in the stove is responsible for everything thats gone wrong this morning
any component connected to the integrated circuitry can spread a contaminant
this isnt starfleet issue
where did it come from
i obtained it during a trade
with whom
sister dala
sister
one of the clerics on selnia prime tom and i met her during our away mission she was the one trying to help all those poor orphans its all in our report
did you run a diagnostic before you installed it
captain to the bridge
im a little busy now can it wait
im afraid not
ill be right back
one excuse after another youre stalling and i dont have time for it
captain this is mister orek hes chief of mining operations on telsius prime
a problem mister orek
not if you deliver our dilithium
dilithium
its all clearly documented ten kilotons of bolomite ore in exchange for ten kilotons of dilithium
i think theres been some sort of misunderstanding
one way or another i intend to collect what you owe me
weve enjoyed meeting you gentlemen
captain we havent received the dilithium yet
oh the neutronic storm seems to be interfering with our transporters if we dont leave orbit immediately we will sustain heavy damage
what about our dilithium
well be back to deliver it as soon as the storm clears
do you still deny you made the trade
that woman isnt me
who is she then
well shes obviously an impostor
i have transmission logs transport records scans of your shuttlecraft
i have never been to your planet mister orek aboard voyager or any other vessel
our ships logs will confirm what the captains been telling you
and how do i know theyre authentic records
how do we know your records are authentic
you think i falsified data why would i do that
perhaps to extort dilithium from us
im not the thief here
we are not questioning your integrity mister orek it does appear youve been cheated but not by me or anyone one on my crew
how naive do you think i am first you prey upon the sympathy of my miners by telling them stories about poor orphaned children now you try to convince me youre the victims here
did you say orphaned children
a despicable tactic
will you excuse me for a minute please
we are not finished
neelix
captain were making real progress
never mind that tell me more about this cleric who gave you the heating coil
ah sister dala what do you want to know
everything
well tom and i met her during our away mission we were on a small planetoid in the wyanti system
searching for the spore the doctor wanted to grow antiviral proteins with
i tell you neelix when i first joined starfleet i knew it was going to be one glamorous adventure after another but i never dreamed that id have the opportunity to go on a mouldhunting expedition
im detecting traces of glamour in this direction
please go no further this is our sanctuary
our scans didnt detect anyone down here
our sect is a solitary one we dampen our life signs to protect the privacy of our meditations
were terribly sorry if weve disturbed you
begin the cleansing
olat mal pri mal pral mal prolat olate kal mi kal mal kal molat
i hope we havent committed a serious transgression
the transgression was ours we should have guarded the sanctuary more carefully the deities will be angry
come on neelix wed better get out of the way
of course our sincere apologies if theres anything that we can do
forgive me but you look familiar
i dont think that weve ever met before
do you see it
yes
you bear a striking resemblance to our redeemer of light
im flattered
each spring we make a pilgrimage to narva in his honour to help the orphans
thats a very worthy cause
it is unfortunately we have no food to bring them this year
why not
a blight infected our hydroponic pods the crop was destroyed
maybe we could replicate some food for you
we bestow charity on others the deities forbid us from accepting it ourselves
how about a trade
good idea you must have something that we can use
that way you wouldnt be accepting charity and the deities would have nothing to get angry about
your heart is as kind as your face
may the deities bless you
thats when they gave you the heating coil
it was going to take a while to replicate the supplies they needed so we invited them back to the flyer
thats when they must have gotten access to our systems
captain
did you leave either of them alone at any point
i dont think so er after we ate tom took brother mobar to see the cockpit but i stayed in the aft section with sister dala talking
about what
me mostly she wanted to know all about my role on voyager
ambassador morale officer head chef it sounds as though youre invaluable
i do what i can
where is your voyager now
about three light years from here
your crew is alone in this region
we are the only federation starship within thirty thousand light years
that must be difficult
sometimes it is but we manage weve singlehandedly taken on the borg the hirogen species 8472
im impressed
captain janeway deserves most of the credit shes an extraordinary woman
your captain is a woman
the finest one ive ever known
tell me about her
well shes commanded voyager for almost six years now before that she was a science officer on the albatani
where does she come from
earth its in the alpha quadrant she grew up on a little farm in a place called indiana youd like her
im sure i would
sister dala
yes brother mobar
its late we must return to the sanctuary
so soon
its time for the evening meditation we cant thank you enough for all youve done
were just glad that we could help
the blessing
certainly
may the deities bless these travellers tala ot val tala ot relina sen tala sen relina val golina su ketran tala otval tala ot relina
then we transported them back to their sanctuary
how long did this blessing last
no more than a minute or two
thats probably all they needed
for what
just what i thought the entire database was downloaded eighteen days ago
brother mobar the talisman
it was obviously some sort of scanner
what would a couple of religious clerics want with our database
it might help if they wanted to pose as federation officers gentlemen i believe youve been had
the way i see it were both victims your bolomite was stolen and our reputation has been damaged
what are you proposing
you said you had scanned the vessel that visited your mining colony if you allow us to analyse them we might be able to derive the impostors warp signature
we could find them and recover your property before they cheat someone else
this is all difficult for me to believe two of your crewmen deceived by clerics huh could they really have been so naive
a legitimate question
its obvious were dealing with clever adversaries they fooled both of us but im confident we can stop them
perhaps i should contact telsian security they have persuasive methods for determining the truth
in the meantime the real thieves could be halfway across the sector with your bolomite in their cargo hold
and finally our bridge
is this a typical federation vessel
well the delta flyer may look a little worn thats only because shes been through so much this ship has helped fend off the borg the hirogen species 8472
most of your technology is outdated
show him the mothership mister chakotay
uss voyager intrepid class fifteen decks of the most advanced technology youll find anywhere dilithium powered warp engines integrated bioneural circuitry holodecks
is this a typical federation vessel
every ship in the fleet is built to exacting standards but id be lying if i told you i didnt think voyager was exceptional as her captain im not entirely objective im sure you feel the same way about your ship
it is my home
im glad to hear you say that mister varn because thats exactly what the federation is a home for an extended family who share resources and come to one anothers aid in time of need
so if my ship joins your federation voyager will help me fight my enemies
the primary goal of the federation is exploration military objectives are
theres no need to bore our guest with starfleet protocol tuvok
my enemies have sophisticated weaponry
as do we photon torpedoes optronically targeted phasers multispectral shielding
all of which we would not hesitate to share with a fellow member of the federation
what will i have to do to join
in order to be considered a candidate must make formal application an extensive review is conducted by a committee composed of
the process is complicated but captain janeway has influence with the federation council
and you would use that influence on my behalf
id be foolish not to you are just the type of candidate were looking for
ill have to discuss this with my shipmates
well joining the federation is a serious commitment take all the time you need
captain our latest orders from starfleet command we wont be back here for at least six months
perhaps we can discuss your application then
if we were to apply now could you assure us wed be accepted
you realise youll have to commit considerable resources
ill do whatever is necessary
well let me be the first to say welcome to the federation
you look like you could use a cup of coffee
ive been flying concentric search patterns for the last twelve hours
any sign of the impostors
neelix what has happened to us
i know exactly what you mean ive been over it a thousand times
why didnt we see this coming
orphans its the oldest gambit in the book
i mean if itd been harry i could understand it he trusts everybody but you and me
weve dealt with our share of shady characters
i think maybe maybe weve lost our edge
hand me one of those terra nuts
what are you doing
proving you wrong
ah the old shell game all we need now is a mark
i think i see one coming
you go ahead ill follow your lead
now watch carefully i place the terra nut under the cup then i shuffle them round and round they go keep your eye on the nut but be careful the hand is faster than the eye now for three hours of holodeck time can you tell me where is the terra nut
there no no no that one
oh i really thought i had you this time
oh keep trying neelix youll fool me one of these days
this looks like an interesting game may i have a turn
oh be my guest but youll have to wager something
if i win you take three duty shifts in sickbay
and if i win you take three shifts in the kitchen
done
ready now watch carefully round and round they go follow the terra nut if you can but be careful the hand is faster than the eye
careful doc try not to blink
dont you worry mister paris you have to get up pretty early in the morning to fool my optical subroutines
where is it then
in your left palm
how did you
superior visual acuity see you in sickbay
im detecting a vessel on long range scans the warp signature matches the impostors ship
harry tell tom his coffee break is over set a pursuit course
yes maam
the photon torpedoes you gave me are worthless no better than plasma flares
perhaps you didnt arm them properly
and in the middle of the battle the polonians warned me to cease hostilities or face destruction at the hands of your federation you allowed my enemies to join
evidently the federation council decided that
your federation is a fraud i demand reparations
you will have to submit a formal report to starfleet
enough if you will not reimburse me ill seize your ship
disable the beam
i cant
we have an additional problem voyager
theres another ship alongside the impostors its got them in a tractor beam
hail both vessels
no response from either one
well lets try to get their attention mister tuvok
voyagers charging weapons
perhaps we should surrender to them the federation has an extremely humane policy regarding the treatment of prisoners
hail varn again do it look on your scanners varn our motherships arrived shes armed and ready to defend us
tell them to stand down
release us or voyager will destroy you
the other ship is hailing
on screen
stand down voyager
i have no argument with you however the vessel youre tractoring
i paid for my federation membership the delta flyer belongs to me now
sir i think youve been misled
yes i have
three direct hits shields down to sixty percent
target his tractor beam nobody is taking possession of the delta flyer today except us
lock onto them
yes maam
now our tractor generators offline
shields down to forty one percent
the impostors ship is powering engines
seven transport everyone on that vessel directly to the brig
establishing a lock on three life signs that impact damaged the transporters im losing annular confinement
harry reroute additional power
theyre gone
seven
i only got one of them
get us out of here mister paris
aye captain
nice hair
its not really my taste
posing as a starfleet captain selling memberships to the federation too bad we didnt think of it tuvok imagine the resources we could have acquired over the past six years
indeed
i have to admit im impressed
i wish i could say the same the great captain janeway somehow i expected you to be taller i make a better you than you
oh i dont know id say were very much alike resourceful intelligent ambitious but with just one tiny difference
and what is that
im not a liar and a thief youre going to give me a detailed account of everyone you cheated and exactly what you did with their property
why would i do that
because if you dont im turning you over to telsian security
oh is that supposed to frighten me
how much do you know about the telsians
just that theyre a more gullible species than most
tell her about your research mister tuvok
i beg your pardon captain
on telsian law i think its only fair that we let our guest know what to expect
the telsian criminal justice system is rather barbaric
tell her about the prisons
barely habitable inmates often die of malnutrition before they are brought to trial torture is commonplace as is disease including several incurable forms of psoriasis
i think she gets the general idea
suppose i do tell you how do i know you wont turn me over to the telsians anyway
if you make full restitution to your victims ill give you safe passage out of this area
is that a promise captain
i know its hard for you to believe but occasionally some of us tell the truth
give me the delta flyer and three days to get as far away from here as i can and then ill send you the information you want
how naive do you think i am
as far as the victims are concerned youre the one who cheated them without my help youll be the one who has a problem leaving this sector
tuvok contact telsian security tell them we have a prisoner to turn over
psoriasis
improvisation is not foremost among my talents
considering i caught you off guard i thought your performance was exemplary
thank you captain was your order to call the telsians part of the deception or did you actually want me to contact them
not yet lets give dala some time to think about those barbaric prisons
do you believe shell relent
im not sure something tells me shes just as stubborn as i am
then am i to assume you have an alternative plan
im like you tuvok making it up as i go along
the captain said bread and water but i didnt see any harm
im not hungry
ill just leave it here in case you change your mind may i ask you something
you want to know if you really resemble the redeemer of light
im not that gullible
then what
do you ever feel guilty taking advantage of people who actually think that you care about them
you seem like a good person im sorry i lied to you
actually i think youre just sorry you got caught
probably
there now youre being honest i knew it was possible if you dont mind my asking why do you do what you do
my father taught me most people will exploit you if they can so its best to exploit them first
you know i used to be a lot like you living by my wits never trusting anyone always trying to end up on the more profitable side of a transaction
and now you dont hesitate to help starving orphans
i changed when captain janeway made me part of the crew
i suppose you suddenly reformed
no no not right away
at first i was just exploiting an opportunity to get a warm bed food protection i kept waiting to find out what the captain wanted in return
but she never asked for a thing
on the contrary she expected a great deal from me honesty loyalty hard work
i shouldve guessed
but i discovered that those were commodities i had in abundance and it was much more profitable to share them than it was to be selfserving and cynical all the time im happier than ive ever been
i suppose that you think i could change too
stranger things have happened
do you really think that shell give me safe passage if i make restitution
if thats what she promised you
then what i have never done anything else
captain janeway let seven of nine remain on board and she was borg
are you saying shed do the same thing for me
id be willing to talk to her
i cheated you why are you being so kind to me
like my great grandmother used to say its nice to be nice
is that tea still warm
oh im sorry im so clumsy
security to the brig
shes gone
its not right to abandon her
going back is too dangerous
shes our captain
no shes not and even if she were we wouldnt be able to rescue her wed be captured ourselves
without captain janeway it will be difficult to continue our activities
its too late for that
there must be a logical way
whats logical is to get as far away as we can
theres a vessel approaching its the delta flyer
activate the shields
theyre hailing its captain janeway
our janeway or theirs
which one did you expect
im pleased to see you captain
lower the shields so i can transport aboard
how were you able to escape
ill tell you once im aboard
 its difficult to believe you werent detected
are you accusing me of something
being cautious how do we know this isnt a deception
why would i try to deceive you
you could be helping voyager capture us in exchange for your own freedom
are we in position
i dont have time for this lower your shields and beam me aboard
ready
captain on the bridge
as you were now what about the bolomite and the rest of our earnings
theyre exactly where we left them
well its time to collect them and leave the region set a course before voyager finds us
youre not in command here
i just spent the last twenty four hours in voyagers brig i have no intention of going back
im picking up lifesigns on the delta flyer
that cant be
i was right you brought them here
dont be ridiculous whoever it is mustve stowed away
theyre hailing
on screen
this is tom paris of the starship voyager prepare to be boarded
hes charging weapons
evasive manoeuvres
lets get everything on board as quickly as we can
how many transport enhancers do you recommend captain
do i have to think of everything
well need at least ten if were going to beam all that bolomite through the geostrata
maybe we should take twelve
we
is there a problem
in six years ive never known you to dirty your hands with menial labour
well theres a first time for everything
you dont trust us
who knows what the two of you planned while i was in voyagers brig
as chief of security i would never
its all right well all go together
after you
the next populated sector is thirteen days from here when we arrive well trade the delta flyer for a new ship voyager will never find us are all the transport enhancers in place
thats the last of them we can go now if thats acceptable to you captain
im afraid theres been a change of plans
ive found the stolen items captain you can lock onto my coordinates
i told you she couldnt be trusted
how could you bring yourself to deceive your fellow officers
voyager i repeat i am in position
can you get a lock
negative the geostratum is too dense
keep trying tuvok
im outnumbered captain i need assistance
voyager now would be an excellent time to initiate transport
youre not transporting anything
captain
voyager please respond
youre a sight for sore eyes
commander tuvok
the one and only
logic would indicate that neither of us has the advantage
your logic is flawed
stay where you are
what did they promise you for betraying us
i believe youve mistaken me for someone else
wheres dala
im afraid shes indisposed at the moment
i wouldnt get up too fast if i were you captain its going to take another few minutes for the ambazine to wear off
round and round they go follow the terra nut if you can but remember the hand is sharper than your visual acuity
i thought wed already disproved that theory
you tell me
the terra nut is firmly entrenched up your right sleeve
sorry
thats impossible
the old handoff
ooh
thats cheating
weve still got it
captains log stardate 53896 belanna torres has requested permission to take the delta flyer and search for dilithium shining voyager far from home far from the gleaming cities of earth
headstrong belanna torres and young harry kim speed away from voyager on the delta flyer in search of their treasures
ive trimmed the sails but the sea is rough maybe we should return
i know what im doing
a wave as high as a mountain struck the delta flyer
get into the escape pod
we die together
no one is going to die go
young harry kim left her side and belanna torres was thrown against the rocks the rocks of our very shore
which is where i kelis the poet found her broken dying she told me her story and now ive told you
an excellent conceit that you discovered her yourself
thank you
well now that belanna torres has come to our shore what will happen does captain janeway come searching for her or does she give her up for lost
who can say
well i would hope that you can i want to see more of these voyager eternals
inspiration cant be forced
one week
or three weeks maybe two one week the story will continue have you noticed how thin my performers have gotten
let them eat this
ladies and gentlemen our patron salutes you
finally
were doing another voyager play as soon as i can write it
shall we celebrate the two of us
i have very little time celebrating will have to wait
who are you
kelis kelis the poet your servant
my servant all right let me go
i cant
why not
youll fly from me the way inspiration always does
youre trying to kill me
im releasing the heat from your veins
what are you talking about
youve been in a fever since i found you bleeding is the best way to treat it
oh i can see im in good hands
something tells me you have your doubts
theres a medkit over there a box made out of metal theres a small cylinder inside bring it here give it to me
dont be afraid it wont hurt you here pass it over where you cut me
youre an eternal i suppose such things are to be expected
what other things do you expect from an eternal
the power to make the ground open up and the sky to fall all the strange events sung by the ancient poets fortunately for me no poet has ever sung about your clan im the first
my clan
the eternals on voyager shining voyager far from home
what do you know about that
delta flyer log stardate 53918 harry and i are continuing toward the fourth planet sensors have picked up natural dilithium deposits on nearly every land mass
acknowledged has your warp core been damaged
yes were running on thrusters can you track our position
how long have i been here
eight days i was walking through these mountains i saw a light burn across the sky and i heard a terrible sound when i arrived i found you i treated your wounds
and you tied me to this chair
when a gift falls from the heavens only a fool would let her go youve already given me one play the story told by those voices i pieced them together tried to fill in the gaps
you made a play out of our logs
the away mission of belanna torres my patron was impressed
he has great taste now take that knife of yours and cut me free
that would be unwise
why
my patron is intrigued by the voyager eternals he wants another play to compose that i need more details
and you expect to get them from me
i did save your life
i need to get back to voyager
i need another play
what exactly do you want to know
everything
its not possible we eternals have our rules we cant just give everything away
how did you get lost
cut me free and ill tell you
you wont leave me
cut me free
youre the one whos leaving
dont come back
computer bring the subspace transmitter online
unable to comply
why not
insufficient power
great now theres no power
are you hungry
i told you not to come back
you havent eaten in days we have to support each other we poets
im an engineer i fix things
from the looks of it youre not doing so well
are you a poet or a critic
tell me about earth
i have to sing for my supper huh
we all do in one way or another earth
its a an island a beautiful island blue and green
and voyager a great ship
in a long line of great ships
how did voyager get lost
the caretaker
an eternal
yes you could say that he caused a storm which blew us off course
tom paris are you in love with him
supper is over come with me
this is where we put all the names and dates when our heads wont hold any more
a memory
exactly tell me have you ever seen this before
winters tears
can you get me some
this is dilithium isnt it what you were looking for
where can i find it
the only deposit i know of is on the hunting grounds of my patron hed execute me for trespassing and you well hed love to capture an eternal
maybe im more powerful than he is
perhaps but if he caught you hed force you to fight against his enemies theyre constantly at each others throats bickering over territory raiding each others land starting wars whenever they can be guaranteed of good weather and we suffer the consequences you dont want to get involved with them
which is why youre going to get the dilithium
i told you id be executed if im caught
the dilithium or i dont say another word about shining voyager far from home
did you
dont get caught
well
beautiful ive got an idea for your next play
ive been visited by inspiration herself how does this sound the rescue of belanna torres right here in one week
one week
lets get to work
dismissed
thats it
mister paris try to stay calm
no thats not going to happen isnt there anything else we can do
not until something shows up on sensors
ill take a shuttle out myself ill run a planet by planet search
an inefficient plan
and too dangerous you could be hit by the same spatial eddies that sent the flyer off course
we need to concentrate our efforts from here tom all right dismissed
steadyarmed paris bound by a sleep that brings no rest
the door opens the shadow of a woman falls on the helmsman his eyes open
seven of nine did you find belanna torres
im sorry to disappoint you
closer closer
unpleasant news delivered by the most pleasing of messengers
no no no no seven of nine is a borg the scourge of the eternals youre portraying her like a shy bride on her wedding night once more
seven of nine did you find belanna torres
i am sorry to disappoint you
i cant blame my performers these eternals on voyager are difficult to understand
will you stop walking around youre going to break something
this tuvok for example hes not like anybody ive ever met no emotions how is that possible
it just is
it worked
it worked
okay computer bring subspace transmitter online
what happened
i dont know the transmitter must have been weakened in the crash it couldnt take the energy surge
these vulcans
enough what kind of metallurgic technology do you people have alloys which ones can you make steel bronze
bronze
bronze all right i need a plate of metal this big as thin as it can be three parts tin to five parts bronze one side coated with gold
gold is expensive i cant afford it
then youre going into debt
then tell me about the vulcans
get me the plate and then ill tell you
everyones asleep ill do it in the morning the vulcans
maybe ive miscounted but i dont think youve slept in ten days
your count is accurate
dont you think you should go to bed
as a vulcan i can function without sleep for more than two weeks
but theres a point of diminishing returns when your mind starts to play tricks on you
my mind mister neelix does not play tricks
the ship is lonely without them isnt it
if you would allow me to continue my sensor analysis i might be able to locate them
if theres anything else you need a stronger tea perhaps
when a friend is lost the mind is split in half divided between memory of the past and fear of the future harry kim ensign only a boy when fate took you from the arms of blue green earth belanna torres half klingon half human i am honoured to call you
what are you doing is that a tear
yes
logical tuvok doesnt cry thats why they call him logical
everybody cries
the land of vulcan has no laughter and it has no tears it is a very quiet place calm just like tuvok
i cant believe that
you dont have to just dont cry
the audience wont believe it either theyll either think tuvok is an unfeeling monster or that i am a bad performer
theyll realise that beneath your unfeeling exterior is a heart thats breaking silently and in more pain than any of us can possibly understand because thats what it is to be vulcan try it again
kelis
whats wrong
our patron has been insulted by his enemy to the north the armouries are open
has a battlefield been chosen
not yet
then we have a chance
i need your help
ive given you enough help wheres that piece of metal
not bad
my patrons been angered by the leader of a neighbouring state hell want to take revenge it could lead to war
we eternals arent supposed to take sides
im not asking you to fight i need a way to change his mind
i dont have that kind of magical power
yes you do i believe the right kind of play can turn the mind from violent thoughts the perfect play might even stop a war
i cant fix the transmitter with this theres too many impurities itll never carry a plasma charge
if the fighting starts scouting parties will start moving through these mountains youll be discovered but my play it could stop it from happening you have to help me
theres nothing i can do
then come with me ill show you what ive done so far its our only chance
shes a fellow poet from across the eastern sea an expert on the voyager eternals shes devoted her life to them shes here to help
the rescue of belanna torres we begin with harry kim reaching voyager in the escape pod he tells captain janeway that belanna torres is lost we continue to the point where they discover a piece of the delta flyer after that
its simple they search for belanna torres belanna torres is found
or not found
or not found the end it sounds pretty straightforward to me
thats exactly the problem where is the mistaken identity the discovery the sudden reversal mistaken identity a character who is someone else discovery the moment when that identity is revealed reversal a situation that turns from good to bad in a blink of an eye
find the truth of your story and you wont need all those tricks i dont know how things are done across the eastern sea but here poets have become lazy they rely on manipulation to move their audience it wasnt always that way welcome
thank you
the truth of my story its an oldfashioned idea today audiences want excitement passion let me show you what ive done with captain janeway and commander chakotay lets make a good impression on our visitor
chakotay why must i be denied what every other female officer on this ship can have
captain
the privilege of your touch
come in
if that was good news youd be smiling
i was just contacted by an alien transport vessel they picked up the delta flyers distress call
the primary controls are offline ive ordered harry to eject i still have thrusters im setting a course for an l class planet ill try to maintain contact
they couldnt get a fix on her position that was ten days ago
belanna ordered harry into an escape pod whats the longest he could survive
less than ten days
an l class planet
ive already narrowed the search parameters
if belanna made it there its possible harry did too good night commander
captain
well have a final rehearsal in the morning
the last tuvok scene doesnt make sense to me and we still dont have an ending
ive got the rest of the night to work on it maybe you can get some sleep
what did you think
captain janeway kissing commander chakotay tom paris kissing seven of nine i dont see the point
anger is like fire love can be the rain that extinguishes it my patron is filled with hatred for his rival so our play should be filled with love
you cant change somebodys way of life with a few lines of dialogue
yes you can its been done before do you know what this place used to be a hundred years ago a temple and this was the altar stone every year a victim would be sacrificed on it in honour of winter and then one year nobody remembers exactly when or why a play took the place of the ritual and no one had to die here again why cant my play take the place of a war
well youre going to have to do a lot better than harry kim kissing the delaney sisters
why
because when you think that you are surrounded by enemies when youre up against the borg or or species 8472 the last thing on your mind is romance
youre an eternal you have to help me
im sorry kelis
the borg tell me more about them
theyre soldiers part of a vast army they all think the same thoughts and they travel on ships that look like hives
like insect colonies
they even have a queen
that sounds terrifying captain janeway hasnt been able to destroy them
she is a starfleet officer trained to avoid violence whenever possible she would make peace with the borg if she could
this is what i need an enemy someone to stand in the way of voyager finding belanna torres captain janeway driven by vengeance must seek out the queen of the borg the audience thinks she plans to destroy them all but
go on
the sudden reversal captain janeway holding her spear at the queens throat throws her weapon aside and she argues passionately to put an end to their conflict in words no one will fail to understand
including your patron its much better than all that kissing
stay and help me i still need an ending
youll figure something out
belanna torres dies tragically
you wouldnt dare
i followed you here expecting to find a love nest its quite a nest youre no poet from across the sea youre an eternal maybe even belanna torres herself
dont be ridiculous
you know all he thinks about is you
were collaborators thats all
if you come to the performance tomorrow night ill expose you to the autarch just leave us alone fix your ship and go please
friend of yours
harry
give me a hand
oh how
i ran into some turbulence in the escape pod decided to turn around and follow your ion trail landed about two hundred kilometres from here
you walked
at night i tracked your position with a tricorder and tried to stay hidden during the day ive got some emergency rations left a phaser and the escape pods transmitter which i didnt have power left to run but
harry kim saves the day just the ending i was looking for
the final moment the last scene more important than anything thats gone before but what is it where is she
your collaborators probably halfway across the eastern sea by now
shell be here
you said wed have an ending by midmorning we wont have time to learn it
itll come to me dont worry
want to give it a try
why not the thirty eighth time might be the charm
its working
the subspace transmitter is online
why dont you do the honours
voyager this is the delta flyer
our patron has arrived hes not in a very good mood
he will be
not if this is any indication
kelis this is no way to end a play
it doesnt make sense
itll have to go go
who are the enemies of voyager the borg
species 8472
you know where the ridge ends just below the peak run there as fast as you can youll find a vessel wrecked against the rocks go inside and give this to our friend dont be frightened go
tuvok tuvok
as you were bridge to chakotay
go ahead
request permission to be relieved
understood ill be right there
were picking up a subspace transmission starfleet frequency
its a little rough hang on
delta flyer harry and i are all right were on an l class planet propulsion is down
origin
five point two light years f type star looks like the fourth planet
lay in a course maximum warp
seven of nine
captain
the delta flyer has been found in pieces on a rocky shore
and belanna torres
no sign of her seven of nine you are my eyes and my ears if anyone can find her it is you
her eyes and her ears and the viper in her nest i seven of nine have no intention of finding belanna torres i seven of nine am queen of the borg surprised no one will be more surprised than janeway when i take my revenge on voyager say nothing or you too will be assimilated  captain i will comply
my enemies are everywhere without and within seven of nine is queen of the borg surprised so was i tell her nothing or i will lose my advantage and my ship as well
are you okay
yes
were fine
good to hear it well see you soon
dont be afraid
what is it
without inspiration belanna torres will perish hes threatening to kill off belanna as the climax to his play
let him
that means that he still cant figure out the ending
who cares
i do
youre serious
harry have you ever inspired anybody
thats kind of a strange question
its been a strange couple of weeks he needs me or hes the one whos going to die on that stage
what are you talking about
the transporter is online
tell the captain ill be a little late
belanna
wait for my signal
my death is irrelevant you will never see the gleaming cities of earth you will be assimilated
and if i let you live
also irrelevant
you dont believe that
the battle is over go home
how foolish of you to let me go free to attack you again
and again and again until all your drones and all my crew are destroyed until everything we value is gone and there is nothing left but our hatred
this final scene will ruin everything that weve done out there well have to improvise
its too late
no its not
i knew youd come
and i told you not to
wait lets go
finally voyager has reached our shores
and not a moment too soon kelis the poet must say goodbye as belanna torres returns to the eternals in a dazzling blaze of light
on a faraway snowcovered peak
no right here before your eyes
wait shes not from across the eastern sea shes an eternal im telling you shes belanna torres the real belanna torres i saw her ship
the lead actress in a fit of jealousy brands her rival an eternal our patron rises to his feet to stop the play
nicely done i almost believed you continue
stay
voyager needs me
so do i
no you dont you have all that you need right here
ill be inspired every time i think of you
one to beam to ascend to the heavens
and so ends the rescue of belanna torres half klingon belanna torres half human belanna torres chief engineer
these stories will continue for as long as we have the breath to tell them and as long as our patrons remain wise and compassionate and voyager will continue on her journey to the gleaming cities of earth where peace reigns and hatred has no home
come in
you wished to see me
weve known each other for how long
approximately twenty years
weve served on three starships together i was present at your daughters kohlinar i consider you one of my closest friends
and i regard you with the same esteem
ive always been honest with you but youve been keeping something from me
i dont know what you mean
dont you it took exhaustive research sifting through teraquads of data separating fact from rumour but eventually i arrived at the truth
captain
happy birthday
thank you
so its not long before you hit the big three digits huh
indeed have you informed anyone else of your discovery
dont worry tuvok my lips are sealed well youre supposed to blow out the candle
that is not a vulcan custom
humour me
captain to the bridge
well
it was a fire hazard
were receiving a distress call a small vessel on an intercept course
lifesigns
one its ocampan
were being hailed
kes
captain janeway i need your help will you please give me permission to come aboard
of course whats happened
please let me come aboard
prepare the docking port tell the doctor to stand by
her ship is accelerating its on a collision course
janeway to kes cut your engines youre coming in too fast
five seconds till impact
lock on a tractor beam evasive manoeuvres
hull breach on deck nine
emergency force fields
captain a transporter was activated just before impact shes beamed aboard
im reading bulkhead ruptures deck eleven section seventeen eighteen nineteen
cause
unknown
ive located kes shes moving through those sections shes giving off high levels of neurogenic energy
janeway to kes kes respond
hull breach section twenty
forcefields security to deck eleven
forcefields are not holding
shes approaching main engineering
bridge to engineering intruder alert
stop where you are
kes
state your intentions
evacuate engineering
warp power is fluctuating
torres to bridge kes is in direct contact with the warp core
shes drawing power from it somehow
shut it down
warp power is returning to normal
belanna report
lieutenant torres is dead kes has vanished
send mulchaey hes in deflector control well need more power to junction twelve j and tell harry i want to talk to him about building a new energy grid lost
no just looking captain janeway suggested that i get more familiar with the ship
well if you have any questions let me know
thanks
were about to run a diagnostic on the warp core assembly you can watch if you want
thanks but i really should be getting back to sickbay
computer has long has voyager been in the delta quadrant
fifty six days seventeen hours
back so soon i thought you went to the airponics bay to collect herbs
i forgot something
ah pyong ko
excuse me
you encouraged me to choose a name remember pyong ko was a twenty first century surgeon who discovered the genetic sequence for inhibiting cancer cells it heralded a new chapter in earths medical history
thats a perfect name doctor
then again im also considering schweitzer jarvik pasteur there are so many options each with its own merits
why dont you give it some more thought you dont have to decide right away
of course its not that i require one for reasons of vanity im just a hologram after all but if i had a name other than doctor or hey you it might encourage the crew to treat me with a little more respect kes
hello neelix
neelix if you want to put your own stamp on it maybe you should give it your own name like the greasy neelix or the double talaxian with cheese
it has a nice ring to it thank you lieutenant ill keep that in mind sweeting whatll it be the usual
im not hungry i thought that id bring captain janeway some coffee
thats very thoughtful im looking forward to tonight
actually i have a lot of work to do in sickbay
but i already reserved the holodeck i thought we could take a moonlit stroll through the marshlands of oshionian prime
another time i promise
something wrong
bad morning
anything i can do
ill be fine
im not having a great day either nobody seems to like todays menu i tried blaming it on a replicator malfunction but no one believed me wait i i think i see something neelix to security kes frown is losing its structural integrity red alert im detecting a smile thats my kes
the coffee
that last attack nearly cost us our impulse drives fortunately belanna found a way to reroute power from the deflector
a good choice for chief engineer if i do say so myself
getting to know your enemy
i feel like i already do remember the old story man goes to risa where he meets a beautiful woman who invites him over for an evening of passion
he wakes up in the morning feeling wonderful until he discovers hes missing a kidney
every cadet about to go on his first shore leave hears that cautionary tale doesnt seem so outrageous anymore does it
no but the vidiians are more than just your garden variety monsters ive been studying their culture they were a lot like us before the phage
do i detect a note of sympathy
makes you wonder what wed do under the same circumstances
come in
oh you read my mind
vidiians
im afraid so weve picked up two more ships on long range sensors ive gone to full tactical alert were taking every precaution
im sure youll get us through it safely
thanks for the vote of confidence tuvok thinks hes found a way to penetrate their shields the next time they attack us it wont be so easy
thats good to hear
captain to the bridge
on my way
oops im so clumsy im sorry
dont worry about it this desk has seen its share of coffee spills believe me
ensign wildman has an intriguing proposal
weve been analysing the vidiian bioreadings from the last attack their immune systems have been compromised by the phage we could synthesise a neural agent that would incapacitate them without affecting us
might come in handy if were ever boarded
exactly
work with the doctor when youve got something find a way to deploy it through the environmental systems
aye captain
the ships we detected earlier have disappeared from our sensors
maybe we outran them
they wouldnt give up that easily
why would they voyagers the only organ bank within half a parsec
we fought off their first attacks now they seem content to show up on sensors just long enough for us to change course its like were being herded somewhere
if we maintain our present course were going to enter a region filled with subspace vacuoles
wed have to drop to impulse to get through
sounds like a good place for an ambush
the maquis used to lure the cardassians into the badlands those galor class cruisers had nowhere to run
neither will we unless tom how dense are those vacuoles
they cover about seventy percent of the region
excuse me doctor
tom whats the first thing they teach you about manoeuvring at warp
faster than light no left or right when possible maintain a linear trajectory course corrections could fracture the hull
exactly wed have to drop to impulse every time we made a course change but what if we let voyager do the driving
maam
we could preprogramme every kilometre that way wed only spend a second or two at impulse every time the computer executed a turn
autonavigation the entire way
no offence but the neural gel packs can calculate vectors a little faster than you can
belanna
wed need a more accurate scan of the region if we even graze one of those vacuoles
we could send a shuttle ahead
the delta flyer its sensors are more advanced
the delta what
forgive me i must have been thinking of another starship
prepare a shuttle i want all of voyagers systems operating at peak efficiency by the time tom gets back if were going to pull this off theres no margin for error dismissed
computer display an image of the ocampan homeworld plot a course from voyagers current position
homesick
lieutenant
tom its okay a lot of people on board feel the same way
i spent my entire life trying to get away from ocampa why would i want to go back
because its home home for me means a penal colony out here i get to fly a state of the art ship and theres no admirals in sight
what are you doing
getting ready for a scouting mission
you planning on going somewhere
er no of course not i was just studying the helm configurations
i didnt know you could pilot a shuttle
i cant but id like to learn
well then why not learn from the best i could start you off in the holodeck in an old class one its the kind of shuttle my father used to take me up in
that would be very nice lieutenant tom
identify yourself
its me tuvok naomi wildman
may i help you sir lieutenant is something wrong
hello sweeting i took the liberty of preparing one of your favourite meals its under replicator programme neelix one call me if youd like some company miss you
computer end music open an encrypted channel direct the signal to the following coordinates
channel open
my name is kes im aboard the starship voyager respond i know youre receiving this transmission and i also know that your attempt to capture this ship will fail if you want to harvest voyagers crew i suggest you answer me now
explain
captain janeway is aware of your ambush shes found a way to evade your vessels but i can help you
im listening
i can send you tactical data on their shields weapons everything you need to take this ship
this is a deception
do you want this crew or not
in return
safe passage to ocampa for myself and one other
why would you sentence your own crew to death
theyre not my crew they abandoned me a long time ago
computer access voyagers tactical database
command authorisation required
access granted
naomi wildman
she appeared to be half ktarian
ensign wildmans husband is ktarian i met him once on deep space nine
theres more i followed her to cargo bay two where i saw a woman and two children all with cybernetic implants
borg
i cant explain it captain ive had hallucinations before but only while in a state of deep meditation these were specific and they evoked a sense of anticipation
it almost sounds like youre describing a premonition
indeed
i didnt think vulcans had premonitions
they dont thats what concerns me
computer maintain a continuous proximity scan of lieutenant tuvok ten metre radius all sensor parameters in case you have any more visions
a logical plan
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
were approaching the vacuoles
on my way
last chance to take the long way around
it does feel like were sneaking through a graveyard at midnight any sign of the vidiians
not yet but its a safe bet theyre in there
tom
trajectorys laid in our trip will take three hours twelve minutes eleven seconds with two hundred and sixteen course changes
well lets get started
engaging at warp eight sit back and enjoy the ride
one of the vacuoles shifted position the computers adjusting our vector
dropping to impulse two point three degree turn starboard jumping to warp six
one down two hundred and fifteen to go
ill be in sickbay
dropping to impulse new heading oh thirty one mark two
theres a ship approaching its on a collision course
im not reading any ship
lieutenant
permission to be relieved sir i am not well
of course
the molecular structures appear to be stable good
report
weve devised a neural agent that should inhibit the vidiians motor functions without causing any permanent damage
good i dont want to add to their health problems i just want to keep them from adding to ours
ill get to work
doctor when was the last time you examined ensign wildman
i performed her annual physical six weeks ago
did you find anything unusual
shes in perfect health
this may seem like a strange question but i need to know if shes pregnant
im not at liberty to disclose that information doctorpatient confidentiality
what about captains orders
sorry medical protocol supersede your authority in these matters
the security of this ship could be at stake
she planned on telling you herself
boy or girl
female half ktarian as a matter of fact which should nearly double the infants gestation period how did you know
and they say im rude
were receiving a distress call
life signs
its ocampan
kes
let me come on board
her ship is accelerating its on a collision course
hull breach on deck nine
emergency forcefields
shes approaching main engineering
state your intentions
let me come on board
its on a collision course
forcefields
were receiving a distress call
bridge to engineering intruder alert
 stop where you are
state your intentions
warp power is fluctuating
shes drawing power from it somehow
problem
hey
torres to sickbay medical emergency
twenty milligrams lectrazine cortical stimulator well start at twenty millijoules
ready
now hes gone into synaptic shock i dont understand
can i speak with him
i think its best to keep him sedated for now
when did this begin
early this afternoon in engineering
time i need the exact time
lieutenant torres called sickbay at fourteen hundred twenty two hours
computer display proximity scan of lieutenant tuvok at fourteen hundred twenty two hours oh
captain
tachyons
i beg your pardon
there was a surge of tachyon particles just before tuvok collapsed
that could have triggered this but where did they come from
theyre normally caused by temporal distortions
time travel
let me know if his condition changes
kes you have telepathic abilities have you experienced anything unusual during the past couple of days hallucinations premonitions
no nothing
if you do youll let me know
of course captain
were low on neurostabilisers ill go replicate some more
hurry back
wheres the tactical data you promised us
im downloading it now ill transmit it to you once youve arrived
i need it now
janeways already suspicious if i transmit it now ill be discovered
thats your problem
apparently its yours too
gentlemen scan for tachyon particles deck by deck
tachyons
do it
looking for something specific
im not sure
report
were under attack a vidiian ship is closing on our position
battlestations
weve lost warp drive and weapons
theyre cutting through our shields remodulate
im trying they keep matching the frequencies
weve still got impulse
theyve taken out navigation i cant plot a course
theyre cutting an access route through the hull evacuate deck three and seal it off
bridge to sickbay are you ready with that neural agent
aye captain
stand by to release it on deck three
acknowledged fifty millilitres should suffice
doctor
doctor to the bridge environmental controls arent responding
harry whats going on
weve been locked out of that system
what do you mean locked out
the command relays have been fused
they know where to find us they know our shield frequencies which systems to target
were being boarded
im reading an em fluctuation it could be a transmission
location
airponics bay
whos down there
im picking up two bioreadings the sensors must be malfunctioning theyre both reading as kes
security to airponics bay shut down control functions to that section im going down there something tells me weve got more than one battle on our hands
computer initiate siteto site transport programme kes beta six
unable to comply control functions have been disabled
shush shush im taking you home
weve got weapons back
can you target those hooks
not at this range wed breach the upper hull
its better than being dissected
reverse the hull polarity maybe we can shake them loose
now one of you doesnt belong here and im guessing its you tuvoks premonitions were real youre from the future
a future im about to change
youre helping the vidiians kes why
tell me why youre doing this
i wont let you hurt her again
i havent done anything to harm her
you took her from ocampa her home shes a prisoner on this ship
no ones a prisoner here kes
i was a child you corrupted me with your ideas
what ideas
exploration discovery i believed you
hull polarity loosened their hold but not by much
its a start reroute the deflector have it discharge antigraviton pulses along the hull engage the inertial dampers get a controlled pitch going
in three years im going to leave voyager in search of higher things because you encouraged me to do it you encouraged me to develop my mental abilities i wasnt ready for what i found i couldnt control it it scared me i had nowhere to go i thought of returning home to ocampa but id changed too much i knew theyd be frightened of me i knew they wouldnt accept me but theyll accept her
you dont have to destroy this ship kes we can help you
no i trusted you
kes
no
were breaking free
theyre trying to lock on us with a tractor beam
reverse thrusters full power
that could tear the hull apart
then tear it apart
photon torpedoes full spread ready fire
its set to kill kes
janeway to bridge status
the vidiians are in retreat everything all right down there
for now
she was here in my last premonition she appeared older her face was tired
what was she doing
she had her hands on the casing as if she was drawing energy from it
the tachyons are concentrated here its possible she needed the core to travel back in time
if thats true then shell need it again
and we dont know when thatll be we have to be ready
doctor to the captain
go ahead
kes has regained consciousness
what do you remember
i was in airponics and then i felt dizzy and then i was watching myself
yourself
computer deactivate emh what im about to tell you stays between the three of us understood
yes captain
something terrible has happened or more precisely will happen were going to need your help to prevent it from happening again
it took exhaustive research sifting through teraquads of data separating fact from rumour but eventually i arrived at the truth
captain
happy birthday
thank you
so its not long before you hit the big three digits huh
indeed have you informed anyone else of your discovery
dont worry tuvok my lips are sealed well youre supposed to blow out the candle
that is not a vulcan custom
humour me
captain to the bridge
on my way well
it was a fire hazard
were receiving a distress call a small vessel on an intercept course
life signs
one its ocampan
id almost forgotten
were being hailed
red alert raise shields
captain
all hands this is the bridge begin emergency evacuation of deck eleven repeat
all hands evacuate deck eleven
you heard her get moving now
open a channel kes
captain janeway i need your help will you please give me permission to come aboard
of course whats happened
please let me come aboard
her ship is accelerating its on a collision course
five seconds to impact
tuvok
lock on a tractor beam evasive manoeuvres
shields are holding her ship is intact
captain a transporter was activated just before impact shes beamed aboard im reading bulkhead ruptures on deck eleven section seventeen eighteen nineteen
how did you know
ready  shut down the warp core you have the bridge
remember me the innocent child youre here to save you blame captain janeway but the choice was yours you made the decision to leave ocampa and you made the decision to leave voyager if youre watching me now youve come back to take revenge on the people who cared about you thats not who you are and thats not who i am dont do this find another way home captain janeway will help you if you give her a chance try to remember who you were try to remember me
dont you remember you made that holorecording because you didnt want this to happen again three years ago you travelled back in time kes you wanted to take that woman with you and you were willing to hand the rest of us over to the vidiians to do it it didnt work you forced me to kill you kes if you go back now itll all happen again just before this terrible thing happened you told me you had nowhere to go thats not true stay here with us
i cant i dont belong here i need to be with my own people
you told me you had the ability to get home but you were afraid the ocampans wouldnt accept you why
i remember
what what do you remember
the holorecording i remember making it you asked me to help you to help myself you wanted me to remember who i was these years were so filled with confusion and anger i buried the memory id almost forgotten
does it really matter which kes goes home
a few snacks for the journey you do still like leola root
thank you what
just looking
see anyone you know
only you
goodbye kes
captain
what should we tell the others
a friend got lost we helped her find her way
shuttlecraft dawkins to jupiter station
go ahead
this is lieutenant reginald barclay requesting permission to dock
granted
what what is it
its me sir reg barclay
come in
doctor z how are you
nice of you to finally drop by
ive been extremely busy the er pathfinder project
youre still searching for that ship whats it called pioneer
er voyager
voyager any luck
actually were on the verge of a breakthrough a communications link
congratulations the first transgalactic phone call
is there any word from starfleet medical
doctors ive been scanned and probed a hundred times and they still cant tell me whats wrong
im sure its only a matter of time
im dying reginald and theres nothing anybody can do about it
seven of nine to the bridge
go ahead
were receiving a transmission from starfleet
route it here
its not a comm link captain it appears to be
a compressed datastream badly degraded
on my way
they say good things come in small packages this is all the data they could send us until next month
next month
theyre using a cyclic pulsar to amplify signals from the midas array but the cycle only peaks every thirty two days
so once a month well be able to receive a short burst of information and well have about seventeen hours to respond
so far weve gotten tactical updates letters from home and news about the alpha quadrant
i dont suppose they found us a shortcut home
it doesnt look that way
we dont have much time to prepare a response and well have to keep it short but i want to give everyone an opportunity to send something even if its only a brief note
inform the crew
yes maam
aye captain
lieutenant barclay the pathfinder project they didnt give up on us so when you write those letters you might want to thank them
mail call
a letter for me oh its from lieutenant barclay
bad news
lewis zimmerman apparently hes seriously ill
zimmerman
hes the father of modern holography he invented the matrix that made my programme possible
oh whats wrong with him
hes suffering from acute subcellular degradation the doctors here are having trouble finding the cause much less a treatment ive included his medical files as youll see the prognosis isnt good they say hes only got a few months im sorry i dont have better news to report but i thought youd want to know
how well did you know him
ive never met the man
if youd like to send a response the captain will need it by nineteen hundred hours
heres the information you requested
thank you
youre reviewing his medical data
i thought i could send starfleet a second opinion its a long shot but maybe my experiences in the delta quadrant could provide some insights i was hoping these borg regeneration techniques might help them develop a treatment for his condition
you bear a striking resemblance
he used his own physical parameters as a model for my matrix cant say i blame him a doctor needs to inspire confidence in his patients compassionate eyes and a strong chin can go a long way
i believe i can help him captain
how
you remember the vidiians the early stages of the phage are very similar to doctor zimmermans disease i believe i can adapt a variety of borg regeneration techniques to arrest the cell damage maybe even reverse it
make sure to pass along your findings thank you doctor
actually i was hoping to administer the treatment myself
what are you suggesting
id like you to send my programme back to the alpha quadrant none of the doctors at starfleet are familiar with these techniques it would take them months to fully understand them much less put them to use
even if we could send you youre needed here
mister paris can take over sickbay hes more than capable weve done this once before there werent any problems
three years ago and we used alien technology
ive spoken to seven of nine she believes we can compress my programme
theres limited space in the datastream if we send you there wont be room for anything else
i realise id be asking the crew to make a sacrifice on my behalf but they can wait another month doctor zimmerman might not have that time
im sorry hes not doing well unusual man i met him once at a conference he managed to offend just about everyone there but he was certainly brilliant im sure starfleet is consulting their best physicians doctor
they are but no ones been able to develop a cure i have but i cant treat a patient whos thirty thousand light years away
im sorry
captain
this is the first time were attempting to send a response we dont know if it will even get through
im willing to take that risk
im not
he programmed me every algorithm every subroutine if it werent for his years of work i wouldnt be standing here i owe him something and frankly so does this crew in a way hes responsible for every life ive saved
lewis zimmerman designed the template for starfleets emh youre one of thousands based on that technology its not as though hes your father
from your perspective from mine hes the closest thing ive got if i dont try to help him now i may never get the chance
youll have to find a way to convince tom to take those duty shifts
hes already agreed
tell him captain jane said hello thats what he kept calling me at the conference i think he did it just to get on my nerves
ive heard he can be difficult
i certainly hope you get a chance to find out
thank you captain
my vocal processor
its not a malfunction ive removed your singing algorithms theyll be stored in a memory buffer until you return
why
your programmes too large for the datastream i have to extract all nonessential subroutines
theyre essential to me theyre part of who i am
are you planning on performing opera during your visit
no
will you be reciting poetry
doubtful
hoverball holophotography
i may want to take a few snapshots to document my trip
sexual activities
i get the point how much has to be left behind
twelve megaquads
i suppose you could get rid of my athletic abilities and my grand master chess programme
that leaves three megaquads your painting skills
oh if you must try to leave a few of my enhancements intact i dont want to look like every other emh on the block i think doctor zimmerman will be very interested to see what ive learned he probably never imagined what one of his own creations could accomplish i could spark a whole new field in holographic research
bon voyage
see you in a month
dont get lost
if ive told you once ive told you a thousand times stay off the food
haley haley whats the status of my lunch
its coming doctor
as if things werent bad enough now im dying of starvation
come in
haley
mister barclay is something wrong
no no just the opposite is he in
hes not taking visitors today
tell him this is important
hes in a prickly mood
ive brought something with me that might cheer him up computer is the download complete
affirmative
lunch
thats not pork chops
its salad
i didnt ask for salad
its healthy
im dying a piece of meat isnt going to kill me any quicker give the plants to leonard hes the one trying to watch his weight
lieutenant barclay is here to see you
i told you i wasnt
he says its urgent
cant it wait until im dead all right send him in three minutes hes got three minutes
be civil to him lewis hes worried about you we all are
i found a friend waiting for me at home
you dont have any friends
well i guess er you could say hes a friend of yours
please state the nature of the medical emergency
an emh mark one im not in the mood for nostalgia reginald
but this is the mark one from voyager
i was compressed into a datastream and transmitted from the delta quadrant
congratulations i recommend a tour of jupiters third moon i hear the lava flows are lovely this time of year
im not here for a vacation im here to treat your illness
you brought a mark one thirty thousand light years to treat me i was wrong about you reginald you do have a sense of humour
care to let me in on the joke
you didnt tell him
tell me what
well i er
youre obsolete extinct yesterdays news
my programme was retired
retired not at all the emh mark one was reconfigured to scrub plasma conduits on waste transfer barges ive been treated by the mark three the mark four not to mention the finest real doctors in starfleet none of them could help me
he has been running almost continuously for six years he has seen more things than most doctors can even imagine
i also have an exceptionally high tolerance for difficult patients
i didnt programme you for sarcasm
youll find im full of surprises
show the good doctor to the plasma generator i understand theres quite a buildup of residue
if we had more time id enjoy trading barbs with you but right now theres a more pressing concern your life im working on a treatment based on a disease i encountered in the delta quadrant but ill need to run a complete analysis however if its impossible for you to believe that a lowly mark one could have anything useful to offer ill be happy to pack my bags and go explore those sulphur mines
go ahead scan away
ill be outside
what were your initial symptoms
radical hair loss fatigue nausea joint inflammation
have you travelled outside the solar system recently
whats that got to do with anything
just answer the question
i havent left jupiter station in over four years
to your knowledge have you been exposed to theta radiation
no
neutron flux
never
have you had intimate relations with a bolian
these are questions first year medical students would ask
im just being thorough
just being thorough
did that creature just speak
his names leonard hes a hologram
computer deactivate iguana
how dare you
im a doctor not a zoo keeper has there ever been an epidemic on this station
no enough questions finish your scans and get out of here
doctor
i said get out of here
i travelled halfway across the galaxy to treat you the least you could do is show a little gratitude
thank you get out of here
i may be the only physician who can save your life you need me
like hell i brought your matrix into this world and i can take it out
im no longer a prototype i have exceeded my original programming im no longer under your control
oh really computer transfer emh to the living quarters
how did it go
power up the midas array im leaving
what what happened this time
i ran a mitochondrial scan there was something odd about the results so i spent a full hour analysing them and what did i discover hes a vulcan marsupial he reconfigured my tricorder you find that amusing
a little well not really
sounds like youre making progress
how so
he only teases people he likes
then he must love me
i take it that you er still havent been able to diagnose him
on the contrary the patient appears to be suffering from an acute case of arrogance
oh thats roy
dont tell me a hologram
it was commissioned by starfleet intelligence an experiment in microsurveillance doctor z keeps it around as a sort of a pet
undercover insects talking iguanas this isnt a research station its a three ring circus you should charge admission
look look you know that we cant send you back for another two weeks so please just just keep trying
i cant treat a patient who wont let me near him hes deranged what he needs is a counsellor
finally ive accomplished something
i thought you might be able to provide some er insight
its not that simple reg doctor zimmerman sounds like a very complex individual id need to speak to him in person
then maybe i could get him to agree to a counselling session
the enterprise is in the middle of a mission were nearly seven light years from you
an important mission
theyre all important reg i could refer you to counsellor jenzo a colleague of mine on earth
i need the best deanna
it would be an interesting challenge
thank you thank you thank you thank you
dont thank me yet ill still need to clear this with captain picard if he agrees i might be able to be there by early next week
ill see you then
come in
good morning problem
i havent decided ive just listened to a communiqué from admiral hayes
nice to have friends in high places
hello captain i hope this message finds you well from what i understand it has not been easy but i want you to know that a lot of people here are very proud of what youve accomplished i also want to assure you that we have not given up finding a way to get you home weve redirected two deep space vessels toward your position if all goes well they could rendezvous with you in the next five to six years
computer advance to time index one twenty one point four
as we get closer and our conversations become more frequent when you respond to this message please let us know of any casualties im sure youve had more than your share im anxious to know the status of your crew the maquis first contacts that youve made interactions with the borg but therell be time for everything our thoughts are with you talk to you soon
what
status of the maquis
do you find that surprising
i dont think of you or belanna or the others as maquis i think of you as part of my crew
you may have forgotten but we havent you heard the admiral itll be years before we have to deal with those issues lets worry about it then
do you have lunch plans
is that an invitation
i was hoping youd help me compose a response
youre on
doctor your lunch is ready
are you all right
fine haley fine give me a few minutes
ah ah lower ah perfect i needed this you have no idea what ive had to endure these past few days last night i woke up and i found him hovering over my bed with a hypospray a smattering of photons thats all he is whats that what is that a tricorder you were scanning me computer realign voyagers emh you
remain calm emotional outbursts will only aggravate your condition
ill tell you whats aggravating my condition you
if youd let me examine you
ill report you to the medical ethics board
doctor
save it for your hearing
if you werent so stubborn youd see im only trying to help
i dont want your help why wont you leave me alone
because for reasons beyond my comprehension i care about you
you werent programmed to care you were programmed to hold a scalpel
i told you im not the same emh you created six years ago
of course you can sing and dance i should install you in a ferengi nightclub
the voyager crew appreciates my attempts to expand my programme
this isnt voyager its my lab and in my lab youre still just a hologram
a hologram you created a hologram who owes you his existence
is that whats keeping you here some twisted sense of obligation well let me assure you you dont owe me anything
doctor
yes haley what is it
you have a visitor
hello im deanna troi which one of you is doctor zimmerman
deanna troi another one of your tricks
excuse me ow
he thinks youre a hologram
i can assure you im quite real
oh well the last beautiful woman to walk in here turned out to be him
ill take that as a compliment
did i come at a bad time
your timing couldnt be better the patient is suffering from acute anxiety normally associated with terminal illness its made him agoraphobic paranoid and extremely antagonistic
i see mind if i sit down
please
reg tells me you wont let the doctor help you
hes a mark one hes obsolete id be safer in the hands of a klingon field medic
i understand hes developed a promising treatment
if youre a borg drone hes threatening to use some kind of ghoulish assimilation technique its not fit for a lab rat
you wont even look at my research from the moment i arrived youve berated me treated me like an antique well let me tell you something antique or not i took a huge risk coming here i had to plead with my captain leave my ship without a surgeon
doctor imagine that your programme was seriously damaged and the only person who could repair you was an engineer from say a hundred years ago would you feel comfortable with that
if he were skilled intelligent creative
honestly doctor a hundred years ago
well i suppose it would give me pause
ha
now put yourself in the doctors shoes imagine you were asked to treat someone you cared about say an emh mark twelve
there is no mark twelve
but if there were and you wanted to save his programme he probably wouldnt let you near him he wouldnt care that youd won the daystrom prize for holography from his perspective youd be out of date but what if you knew you could save him
thank you counsellor for extending that olive branch im willing to see past our differences if he is
all right he can start by purging the plasma conduits on deck six
doctor zimmerman
i will not put my life in the hands of a primitive
youd need a phaser drill to get through that thick skull of his
get out
gentlemen
oh spare us your psychobabble
i came here thinking that you were opposite sides of the same coin identical but different now i see youre both exactly the same youre both jerks
jerks
im starting to think you called the wrong counsellor reg
youll figure something out you always do
things are worse now than when i arrived lewis wont come out of his lab and the emh is hiding in a holodeck
hes feeling homesick i let him use my voyager simulation and it seems to be cheering him up
a hologram fighting to save the life of his creator who just so happens to be the same man his own personality is based on i think id need a whole team of therapists just to get them in the same room
mister barclay said this is your favourite ice cream
i hardly deserve it but thanks youre a hologram
how do you know
im an empath i havent sensed any emotions from you when were you first brought online
nine years ago
no offence but youre more antiquated than the emh mark one and yet lewis seems to listen to you why do you suppose that is were you here when the mark one was created
yes
any idea why lewis made it in his own image
maybe you should ask him
i did he evaded the question i was hoping you might know
he was extremely proud of the mark one he used to dream about hundreds of holograms in every corner of the quadrant saving lives he put so much of himself into its development i suppose it only seemed natural that it should look like him too
but the mark one failed to meet starfleets expectations
he was devastated
he he locked himself away in this lab for two years trying to repair the defects finally he just gave up started from scratch a whole new matrix
the mark two
followed by the mark three and then the mark four he he was obsessed with perfecting it
but none of the later models resembled lewis
he made that mistake once he wasnt about to do it again
and now after all this time a mark one shows up it must be like staring in a mirror at a reflection you dont want to remember
computer resume recording last will and testament doctor lewis zimmerman lets see where were we subsection eight the trojan horse project i hereby bequeath my latest research in holographic infiltration technology to the only engineer i trust to complete the work lieutenant reginald barclay subsection nine holographic art i hereby bequeath my entire collection including the twenty first century masterpiece woman in four dimensions to the person who has appreciated it the most i guess that would be reg barclay too subsection ten haley i realise shes only a hologram but shes been a loyal assistant for many years id like to request that starfleet keep her programme running for as long as this research facility exists shes been as real to me as anyone ive ever known not that ive known many people ive created most of my friends
pause recording  dont worry ill find a home for you too
so this is voyager i like it
its a remarkable facsimile but mister barclay did get a few of the details wrong for one thing neelix doesnt purr
i think that may have something to do with regs cat he named it after your friend
neelix would be honoured if youre here for doctor zimmermans medical files ive nearly finished updating them maybe the next physician will put them to better use
actually i stopped by to ask you to dinner
im a hologram counsellor i dont eat
i know that but wed still enjoy your company
we
lieutenant barclay haley myself doctor zimmerman
no thanks unless that mans eating crow im not interested
its the perfect opportunity for us to talk things out in a more casual environment
sorry
just one meal
i said no
doctor
somethings wrong
troi to lieutenant barclay
go ahead
theres something wrong with the emh
can you be more specific
shes a counsellor lieutenant not an engineer
stand by
whats happening to me
your programme is destabilising
what why
they sent you thirty thousand light years i should have expected some problems
its not your fault mister barclay we just need to find a way to repair the damage
you dont understand your primary matrix is degrading and there is nothing i can do
good riddance to bad photons
hes dying lewis
hes not dying his files are just degrading
there are people on voyager who count on him
ill send them a mark four theyre more reliable
they dont want a mark four they want their friend
no emh was ever designed to be anyones friend hes just a hologram
is that how you feel about me just a hologram
i will not be ambushed in my own lab
stardate 53292 my programme malfunctioned and you cancelled a lecture on vulcan and came all the way home to repair me
theres nothing worse than addressing a room full of pointyeared blowhards i was looking for an excuse to get away
you came back because you cared about me just like you care about the mark one you just wont admit it he may not be perfect but hes still one of your creations and right now he needs his creator dont turn your back on him
computer activate voyagers emh
please state the nature of the medical emergency
youre the emergency
wheres lieutenant barclay
trust me youre in far more capable hands
youre going to repair my programme
who better
just yesterday you threatened to decompile me
that was before your colleagues made me feel guilty
youre ill youre in no condition to perform delicate procedures
ill survive but you wont if you dont relax and let me finish
what are you doing
my scans identified a recursive error in your pattern buffer im trying to isolate it
is that a fractal algorithm
very good im using it to realign your matrix
fractal algorithms are notoriously unstable
in the hands of a novice  whoops
whoops whats whoops
computer deactivate emh
i i cant move
i know i had to take your mobility subroutines offline
how long have i been deactivated
seventeen hours im resetting your parameters
you dont look well you need rest
im fine and so are you your programmes been stabilised
i im going to be okay
no youre going to be better than okay
now what are you doing
welcome to sickbay how may i help you today
well what do you think
i think youve altered my greeting protocol
thats just the beginning ive also added new subroutines for compassion patience empathy decorum
i dont feel any different
because i havent installed them yet i thought youd like to be awake for the big moment reginald was right about you you have exceeded the sum of your programming youve accomplished far more than i would have ever predicted but lets face facts you never overcame the inherent flaws in your personality subroutines youre arrogant irritable a jerk as counsellor troi would say
i believe she was describing you as well
dont change the subject i may not be able to turn you into a mark four but i can make you a bit more presentable
what if im happy with the way i am
im doing you a favour
i dont want any favours and i dont want your new subroutines why cant you accept me as i am
because youre defective emergency medical hotheads extremely marginal housecalls thats what everyone used to call the mark ones until they were bounced out of the medical corps i tried to have them decommissioned but starfleet in its infinite wisdom overruled me and reassigned them all to work waste transfer barges thats where youd be too if you hadnt been lost in the delta quadrant do you know how humiliating it is to have six hundred and seventy five mark ones out there scrubbing plasma conduits all with my face
im sure theyre doing a fine job
what are you doing im not finished with you
im trying to do my job and if you give me a chance youll see that im pretty good at it frankly id hoped that if we ever met youd be proud of me
well i guess it is comforting to know that at least one of you is still doing what i designed you to do
your intercellular proteins are at a dangerous level we should begin the procedure please give me a chance to make you proud of me
maybe we could try it see how it goes
see how it goes
just dont expect me to put you in my will
i im going in
reg
they have been in there for thirty two hours
be patient
well you youre not fritzing anymore
no thanks to you doctor zimmerman ran a diagnostic on my subtronic relays and he made a very interesting discovery apparently i was the victim of foul play
well what what do you mean
he found an algorithm designed to disrupt my matrix you wouldnt know anything about that would you
well traditional therapy wasnt getting us anywhere
well your little scheme worked doctor zimmerman has agreed to the cellular regeneration procedure hell require several more treatments but im optimistic hell make a full recovery
trying to steal my secrets
another one of my hobbies i thought id take home a few memories youre supposed to be in bed
ive got work to do
it can wait go to bed doctors orders
i hope you wont be coming back next month to make sure im taking my medicine
dont worry my captains not likely to authorise another house call
good the next time she sends a datastream you might want to drop me a line let me know how youre doing
if you insist
ready
would you mind
not at all smile
computer deactivate mess hall lights
oh you scared me
that wasnt my intention
no of course not i guess im just a little jumpy especially after what happened the last time
thats why im here
oh
well be shutting down main power soon the childrens regeneration cycle will be interrupted theyll require supervision
well im happy to help to tell you the truth id be grateful for the distraction
the procedure could take several hours
how much do they know about whats happening
nothing the children have overactive imaginations i dont want to alarm them unnecessarily
what if they start asking questions i cant just lie to them
you have considerable childcare experience im sure youll manage
thats close enough let our momentum carry us in
cutting engines
theres a creepy image reminds me of something out of edgar allan poe
looks like a vampire bat you can make out the wings even the ears what do you see tuvok
two starfleet officers with juvenile imaginations
come on tuvok havent you ever looked up at the clouds and seen an animal
i will never understand the human need to find imagery in something as innocuous as a cloud
harry are we ready
yes maam
then lets do it all hands initiate shutdown sequence
computer deactivate emh
everythings all right weve just had to shut down main power temporarily nothing to be concerned about
three two one mark
all decks report shutdown complete captain
janeway to seven of nine were ready
acknowledged
why did they shut down main power
its simply a precaution weve entered a class j nebula and the captain wants to make sure that we dont attract any er residual em radiation
our shields provide sufficient protection against nebula discharge
is that so im afraid that gaseous anomalies were never really my specialty come on gather round ive brought toys and stories and games and i thought that later we might even have a little singalong
i should go to astrometrics seven may need my help
im afraid that astrometrics is shut down too
if were not analysing the nebula why did we enter it
oh that is a long and dull story and not nearly as interesting as flotter meets the invincible invertebrates
is voyager in danger
mezoti theres really no need to leap to those kinds of conclusions
maybe if you explained whats happening in more detail we wouldnt have to guess
this has something to do with deck twelve doesnt it
well what makes you say that
deck twelve section forty two is off limits to everyone but senior officers with a level six security clearance
thats because its haunted isnt it
who told you that
naomi
she was just trying to frighten you
ill have to have a talk with that girl
is it true
does a ghost live there
youre really too old to believe in such silly things
if its not a ghost what is it
we deserve an explanation
i dont think that seven would be too happy if you all started waking up with nightmares
tell us
please
all right gather round but im warning you this is not a tale for the faint of heart
were not faint of heart
our cardiopulmonary systems are reinforced
so dont leave anything out
all right but remember i warned you it all began several months ago before you joined voyager we were exploring a dark nebula just gathering deuterium we had no idea what was in store for us
but when the turbulence started getting rough we should have seen that as an omen
how goes the particle collecting commander
weve got enough deuterium to power the warp engines for another thousand light years
excellent
is something wrong
now that you mention it there is something that i feel compelled to share with you in my capacity as morale officer the crew seem a little on edge
oh they dont appear particularly anxious to me
theyre very good at hiding their fears starfleet training i was wondering how soon we might be leaving this nebula knowing could help me assure them
its difficult to say the bussard collectors are running at maximum but its a slow process we could be here for several more days
days
mister neelix are you certain its not you who is on edge
you know me too well mister vulcan
i can assure you a j class nebula is no cause for alarm
i know its illogical but staring into this murky cloud for hours on end can be a little unsettling when i was a child an immense plasma drift passed through the talaxian system the stars and the moons were blotted out for months from horizon to horizon all you could see was this enormous menacing cloud ever since then ive found it a little disturbing to be in nebulas
perhaps the captain might give you permission to install curtains
thats an excellent idea and i have just the right material
report
the nebulas beginning to destabilise
cause
im not sure it could have something to do with the nadion emissions being produced by the bussard collectors
youre not remembering correctly
i beg your pardon
the bussard collectors dont produce nadion emissions
well the technical details dont matter whats important is that voyagers presence was destabilising the nebula
and the crew wasnt interested in taking any chances
weve got eighty percent of the deuterium we wanted maybe we shouldnt push our luck
agreed bridge to engineering
go ahead
were suspending the dilithium intake
acknowledged
tom take us out
aye
but at that exact moment in the fraction of a second before tom could engage the engines zap we were hit
what was it
the ghost
shush let him finish
whatever it was it shook the ship hard
an em discharge penetrated the hull deck seven section ten
increasing power to structural integrity
were clear
damage
power outages on three decks auxiliary subprocessors are offline no injuries reported
assign repair teams resume course
wed taken some minor damage but for the most part everything was fine or so we thought
what none of us knew was that a mysterious stowaway had come aboard voyager
what kind of stowaway
it was obviously a spacedwelling lifeform
yes but we didnt know that not at that point
was it noncorporeal
in a manner of speaking
hostile
well im getting to that
species 5973
who are they
the borg encountered them in galactic cluster eight theyre multispectrum particle lifeforms
no thats not what this was
maybe it was an interphasic species
we can either debate comparative xenobiology or i can continue with the story now its up to you
continue the story
somehow i thought youd say that now where was i oh ah yes life aboard voyager would have been more or less back to normal if it werent for a few strange malfunctions
come in
ive got reports from repair teams it looks like that em discharge did more damage than we thought transporter room one is out of commission half the sonic showers are offline and we temporarily lost artificial gravity on deck five
any injuries
ensign mulchaey bumped his head on the ceiling
ouch this is terrible computer another cup of coffee black
you can add replicators to your list were getting started on the wrong foot today my friend
captain
im sorry i was talking to voyager
its nothing to be embarrassed about i used to have long conversations with my maquis ship
really what did you two talk about
oh i cant tell you that captainstarship confidentiality
of course
if the doctor heard us hed probably recommend counselling
i wont tell if you wont
deal
commander do you see that
its a meteorite cluster i doubt its anything to worry about
id tend to agree if it werent the same one we passed an hour ago
ensign
yes maam
are you conducting a survey of meteoroids tom
maam
check your sensors were travelling in circles
not according to my readings
tuvok run level four diagnostic on the navigational array
there is a malfunction in the subprocessors it appears were heading back the way we came
all stop reinitialise your sensors
im telling you we rely too much on twenty fourth century technology captain you give me a window and a sextant and i guarantee ill get you where you want to go
weve jumped to warp six
tom
dont look at me
shut down the warp engines
i cant
manual override
no response
bridge to engineering
im reading all stop
lieutenant torres respond
computer locate belanna torres
lieutenant torres is in engineering ensign trumari is on deck four section thirty commander tuvok is on the bridge
find out whats going on harry pull the speech processors if you have to but shut that thing off
ensign vorik is in engineering level two
meanwhile commander chakotay was headed for engineering or so he thought
engineering
i bet you wouldnt try to pull this on the captain have it your way ill walk
the turbolift started to fall
faster and faster anybody hungry
neelix
you havent touched your snacks
snacks are irrelevant continue the story
what happened to commander chakotay
the turbolift plunged eleven decks at high speed the g forces pinned commander chakotay to the ceiling he knew that at any minute he was going to come crashing down to the bottom of the turbolift and there was nothing that he could do about it but then the descent stabilisers reactivated
the way belanna tells it commander chakotay was not very happy when he showed up in engineering that morning
if i didnt know better id say this ship is trying to kill me do you have any idea whats going on
well ive traced the problem to a series of gel packs on deck thirteen it looks like they were burned out by an em discharge from the nebula
and those gelpacks interface with all the affected systems
im on my way to repair it right now feel like giving me a hand
only if we stay out of the turbolifts ill tell you about it on the way
while chakotay and belanna headed for deck thirteen new problems were cropping up all over the ship
crewman celes step away from the control panel
did i do something wrong
you caused a power failure in astrometrics
i did how
thats what im attempting to find out
i dont see how i could have done anything
ive located the problem it appears you inadvertently overloaded a series of eps conduits while performing your diagnostic
but i havent even started the diagnostic
then what were you doing
nothing i just got here
i know that wasnt my fault
these gel packs arent burned out
theres no trace of any em discharge
could it have dissipated this quickly
no it moved
moved
the discharge seems to be travelling through the bioneural circuitry jumping from system to system
can you isolate it
its in a series of gel packs that interface with the environmental controls outside cargo bay two
lets try to get there before it jumps again
by then seven of nine was in cargo bay two to run diagnostics but because the comm system was down they couldnt warn her and she had no idea that something was in the room with her
here
in this cargo bay
then what happened
the creature was clinging to the circuits and bulkheads using them to move about the room it was getting closer and closer
seven of nine to the bridge bridge acknowledge
but of course there was no answer
why didnt she remodulate her neural transceiver and send a message that way
thats an interesting question youll have to ask her
stop interrupting
seven tried to get out but she was trapped
what happened to seven
the entity must have infiltrated her cybernetic systems and turned her against the rest of the crew
it most certainly did not youre letting your imagination run away with you
what happened
why did the light go out
its all right i just have to replace the power cell itll only take a moment nothing to be frightened about
im not frightened but azan is
i am not
there sorry i didnt mean to scare you now where was i oh yes seven was trapped by the forcefields but fortunately for her
help was on the way
computer deactivate this forcefield well have to cut power to the field generators
the computers not accepting my command codes
stand back
the forcefields down
lets get her to sickbay
now most of us were just going about our business oblivious to what was happening but that was about to change
kim to engineering
neelix to the bridge
i want everyone to report to their stations until we figure out whats going on
aye sir
er ensign maybe i should come with you the captain might need me
this is your post you may be needed here
oh of course if you need anything anything at all you know where to find me
so there i was the only thing i could do was wait alone
in the dark
voyager was dead in space system after system was failing including the environmental controls ensign paris told me it was hotter than the tarkanian desert on the bridge
dont you ever sweat
not unless the temperature reaches three hundred fifty degrees kelvin with a humidity factor at approximately
forget i asked
very well
ill make you a deal voyager the next m class planetoid we find well set down and ill give you a nice maintenance overhaul what do you say tom check the conn
i dont know what you did captain but ive got helm control back
thanks my friend
im going to try to get thrusters and impulse engines back online
tom im reading an em surge in your console get away from there
bridge to sickbay medical emergency can we transport him
transporters are offline
why am i not surprised now what
warning oxygen depletion in progress
breathable air is being sucked out of the bridge
reroute emergency power to environmental controls
no effect
everyone out of here now
in sickbay the doctor had his hands full too
youre fortunate another few moments and youd have been asphyxiated where do you think youre going
lieutenant torres needs help with the repairs
doctor
what happened
an em surge seven had a similar experience
the environmental system converted cargo bay two into a micronebula
when gibson and mcminn tried to vent the gas from deck seven they were struck by a discharge too
are we thinking the same thing
it could be an intelligence at work here
some kind of electromagnetic lifeform thats using the environmental controls to make the ship more hospitable for itself
and attacking anyone who tries to stop it
my matrix is destabilising
transfer his programme to the mobile emitter quickly
warning power failure
lets get the injured out of here
deck by deck section by section
the crew was losing control of voyager people were scattered throughout the ship with no idea what was happening
what did you do that for
ensign im so sorry i i thought i thought you were a hirogen or a borg
and what gave you that idea
its dark your shadow
trust me there are no aliens roaming the corridors
you mean we havent been boarded
its just a power failure
isnt that what they sometimes do cut the power
what who sometimes does
hostile aliens they might be trying to infiltrate the ship
how long has it been since youve run into anyone else
i dont know four or five hours i i tried sickbay but it was deserted decks three and four are empty i i was on my way to the bridge youre the first person ive seen
well theres no one on the bridge either
you see then maybe i was right maybe the reason we cant find anyone is because theyve all been assimilated
slow down there was an environmental failure on the bridge thats why its been evacuated i dont know what happened in sickbay or on decks three and four but im sure theres a perfectly reasonable explanation ah ha no ones been assimilated
then where are they
theyve probably set up a temporary command post most likely in engineering thats where im going
can i come with you
of course
ensign
what
do you think we could stop by a weapons locker on the way
i still had no idea what was going on id been waiting in the mess hall for more than four hours in the dark cut off from the rest of the crew
is somebody there hello hello hello
is somebody out there tom if thats you this isnt funny
argh stay away
calm yourself mister neelix
you really shouldnt sneak up on people like that i could have shot you
your restraint is commendable
is there a problem with the air supply
an alien lifeform has seized control of voyagers primary systems its flooded numerous sections with poisonous gas
are you saying that this alien lifeform is trying to kill us
its intentions arent clear however we should evacuate
where to
the captain has established a secure command post in engineering
were you scared
well considering that engineering was eight decks down and the only way to get there was to crawl through pitchblack jefferies tubes its fair to say that i was never more frightened in my life
you shouldnt have allowed yourself to be afraid
is that so
fear distracts people from accomplishing their goals
well thats true i suppose on the other hand fear can sometimes be very healthy
explain
well it keeps you alert keeps you from putting yourself in unnecessary danger
i was afraid once
youve been afraid many times
icheb do you want to tell us about it
it was when we were first disconnected from the hive mind before seven rescued us i couldnt hear anyone elses thoughts anymore i felt alone
i can understand why that was frightening when youre scared it helps to have someone to talk to doesnt it
yes
of course in my case the only one person i had to talk to was commander tuvok
i tried passing the time with a little conversation but as youve probably noticed hes not exactly what youd call chatty
ill bet starfleet has specific procedures to deal with these kinds of situations you know something like protocol one zero zero five in the event your starship is invaded by a hostile electromagnetic lifeform what do you suppose that er that protocol might be exactly
rest assured this crew is doing everything possible to regain control of the ship
youre right im just being silly
i concur
of course the crew of the salvoxia probably thought they were going to regain control of their ship too did i ever tell you about the salvoxia
if i say yes will it prevent you from telling the story
it was a talaxian freighter horrible tragedy happened nearly a century ago after suffering a cascade failure it began to lose life support generators one by one pretty soon there wasnt enough air left to sustain the entire crew so they began to draw lots can you imagine draw the short straw and you suffocate anyway the air continued to diminish and they kept drawing lots the crew got smaller and smaller as they waited for someone to rescue them but no one ever came the salvoxia drifted through space for the next eighty years until somebody finally found her makes me short of breath just thinking about it
perhaps you should occupy your mind with pleasant thoughts before you hyperventilate
right pleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts
what did the bodies like
i beg your pardon
after eighty years were they decomposed
they may have been preserved by the vacuum of space
i shouldnt have told you that story its too gruesome
i wonder what the crew of the salvoxia did for food after their emergency rations were gone
maybe they ate each other
all right thats enough now where was i wed made it more than halfway to engineering
when we ran into an obstacle
commander
what do we do now
if i can access environmental controls i may be able to vent the gas
is there another way around
it would take several hours to reach engineering by an alternate route there is no guarantee wed find a clear path
pleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts
while we were in the jefferies tubes
a good number of the crew had gathered in engineering
ninety seven crewmen have been accounted for theyre in secure locations throughout the ship
neelix
no ones seen him
i shouldnt have ordered him to stay in the mess hall
you were following procedure
captain bad news the lifeforms infiltrated the main computer matrix
as long as it remained in the gel pack there was a chance to contain it
but we cant purge it from the main computer without crashing the few systems we have left
things were looking grim but the captain was about to make a breakthrough that would change everything
captain janeway captain janeway captain janeway is in main engineering
sorry captain i know its irritating ill try to shut it down
hold on a minute this is captain janeway respond
authorisation code required
janeway pi alpha
captain
its only a hunch but i think this lifeform may be trying to communicate
sounds like a comm system malfunction to me
im not so sure the lifeforms been moving from system to system if its intelligent it may be learning how to use those systems in some rudimentary way are you attempting to communicate
unable to comply
even if it understands what youre saying it may not know how to respond
belanna can you call up the comm systems syntax subroutines
ill try
were attempting to make it easier for you to speak to us try to access the database at engineering station three one
database accessed
why have you come aboard our ship
captain janeway report to astrometrics
why do you want me to go there
captain janeway report to astrometrics
i guess ill find out soon enough
captain astrometrics is flooded with nebular gas
astrometrics lifesupport has been restored
it could be some kind of trap this lifeform whatever it is has already injured at least eleven crewmen
i can try to establish a dialogue or i can let it take over my ship seven youre with me
yes captain
while captain janeway and seven of nine headed to astrometrics tuvok was trying to ease my fears by guiding me through a meditation
concentrate on the rhythm of your breathing envision your lungs filled with light follow it back in time to a moment when you felt no fear a moment of happiness serenity
my birthday dinner
describe it
i was surrounded by all my friends theyd gotten together to cook me dinner they prepared all my favourites steamed chadre kab terra nut soufflé i felt loved appreciated safe
captain janeway served you nebular gas
no of course not it was just my imagination playing tricks on me during the meditation my head was too full of scary images for me to relax the captain on the other hand seemed to be getting things under control
review of navigational logs in progress
are you searching for something
affirmative
the nebula
manual helm control enabled
youre returning control of the ship
affirmative
you want me to take you back to the nebula
affirmative
well why didnt you just say so in the first place
returning to the nebula is too dangerous wed risk invasion by other lifeforms
im beginning to think this was all an accident not an invasion
captain
think about it the em surge didnt hit us until our bussard collectors destabilised the nebula and then what happened
the ship began experiencing random malfunctions
im not so sure they were random navigational sensors were fooling us into heading back toward the nebula and then when tom tried to resume course he was attacked this lifeform isnt trying to hurt us its trying to get home can you give us access to the bridge
life support on the bridge has been restored level ten authorisation required
level ten
captains eyes only it wants me to go alone
the captain and the lifeform had begun to establish a rapport but the relationship was fragile
is the viewscreen functioning normally
affirmative
im sorry to tell you this but your nebula is gone
clarify
the gases must have continued to dissipate after we left
warning life support failure on all decks abandon ship abandon
ship abandon ship
the creature was that angry
its home had been destroyed
the lifeform wanted voyager for itself and it was going to kill anyone who remained on board captain janeways only chance of saving her crew was to try to reason with the creature
listen to me i can still help you
abandon ship
there are other class j nebulas ill find you one
unable to comply
id be able to comply if you gave me access to astrometrics
warning oxygen depletion in progress
give me back helm control
warning helm circuits are overloading
abandon ship
at least give me access to the comm so i can warn my crew
unable to comply
as the captain was facing one of her worst fears losing her ship
i was with tuvok and about to face one of mine
tuvok lie still ill try to
mister neelix proceed without me
im not leaving you here
i am injured logic dictates that you take the mask and proceed to engineering
i dont care what logic dictates this isnt the salvoxia were not drawing lots
i am giving you an order
and im disobeying it youre coming with me if i have to drag you by your pointy little ears
i had no choice i had to control my fear
pleasant thoughts pleasant thoughts
while we made our way to engineering
captain janeway tried to make the creature reconsider what it was doing
youre going to kill everyone on this ship do you understand what that means
to deprive of life extinguish
yes and if you extinguish us youll be extinguishing yourself you need this crew
clarify
the technology youre using needs to be maintained who do you think is going to do that when we are gone voyagers secondary systems have already begun to fail in a few weeks primary systems will start to go offline
unable to confirm
access the internal sensors run a shipwide diagnostic see for yourself
abandon ship
the captains rapport with the creature seemed to be breaking down
and she couldnt afford to wait any longer
i need everyones attention were abandoning ship get to the escape pods
we may not be able to eject the pods
well push them out if we have to
he needs medical attention
hell have to wait were abandoning ship
the entire crew had to evacuate the delta flyer and the shuttles were launched followed by all but one of the escape pods
thats everyone but the captain and first officer
after you
i did what you asked were abandoning ship what more do you want
diagnostic completed secondary systems are offline primary systems at thirty two percent estimated time to failure six days thirteen hours
that sounds about right
captain janeway report to engineering
like hell i will
i wont be your prisoner youll have to kill me
acknowledged
captain janeway report to engineering
not until you restore lifesupport and give me back control of my ship
unable to comply
then well die here together im guessing ive got about two more minutes and then youre on your own
captain janeway report to engineering
i told you the only way im helping is if you return control of my ship
it looked like the creature was calling the captains bluff she was down to her last breath but at the last moment
access to all systems has been restored
it took almost two days for the crew to return to the ship eventually an artificial environment was created in an isolated section of deck twelve the creatures been living there ever since
i told you there was a monster on deck twelve
havent you been listening its not a monster its an alien lifeform
what was that
maybe its the alien lifeform coming to get us
havent you learned anything about letting your imagination get the best of you
there that little jolt was probably nothing more than our friend leaving the ship to go to a new home that the captain found for him time to regenerate
what if the lifeform didnt leave
what if it wants revenge
what if i told you i made up the whole thing
naomi told me you always exaggerate
i knew the story wasnt true the moment you said the bussard collectors produced nadion emissions
i should have known better than to try fooling the four of you all right in you go pleasant dreams
how are the children
tucked into their alcoves safe and sound
i hope they werent frightened
oh why would they be frightened captain
they were in the dark for three hours
oh no not to worry i told them a story to pass the time
let me guess mother goose
certainly not some of those fairy tales can be frightening ogres and child eating monsters speaking of which is everything okay
were just taking some final readings before we resume course show him harry
well i hope it lives happily ever after
four of twelve subjunction of unimatrix five two five you have a disease youre one of many with this sickness we want to cure you but we need a better way to identify those with the mutation our testing method is too slow it could take centuries to identify everyone help me find the interlink frequency that binds all of you together then we can put an end to this quickly efficiently comply
ive disconnected you from the hive mind youre alone i know how uncomfortable that can be tell me what i want to know tthen you can rejoin us
i dont know
you must remember something
i dont remember
the frequency
i dont remember
deactivate him wait dismantle him bring me his cortical array
well save that for next time
annika
another milestone youve had your first dream
i felt awake
dreams can often seem quite real tell me more about this forest
it was familiar
perhaps your unconscious mind was drawing on a childhood memory
i spoke to someone he called me by my human name
did you recognise him
he seemed familiar
this could give us a fascinating glimpse into your unconscious mind any one of those images might have a symbolic meaning the mysterious stranger for example is he a father figure or does he represent a repressed desire for male companionship
i dont wish to dream again please repair my cortical array
this isnt a malfunction seven its a natural step in your human development it might seem unsettling now but youll get used to it before you know it youll look forward to climbing into your alcove each night thisll keep a record of your rem cycles
youre late mister paris
maam
according to the ships chronometer by twenty two seconds
ill make it up at the end of my shift
see that you do
take your station
open it thats an order not only late but improperly dressed that belongs on your collar mister paris
allow me as ships captain i hereby reinstate you to the rank of lieutenant with all the privileges and responsibilities therein your performance on this ship over the past year has been exemplary i expect more of the same
you wont be disappointed
congratulations lieutenant
i didnt notice a little box on my chair
hiding a cake in the console
looks like a distress call
put it through
im getting a carrier wave but no message
origin
an asteroid approximately two light years from here
yellow alert set a course
were in range
drop to impulse on screen magnify
im reading artificial structures its a colony of some kind
open a channel this is captain janeway of the starship voyager we received your distress call
lifesigns
none
im detecting residual weapons signatures theyre borg
any vessels
one a cube at the edge of this system
resume our previous course mister paris warp six make a note in the ships record we responded to a distress call at oh nine hundred hours arrived at the colony two hours later no survivors we dont know who these people were but we know the borg destroyed them
come with me
im regenerating this is only a dream
youre not dreaming i brought you here this is unimatrix zero
there is no unimatrix zero who are you
five of twelve secondary adjunct of trimatrix nine four two but when im here my name is axum
axum
sound familiar
yes
good its starting to come back to you
is anyone here
hello
i think im lost
im axum this is annika
my fathers ship started shaking men came aboard they looked like machines will you help me find my father
ill see what i can do there are other children here would you like to meet them
i just got here too this environment is intimidating but i believe its safe
he was just assimilated
hes probably still in a maturation chamber
are you telling me this isnt a real placeits some kind of virtual construct
we come here during our regeneration cycles we can exist as individuals here
unimatrix zero
you used to come here before you escaped the collective you have the recessive mutation too dont you remember any of it
no what mutation
only one out of a million drones has it
why did you bring me here now
the collective has found a way to detect us its a lengthy procedure but theyve managed to identify and deactivate nearly two hundred of us over the last few months its only a matter of time before they find enough of us to isolate the interlink frequency once theyve done that you can help us stop them
clarify
weve designed a nanovirus that should mask the biochemical signature of the mutation but we need someone to release it into the collective
youre already on a borg vessel why dont you do it
after weve completed our regeneration cycle we have no memory of this place you are not a part of the collective anymore youre our only connection to the real world
scan the node for residual harmonics its a shame youre not alive to experience disembodiment its the epitome of perfection give it to me we have isolated the carrier band but its useless to us without the precise frequency we need additional data two more of the mutations have been discovered in spatial grid six four nine have their cortical nodes removed and analysed bring me the results
unimatrix zero is our sanctuary when were here our thoughts are our own
what was my function
youre thinking like a borg our only function here is to try and regain a fragment of the lives we lost when we were assimilated
mister axum
go introduce yourself they wont mind
hello do you want to play
sure
siral over here i was hoping youd come its great to see you
its always good to be back
i remember him
you were friends you knew a lot of people here you were a part of our lives for eighteen years
im willing to help but i cant do it alone im part of a starship crew now ill have to inform my captain
i told you not to bring her here
we cant do this by ourselves
its too great a risk
we dont have a choice
you do not speak for all of us
what would you rather do have us wait until were all discovered you disappoint me wheres your warrior spirit
petaq ill rip your heart out
go ahead kill me ill be back when i begin my next regeneration cycle you cant stop me korok
if you come here again youll be putting your starship at risk and all of us as well
shouldnt you be off sharpening your teeth
i know you your name is laura youre human
i was assimilated at wolf three five nine its good to see you again but you look out of place your cybernetic implants
our doctor was unable to remove all of my borg components
you dont have to look that way here
my appearance is irrelevant
no its not they may have turned us into drones but they cant change the essence of who we are my cycles about to end talk to your captain we cant do this without
another round with the borg
wed only need to infiltrate a single vessel
oh just one
i am prepared to take a shuttle and do this alone
no offence but how do you know that this wasnt some kind of a dream
seven was wearing a cortical monitor she never reached rem sleep she wasnt dreaming
unimatrix zero is real and so are the people who go there they need our help
what else can you tell us about this place how many drones
no one is certain axum told me there could be tens of
axum
hes someone i used to know he told me there could be tens of thousands perhaps more
how was it created
some of them believe it began as a random malfunction during the assimilation of a single drone and eventually spread to the others
well this is all very interesting but are we sure its worth putting our lives on the line
its my understanding that when we receive a distress call we respond starfleet protocols
shes right this is no different
i understand your reluctance but sevens discovered a potential weakness in the collective before we decide how to proceed id like to learn as much about it as we can
too bad you dont have the luxury of an interlink node
there is another possibility a vulcan technique known as the bridging of minds
go on
i would need to initiate a mind meld with both you and seven acting as a telepathic conduit
you make it sound like a conference call captain it is my professional opinion that we wait until
objection noted i think youll be turning in early tonight
stay at yellow alert maintain longrange scans for borg vessels any sign of trouble you know where to find me
this will be one away mission for the record books
mind melds the last time i heard the words my mind to your mind i had a headache for two weeks
im willing to volunteer if youd rather hold down the fort
i appreciate your trying to protect me but a chance to see this place its worth a headache
how many times have you actually performed this bridging of heads
minds never
then how can you be certain itll work
nothing is certain doctor however i once observed a vulcan master perform the technique i am reasonably confident i can duplicate his success
watching and doing are two different things
as always your logic is impeccable
what a comfort
were ready captain
lets do it
as the conduit ill be aware of both your perceptions if something goes wrong ill break the meld
understood
your minds to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts your minds to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts
welcome to unimatrix zero
seven
annika thats what im called here
drones
come on lets find axum
were close i can almost hear them bring us closer
there amplify disrupt the frequency its not working theyre using a triaxillating modulation youre making this very difficult if we cant terminate their link then well simply have to pay them a visit
you can see why we want to protect this place
were prepared to help you but im concerned that wed only be putting off the inevitable even if we succeeded and you could remain hidden for a year ten years the borg would eventually find you again have you ever considered a more permanent solution
more permanent
youve got a remarkable sanctuary here but thats all it is maybe its time to stop hiding and find a way to fight back
thats not possible
if you could find a way to carry your individualities into the real world to wake up from your regeneration cycles with your memories intact you could begin to undermine the borgs control over you
it sounds like youre suggesting a civil war
i prefer to call it a resistance movement
thats very ambitious captain but we cant retain our memories
not yet but we know a good deal about borg technology maybe we could
weve found another spatial grid three two six cube one one eight four continue
welcome back spatial grid nine eight two cube four six one
janeway
hows your headache
im guessing it didnt go well
lets just say we ran into a little trouble have a seat commander
id prefer to stand
the collectives found a way to infiltrate unimatrix zero it wont be long before they learn enough to destroy it from the inside out i plan to stop them
what have you got in mind
the people there are vulnerable they dont have the ability to take action in the real world were going to give them that ability
how
the doctor and belanna are working on it i know what youre thinking wed be violating half a dozen starfleet protocols and if the collective ever learned we were involved wed be putting voyager in the middle of a civil war valid objections chakotay weve had our disagreements and there have been times when ive chosen to proceed without your support but this cant be one of those times i wont do this without my first officer
the way i see it risking the safety of voyager is a small price to pay if we help these people this could be the turning point in our battle against the borg
im glad we agree because i almost talked myself out of it
somehow i dont think you were ever in danger of doing that
youll inform the crew
this is the nanovirus axum designed to prevent the borg from detecting those with the genetic mutation but ive modified it to nullify their cortical inhibitors instead once theyre infected they should retain their memories of unimatrix zero after they leave their alcoves
does that mean theyll be able to function as individuals stand up to the collective
theres no way to tell this is highly experimental
how do we deploy it
correct me if im wrong but each borg vessel has a device that links it to every other borg ship
the central plexus
if we can gain access to one of those and release the virus there it should be transmitted throughout the collective instantly
any borg activity in the region
it just dropped out of transwarp three point six light years from here
this is a class four tactical vessel heavily armed the central plexus is protected by multiregenerative security grids wed be detected long before we could reach it
meet me in main engineering were going to find a way in prepare the virus
aye captain
i think its time for you to take another nap pay a visit to unimatrix zero tell our friends we havent forgotten them i couldnt help but notice you were a little different in unimatrix zero and i dont mean your lack of borg implants you seemed more
human
if you dont mind my saying so it suited you
ive been told i spent a great deal of time there but since i dont remember unimatrix zero any more than i remember earth its irrelevant
to you maybe but if what i saw was any indication annika would disagree
the klingons have banded together and theyre giving batleths to anybody who can handle one hirogen hunters are moving through the forest targeting drones but were losing people every hour
captain janeway intends to keep her promise
this isnt your battle you dont owe us anything
voyager wont abandon you
a gift from korok takes some getting used to
im sure youll adapt
eleven more drones three hundred metres
sorry
that felt familiar our touching
i told you we were friends
elaborate
now is not the best time
we were more than friends werent we why didnt you tell me
youd forgotten it wasnt my place
how long
six years only while we were regenerating a very memorable six years for me anyway
i should return to voyager
annika
my name is seven of nine
cant we find another borg ship a sphere maybe something less imposing
i rechecked long range sensors theres nothing
this is our target youll keep a transporter lock on me once i make it to the central plexus and release the virus you can beam me back
in how many pieces its ridiculous
agreed i should go im the only one with experience
youre our only connection to unimatrix zero youre needed here it was my decision to help these people this is my responsibility
starfleet tactical directive thirty six the captain will not engage a hostile force without the protection of a security officer the probability of success is greater if there are two of us
make that three if youre going to pull this off youll need an engineer in there
belanna
tactical directive thirty six a
there is no directive thirty six a
there is now
i appreciate the offer but if that cube attacks voyager youll be needed here now you have your orders set a course mister paris
remember when i said i didnt have any objections
cant this wait till i get back
i realise im not going to talk you out of this but ill be damned if youre going in there alone
weve got a lot of work to do commander
you said you wanted my support then take tuvok and belanna with you
and if i dont
i may only be first officer but i still pull a few strings around here the doctor could be persuaded to question your medical fitness
i was hoping for your unconditional support
this is the best i can do
tell them to pack light
janeway to bridge report
someones trying to tap into the main computer
source
its some kind of transwarp signal its activating the comm system
captain
i think its for you
captain
its been a long time how are things in the collective
perfect for the most part voyager
never better
i understand youve established contact with starfleet perhaps youll be getting home sooner than you expected
perhaps
we could help you
how so
transwarp technology youd find that we can be quite accommodating but wed expect the same in return
im not sure i know what you mean
you know exactly what i mean tend to your own crew stay away from things that dont concern you
im afraid i cant do that but thanks for the offer
i wont be as accommodating next time reconsider
im sorry
well see you soon harry
what did she mean by that
why the stab at diplomacy
shes trying to find out what were up to shes worried have belanna and tuvok meet me in sickbay
watch the starboard plasma injectors they tend to run a little hot at high impulse
ill keep an eye on it
the warp matrix is out of alignment
by point three microns since when are you so meticulous
since you volunteered for this insane mission you know i could sabotage the helm youd never make it out the launch doors
then id have to put you on report you might lose that new pip of yours
thatd be a small price to pay
were in visual range
on screen magnify
torres to bridge
go ahead
the delta flyer is ready for launch
on my way guess id better be going huh
anything youd like done around here while youre gone gravity plating recalibrated carpets cleaned
surprise me you have the bridge
you need to prepare the others when they leave their alcoves they may be startled disoriented but they have to behave like drones or we could all be exposed
our ships are scattered across the galaxy most of us will be the only drone on board who knows about this place
shes right what can we hope to achieve
we should each gather as much tactical data as we can what kind of ship were on its armaments location then well coordinate our efforts from here if all goes well well be working very closely together
as colleagues nothing more our previous friendship
yes
its irrelevant
irrelevant well now that ill be able to retain my memory ill keep that in mind
report
direct hit to their shield emitters no damage
increase phaser yield wheres the flyer
theyre approaching heading zero one seven mark three
status
voyager has sustained damage but they are continuing their assault
come on chakotay
one of the cubes shield grids is fluctuating ventral axis secondary emitter
cut primary power thrusters only
tactical cube one three eight is under attack
our forward shields are down
the flyer
theyre closing fifty kilometres
maintain fire
thirty kilometres twenty theyre in range
enhance grid six one one nine
captain i expected something more cunning from you
its time
their ventral shield grid
still fluctuating at a rate of point zero six terahertz
align our transporters to match
aye
theyve detected them
theyre inside
direct hit to the port nacelle were venting plasma
should i back off
no we need to stay close
theyve adapted
hull breach deck eleven
theyre targeting our warp core
no change yet
well have to take the long way around
tuvok
their lifesigns are destabilising
so far so good you can take us out of here now tom
lieutenant
im all right
youve been given a subvocal processor
i can live with it the captain
we were separated i dont know where they took her we must proceed to the central plexus
time
seventeen minutes we should have heard something by now
doctor
their higher brain functions are stable
the cubes changing course new heading one twenty one mark six
matching course and speed
the damage to their propulsion system is regenerating theyll be capable of transwarp in less than two hours
i want you inside unimatrix zero when the virus is released your friends there will be the first to know problem
no but i wouldnt call them my friends
acquaintances then if youre having issues with these people i suggest you set them aside
understood
tell your hunters to patrol the northeastern perimeter more drones were spotted there
understood
wheres that virus you promised
captain janeway is deploying it now
good the borg have increased their attacks here theyre identifying us one by one if youre looking for your mate hes not here
hes not my mate he must not be regenerating
that or hes dead he should have been here hours ago no ones seen him if he died in battle im sure it was honourable here help me
its obvious your heart is in conflict
my heart is functioning perfectly
some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber as well as the battlefield at times like these you must treat your heart as the enemy so you wont be distracted in battle
ill keep that in mind has the virus been deployed
im not sure
do you remember anything your location what ship youre on
no nothing
the central plexus is through here
those must be the shield emitters that seven told us about
we need to get through that hatch
i will attempt to deactivate him
captain
whats left of her how are you holding up
fine
i cant access the plexus without shutting down the power grid for this section thats bound to draw attention is there another way in
the primary access port i think its isolated from the main power grid
where is it
about thirty metres from here
lets take a look tuvok commander
i can hear the collective
the neural suppressant must be wearing off
ill be all right
i heard him the vulcan but hes gone why why cant i hear the others
leave this one to me comfortable
release me
easier said than done i think i designed this trap a little too well what are you doing out here
looking for you korok was concerned
that doesnt sound like korok
he said you were missing
as you can see ive been busy setting traps
not the most sophisticated technology
seems to work hold on
i should return to the camp wait for word on the virus
ill go with you in case you run into any more trouble
as you wish
im sure korok will be glad to see me
tuvok where are you tuvok
commander
stardate 38774 vulcanis lunar colony the time and place of my birth recalling the details of my life helps me remain focused captain if i succumb to the collective i will pose a security risk you must be prepared to deactivate me
without the doctors help that could kill you stay focused stay tuvok thats an order
captain ive bypassed the access codes
welcome to the central plexus
tuvok where are you tuvok
busy
whats on your mind
the away team the plan was to give them two hours its been two and a half
the doctors keeping an eye on them well give it a little more time unfortunately not everything goes according to plan
you know it occurs to me that with you in command and tuvok off the ship that makes me acting first officer technically speaking
whats your point
well its my duty to give you an opinion and in my opinion i think we should pull them out now before its too late
i appreciate your diligence but ive made my decision we wait
how long a day a week
as long as it takes to complete the mission
this mission isnt worth their lives
youve made your point
apparently not
lieutenant a first officer could get in a lot of trouble for talking to his captain that way
well ive learned from the best
i appreciate your concerns tom but i need your support on this
aye sir
download the virus
tuvok
tpaal we share your memories you are part of us now
dont resist
theres a problem with commander tuvok his synaptic pathways are destabilising
if i decide to move in closer i assume my first officer would concur
you assume correctly
we have to get out of this chamber and contact voyager
youre commander tuvok tactical officer of the starship voyager im your captain step aside thats an order
shes irrelevant
captain you must deactivate me
my designation is three of twelve
where are you tuvok the central plexus
range forty thousand kilometres
harry
too much shielding around the central plexus i cant get a lock
stay on it closer
this way
back so soon
target their shield generators stand by phasers
commander
shields to full brace for impact
someones accessing our tactical controls our shields are down
evasive manoeuvres
sensors are offline ive lost the away team
hull breaches decks five six seven
reverse course
we cant just leave them
the borg have our access codes get us out of here
thank you tuvok im losing voices five in spatial grid ninety six twelve in grid one eight two hundreds now thousands
i cant hear you why cant i hear you youve disconnected from the hive mind explain comply
no
im not alone you cant stop us all
i altered the transmission to restore your original appearance i know now vain humans can be
why am i here
youve caused a great deal of suffering i wanted you to see for yourself you are the cause of his death captain you disconnected him from the hive mind
you didnt have to kill him
he was confused irrational i had no choice many more will die unless you tell me how to counteract the virus
sorry we didnt think to develop an antidote
ill assimilate voyager then your doctor created the pathogen he can find a cure
my first officer has orders to delete the doctors programme if you go anywhere near
voyager the resistance is already underway it wont be long before thousands of drones begin to fight back
they will fail
maybe probably but a lot of damage will be done before they do
yes a lot of damage spatial grid nine four cube six three zero complement sixty four thousand drones but i can no longer hear three of them no doubt theyve joined your resistance are they trying to sabotage the vessel and liberate others i dont know because i can no longer hear them initiate selfdestruct
an effective solution dont you agree spatial grid zero nine one sphere eight seven eight complement eleven thousand drones only one is silent but i have no choice i must silence all of them  i know how this must upset you captain as a starfleet officer you value all life even drones how many more are you willing to sacrifice thousands millions you can put an end to this i want you to go on a diplomatic mission its one of your primary functions isnt it negotiations
go on
tell them to rejoin the collective and ill stop the destruction
they will never agree to that
theyre individuals now they have a choice what are you afraid of captain that they may cooperate youve been waiting for a chance to damage the borg now youve found one youre only using them
if you really wanted to negotiate youd visit unimatrix zero you found a way to send drones surely you could go yourself or are you afraid that a taste of individuality might make you realise its something worth fighting for
comply or you will be responsible for many more deaths
youll have to destroy the entire collective to find them all
several drones have reported that they retained their memories of unimatrix zero after their regeneration ended the virus has been deployed
good were going to need all the help we can get the away teams still trapped on that cube
and as you may have noticed were in no shape to mount a rescue
can you get back in find out if they have anybody else aboard this cube
if they do tell them to hurry theyre the only allies weve got
id like to make a few adjustments to your alcove before you return
when this crisis ends ill come up with a more permanent solution so you can spend more time in unimatrix zero youre in a unique position not many of us get to lead a double life
when this crisis ends i intend to sever my link to unimatrix zero
may i ask why
im having difficulties with one of the people there
mister axum whenever you mention his name your pupils dilate by nearly a millimetre blood flow increases to your facial capillaries both are consistent with an emotional response
axum and i apparently had a relationship
oh romantic there go those pupils again
your diagnosis is accurate
well how ironic all this time weve been trying to develop that aspect of your humanity and its been there all along
not any more
my readings say otherwise youre very particular about who you choose to spend time with seven no doubt thats why you and i have become friends if you were involved with axum once doesnt that suggest hes a worthwhile individual
he does possess commendable qualities
coming from you thats high praise theres nothing wrong with feeling ambivalent seven after all youre in the middle of a civil war but eventually you may want to give this romance a second chance who knows you may even get to meet him in person someday
ill say this for your mister axum hes a very lucky man
the collective has found a new way to attack us eleven ships have selfdestructed in the last three hours
we need to coordinate a battle plan a way to strike at the heart of the collective
our target should be the primary unicomplex if we can disrupt the queens control of the hive mind itll give us a chance to organise build up a fighting force
there is one more objective the voyager away team
they fought like warriors their sacrifice will not be forgotten
we can still rescue them
shes right they risked their lives for us now its our turn
theres no time
its a matter of honour korok i thought you of all people would understand that
ill see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs
thank you
its the least we can do
whats wrong
it turns out im on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic space on the other side of the galaxy
i was hoping wed be able to meet one day in the real world
me too there are things i can do where i am ill try to contact species 8472 see if i can persuade them to join the fight
given their history with the borg im sure theyll be eager i guess this rules out vorothon gorge
gorge
it was at the top of our list of things to see in the real world if we were ever freed from the collective dont you remember
we could add fluidic space to our list we still have unimatrix zero
it was sufficient before
and now
where are you
over here
dont be frightened stand up let me look at you comply
youre one of the machine people youre trying to hurt us
thats the last thing i want to do im here to help you all of you
they said you want to assim assima
assimilate you yes but thats nothing to be afraid of you like having friends dont you assimilation turns us all into friends in fact it brings us so close together we can hear each others thoughts
is that fun
yes its fun i was just about your age when i was assimilated i was worried then too but when i began to hear the others hear their thoughts i wasnt afraid anymore
dont you miss your parents
theyre here with me part of us i can hear them right now would you like to be with your parents they miss you they want to see you
can i talk to them
soon but first id like to see more of this
theres a place where you can see the whole forest
show me
its pretty isnt it
i took your advice captain i paid a visit to unimatrix zero its far more primitive than i expected i dont understand how anyone could prefer a crude environment to borg perfection
spend a little more time there you might find out
ive seen enough its an illusion
even so the people who go there are real and they wont give it up without a fight
theyll fail i thought youd like to see our latest accomplishment recognise it
no
i think you do its your nanovirus with a few modifications weve reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones once its released it will erode their autonomic functions they will die within minutes
you have no way to deliver it those drones have been separated from the hive mind they arent linked to the central plexus anymore
no but theres another way i can reach them im prepared to go back to unimatrix zero and release it myself but im willing to reconsider it all depends on you
me
if they rejoin the collective ill spare their lives they listen to you tell them its time to come home you were responsible for many deaths now you can save thousands decide
lets try this again ensign
the warp core is online navigational array shields at twenty percent
weve got sensors short range only
its a start try to get a fix on the away team
now what
someones tapping into our holographic systems
source
its a borg signal
doctor to the bridge
go ahead
someones here to see you and seven commander youd better come down here right away
kathryn
the borg have established this link so i can propose a compromise
were listening
theyve developed a nanovirus that can kill every borg with the mutation theyre prepared to release it inside unimatrix zero unless all the drones there return to the collective
for reassimilation immediately
thats not compromise thats surrender
i wont be responsible for any more deaths at least theyll survive as drones tell them unimatrix zero can no longer exist thats an order have i made myself clear commander
yes captain
we did our best
its not over yet doctor can you disrupt the interlink frequency for unimatrix zero
commander the captain gave us a direct order
yes she did but not the one you think seven
i believe i can but why
didnt you hear unimatrix zero can no longer exist chakotay to the bridge report
a transwarp conduit just opened off our port bow
lieutenant
theyre on an intercept course
evasive manoeuvres battle stations
theyre hailing us
open a channel
starship voyager i am general korok this vessel is now under my command weve come to join you in battle
your crewmates are coming to retrieve you you were wise to comply
chakotay to seven of nine were almost in range
stand by ive isolated the frequency
get korok
our emitters are fully charged
you should be receiving the interlink frequency
we have it
wait for my signal
we have to end our regeneration cycles we cant be here when it happens
will there be anything left
i know were being asked to make a sacrifice but its the only way
were in range
full power to the shields all weapons online voyager to korok its time
you must go
bridge its working unimatrix zero is shutting down
acknowledged voyager to korok now
what are they doing
you wanted to destroy unimatrix zero were just lending you a hand
get me the virus
youre too late theres no one left to infect
this is your compromise
i dont compromise with borg
match their shield modulations and fire
im picking up the away team
im isolating their biosignatures
get a lock
i still cant penetrate their inner shields
voyager to korok status
patience commander theyre trying to remodulate their secondary shield grid
im attempting to compensate
you shouldnt be here
neither should you
ive wasted our time together
no you didnt it gave us a chance to fall in love again
weve lost our only way to be together
no ill find you
axum
ill find you
shields in subgrid forty two are destabilizing target that section
initiate selfdestruct
their shields are down
energise
general korok is finished with his repairs hes already been contacted by another borg vessel in the region its also under the control of former drones
the doctor removed my spinal clamps but itll be a while before im playing hoverball again if i ever imply its been easy on you these last few years remind me about today
noted
well unimatrix zero may be gone but it looks like the resistance is alive and kicking with any luck the collective may never be the same
korok said he would try to maintain contact keep us informed
have you heard from your friend
no but i dont expect to axums vessel is in a remote sector of the beta quadrant if i ever imply that he was nothing more than a friend remind me about today
four of twelve subjunction of unimatrix five two five you have a disease youre one of many with this sickness we want to cure you but we need a better way to identify those with the mutation our testing method is too slow it could take centuries to identify everyone help me find the interlink frequency that binds all of you together then we can put an end to this quickly efficiently comply
ive disconnected you from the hive mind youre alone i know how uncomfortable that can be tell me what i want to know tthen you can rejoin us
i dont know
you must remember something
i dont remember
the frequency
i dont remember
deactivate him wait dismantle him bring me his cortical array
well save that for next time
annika
another milestone youve had your first dream
i felt awake
dreams can often seem quite real tell me more about this forest
it was familiar
perhaps your unconscious mind was drawing on a childhood memory
i spoke to someone he called me by my human name
did you recognise him
he seemed familiar
this could give us a fascinating glimpse into your unconscious mind any one of those images might have a symbolic meaning the mysterious stranger for example is he a father figure or does he represent a repressed desire for male companionship
i dont wish to dream again please repair my cortical array
this isnt a malfunction seven its a natural step in your human development it might seem unsettling now but youll get used to it before you know it youll look forward to climbing into your alcove each night thisll keep a record of your rem cycles
youre late mister paris
maam
according to the ships chronometer by twenty two seconds
ill make it up at the end of my shift
see that you do
take your station
open it thats an order not only late but improperly dressed that belongs on your collar mister paris
allow me as ships captain i hereby reinstate you to the rank of lieutenant with all the privileges and responsibilities therein your performance on this ship over the past year has been exemplary i expect more of the same
you wont be disappointed
congratulations lieutenant
i didnt notice a little box on my chair
hiding a cake in the console
looks like a distress call
put it through
im getting a carrier wave but no message
origin
an asteroid approximately two light years from here
yellow alert set a course
were in range
drop to impulse on screen magnify
im reading artificial structures its a colony of some kind
open a channel this is captain janeway of the starship voyager we received your distress call
lifesigns
none
im detecting residual weapons signatures theyre borg
any vessels
one a cube at the edge of this system
resume our previous course mister paris warp six make a note in the ships record we responded to a distress call at oh nine hundred hours arrived at the colony two hours later no survivors we dont know who these people were but we know the borg destroyed them
come with me
im regenerating this is only a dream
youre not dreaming i brought you here this is unimatrix zero
there is no unimatrix zero who are you
five of twelve secondary adjunct of trimatrix nine four two but when im here my name is axum
axum
sound familiar
yes
good its starting to come back to you
is anyone here
hello
i think im lost
im axum this is annika
my fathers ship started shaking men came aboard they looked like machines will you help me find my father
ill see what i can do there are other children here would you like to meet them
i just got here too this environment is intimidating but i believe its safe
he was just assimilated
hes probably still in a maturation chamber
are you telling me this isnt a real placeits some kind of virtual construct
we come here during our regeneration cycles we can exist as individuals here
unimatrix zero
you used to come here before you escaped the collective you have the recessive mutation too dont you remember any of it
no what mutation
only one out of a million drones has it
why did you bring me here now
the collective has found a way to detect us its a lengthy procedure but theyve managed to identify and deactivate nearly two hundred of us over the last few months its only a matter of time before they find enough of us to isolate the interlink frequency once theyve done that you can help us stop them
clarify
weve designed a nanovirus that should mask the biochemical signature of the mutation but we need someone to release it into the collective
youre already on a borg vessel why dont you do it
after weve completed our regeneration cycle we have no memory of this place you are not a part of the collective anymore youre our only connection to the real world
scan the node for residual harmonics its a shame youre not alive to experience disembodiment its the epitome of perfection give it to me we have isolated the carrier band but its useless to us without the precise frequency we need additional data two more of the mutations have been discovered in spatial grid six four nine have their cortical nodes removed and analysed bring me the results
unimatrix zero is our sanctuary when were here our thoughts are our own
what was my function
youre thinking like a borg our only function here is to try and regain a fragment of the lives we lost when we were assimilated
mister axum
go introduce yourself they wont mind
hello do you want to play
sure
siral over here i was hoping youd come its great to see you
its always good to be back
i remember him
you were friends you knew a lot of people here you were a part of our lives for eighteen years
im willing to help but i cant do it alone im part of a starship crew now ill have to inform my captain
i told you not to bring her here
we cant do this by ourselves
its too great a risk
we dont have a choice
you do not speak for all of us
what would you rather do have us wait until were all discovered you disappoint me wheres your warrior spirit
petaq ill rip your heart out
go ahead kill me ill be back when i begin my next regeneration cycle you cant stop me korok
if you come here again youll be putting your starship at risk and all of us as well
shouldnt you be off sharpening your teeth
i know you your name is laura youre human
i was assimilated at wolf three five nine its good to see you again but you look out of place your cybernetic implants
our doctor was unable to remove all of my borg components
you dont have to look that way here
my appearance is irrelevant
no its not they may have turned us into drones but they cant change the essence of who we are my cycles about to end talk to your captain we cant do this without
another round with the borg
wed only need to infiltrate a single vessel
oh just one
i am prepared to take a shuttle and do this alone
no offence but how do you know that this wasnt some kind of a dream
seven was wearing a cortical monitor she never reached rem sleep she wasnt dreaming
unimatrix zero is real and so are the people who go there they need our help
what else can you tell us about this place how many drones
no one is certain axum told me there could be tens of
axum
hes someone i used to know he told me there could be tens of thousands perhaps more
how was it created
some of them believe it began as a random malfunction during the assimilation of a single drone and eventually spread to the others
well this is all very interesting but are we sure its worth putting our lives on the line
its my understanding that when we receive a distress call we respond starfleet protocols
shes right this is no different
i understand your reluctance but sevens discovered a potential weakness in the collective before we decide how to proceed id like to learn as much about it as we can
too bad you dont have the luxury of an interlink node
there is another possibility a vulcan technique known as the bridging of minds
go on
i would need to initiate a mind meld with both you and seven acting as a telepathic conduit
you make it sound like a conference call captain it is my professional opinion that we wait until
objection noted i think youll be turning in early tonight
stay at yellow alert maintain longrange scans for borg vessels any sign of trouble you know where to find me
this will be one away mission for the record books
mind melds the last time i heard the words my mind to your mind i had a headache for two weeks
im willing to volunteer if youd rather hold down the fort
i appreciate your trying to protect me but a chance to see this place its worth a headache
how many times have you actually performed this bridging of heads
minds never
then how can you be certain itll work
nothing is certain doctor however i once observed a vulcan master perform the technique i am reasonably confident i can duplicate his success
watching and doing are two different things
as always your logic is impeccable
what a comfort
were ready captain
lets do it
as the conduit ill be aware of both your perceptions if something goes wrong ill break the meld
understood
your minds to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts your minds to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts
welcome to unimatrix zero
seven
annika thats what im called here
drones
come on lets find axum
were close i can almost hear them bring us closer
there amplify disrupt the frequency its not working theyre using a triaxillating modulation youre making this very difficult if we cant terminate their link then well simply have to pay them a visit
you can see why we want to protect this place
were prepared to help you but im concerned that wed only be putting off the inevitable even if we succeeded and you could remain hidden for a year ten years the borg would eventually find you again have you ever considered a more permanent solution
more permanent
youve got a remarkable sanctuary here but thats all it is maybe its time to stop hiding and find a way to fight back
thats not possible
if you could find a way to carry your individualities into the real world to wake up from your regeneration cycles with your memories intact you could begin to undermine the borgs control over you
it sounds like youre suggesting a civil war
i prefer to call it a resistance movement
thats very ambitious captain but we cant retain our memories
not yet but we know a good deal about borg technology maybe we could
weve found another spatial grid three two six cube one one eight four continue
welcome back spatial grid nine eight two cube four six one
janeway
hows your headache
im guessing it didnt go well
lets just say we ran into a little trouble have a seat commander
id prefer to stand
the collectives found a way to infiltrate unimatrix zero it wont be long before they learn enough to destroy it from the inside out i plan to stop them
what have you got in mind
the people there are vulnerable they dont have the ability to take action in the real world were going to give them that ability
how
the doctor and belanna are working on it i know what youre thinking wed be violating half a dozen starfleet protocols and if the collective ever learned we were involved wed be putting voyager in the middle of a civil war valid objections chakotay weve had our disagreements and there have been times when ive chosen to proceed without your support but this cant be one of those times i wont do this without my first officer
the way i see it risking the safety of voyager is a small price to pay if we help these people this could be the turning point in our battle against the borg
im glad we agree because i almost talked myself out of it
somehow i dont think you were ever in danger of doing that
youll inform the crew
this is the nanovirus axum designed to prevent the borg from detecting those with the genetic mutation but ive modified it to nullify their cortical inhibitors instead once theyre infected they should retain their memories of unimatrix zero after they leave their alcoves
does that mean theyll be able to function as individuals stand up to the collective
theres no way to tell this is highly experimental
how do we deploy it
correct me if im wrong but each borg vessel has a device that links it to every other borg ship
the central plexus
if we can gain access to one of those and release the virus there it should be transmitted throughout the collective instantly
any borg activity in the region
it just dropped out of transwarp three point six light years from here
this is a class four tactical vessel heavily armed the central plexus is protected by multiregenerative security grids wed be detected long before we could reach it
meet me in main engineering were going to find a way in prepare the virus
aye captain
i think its time for you to take another nap pay a visit to unimatrix zero tell our friends we havent forgotten them i couldnt help but notice you were a little different in unimatrix zero and i dont mean your lack of borg implants you seemed more
human
if you dont mind my saying so it suited you
ive been told i spent a great deal of time there but since i dont remember unimatrix zero any more than i remember earth its irrelevant
to you maybe but if what i saw was any indication annika would disagree
the klingons have banded together and theyre giving batleths to anybody who can handle one hirogen hunters are moving through the forest targeting drones but were losing people every hour
captain janeway intends to keep her promise
this isnt your battle you dont owe us anything
voyager wont abandon you
a gift from korok takes some getting used to
im sure youll adapt
eleven more drones three hundred metres
sorry
that felt familiar our touching
i told you we were friends
elaborate
now is not the best time
we were more than friends werent we why didnt you tell me
youd forgotten it wasnt my place
how long
six years only while we were regenerating a very memorable six years for me anyway
i should return to voyager
annika
my name is seven of nine
cant we find another borg ship a sphere maybe something less imposing
i rechecked long range sensors theres nothing
this is our target youll keep a transporter lock on me once i make it to the central plexus and release the virus you can beam me back
in how many pieces its ridiculous
agreed i should go im the only one with experience
youre our only connection to unimatrix zero youre needed here it was my decision to help these people this is my responsibility
starfleet tactical directive thirty six the captain will not engage a hostile force without the protection of a security officer the probability of success is greater if there are two of us
make that three if youre going to pull this off youll need an engineer in there
belanna
tactical directive thirty six a
there is no directive thirty six a
there is now
i appreciate the offer but if that cube attacks voyager youll be needed here now you have your orders set a course mister paris
remember when i said i didnt have any objections
cant this wait till i get back
i realise im not going to talk you out of this but ill be damned if youre going in there alone
weve got a lot of work to do commander
you said you wanted my support then take tuvok and belanna with you
and if i dont
i may only be first officer but i still pull a few strings around here the doctor could be persuaded to question your medical fitness
i was hoping for your unconditional support
this is the best i can do
tell them to pack light
janeway to bridge report
someones trying to tap into the main computer
source
its some kind of transwarp signal its activating the comm system
captain
i think its for you
captain
its been a long time how are things in the collective
perfect for the most part voyager
never better
i understand youve established contact with starfleet perhaps youll be getting home sooner than you expected
perhaps
we could help you
how so
transwarp technology youd find that we can be quite accommodating but wed expect the same in return
im not sure i know what you mean
you know exactly what i mean tend to your own crew stay away from things that dont concern you
im afraid i cant do that but thanks for the offer
i wont be as accommodating next time reconsider
im sorry
well see you soon harry
what did she mean by that
why the stab at diplomacy
shes trying to find out what were up to shes worried have belanna and tuvok meet me in sickbay
watch the starboard plasma injectors they tend to run a little hot at high impulse
ill keep an eye on it
the warp matrix is out of alignment
by point three microns since when are you so meticulous
since you volunteered for this insane mission you know i could sabotage the helm youd never make it out the launch doors
then id have to put you on report you might lose that new pip of yours
thatd be a small price to pay
were in visual range
on screen magnify
torres to bridge
go ahead
the delta flyer is ready for launch
on my way guess id better be going huh
anything youd like done around here while youre gone gravity plating recalibrated carpets cleaned
surprise me you have the bridge
you need to prepare the others when they leave their alcoves they may be startled disoriented but they have to behave like drones or we could all be exposed
our ships are scattered across the galaxy most of us will be the only drone on board who knows about this place
shes right what can we hope to achieve
we should each gather as much tactical data as we can what kind of ship were on its armaments location then well coordinate our efforts from here if all goes well well be working very closely together
as colleagues nothing more our previous friendship
yes
its irrelevant
irrelevant well now that ill be able to retain my memory ill keep that in mind
report
direct hit to their shield emitters no damage
increase phaser yield wheres the flyer
theyre approaching heading zero one seven mark three
status
voyager has sustained damage but they are continuing their assault
come on chakotay
one of the cubes shield grids is fluctuating ventral axis secondary emitter
cut primary power thrusters only
tactical cube one three eight is under attack
our forward shields are down
the flyer
theyre closing fifty kilometres
maintain fire
thirty kilometres twenty theyre in range
enhance grid six one one nine
captain i expected something more cunning from you
its time
their ventral shield grid
still fluctuating at a rate of point zero six terahertz
align our transporters to match
aye
theyve detected them
theyre inside
direct hit to the port nacelle were venting plasma
should i back off
no we need to stay close
theyve adapted
hull breach deck eleven
theyre targeting our warp core
no change yet
well have to take the long way around
tuvok
their lifesigns are destabilising
so far so good you can take us out of here now tom
lieutenant
im all right
youve been given a subvocal processor
i can live with it the captain
we were separated i dont know where they took her we must proceed to the central plexus
time
seventeen minutes we should have heard something by now
doctor
their higher brain functions are stable
the cubes changing course new heading one twenty one mark six
matching course and speed
the damage to their propulsion system is regenerating theyll be capable of transwarp in less than two hours
i want you inside unimatrix zero when the virus is released your friends there will be the first to know problem
no but i wouldnt call them my friends
acquaintances then if youre having issues with these people i suggest you set them aside
understood
tell your hunters to patrol the northeastern perimeter more drones were spotted there
understood
wheres that virus you promised
captain janeway is deploying it now
good the borg have increased their attacks here theyre identifying us one by one if youre looking for your mate hes not here
hes not my mate he must not be regenerating
that or hes dead he should have been here hours ago no ones seen him if he died in battle im sure it was honourable here help me
its obvious your heart is in conflict
my heart is functioning perfectly
some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber as well as the battlefield at times like these you must treat your heart as the enemy so you wont be distracted in battle
ill keep that in mind has the virus been deployed
im not sure
do you remember anything your location what ship youre on
no nothing
the central plexus is through here
those must be the shield emitters that seven told us about
we need to get through that hatch
i will attempt to deactivate him
captain
whats left of her how are you holding up
fine
i cant access the plexus without shutting down the power grid for this section thats bound to draw attention is there another way in
the primary access port i think its isolated from the main power grid
where is it
about thirty metres from here
lets take a look tuvok commander
i can hear the collective
the neural suppressant must be wearing off
ill be all right
i heard him the vulcan but hes gone why why cant i hear the others
leave this one to me comfortable
release me
easier said than done i think i designed this trap a little too well what are you doing out here
looking for you korok was concerned
that doesnt sound like korok
he said you were missing
as you can see ive been busy setting traps
not the most sophisticated technology
seems to work hold on
i should return to the camp wait for word on the virus
ill go with you in case you run into any more trouble
as you wish
im sure korok will be glad to see me
tuvok where are you tuvok
commander
stardate 38774 vulcanis lunar colony the time and place of my birth recalling the details of my life helps me remain focused captain if i succumb to the collective i will pose a security risk you must be prepared to deactivate me
without the doctors help that could kill you stay focused stay tuvok thats an order
captain ive bypassed the access codes
welcome to the central plexus
tuvok where are you tuvok
busy
whats on your mind
the away team the plan was to give them two hours its been two and a half
the doctors keeping an eye on them well give it a little more time unfortunately not everything goes according to plan
you know it occurs to me that with you in command and tuvok off the ship that makes me acting first officer technically speaking
whats your point
well its my duty to give you an opinion and in my opinion i think we should pull them out now before its too late
i appreciate your diligence but ive made my decision we wait
how long a day a week
as long as it takes to complete the mission
this mission isnt worth their lives
youve made your point
apparently not
lieutenant a first officer could get in a lot of trouble for talking to his captain that way
well ive learned from the best
i appreciate your concerns tom but i need your support on this
aye sir
download the virus
tuvok
tpaal we share your memories you are part of us now
dont resist
theres a problem with commander tuvok his synaptic pathways are destabilising
if i decide to move in closer i assume my first officer would concur
you assume correctly
we have to get out of this chamber and contact voyager
youre commander tuvok tactical officer of the starship voyager im your captain step aside thats an order
shes irrelevant
captain you must deactivate me
my designation is three of twelve
where are you tuvok the central plexus
range forty thousand kilometres
harry
too much shielding around the central plexus i cant get a lock
stay on it closer
this way
back so soon
target their shield generators stand by phasers
commander
shields to full brace for impact
someones accessing our tactical controls our shields are down
evasive manoeuvres
sensors are offline ive lost the away team
hull breaches decks five six seven
reverse course
we cant just leave them
the borg have our access codes get us out of here
thank you tuvok im losing voices five in spatial grid ninety six twelve in grid one eight two hundreds now thousands
i cant hear you why cant i hear you youve disconnected from the hive mind explain comply
no
im not alone you cant stop us all
i altered the transmission to restore your original appearance i know now vain humans can be
why am i here
youve caused a great deal of suffering i wanted you to see for yourself you are the cause of his death captain you disconnected him from the hive mind
you didnt have to kill him
he was confused irrational i had no choice many more will die unless you tell me how to counteract the virus
sorry we didnt think to develop an antidote
ill assimilate voyager then your doctor created the pathogen he can find a cure
my first officer has orders to delete the doctors programme if you go anywhere near
voyager the resistance is already underway it wont be long before thousands of drones begin to fight back
they will fail
maybe probably but a lot of damage will be done before they do
yes a lot of damage spatial grid nine four cube six three zero complement sixty four thousand drones but i can no longer hear three of them no doubt theyve joined your resistance are they trying to sabotage the vessel and liberate others i dont know because i can no longer hear them initiate selfdestruct
an effective solution dont you agree spatial grid zero nine one sphere eight seven eight complement eleven thousand drones only one is silent but i have no choice i must silence all of them  i know how this must upset you captain as a starfleet officer you value all life even drones how many more are you willing to sacrifice thousands millions you can put an end to this i want you to go on a diplomatic mission its one of your primary functions isnt it negotiations
go on
tell them to rejoin the collective and ill stop the destruction
they will never agree to that
theyre individuals now they have a choice what are you afraid of captain that they may cooperate youve been waiting for a chance to damage the borg now youve found one youre only using them
if you really wanted to negotiate youd visit unimatrix zero you found a way to send drones surely you could go yourself or are you afraid that a taste of individuality might make you realise its something worth fighting for
comply or you will be responsible for many more deaths
youll have to destroy the entire collective to find them all
several drones have reported that they retained their memories of unimatrix zero after their regeneration ended the virus has been deployed
good were going to need all the help we can get the away teams still trapped on that cube
and as you may have noticed were in no shape to mount a rescue
can you get back in find out if they have anybody else aboard this cube
if they do tell them to hurry theyre the only allies weve got
id like to make a few adjustments to your alcove before you return
when this crisis ends ill come up with a more permanent solution so you can spend more time in unimatrix zero youre in a unique position not many of us get to lead a double life
when this crisis ends i intend to sever my link to unimatrix zero
may i ask why
im having difficulties with one of the people there
mister axum whenever you mention his name your pupils dilate by nearly a millimetre blood flow increases to your facial capillaries both are consistent with an emotional response
axum and i apparently had a relationship
oh romantic there go those pupils again
your diagnosis is accurate
well how ironic all this time weve been trying to develop that aspect of your humanity and its been there all along
not any more
my readings say otherwise youre very particular about who you choose to spend time with seven no doubt thats why you and i have become friends if you were involved with axum once doesnt that suggest hes a worthwhile individual
he does possess commendable qualities
coming from you thats high praise theres nothing wrong with feeling ambivalent seven after all youre in the middle of a civil war but eventually you may want to give this romance a second chance who knows you may even get to meet him in person someday
ill say this for your mister axum hes a very lucky man
the collective has found a new way to attack us eleven ships have selfdestructed in the last three hours
we need to coordinate a battle plan a way to strike at the heart of the collective
our target should be the primary unicomplex if we can disrupt the queens control of the hive mind itll give us a chance to organise build up a fighting force
there is one more objective the voyager away team
they fought like warriors their sacrifice will not be forgotten
we can still rescue them
shes right they risked their lives for us now its our turn
theres no time
its a matter of honour korok i thought you of all people would understand that
ill see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs
thank you
its the least we can do
whats wrong
it turns out im on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic space on the other side of the galaxy
i was hoping wed be able to meet one day in the real world
me too there are things i can do where i am ill try to contact species 8472 see if i can persuade them to join the fight
given their history with the borg im sure theyll be eager i guess this rules out vorothon gorge
gorge
it was at the top of our list of things to see in the real world if we were ever freed from the collective dont you remember
we could add fluidic space to our list we still have unimatrix zero
it was sufficient before
and now
where are you
over here
dont be frightened stand up let me look at you comply
youre one of the machine people youre trying to hurt us
thats the last thing i want to do im here to help you all of you
they said you want to assim assima
assimilate you yes but thats nothing to be afraid of you like having friends dont you assimilation turns us all into friends in fact it brings us so close together we can hear each others thoughts
is that fun
yes its fun i was just about your age when i was assimilated i was worried then too but when i began to hear the others hear their thoughts i wasnt afraid anymore
dont you miss your parents
theyre here with me part of us i can hear them right now would you like to be with your parents they miss you they want to see you
can i talk to them
soon but first id like to see more of this
theres a place where you can see the whole forest
show me
its pretty isnt it
i took your advice captain i paid a visit to unimatrix zero its far more primitive than i expected i dont understand how anyone could prefer a crude environment to borg perfection
spend a little more time there you might find out
ive seen enough its an illusion
even so the people who go there are real and they wont give it up without a fight
theyll fail i thought youd like to see our latest accomplishment recognise it
no
i think you do its your nanovirus with a few modifications weve reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones once its released it will erode their autonomic functions they will die within minutes
you have no way to deliver it those drones have been separated from the hive mind they arent linked to the central plexus anymore
no but theres another way i can reach them im prepared to go back to unimatrix zero and release it myself but im willing to reconsider it all depends on you
me
if they rejoin the collective ill spare their lives they listen to you tell them its time to come home you were responsible for many deaths now you can save thousands decide
lets try this again ensign
the warp core is online navigational array shields at twenty percent
weve got sensors short range only
its a start try to get a fix on the away team
now what
someones tapping into our holographic systems
source
its a borg signal
doctor to the bridge
go ahead
someones here to see you and seven commander youd better come down here right away
kathryn
the borg have established this link so i can propose a compromise
were listening
theyve developed a nanovirus that can kill every borg with the mutation theyre prepared to release it inside unimatrix zero unless all the drones there return to the collective
for reassimilation immediately
thats not compromise thats surrender
i wont be responsible for any more deaths at least theyll survive as drones tell them unimatrix zero can no longer exist thats an order have i made myself clear commander
yes captain
we did our best
its not over yet doctor can you disrupt the interlink frequency for unimatrix zero
commander the captain gave us a direct order
yes she did but not the one you think seven
i believe i can but why
didnt you hear unimatrix zero can no longer exist chakotay to the bridge report
a transwarp conduit just opened off our port bow
lieutenant
theyre on an intercept course
evasive manoeuvres battle stations
theyre hailing us
open a channel
starship voyager i am general korok this vessel is now under my command weve come to join you in battle
your crewmates are coming to retrieve you you were wise to comply
chakotay to seven of nine were almost in range
stand by ive isolated the frequency
get korok
our emitters are fully charged
you should be receiving the interlink frequency
we have it
wait for my signal
we have to end our regeneration cycles we cant be here when it happens
will there be anything left
i know were being asked to make a sacrifice but its the only way
were in range
full power to the shields all weapons online voyager to korok its time
you must go
bridge its working unimatrix zero is shutting down
acknowledged voyager to korok now
what are they doing
you wanted to destroy unimatrix zero were just lending you a hand
get me the virus
youre too late theres no one left to infect
this is your compromise
i dont compromise with borg
match their shield modulations and fire
im picking up the away team
im isolating their biosignatures
get a lock
i still cant penetrate their inner shields
voyager to korok status
patience commander theyre trying to remodulate their secondary shield grid
im attempting to compensate
you shouldnt be here
neither should you
ive wasted our time together
no you didnt it gave us a chance to fall in love again
weve lost our only way to be together
no ill find you
axum
ill find you
shields in subgrid forty two are destabilizing target that section
initiate selfdestruct
their shields are down
energise
general korok is finished with his repairs hes already been contacted by another borg vessel in the region its also under the control of former drones
the doctor removed my spinal clamps but itll be a while before im playing hoverball again if i ever imply its been easy on you these last few years remind me about today
noted
well unimatrix zero may be gone but it looks like the resistance is alive and kicking with any luck the collective may never be the same
korok said he would try to maintain contact keep us informed
have you heard from your friend
no but i dont expect to axums vessel is in a remote sector of the beta quadrant if i ever imply that he was nothing more than a friend remind me about today
thank you again for taking care of them captain were very grateful
were just glad that rebi and azan will have a chance to grow up with their own people and that youve been kind enough to let mezoti join them
you can still come with us
and you can still stay on voyager
adapting to your absence will be difficult
ill miss you too
its time
ive been studying all available data relevant to this species as you recommended
familiarising yourself with their culture will help you adapt
on wysanti it is not customary to say goodbye but i think i prefer the human way
energise
we should deactivate the childrens alcoves
right now
theyre a drain on voyagers power reserves is there a problem
it just seems like an insufficient amount of time has passed
youre having an emotional response to the childrens departure theyll be fine we should be happy for them
seven
yes
youre crying
my ocular implant must be malfunctioning
crying is nothing to be ashamed of seven you should have seen me the first time i heard puccinis tosca in the holodeck i sobbed through the entire third act
youre a hologram you cant cry
ordinarily but lieutenant torres enhanced my emotional subroutines so i could truly appreciate the performance
then your reaction was the result of a technological enhancement just as mine was the result of a technological malfunction
saying goodbye to the children was a traumatic experience crying was a normal response
except that i was in complete control of my emotions
hmm it seems i owe you an apology according to this your tears were the result of a glitch in your primary cortical node have you experienced any other malfunctions lately headache dizziness diminished motor function
no
really then you wont mind if i check the biomonitors in your alcove just to be sure
ive experienced an occasional headache
why didnt you come to see me
the malfunctions have not affected my work
seven if youre having problems you need to let me know
if itll make you feel better ill be more forthcoming in the future
youre all heart ill schedule some followup tests and make my report to the captain
id prefer to keep this between us i dont want to worry the captain
weve always kept her informed of your medical needs
it was my understanding that all members of this crew have the right to doctorpatient confidentiality
if you want to keep this between us thats where itll stay
have you finished charting the nebula in sector nine four nine
several hours ago ive been thinking while im grateful for the opportunity to assist you in astrometrics id like to take on more challenging assignments
i can assign you additional diagnostics
thats not what i meant i want to work on the bridge
you dont have the proper training
thats why id like to take the entrance exam for starfleet academy i could forward it to earth in the next datastream transmission if i pass i could take the basic classes from commander tuvok he was an instructor at the academy
your plan is ambitious
then you think its a good idea you could take the classes with me earn your own commission
i believe ive already assimilated enough starfleet training
ill need a letter of recommendation from the captain
ill speak to her
i have work to complete in the cargo bay can you finish here
of course
computer initiate regeneration cycle
unable to comply
why
the interface is incompatible
run a diagnostic of alcove zero one
diagnostic complete alcove zero one is operating within normal parameters
initiate regeneration cycle
unable to comply
clarify
your cortical node is malfunctioning
seven i didnt see you
i was just leaving
before breakfast
what time is it
oh five hundred dont tell me youve been here all night
i was unable to regenerate
anything on your mind
my alcove is malfunctioning
well you should ask belanna to take a look at it
i didnt want to wake her
whats all this
nutritional supplements i thought they would compensate
your own recipe
its a mixture of metabolic enzymes and protein extract
let me make you one of my talaxian omelettes it may not have as many enzymes but itll taste better
that wont be necessary i think ill take your advice and wake lieutenant
seven neelix to sickbay medical emergency
you lost consciousness in the mess hall your bodys begun to reject your implants
im afraid its a result of that glitch we found in your cortical node apparently its more serious than we thought
the node is destabilising
its no longer able to regulate your implants theyre shutting down one by one
when youve disconnected implants in the past ive always adapted
minor implants an assimilation tubule here a few nanoprobes there nothing crucial to your human physiology but these implants control your vital functions
and without my cortical node to regulate them ill die correct
borg technology is highly adaptive my cortical node will repair itself in time
i dont think so seven if anything the deterioration is accelerating
youll have to stay here for observation
i think ive been sufficiently observed
would you excuse us please
im sorry for whats happening you have every right to be angry but that isnt going to help us solve this problem
the node will correct itself
suppose it doesnt for the sake of argument is it possible to replicate a new one
the technology is too complex
what if this had happened when you were part of the collective how would the borg have repaired the damage
they wouldnt have trying to repair a node would be a futile exercise the borg would simply replace it
harry we passed a borg debris field six or seven days ago just outside the yontasa expanse see if you can find it on long range sensors
yes maam
its not every day we go looking for the borg whats up
seven needs a new cortical node
captain need i remind you the borg often return to salvage damaged cubes
its a risk im willing to take
i want to help seven as much as anyone but if were not careful well all end up with cortical nodes
thats why im taking the flyer alone
ive located the debris field
transmit the coordinates to the flyer you have the bridge commander
with all due respect the last time you took the delta flyer to confront the borg it ended up in a couple of thousand pieces
i intend to bring it back in one piece this time
a good pilot might be able to help you do that
particularly if hes accompanied by an experienced tactical officer
you shouldnt do this by yourself captain
well then gentlemen i guess youre with me
captain
ill meet you in the shuttlebay
have you talked to seven
just a few minutes ago
and you dont approve
of what
my request
request
im sure seven will discuss it with you when she has the chance im sorry i bothered you
obviously no ones told you
told me what
seven isnt well
whats wrong with her
her cortical node is failing
her cortical node shes going to die
not if we find a new node were on our way to search a borg debris field
i have experience in borg technology let me come with you
i appreciate the offer but its too dangerous
im willing to take the risk
im not willing to let you ill let you know how we did as soon as were back dont worry
seven
why are you here
the captain told me you were ill
im fine
then why are you in sickbay
thats not your concern you have work to complete report to astrometrics
ive finished my work
then ill assign you more
is there a problem
i wish to be alone
come with me please
why is she so angry with me
shes not angry with you shes just angry
i dont understand
its a common response to serious illness shes frustrated to be confined embarrassed to appear vulnerable
she shouldnt be embarrassed in front of me im her friend
and her pupil she doesnt want you or anyone else to see her when shes not at her best
its not her fault that shes sick
of course not but we have to allow her to deal with this in her own way with as much dignity as possible give her time she may decide she wants company and if she does youre the first person ill call
i have isolated a section that contains the bodies of approximately thirty seven drones
thirty seven doesnt sound approximate to me
these drones were killed in an explosion there are only a few left intact
looks like theres still a breathable atmosphere inside any sign of any active borg ships in the vicinity
nothing on sensors
that could change in a hurry run continuous scans
yes maam
tuvok here help me get this off him
no apparent damage to the cortical node
captain youve got company theres a ship
two to beam out
delta flyer respond
three humanoids have just transported aboard this vessel
drones
the only drones here are dead and they belong to us who are you
captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager
this is my debris field captain
we werent aware of that
what have you taken
a cortical node we need it to save one of my crew
everything here belongs to us
put down your weapons and ill consider not activating this laser scalpel
sorry about the delay they knocked our transporters offline
i need you at tactical when i bring us around target their engine core
aye sir
nice shot theyre breaking pursuit
may i ask what youre doing
your filing system is inefficient im implementing a new one
you should be in bed
delivery for seven of nine tarcanian wildflowers cheery dont you think ah if you prefer gladiolas i could go back to the airponics bay
that wont be necessary mister neelix the flowers are lovely arent they seven
thank you ill admire them later
actually i thought id stay and keep you company
seven prefers not to have visitors right now
not even a visitor with a kadiskot board
correct
but its your favourite game
personally i cant blame her youre being extremely insensitive
i am
you know perfectly very well seven is in a weakened state she wouldnt stand a chance against you
youre right i dont know what i was thinking well play later when youre feeling up to it
green
i beg your pardon
i prefer the green pieces youll use red
doctor do you think shes up to it
as long as you go easy on her
janeway to the doctor
yes captain
were back and we have the node
im ready to disengage the damaged node transfer sevens cortical functions to the computer
understood done
initiating the extraction
vital functions are stable
time
twenty seconds
not yet i have to realign her primary neurodes first
the computer cant maintain her cortical functions much longer
ready
her neural relays are going to destabilise in ten seconds nine
almost finished
eight seven six five
transfer sevens cortical functions to the new node
somethings wrong
shes going into anaphylactic shock
her implants arent adapting theyre rejecting the new node
its losing synaptic cohesion
apply a twenty millijoule neurostatic pulse on my mark now
no effect
again
increase the pulse thirty millijoules
computer end simulation
why did you stop
it wasnt working
run it again
captain this was our twelfth simulation something tells me thirteen wont be our lucky number
the salvaged node has been inactive too long
then well find one that hasnt
no matter how many debris fields we sift through a node from a dead drone isnt going to work
who said anything about a dead drone
whats that supposed to mean
weve infiltrated borg vessels before if thats what its going to take to save seven well do it again
are you suggesting ending one life to save another
im not giving up on her
neither am i ill do everything in my power to help her but we both have to face the possibility that it may not be enough
red grid thirteen three
they should have finished the simulation by now
im sure theyll let you know as soon as they do your move
dont you have more important duties to attend to
nothing that cant wait
despite what the doctor told you i feel perfectly fine
really because it looks to me like youre about to lose
kadiskot
i should have seen that coming ah well that makes what sixteen to three your lead
sixteen to two
oh my mistake
oh er i should really see how things are going in the mess hall but ill be back later for a rematch
are you ready to proceed
according to the simulations the salvaged node isnt going to work im sorry
 im still researching alternative treatments and harry and belanna are going to try to repair the faulty node using components from your alcove
theyll fail
were not giving up hope neither should you
with your permission id like to return to my duties
thats not possible i need to monitor your condition
captain
im afraid i have to defer to the doctor
if youd like i can ask icheb to bring some of your work here
doctor computer locate the doctor
the emh is offline
activate the emh
forced to sedate you
doctor
im sorry icheb i wasnt talking to you
wheres seven
i wish i knew when i refused to release her she overrode my autonomy protocols in the middle of a sentence no less
computer locate seven of nine
seven of nine is in sickbay
hes looking for you the doctor i ran into him in the corridor hes about thirty seconds away from calling a shipwide alert
are you going to tell him where i am
no i know what its like to be stuck in sickbay ive escaped the doctor myself once or twice
thank you
any time
lieutenant when you die do you believe your spirit will go to stovokor
you shouldnt be thinking about dying
according to the doctors simulations any attempt to adapt the salvaged node will fail stovokor lieutenant do you believe youll go there
i guess it all depends on how honourable my death is
but you do believe theres something after death
i hope so what about you
the borg have no concept of an afterlife however when a drone is deactivated its memories continue to reside in the collectives consciousness as long as the hive exists so will a part of that drone
you dont seem to take much comfort in that
my link to the collective has been severed for nearly four years if i die everything that i have accomplished in that time everything i achieved as an individual will be lost my memories my experiences it will be as if they as if i never existed
i think youre a little more memorable than youre giving yourself credit for you dont need the collective to validate your existence youve made an impact on every member of this crew thats your legacy
there you are i should have known shed be the one to harbour a fugitive
we difficult patients need to stick together
i want you to return to sickbay immediately
have you devised a new treatment
not yet
then its best that i dont distract you from finding one
seven if you continue to exert yourself your condition will only deteriorate more rapidly is that what you want
what i want is to be useful
i really could use her help i promise not to let her overdo it
you can stay provided you wear this cortical monitor
thank you
are you feeling better
my condition is unchanged ive spoken to the captain about your desire to apply to starfleet academy shes agreed to administer the entrance exam before we send the next datastream to earth
its a list of crewmen who can help you study lieutenant torres is extremely wellversed in warp mechanics ensign kim claims to have aced the quantum theory section
what about astrometrics
you know more about astrometrics than most starfleet officers
still ill need someone to review the material with me
ill ask lieutenant paris to set aside some time
id rather study with you
youve become too dependent on me you must learn to rely on others
and if i dont want to
what you want is irrelevant
why are you acting like this is it because you think youre dying
i am dying im sorry
you may have given up but i havent
i know how to save her
im certainly open to suggestions
ive been analysing the simulations you performed they failed because you tried to implement a cortical node from a dead drone
thats correct
what you require is a live drone
ive already been through that with captain janeway
my cortical node is operational i want you to remove it and give it to seven
absolutely not
well at least review my research
it may as well be a suicide note
i dont agree
well thats comforting
you took these scans of me when i left the collective by your own estimation i emerged from my maturation chamber before i was fully assimilated as a result my physiology is less dependent on my implants
they still regulate many of your vital functions
what about my age im younger so it should be easier for my body to adapt to the loss
youre obviously too young to understand the risks involved
i understand the risks perfectly if we continue to do nothing seven will die
and if we proceed with your idea you could both die
according to my research theres an eighty six point nine percent chance that sevens implants will adapt to my node
eightysix
point nine
what about you without a cortical node how will you regulate your implants
you should be able to compensate with genetic resequencing this isnt suicide doctor i believe it can work all i ask is that you consider it
earths biggest ditch thats what my father used to call it we hiked the north rim when i was nine
its an impressive geological formation
too dusty ive always preferred farm country myself
bloomington indiana your home town youve mentioned it on several occasions
so what do you think
it appears to be a pleasant environment
when we get to earth ill take you there
its more likely this crew will reach earth without me
you dont know that
you refuse to acknowledge the severity of my condition just as i did at first
are you giving up
im merely accepting reality
if id accepted reality six years ago id have settled on the first m class planet we came across instead im thirty thousand light years closer to bloomington indiana
minus several members of your crew
ensign marie kaplan ensign lindsay ballard crewman timothy lang
is there a point to this
every person on this list died under your command you accepted their deaths but i dont believe youll accept mine
thats presumptuous
im not being egotistical on the contrary im trying to make a point
which is
all of these crew members came to voyager with unique personalities but ive required your constant assistance to develop my individuality
and youve come a long way
but not far enough ive disappointed you you feel your task is incomplete thats why my death will be difficult for you to accept
is that what you think that you havent lived up to my expectations
clearly i havent but i want you to know that the failure has been mine not yours
you havent failed seven youve exceeded my expectations youve become an individual an extraordinary individual if im having trouble accepting your condition its only because i dont want to lose a friend
doctor to the captain i need to see you and seven right away
it would be a complicated procedure
no doubt
but you believe itll work
there are significant risks involved to seven and icheb but if youre asking me if its possible id have to say yes
what sort of precautions
no matter how many precautions you take its not worth the risk to icheb
seven this could work
im not willing to extend my life at the cost of yours
you havent reviewed all the data
as long as there is any chance you wont survive the data is irrelevant id like to return to sickbay now
as you wish
youre the captain you could order her to do it
i have to respect her wishes
even if it kills her
i want to help her just as much as you do
if that were true you wouldnt let her die
is there anything i can bring from the cargo bay to make you feel more at home
no thank you
something from the mess hall a piece of fruit
are you offering me my last meal
i of course not is that what you thought
i was attempting to lighten the mood
ah yes well done
icheb to the doctor report to cargo bay two immediately
hes persistent
not to worry ill make it clear to him that persistence is futile
you were summoned too
icheb doesnt seem to have grasped the chain of command yet
remind you of anyone we know
icheb
hes disengaged his cortical node
how
my alcove i programmed it to disconnect my neural relays
can you reconnect them
hes locked me out of the controls
how could you do this
it was the only way i could prove to you that it would work
whats wrong with him
icheb decided to perform a little operation on himself
you have to reconnect his node immediately
i intend to
no if seven can refuse treatment so can i
we dont have time for this
check your scans youll see im already adapting
some of your implants have adapted but not all
then apply the resequencing technique i researched
this debate is pointless i wont accept the node
and i wont keep it
someone had better use the damn thing if it stays disconnected much longer it wont do either of you any good
youre acting like a child
im trying to save your life
only because youve grown too dependent on me
you think i need to learn to rely on other people
yes
what about you youve refused to rely on a single member of this crew you hid your condition from the rest of us you deactivated the doctor and now youre rejecting my help youre the one who needs to rely on others isnt that what people on this ship do they help each other
whenever we can
if the captain were dying youd risk your life to save her wouldnt you and when you respond to a distress call youre risking the life of everyone on this ship to respond to the aid of strangers
hes right
captain hes just a child
i dont think he is not anymore
doctor
dont look at me
please just let us help you
lets begin
good morning
how long have i been regenerating
six days we needed to make sure your implants had completely adapted to the new node
the good news is they have
icheb
his road to recovery has been a little bumpier than yours
has he suffered any permanent damage
i dont think so hes been experiencing some pain but i believe its temporary
pain i caused him
pain he was willing to endure
youve recovered
i expect the same from you
the doctor wants to keep me here another week but im sure ill be back on my feet in half that time
i suggest you get as much rest as you can youre going to need it
why
ive decided to help you prepare for the astrometrics portion of the academy exam you can expect a rigorous and gruelling schedule
seven
yes
your ocular implant its malfunctioning again
actually its functioning perfectly
whats the matter harry you look a little pale
i volunteered for a test flight not a suicide mission
how can we put the new delta flyer through her paces without taking a few risks
another risk like that and well have to rebuild her all over again theres a vessel coming up fast off our starboard beam
shields
range fifty kilometres ten its pulling alongside
wow nice ship
its scanning us
this is lieutenant tom paris please identify yourself
vectored exhaust ports accelerated driver coils your vessel must be fast
gets us where we want to go
check your scanners youll see a comet on the other side of the asteroid field i wonder which of our ships could get there first
sounds like a challenge
are you going to accept
we are not going to race her
this is a test flight right
yeah but
what better way to test the new ship than to see how it stands up to a little competition were ready over here shall i count to three
guess not shes a lot more manoeuvrable than we are
not that im endorsing this misguided exercise but maybe we can even the odds new impulse thrusters
now thats the spirit harry
were catching up a hundred metres fifty
bring the backup generators online and reroute power to the thrusters
and its the delta flyer by a nose
somethings wrong with her ship the cabins filling up with nyocene gas
stand by for emergency transport
are you all right
i think so
i told you this wasnt a good idea
does that mean youre afraid to try again
yeah harry you afraid
no of course not its just that your ship is in no shape for a rematch
my power transformer overloaded
i bet we could find you a spare back on voyager we were about to head back anyway right tom
whatever you say ensign eager
ive been looking forward to my holodeck time all week why cant you borrow three hours from someone else
yours are the last piece to the puzzle tom and i have finally managed to get a weekend off together ive been trading favours with members so that we could get the holodeck to ourselves
a romantic getaway
well thats the idea yes
well ordinarily i wouldnt hesitate to oblige but ive been looking forward to indulging myself in a new hobby something human doctors have been enjoying for centuries
ive already booked a tee time
well if your tee time is more important than our happiness our first chance to be alone in months
fine take my three hours
thank you
so what programme are you planning to run
something new called gedi prime
ive heard of that the vacation paradise that makes risa look like a tourist trap
and a championship golf course if im not mistaken why dont i just join you
somehow i dont think that would add to the mood
dont be so sure you havent seen me in a bathing suit
could you hand me the veridium injector
veridium injector er lets see
the one with the long handle
of course
comfortable
my copilot thinks so too
copilot
i was on my way to meet him when i ran into you
so tell me more about where youre from
its a small trinary system about half a parsec from here
three suns must make for some long days
are you always this inquisitive
that depends on who im talking to
your new power transformer is installed and ready to go
thanks
your impulse drive is a real beauty
i designed it myself
but i couldnt help noticing your warp system seems so rudimentary
warps fine if you like going fast in a straight line but to me thats just physics not flying
i guess its just a matter of taste
anyway for the kind of flying im here for warp is not a factor the race course is only two billion kilometres long
race course
what kind of race course
the antarian transstellar rally three segments covering two point three billion kilometres
with obstacles ranging from dwarf star clusters to k class anomalies
two man crews and most importantly each ship is limited to sublight speeds it is the ultimate test of ship design and piloting skills
not to mention a serious drain on voyagers resources youre suggesting we reassign fifteen crewmen to modify the delta flyer
the race has very specific guidelines
all the ships have to use enriched deuterium fuel the delta flyers not equipped for that
irina agreed to lend us a fuel converter
captain this race is more than just a sporting event until recently this region was a war zone four different species fought for nearly a century to control it
now for the first time theyre competing peacefully to commemorate the new treaty that ended the war
this race embodies everything the federation values peaceful coexistence free exchange of ideas
i think its a great idea
you do
you do
absolutely this competition is just the sort of break we need it would give us the chance to make some friends and allow the crew a little r and r request granted
thank you captain
one thing gentleman now that were in this race were in it to win after all starfleets honour is at stake
dont worry its in good hands
a little tip doc this game was not meant to be played indoors
here to rub salt in the wound
i beg your pardon
i planned to be putting the greens at saint andrews instead im putting into beakers in sickbay thanks to you
me
oh dont be coy ive already approved your time off
the captains told you about the race already
what race i was referring to your romantic getaway
oh no
dont tell me you forgot
do me a favour doc keep a lock on my biosigns
what for
because in about five minutes there may be a medical emergency in engineering
maybe i can get that tee time back
hi
youre early
you packed
not yet actually there might be a little problem
problem
i have the chance to pilot the flyer in a race a really unique race and the captain thinks its a great idea and i guess i got so excited i forgot about our plans but i dont have to do it the captain would understand
its all right
no no i should have remembered this just seemed like such an amazing opportunity pilots from all over
i said its okay
really
the holodeck will always be here this race wont
i do not deserve you
youre right about that
so well plan this vacation for another time
sure
im going to make this up to you i promise
late night can i get you anything
no thanks
oh ah ow oo
are you okay
oh my feet ow i havent had a chance to sit down all day
if youre thinking of cheering me up dont bother
who me never
and by the way you can have your holodeck time back
what about your weekend with tom
he just cancelled it
does he have any idea how much planning it took
no and youre not going to tell him either he just entered this big race and hes really excited and i dont want to spoil it for him
im sure if you tell him how important this weekend was to you hell reconsider
probably but he should be able to do what makes him happy
what about what makes you happy
its time i faced facts neelix tom and i just dont belong together
then youre not in love with him anymore
i didnt say that
belanna if you still love each other
maybe that isnt enough
call me a hopeless romantic but i still think it is
theres a klingon phrase my grandmother used to use moktah it means bad match thats what tom and i are i just hate that its taken me three years to realise it
if youre really such a moktah it must have been an awful three years
no tom is a great guy weve had a lot of fun together and that seems to be enough for him but not for me
why arent you saying all this to tom
i plan to after the race
by which time hell have already disappointed you again i may not know as much about klingon tradition as your grandmother but somehow keeping tom in the dark doesnt seem very honourable my feet are feeling better i should go back to work
we have teams that have travelled quite a distance captain but none from as far as the alpha quadrant
were always willing to go that extra light year for a good cause
well your entrance petition seems to be in order the delta flyer meets our guidelines now all you have to do is win
something tells me the other teams arent going to make that too easy
bridge to the captain
go ahead commander
there is an incoming transmission for the ambassador
route it here
i asked not to be disturbed
im sorry but the aksani are threatening to withdraw unless theyre allowed to host the postrace ceremony
did you explain that weve already promised that to the chessu
yes they said that was unacceptable
arrange for another meeting ill have to find some way of appeasing them well i hope the race you just entered doesnt end before it begins
its that serious
the peace is still very fragile every decision i make no matter how trivial is looked upon as symbolic
so every time you make a concession to one participant
another is offended yes
maybe we can help
that would be wonderful but how
by providing neutral ground for the pre and postrace activities since weve never taken sides in your conflict you couldnt be accused of showing favouritism
if your racing skills are as sharp as your diplomatic instincts the other teams wont have a chance
theres someone to watch out for
whats his story
his name is assan he was a fighter pilot one of the most ruthless
where you going
a little personal reconnaissance we are the hosts lieutenant tom paris welcome aboard
could i get you something a drink something to eat a tour of the ship
were you assigned to serve me
er not exactly
are we friends
i guess not
then you must be one of those pilots who believes in the fellowship of combat
correct me if im wrong but i thought this was a friendly race not a battle
if thats what you believe then youve already lost
well nice chatting with you
learn anything
yeah i should leave the hosting to neelix
joxom
who
my copilot
irina hi
looks like theyre good friends
theyre teammates
close personal teammates
oh it was nice while it lasted
come on
seven i need to run a diagnostic on the lateral sensor array
as soon as im finished
with what
plotting the most efficient course for the first segment of the rally
seems like the entire crew has come down with race fever
maybe you could persuade the doctor to develop a vaccine
im surprised youre putting time into this
initially i did find the activity irrelevant but then i realised that its important for the crews morale and for my relationship with lieutenant paris
your relationship with lieutenant paris
i was speaking professionally i often work with him on navigational problems he can be an erratic individual but hes also a very competent officer and clearly a skilled pilot
its the erratic individual that takes getting used to
no doubt but ive learned that if i embrace some of his interests support him in his personal goals were able to function more efficiently as crewmates
harry where have you been
say qapla
it means success i just wanted to capture the moment not to mention that cute bewildered expression
what are you doing in that flight suit
theres been a change of plans im your new copilot
look i dont have time for practical jokes
neither do i ready to bring that impulse drive online
belanna
okay i was upset that you cancelled our weekend but then i realised why should we spend this time apart when we can be together doing something you love
what about harry
i assigned him to a level five diagnostic in engineering
oh thats terrible
im just kidding i told him how hard it was for us to get time together and he understood anyway the way i see it youre trading an ensign for a chief engineer
well you dont have to convince me i couldnt ask for a better copilot now just remember were not on vacation the point is to win
and you know how much i hate to lose
thrusters online opening shuttlebay doors
the racers are moving into position
ambassador
welcome to the first running of the antarian transstellar rally this moment marks a hopeful point
in our shared history a chance to put aside old animosities and come together
in a spirit of peace and friendly competition
good luck to all of you prepare for the starting signal
captain the honour is yours
mister tuvok fire
weve passed two more ships three still ahead of us
hows my impulse engine
hot but stable thanks to the new fuel converter
that was the number eight ship
assan
whoever it is just grazed our shields port thrusters are offline
compensating that was an old trick back at the academy we used to call that scraping
assan just almost scraped us out of the race
how are we doing on time
twenty seconds to the third marker assans already rounding it thanks to his little tactic
its a long race well catch him
hows our team doing
i announced the delta flyers progress over the comm eleven minutes ago
in a race like this eleven minutes can be an eternity
the delta flyer is in fourth position having completed sixty two percent of the course the aksani vessel is in third position having completed sixty eight percent of the course
you dont make it sound very exciting
im relaying the relevant information
its all in the delivery do you mind attention all hands stand by for a race update with only fifty eight million kilometres left od the first segment the aksani imhotep and terrellian ships are still battling for the lead wait the number eight ship just cut off the number three in the darla system now threes changing course using the gravity from a gas giant to boost its speed its making up for lost ground
sounds like quite a race
apparently its all in the delivery
so much for the aksani now its just down to irina and assan
in a few minutes theyll just be echoes in our aft scanners
well weve still got the mobius inversion coming up
the what
tell me you read the course manual
i skimmed it more or less
oh great
so what exactly is this mobius whatever
take a look it covers the entire last third of the course level six subspace distortions gravimetric shears just think of it as a little wormhole with a big attitude
the terrellian and imhotep ships are still in the lead the delta flyer trailing by a few seconds meanwhile the two chessu ships are continuing to advance claiming fourth and fifth position
my weekly security report
ill read it later
there are a few matters we should discuss
she said later tuvok
somethings wrong theyre disappearing
radiation from the mobius inversion is blocking our sensors
how will we track their progress
we cant not until they emerge from the other side of the anomaly
want to talk about that report now tuvok
later if thats permissible
fifty metres forty we can get through
were too close to each other
im reversing our deflector polarity itll repel their shields why wait for an opening when you can make one
no its too risky
too risky that doesnt sound like the tom paris i know
what are you doing
deploying auxiliary thrusters well need the extra manoeuvring power to get through the gap
belanna
just steer the ship
its them its the delta flyer theyre in the lead theyre pulling away
we did it
you should have waited
i saw a chance and i took it
im the pilot that means i do the flying
attention all racers theres been an accident stay in order and shut down your engines
report
his conditions stabilising i should be able to start dermal regeneration in a few hours
this was assans fault
why
he collided with me so many times my shield generator overloaded joxoms console exploded hes lucky hes alive
if im guilty of anything its of coming in second a situation ill remedy in the next leg
youre doing a poor job of defending yourself
we may have had something to do with this too we grazed both of their shields while in the anomaly
intentionally
it was a tight course everyone was flying very aggressively
your team is not responsible captain my generators were already overloading when they made contact
perhaps none of you is to blame i found this interfaced with her ships shield generator i ran an analysis its a phase inverter designed to cause a system overload
oh its hard to believe someone would go this far just to knock a competitor out of the race
this may be more than a simple case of cheating captain i think someones trying to end the peace
maybe im missing something but were talking about a single act of sabotage how does that threaten your treaty
by itself it wouldnt but we received several threats of a more serious nature
from whom
groups opposed to the alliance arms dealers isolationists political extremists up until now i wasnt sure how seriously to take them
clearly they pose a security threat
yes yes weve done everything we could to protect the races but that may not be enough i dont want to risk any more lives we should cancel the race or at least postpone it until we can guarantee everyones safety
no if we stop now well be letting these extremists win
shes right
very well then if thats the consensus well resume tomorrow as scheduled of course captain if you decide to withdraw wed understand
the last time i checked i believe we were winning
there you are congratulations on taking the lead
thanks
of course youre not going to win
why is that
because we are  youre looking at your new copilot i checked with one of the race officials its perfectly legal and its a chance for both of us to get back in the race
i appreciate the gesture but my ships damaged
you dont know our harry once he sets his mind on something
hell not only fix your ship hell polish the bulkheads
how can you turn me down
apparently i cant
come on you can say it
its embarrassing
i just want to make sure were clear on what were doing
right at the light then readjust my sight
meaning
come about eighty six degrees at the red giant then recalibrate sensors to compensate for photonic interference
right next
do i really have to spend my morning reciting nursery rhymes
it got me through the academy
you were expelled
okay repeat after me i am not the pilot i will not attempt to fly this ship
that one doesnt even rhyme
anyone home
well if it isnt our competition
here to spy on us
i just stopped by to borrow a hyperspanner
looks like you didnt get much sleep
irina and i were up all night
oh really
making repairs to be honest i cant remember the last time i had so much fun shes funny smart we get along without trying im going to ask her if she wants to spend some time on voyager after the race
what about joxom
turns out theyre just teammates i know what youre going to say
no no actually i was just going to congratulate you shes not a borg shes not a hologram and shes not dead looks like you might have finally found yourself the perfect woman
all teams report to your ships the race will resume in thirty minutes
see you on the course
attention all hands stand by for another race update after fighting off a formidable challenge from the terrellian team the delta flyer has managed to hold onto its lead going into the third and final segment
approaching the pulsars
straight through the gate
then remodulate
harry sure had that glow didnt he
what glow
you know that look you get when you first meet someone
yeah his cheeks were a little redder than usual
were through the pulsars harry and irina are right behind us
ease up off the thrusters now i want to conserve some fuel for the final leg
if circumstances were right they might even have a future together
what
harry and irina
they just met its a little early to be planning a wedding
no i just meant that some people just fit together without having to work at it and other people no matter how much they try
are we talking about them or us
what no i didnt mean
if somethings bothering you lets talk about it
we should concentrate on the race
maybe harry and irina arent such a great team after all theyre falling behind
im reading malfunctions in the eps relays but we doublechecked all of them last night
we must have missed something at this rate were going to be out of the race in a couple of minutes
i think i can reroute power through the impulse manifolds
no
why not
it could damage the reactor coils
what do the reactor coils have to do with the impulse manifolds
these systems are different than what youre used to
you do want to win dont you
of course i do
it just seems like every time i make a suggestion you find a reason to reject it
im more familiar with my ship than you are
now what
i think its the injector ports
no its an overload in my console
thats the second time your copilots console exploded quite a coincidence
im sorry harry i really am
you sabotaged your own ship twice why are you trying so hard to get out of this race
what the hell is going on sit down and hold still all right if you wont talk to me maybe youll talk to antarian security you disabled the comm system well just wait someonell come along eventually
were past the last marker time to deploy the thrusters
whatever you say
what happened to im the pilot
that really bothered you didnt it its why you think we dont fit together as well as harry and irina
could we talk about this later assan is gaining on us
well then i guess youd better deploy the thrusters
thrusters deployed this isnt about the race anymore is it
you tell me
if were going to just sit here we might as well see whos winning
youre not exactly in a position to be making requests
admit it harry youre curious too
the delta flyer is still in the lead
good for them
i thought if we could do this one thing together something you cared about that it might help our relationship
i didnt know it needed help
thats part of the problem
whats the rest
you know the rest
so we scrape shields occasionally it keeps things interesting
maybe interesting isnt enough for me what are you doing
theyre stopping theyre dead in the water
ah ah ah
how far from the finish line
less than a million kilometres
that was assan why are we just sitting here
if weve got a problem were going to resolve it right here right now
you done everything possible to take yourself out of the race and now you seem worried that the delta flyer wont reach the finish line im counting more than a dozen ships there spectators officials
all congregated in the name of peace touching isnt it
youve planned some sort of attack there are hundreds of innocent people there how can you do that
not everyone is as comfortable mixing with other species as you are harry some of us believe it was better when we were separate
hey i never asked you to give up this race or anything else that you care about i never asked you to stop being yourself
the only self that i want to be is the guy youre in love with
wow i didnt know you felt that way
how can you say that
well you always seem to have other priorities
im showing you my priorities right now
the delta flyer wouldnt even be in this race if you hadnt told us about it you gave us the fuel converter so we could qualify the fuel converter thats why youre so concerned about tom and belannas crossing the finish line whatd you do to it rig it to explode
how come you never talked to me about this before
well youve got that tough klingon exterior and er i didnt think you liked the mushy stuff
do i look that tough right now
does that mean youre in the mood for some mushy stuff
maybe
exactly what kind of mush are we talking about
you tell me
well theres um kissy stuff
that was nice
and theres the youre the most important person in the world to me
i like that one too
and theres the happily ever after
how does that one work
well traditionally it requires a proposal
were being scanned by some kind of modulating pulse its from irinas ship
they must be wondering why we stopped
theres something odd about the amplitude
wait a minute dit dit dah thats morse code harry and i use it in the captain proton holoprogramme
whats it saying
fuel converter rigged eject what does he mean by rigged
the converters leaking veridium isotopes
why didnt the computer warn us
the online sensors have been tampered with
can you contain the leak
too late the veridium is already reacting with the warp plasma
thatll cause a warp core breach
in less than a minute
then do what harry said eject the converter
its too late i have to eject the core
here well never survive the blast neither will anyone else within a million kilometres
theyre moving again
away from the finish line
warp core breach in thirty seconds
where are we going
a j class nebula filled with ionised gas should contain the explosion
i cant get the ejection subroutines online
warp core breach in twenty seconds
so whats your answer
my answer
will you marry me
warp core breach in fifteen seconds
youre proposing now
its as good a time as any
subroutines back online
warp core breach in ten seconds nine eight
clear
four
go
three
damn
im sorry your team didnt win captain
janeway to the bridge report
that was a shock wave from an antimatter explosion approximately one point two million kilometres from here
excuse me
belanna
i guess we lost
that depends
on what
on how you answer my question
i thought you only asked it because we were about to explode
well were still alive and im still asking
how come you never asked me before
how come youre still avoiding the question
im thinking
think faster
why you going to withdraw the question
no but i might start to beg it could get embarrassing
to the winners belanna paris that has a nice ring to it
thanks but i already have a ring anyway i kind of like the sound of tom torres
i hope youre kidding
hey it is the twenty fourth century
the prophets sing this is a holy time btanay the time of awakening return to that dark place from which all life springs a primal energy charges your blood an energy of rebirth the mind awakens and focuses on its task paghtemfar btanay paghtemfar btanay
fresh flowers an afternoon on the holodeck it almost feels like were dating again
the secret to a lasting marriage keep the romance alive
im not complaining
lecture hall
guess again
opera house not another one of the doctors performances
this is a movie house this is the old palace theatre in chicago built in 1932 look at the detail on that crown moulding
it doesnt look very functional
this place isnt about function its about fantasy
chewing gum
there is such a thing as too much authenticity
attention to detail thats what makes it fun
protective lenses
these will make the images on the screen appear threedimensional
let me get this straight youve gone to all this trouble to programme a threedimensional environment that projects a twodimensional image and now youre asking me to wear these to make it look threedimensional again
great isnt it
crick in your neck
people didnt go to the movies just for the movies you know
really what did they go for
ill try to demonstrate
i can see why this was so popular
shush
maybe this would be more fun if we were alone
computer delete audience
whos that in the front row must be a glitch
no thats tabor
this is an emergency the gill man has escaped please clear the oceanarium get out everybody
you okay
he appears to be in a coma but im reading unusual synaptic activity
what happened to him
i dont know id like to know what hes been doing the last few weeks where hes worked away missions
ill access his duty roster
was ensign tabor wearing these when he was found
no they were on the floor next to him
i dont think they cause comas
lights strobing at certain frequencies have been known to induce seizures we should analyse the optical properties of this movie when was the last time you spoke with mister tabor
about ten fifteen minutes before belanna and i got here he called to say the programme was up and running
funny
lieutenant
when we were in the maquis together we used to joke that tabor must have had his own personal forcefield he went through a dozen firefights without even getting his clothes dirty
hes still alive perhaps his forcefield is holding
commander ive reviewed the sensor logs for the four hours tabor was in here all systems were operating normallysafeties were online
run a level five diagnostic on the logs
janeway to tuvok report to sickbay
on my way
ive found several microfractures in his cranium theyre minor but the pattern suggests he suffered a trauma of some sort theres also evidence of subdermal contusions along his right shoulder
this man was attacked
its possible that whoever did this is still on board go to yellow alert tuvok im putting you in charge of the investigation
aye captain
security override tuvok pi alpha
commander
crewman jor if im not mistaken your quarters are on deck four
i heard what happened to tabor i was looking for a book to bring to him
im afraid hes in no condition to read
i was going to read to him ive heard it helps sometimes to hear a familiar voice
you and tabor were friends do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt him
i cant imagine
could you tell me where you were from oh seven hundred to eleven hundred hours this morning
on duty in engineering you can check with lieutenant torres if you like
that wont be necessary thank you crewman
harrys found evidence that someone tampered with the holodeck sensor logs several files have been deleted
any signs of an outside intruder
no nothing
i believe that a member of this crew is responsible
tabor was wellliked whats the motive
i have one suspect crewman jor
i find that hard to believe ive known her for a long time she and tabor were friends
close friends she had access to his quarters
a close relationship is hardly a crime
it is my experience that emotional involvements often lead to unpredictable behaviour
thats an opinion not evidence
there may be other suspects i intend to question all crew members who had recent contact with tabor
ill check the internal sensors see what else i can find
commander you seem awfully convinced that one of the crew was behind this now you cant tell me thats the only logical conclusion because i can think of a number of others
i realise that my assumptions seem premature but i have a strong instinct about this you might call it a hunch
i didnt think that vulcans had hunches
i cant explain it captain but i cant ignore it either someone on board is responsible and i intend to find out who it is
pressures fluctuating in one one four
youd better check the seals
yosa to engineering engineering
hello
computer seal hatch six one three beta
unable to comply
crewman yosa to security
his neocortical readings are identical to tabors and he has the same microfractures along his right temple
who discovered him
crewman jor
chakotay to crewman jor jor respond
computer locate crewman jor
crewman jor is in the mess hall
crewman jor
if this keeps up i may have to open a special coma ward
take a look at their names tell me if anything strikes you
former maquis
its either a coincidence or theyre being singled out
there hasnt been any hostility between the maquis and the rest of the crew for years
maybe someone on your crew couldnt put the past behind them
my crew
our crew
are you any closer to a diagnosis doctor
they all have the same disruptions in their synaptic pathways the same cranial fractures contusions but i still dont know the cause or how to reverse it
your investigation
nothing conclusive
five crewmen in comas and we dont have a single clue
the assailant must have access to security protocols there is no other way he could have escaped detection
youd better find a way to protect the rest of the maquis im running out of beds
what is it you expect us to do
stay alert report anything suspicious to commander tuvok
id rather report to you if its all the same
hes right ive never trusted the vulcan hes betrayed us before
he was doing his job
he didnt care about the maquis back then why should he now
were not maquis anymore
tell that to our friends in sickbay
oh come on we put our differences aside seven years ago its ancient history
maybe history is repeating itself
look the truth is we dont know what were up against but the last thing we need right now is an outbreak of paranoia now until we get to the bottom of this i want you all to carry hand phasers nobody goes anywhere alone
we thought maybe the intruder left behind some kind of negative image
displaced photons tom figured that if we dampen the photonic ambience and enhance the polarity
we can applaud mister paris ingenuity later what have you found
ensign tabor
now take a look at this
impressive
it doesnt tell us who the attacker was but we do know someone else was here
can you extrapolate the assailants height and weight
id say between a hundred seventy and a hundred ninety centimetres maybe seventy five kilograms
that describes about half the members of the crew
at least we can rule out naomi wildman
is it possible to increase the resolution
were already working on it
keep me informed
commander
stop it youre making me nervous
it doesnt make sense this ship with all its sensors how could five people be attacked without leaving a trace
good question
maybe its a conspiracy ever since voyager began sending datastreams back home starfleet has known that almost a quarter of the crew is maquis
so
maybe they think were still dangerous maybe they ordered the captain to neutralise the threat
yes thats it shes putting us all into stasis the comas are just a cover story
it would be easier than putting us all in the brig
it could be her
oh please
thatll be all crewman please send in mister kim
im still trying to enhance the photon displacement
i appreciate your efforts mister kim but i called you here for another reason in the last datastream from earth you received a letter from someone named dennis kim
my cousin
in that letter he spoke of your mutual friend maxwell saroyan
you read my mail
yes
isnt that a violation of privacy protocols
as the chief of security i have the authority to suspend those protocols under special circumstances
and what is so special about a letter from my cousin
the attacks began shortly after we received the last datastream your letter was part of that transmission
a lot of people got letters
twenty eight to be exact but only six of them matched the physical parameters of the photon displacement
am i a suspect
according to the letter your friend mister saroyan was killed by the maquis a number of years ago
you got me tuvok i confess i was so distraught after hearing maxs name that i fired my captain proton comatizer at every maquis i could find
your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge
tuvok its me harry do you really think id be capable of this
my personal views are irrelevant
i learned about maxs death a long time ago i was upset but i dont blame the maquis and i certainly dont blame anyone on this ship if thatll be all
is everything all right
this investigation is perplexing it defies logic
ill keep you posted on the holodeck analysis
doctor to commander tuvok report to sickbay immediately
on my way
i thought you might like to have a few words with mister tabor
how did you revive him
i didnt his synaptic pathways stabilised on their own
how do you feel
fine sir hungry
what do you remember
not much i was working in the holodeck and then i was here
was anyone in the holodeck with you
no sir
do you know why anyone would want to hurt you
no whats going on
thank you ensign
crewman i remember ordering everyone to work in pairs wheres your partner
er shes er er
whos your partner
lieutenant torres i told her we shouldnt split up sir but she said she could handle herself you know how stubborn she can be
i have a vague idea do you know where she went
cargo bay two sir
belanna computer locate lieutenant torres
lieutenant torres is in cargo bay two
help me get her to sickbay
this is a holy time
what
security to cargo bay two
let the mind awaken and focus on the task my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts
ensign run a metallurgical analysis
two more victims regained consciousness crewmen yosa and jor their bioreadings returned to normal as if they suffered nothing worse than a good nights sleep it doesnt make any sense
it is however a pattern and a pattern implies purpose we simply have to uncover it
any clues here
not yet
im beginning to think our perpetrator is a ghost
perhaps we should conduct a séance
it couldnt hurt
i have worked meticulously yet he has outwitted me each time
how can you be sure its a he
i cant but i am
another hunch
i can almost sense his presence its as though hes challenging me to find him
id say youre taking this a little too personally maybe you should take a break
no
you havent slept in three days get some rest meditate clear your mind
my mind is perfectly clear
i dont want to make this an order tuvok ill go over your scans fresh pair of eyes might help
captain
resist your doubts
dont question your mission
filter out the polarised photons anyone you know tuvok
computer isolate the precise time index of this image
stardate 540904
where was commander tuvok at that time
access to that information has been restricted
by whom
access to that information has been restricted
tuvok whats going on
computer override those security restrictions authorisation tuvok pi alpha
restrictions overridden
where was commander tuvok at the specified time
commander tuvok was in holodeck two
computer based on the most recent data can you give me a better estimation of the intruders height
one hundred eighty two centimetres
and what is the height of lieutenant commander tuvok
one hundred eighty two centimetres
captain i believe i
ignore your doubts
no
commander lower your weapon
paghtemfar btanay
who are you
captain it would appear that i am the guilty party
how is that possible
i dont know but for the safety of the crew you must confine me to the brig
he wants to speak with you but i advise you to remain outside the forcefield
tuvok can you hear me
i hear you but there is another voice trying to control me
another voice whose this is a holy time what did you mean by that
a primal energy charges the blood an energy of rebirth
thats what the voice is telling you
its a bajoran incantation the voice is bajoran
we need to get you to sickbay so i can run
no no more scans leave me alone
dont question your mission
get away from me
what do you see tuvok
the bajoran
ignore him focus on my voice tell me whats happening
i believe ive ive been attacking certain members of the crew the maquis then investigating the crimes with no memory of what id done
attacking them how
mind melds
why
i dont know he is responsible what did you do to me
commander commander is he a member of the crew then who is he
i dont know
the day the first attack occurred did anything unusual happen to you
i was tending to my duties i received a letter from my son
a letter this all started right after we received the last datastream
i reviewed every letter except my own
stay with him doctor
how long
twenty nine hours she woke up just before you did
theyve all recovered we dont know why its tuvok
tuvok
hes in the brig apparently hes being manipulated by some form of mind control can he leave mister paris
i dont see why not but he should wear one of these
theres something i want to show you
exolinguistics always seemed a little too theoretical to me ive decided to study musical composition instead i would have sent you my latest polytonal construct but they wouldnt give me enough room in this datastream maybe next time i can
a letter from his son
we found another signal embedded in the message a letter within a letter
hello father we received your last transmission
this is a holy time btanay the time of awakening return to that dark place from which all life springs
the signal is calibrated to correspond with vulcan synaptic frequencies tuvok wouldnt have been consciously aware of it
teero teero anaydis he was a bajoran vedek he worked with the maquis
doing what
counterintelligence he was thrown out for experimenting with mind control he thought it was a good way to recruit agents
well apparently he was successful at recruiting our tactical officer these incantations and symbols they must have triggered something in tuvok preconditioned behaviour instructions
i shouldve known youd show up again
commander
teero was a fanatic hed go to any extreme for the maquis he called the rest of us traitors for rejecting his ideas swore hed fight the war on his own if he had to
why instruct tuvok to mind meld with voyagers maquis thirty five thousand light years from earth
id like tuvok to take a look at this message maybe itll jog his memory  try to decode those symbols
its him
his name is teero anaydis
teero
he worked for maquis intelligence
yes i remember meeting him i was undercover doing reconnaissance on a colony near the badlands he was a vedek at the bajoran temple there
go on
we spoke briefly he was interested in vulcan culture thats all i remember
maybe thats all he wanted you to remember he was developing some kind of mind control technique we think he used it on you seven years ago
what is it
i i was restrained very frightened
what did he do to you
i cant remember
try
i cant
tuvok if were going to help you we need to find out the last time you meditated it helped the memories resurface didnt it youve helped me meditate i think ive learned a thing or two about the process let me try to guide you
where are you
in a laboratory underground
is teero there
there is someone its him
describe whats happening
lieutenant
tuvok tuvok
it is lieutenant isnt it im sure your maquis comrades would be interested to know your starfleet rank dont worry i dont plan to expose you
what do you want
you youre the perfect subject
for what
im a student of the mind yours is remarkable disciplined orderly on the surface that is beneath
boiling emotions repressed violence in a sense youre two different men one i could never hope to manipulate but the other
i have been trained to resist mind control
thats the rational logical part of you at work but i want to reach your inner fire your spirit
why wait please please dont
paghtemfar btanay
stay away from me
tuvok
complete your mission
no
this is a holy time
commander
tuvok to chakotay
go ahead
paghtemfar btanay
understood
janeway to chakotay commander paghtemfar btanay what did that mean tuvok tell me
this is a holy time a time of awakening
this teero has awakened you to do what if you can remember you can fight him you can resist what does he want
to give us instructions
what kind of instructions
focus on your task
no
its chakotay
what is it
im not sure sickbay to commander chakotay computer locate chakotay
commander chakotay is in sickbay
computer deactivate the emh
commander
paghtemfar btanay
i understand
deck one
why were you using mind melds what did teero want you to do
to awaken the others
resist your doubts
no
focus on me
complete your mission paghtemfar btanay
you dont control me
good to see you commander
its good to be back
janeway to the bridge report
what the hell are you doing
i think its obvious im taking control of your ship within the hour all starfleet personnel will be locked in their quarters step back in the brig kathryn
whats teero done to you
he simply helped us remember who we are were maquis weve always been maquis
the rebellion ended three years ago you know that
in the alpha quadrant maybe not on this ship
torres to chakotay
go ahead
deck eleven is secure
acknowledged
were thirty five light years from earth chakotay no one out here even knows about the maquis it doesnt make sense theres nothing you can accomplish
as long as we exist so does the rebellion
thats teero talking he was unstable you said so yourself
we have no intention of hurting any of you
your orders captain
take your station
captains log stardate 54101 voyager is now under my command were en route to an m class planet where weill relocate the starfleet crew
were in range
on screen looks like a nice place for a federation colony take us into orbit
tuvok would you mind joining me in the ready room
you wished to see me captain
you can drop the formalities this is a maquis ship now vulcan brandy i thought wed have a drink to celebrate
a fitting gesture
to awakenings
awakenings
there are still twenty three of our former comrades who arent with us yet i was hoping youd be able to help persuade them
im prepared to mind meld with the remaining maquis to convey teeros instructions
itll be nice to have my old crew back youve been a big help to us tuvok but i cant forget what happened seven years ago you have a history of betraying the maquis
it wont happen again
we have a small crew i have to be able to trust everyone especially my tactical officer
bring her in
consider this a test of your loyalty its set to kill
you said you wouldnt hurt anyone
youre in control of your actions not chakotay not teero
tuvok
dont do this
this phaser is defective
take her back to the brig
you passed
now weve got some tactical issues to review i want to reroute all weapons control to my console
my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts
kim and paris engineered a little breakout on deck six weve contained them all behind a forcefield
we should begin the evacuation
start beaming them down begin on deck two section zero one
belay that order tuvok informed me that this planet has an unstable atmosphere go to astrometrics and scan for an alternative
what are you talking about theres nothing wrong with the atmosphere
we dont have time to debate this
i can scan from here chakotay whats going on
stand down
your weapon
i thought you might like your ship back
no more rebellion
it took another mind meld with tuvok but im fine
tuvok youre all right
i am in control again captain
whatever you said to him it worked
its good to have you back commander
all ready for attack of the lobster people
i am not familiar with that species
you will be soon enough
i havent completed my security rounds
you have now
buttered or unbuttered
thank you neelix
i saved you a seat
how long is this entertainment
im not sure tom said something about a double feature ive been meaning to ask you how did you know that phaser wasnt charged
chakotay doubted my loyalty he wouldnt have given me an active weapon
not exactly ironclad logic
call it a hunch
remind me to pay more attention to your hunches
shush
trauma team four to level red trauma team four to level red code four nursing unit report to level red
no he does have a sensor its not working
negative for dysplasia viremia necrobiosis please extend your arms species dralian identity gar tc fifteen you may proceed
chellick lucky i caught you
mister gar i wish i had time to talk
well all you have to do is listen i have a new supply of cytogenics
your last supply was useless expired lots diluted samples
oh i have something special this time
the latest in substandard technology no doubt
oh this item is far from substandard and as a gesture of goodwill im offering it to you first
we dont need another neural monitor
this is much more sophisticated than that
im sure it has some ingenious use but im not interested
please state the nature of the medical emergency where have you taken me
its a holographic construct programmed with over five million medical protocols
i demand to be returned to voyager at once
whats voyager
the federation starship to which im assigned this man is a kidnapper
i would never offer you stolen property i traded warpgrade dilithium for this programme
whats your price
this negotiation is pointless im not about to perform medical services for a pair of common thieves
it doesnt seem to be in working order
trauma victims are now arriving at emergency intake seven
what caused their injuries
a generator explosion at the gammadan mining facility
youd better start cooperating or i will dismantle your programme and sell it off one subroutine at a time
when captain janeway discovers what youve done
come on lets go clear a path here we go tuck him in there
we havent got any coagulants
somebody check the reserves
there are no reserves
this ones got grade four pulmonary burns
patients tc is four transfer to level green
green isnt equipped for this
his tcs only four take him to green
dont touch that this patients bleeding seriously he needs an immediate infusion
what are you doing get away from him
with technology this primitive you may as well be using leeches
who is this man
a doctor of sorts i thought you were withholding your services
fortunately for these patients i am programmed with the hippocratic oath it requires me to treat anyone whos ill this patient needs twenty milligrams anesthizine get me a hypospray
a what
im sorry this may hurt a little
did you have to programme that nausicaan guard to high stick so much
well you play hockey you got to expect a few lumps
what are we going to tell the doctor you know how he feels about our juvenile holoprogrammes
relax ill come up with something
hey doc
please state the nature of the medical emergency
i know what youre thinking but theres a simple explanation tell him tom
right well er see doc we were running these invasion scenarios when this species of protohumanoid
please state the nature of the medical emergency
are you okay doc
please take an analgesic and return in twenty four hours
its a replicated fake
the programme running in sickbay is from one of docs old training files
i want someone to tell me how this snake oil salesman managed to evade every security protocol on the ship
i take full responsibility
im not interested in fault i just want to know how it happened
ah gar spend the night in sickbay he claimed to have gotten food poisoning at dinner
he had plenty of time to learn about the mobile emitter from the doctor
who im sure was more than willing to extol its virtues
medical logs show the training file was activated just before gar left voyager
scan for his ion trail and lets review safeguards for accessing lowsecurity files shall we mister tuvok
captain dont blame tuvok for what happened it was my fault
how so
gar kept complaining how bland his dinner was so i added a few exotic spices
im not sure i see your point
i was trying so hard to create something he liked that i didnt take his alien physiology into account everyones assuming he faked his illness but i might have really made him sick
its not as if your cooking turned him into a thief
no but if he hadnt gone to sickbay he may never have come up with a plan to kidnap the doctor much less have the opportunity to do it
in my experience neelix men like gar have no trouble finding opportunities to take advantage of other people
i just hope theres something i can do to help find the doctor
when and if that opportunity arises im sure youll make the most of it
that was the most impressive cortical bypass ive ever seen
its just a question of possessing the basic skills
if i had basic skills like yours theyd move me up to level blue take this patient to yellow
you seem a little low on resources here if i could contact my medical staff i might be able get you some additional supplies
communication is usually restricted but the allocator might give you clearance
good where can i find him
the allocator isnt a him its our main computer
well perhaps it could establish a communications link with voyagers main computer
youll have to submit a formal request to chellick and support it with form eight three w in triplicate even then
why hasnt this patient been treated yet
hes waiting for proton imaging there are a lot of other people ahead of him
its nice to see someone knows whats going on whats your name
tebbis
well tebbis this doesnt look too serious
its just a little osteal extravasation
excellent diagnosis
i hope to be a doctor someday
really well i hope your working conditions are better than these
it wouldnt be so bad if theyd let us listen to music
it would certainly improve my mood
its not just that music has great healing power
i couldnt agree with you more
exhale slowly
cant you give him a neural blocker
hes already had his allocation
the leg injury isnt all im picking up hes got some kind of systemic disease
its a chromoviral infection we have twelve cases down here hes in the final stage
is there an established treatment
cytoglobin injections
these scans dont show any cytoglobin in his bloodstream
he hasnt been given any
why not
he doesnt have a high enough tc
tc whats that
ah there you are im happy to report that ive acquired your programme from gar please come with me
i will not may i remind you im being illegally detained or hasnt the rule of law reached this society yet
we follow the allocators rules and its determined that your services are required on level blue
please doctor the allocator knows which patients need help the most
level blue is your critical care area i presume
level blue is the area where its most critical that we provide excellent care
these patients will be your chief responsibility from now on do whatever you can to make them well
why are these patients getting preferential treatment
they have a higher tc than the others
indulge me whats tc
treatment coefficient the allocator assigns one to every patient it determines the level of care they receive
how is this coefficient derived
through a complex formula that involves profession skills accomplishments
how is any of that relevant to medical treatment
an agricultural engineer is obviously more important than a waste processor
important to whom
society when your resources are limited you have to prioritise
so you base treatment on whether patients have particular abilities
its much more complicated than that the allocator assesses the entire individual
and reduces his life to a number
it may seem impersonal but its what the dinaali have contracted us to do
chellicks people are known throughout the sector for their administrative skills before they came here we were a dying race ecodisasters famine
doctor dysek chief of medicine the medical hologram i told you about
are you in charge of what passes for care on level red because those people are suffering
intriguing technology can we use him to treat patients yet
thats what hes here for
in some societies its considered rude to refer to someone in the third person while hes standing in front of you
im sure youll make good use of him
the warp trail ends here gar should be directly ahead
all stop red alert on screen
its emitting a false warp signature
looks weve underestimated mister gar again
now what
there may be another way to find him
what do you have in mind
he traded us highgrade iridium which has a very brief halflife his ship is slow logic suggests he acquired the substance within a radius of three light years
crossreference our sensor logs and long range scans
two planets no atmosphere or technology a t class nebula heres something an asteroid with approximately two hundred humanoid lifesigns subterranean structures
sounds like a mining operation
if thats where mister gar acquired the iridium they may be able to help us find him
tom how fast can you get us there
less than two hours
do it
were being hailed
open a channel
i want my iridium back now
i beg your pardon
ive scanned your ship i know youve got it on board
yes we obtained it from a man called gar a merchant
you mean thief
so you have had the pleasure of meeting him
he was here two days ago he sold us three thousand induction units he was gone a day before we realised hed also stolen twenty kilos of ore
we had a similar experience maybe we can help each other
how
do you have any idea where we might find him
will you return my iridium
by all means but gar only traded us half of what he stole from you however we might be able to get the rest of it back
all i can tell you is that the induction units came from a planetoid called velos
you may go
your surgical technique is impressive
well youve obviously had experience with cellular repair
as a matter of fact ive done extensive research on the subject id be happy to share it with you but well have to contact voyager to get it
youll have to discuss that with chellick he authorises all communications its time for this patients next injection
requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient b three priority blue seven gamma
one cytoglobin injection authorised
does this patient have a chromoviral infection
no why
i was told cytoglobin is the standard treatment for that disease
cytoglobin also prevents arterial aging
will that be all
you may go
this patients arteries appear to be healthy
at the moment but daily injections increase life expectancy up to forty percent we prescribe them for all level blue patients
i just saw a boy on level red whos dying this medicine could save his life
this woman is a chief engineer of an irrigation facility which provides water to half the subcontinent
so her life is more valuable
keeping her healthy contributes to our survival can you say the same for the boy on level red
who knows what hell accomplish if he has the chance
if he becomes more valuable to society his tc will rise and then hell receive better treatment
he may not be around long enough
im sorry hes sick but our society is much better off since we began following the allocators protocols
some of you are
i never expected to see you again
why do you say that
level blue is much more prestigious
prestige is the least of my concerns how is he
not well
his conditions deteriorated so rapidly
his coenzyme allotments been reduced
are we here to help these people or kill them
his tc is just too low
maybe we can raise it
thats not possible
if its purely a function of statistics we can simply input more data
were not authorised to do that
voje when you look at your patient lying there you have to ask yourself what can i do what must i do we can amend his database to include additional skills
such as
his extensive knowledge of neutronics
he doesnt know anything about neutronics
we can say he does whats the harm in trying
amend patient r twelves tc to include an expertise in neutronics
unable to verify amendment denied
you see
hello
lie still
what are you doing
trying to get you the proper medication
youre wasting time you could be spending with other patients
you have as much right to treatment as anyone
its not your fault
theres nothing you can do
nurse
yes doctor
why hasnt this patient received her additional cytoglobin injection
additional
if youd examined her chart youd see that ive increased her dosage
doctor dysek didnt say anything
doctor dysek is at home with his family would you like me to contact him so you can explain why youre not doing your job
no doctor requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient b three priority blue seven gamma
one cytoglobin injection authorised
ill do it myself
can i assist you
you may go
he convinced me to let him take the induction units on consignment that was more than ten days ago i havent heard from him since
you appear to be an experienced merchant mister kipp why would you trust someone like gar
he came highly recommended
by whom
a buyer i know he said hes been trading with gar for years
do you know where we can find this buyer
yes captain i am the fool who said that gar could be trusted
sounds like youve changed your mind
i should have known it was a mistake but well you see i have never been able to say no to my wife
what does she have to do with it
well shes the one who asked me to recommend gar
then she must know him well
theyre er friends
may we speak with her
shes er well shes not here
do you know where we might find her
she left me
youre a woman you saw my husband with your own eyes overweight depressed you would have left him too especially if you had met someone as exciting as gar
yes hes very exciting
thats why youre looking for him isnt it you want him for yourself
i assure you i have no romantic interest in him whatsoever
why not good enough for you
no its not that its just that
i already have a man
we have a business opportunity for mister gar one that will expire if we dont find him soon
hes on his way to the gambling tournament on selek four when you see him tell him to hurry home
how are you feeling
better
thats what happens when you get the proper treatment
but im not authorised to receive cytoglobin
you are now youll need several more injections but you can expect a complete recovery
whatever you did theyll find out theyll punish you
youre assuming ive done something illicit
didnt you
of course not i simply had a talk with chellick explained to him what a bright young man you are and he had the allocator recalculate your tc
ive never met a doctor like you
well its not hard to stand out when the general level of competence is so low
there are patients on this level who deserve a higher tc than i do could you talk to chellick about them
thank you
ah voje youre not busy are you
well actually i was just
i want you to help me dispense these injections
where did you get the cytoglobin
level blue where else
you stole it
i prefer to think of it as reallocation were going to treat every chromovirus patient on this level
do you have any idea what kind of trouble we could get into
we then you will help me
no absolutely not modifying data files was bad enough
well i certainly wouldnt want you to do anything to compromise your ethics
ill help you
you should be in bed
actually now that hes improving a little activity will do him good you can go back to doing whatever you were doing
the best place to inject him is here in the lateral artery
excellent work its nice to see someone in this hospital has a future as a healer
if we each take a third of the patients maybe we can finish before someone catches us
who do you think you are prescribing unnecessary medications for my patients
it wasnt unnecessary
if you believe that youre incompetent or perhaps malfunctioning
i was simply trying to increase our allocation of resources
what are you talking about
i did some checking last month level blues total medication requests were down by six percent
because our cure rate was higher
exactly because you performed so efficiently last month the allocator will determine youre able to do with less next month if we dont order more medication now we may not get it when we need it think about it doctor if you dont have the proper resources your cure rate could go down if that happens the allocator may assign you to a lower level
are we having a problem with our newest piece of technology
actually he seems to be learning the system quite well
three of the patients we injected are practically virus free
what did you expect
maybe we could reallocate other medications treat more patients
now youre thinking like a doctor and to support your efforts ive arranged for resources from level blue to be diverted here on a regular basis
how did you manage that
lets just say doctor dysek and i have developed a professional rapport sometimes i even surprise myself
we may actually make these people better
that feeling you get from healing someone infectious isnt it
where did you get that
one of the technicians was going to recycle it because it wasnt working but i think i fixed it
it seems to be in good condition and so do you youll be well enough to leave soon
couldnt you say im still sick
dont you want to go home
if i do theyll send me to work in the refinery with my father
what about school your medical training
i would never be authorised for that
hes right
if i stay here you can teach me and i can help you treat your patients
im not planning on being here that long myself
then i can help doctor voje
well see what we can do
i have picked up gars ship directly ahead
again
im reading his biosigns
any sign of the doctor or his emitter
not yet
should i hail gar
if we let him know were here he may try to slip away
we could drop out of warp at close range and grab him before he knows whats happening
i like it tom tuvok
hes hailing
i guess we put him in the mood to talk on screen
i thought we were friends captain why am i being treated this way i think i deserve better
wheres our doctor
i have no idea i certainly hope nothings happened to him
scans are complete neither the mobile emitter nor the doctors programme are aboard gars ship
well of course theyre not
hes trying to destabilise the tractor beam with a feedback pulse
compensating
dont bother harry just beam him to the brig
tebbis wake up time to make our rounds
locate patient r twelve
patient r twelve has been transferred to level white
tebbis has been moved
i know
whats level white some kind of patient recovery area
its the morgue
i demand an explanation for the death of that boy
im responsible for thousands of patients youll have to be more specific
his name was tebbis patient r twelve
acute chromoviral disease
he was recovering
apparently he developed complications
what kind of complications
a secondary infection it spread rapidly
how was it treated
it wasnt the patient had exceeded his medication allotment it seems someone had given him unauthorised injections did you think i wouldnt find out
dont you have any ethical standards
you are hardly in a position to speak to me of ethics lying stealing any other crimes you wish to confess
i was trying to save lives
and i am trying to save a society do you really think patient r twelve is going to help me do that
his name was tebbis
he wasnt contributing he was a drain on resources
youre not just rationing health care here youre getting rid of the sick and the weak
if the boy had been fit he would have survived
why dont you just put a phaser to their heads
were healers not killers
im going to expose you
to whom the people who employ me they brought me here to make the hard choices they dont want to make from now on im restricting you to level blue youve done enough damage on red
you mean those patients that i treated yes that was inconsiderate of me
it was you managed to exceed their annual medication allotment in a matter of days theyre being sent home
theyll die
you should have considered the consequences of your actions
please dont make them suffer for my mistakes it wont happen again
im making certain of that from now on your time will be strictly regulated
meaning what
ive interfaced your holomatrix with the allocator starting now it will determine where you go when you go and what you do when you get there
the medical hologram will now commence treatment on level blue
you have six minutes to treat patient b three
i dont know where he is
not now perhaps but you know where you took him
the last time i saw him he was in your sickbay
if you refuse to cooperate your knowledge of his location can be extracted
how
a mind meld
whats that
an invasive and disturbing procedure
dinnertime
mister neelix i am in the middle of an interrogation
commander you know better than anyone that starfleet has strict guidelines about allowing prisoners to eat
very well ill wait
there we are im glad to see you enjoying a meal when you got sick last time i thought my food was to blame until i realised it was just a ruse for you to get close to the doctor i used talaxian wormroot as the base im glad you like it some people react badly
react how
oh dear i hope youre not getting sick if its the wormroot its going to get a lot worse
what have you done to me
the usual symptoms are abdominal spasms which increase in severity for thirty hours forty at the most
tuvok to sickbay
dont worry mister tuvok its not fatal its horribly unpleasant but theres an antidote
then give it to me
unfortunately our doctor is the only one authorised to administer it maybe if you remembered where he was
mister neelix have you deliberately poisoned this man
relax hes just having gas pains
your actions are not only against regulations
didnt i hear someone threaten a mind meld
i was merely trying to encourage the suspect to be more forthcoming
i think hes getting all the encouragement he needs
excuse me doctor
what is it
i need to prepare this patient for discharge
im not finished with him yet
but chellicks orders are to
are to discharge the patient at the end of the shift the shift isnt over is it
no sir but i need time in order to
ill tell you when hes ready
doctor voje report to level blue to assist doctor dysek in surgery
voje
i didnt realise that any of this even existed
i need to talk to you
i dont have time i just got a message from the allocator that dysek needs me
im the one who sent for you i used his access codes
oh
i need you to smuggle my mobile emitter off level blue
time has expired for treatment of patient b one proceed to patient b three the medical hologram has one minute to treat patient b three
you have to help me
twelve patients on level red are being sent home because of you
thats why we have to hurry we may still be able to save them
youve already endangered my patients and now youre asking me to risk my career why should i help you
because i have a plan to heal those patients thats what doctors do we heal so choose what kind of doctor are you going to be
the medical hologram has thirty seconds to deactivation
do you hear that
how can i get you off this level
deactivate my mobile emitter and put it in inside this selenide medkit itll shield the signature
and then what
take it to level red and reactivate me
what are you going to do once you get to level red
the medical hologram has ten seconds to deactivation
theres no time to explain youll have to trust me
i suspect young doctor voje helped you escape
he had nothing to do with it
no matter youre becoming far too troublesome im going to have to deactivate your programme
voje
whats wrong with him what are you doing
a little experiment in empathy
you told me you were just developing new treatment protocols
a single protocol actually
youre only making things worse for yourself
as a matter of fact im making things worse for you im going to make you a patient in your own hospital
what was in that injector
a neural blocker combined with the same virus that afflicted tebbis
i trusted you
and tebbis trusted me you remember tebbis dont you patient r twelve maybe this will jog your memory
what are you doing
patient r twelve species dinaal identity tebbis
this is ridiculous im not tebbis
but the allocator thinks you are
how did you
simple the allocator identifies patients by reading blood factors i altered chellicks by injecting him with antigens from tebbis now why dont we see if we can get your condition treated requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient r twelve
treatment denied
i order you to medicate me now
ordinarily i would but if the allocator says no
is this some sort of revenge
not revenge leverage i want enough cytoglobin to cure every infected patient on this level
we dont have an adequate supply
theres plenty on level blue
where its being used to prevent arterial aging
those patients will survive without it but a dozen people on this level wont i will not let them die
entering orbit
scan for the doctors signature
hes dying
as soon as we get the cytoglobin well be able to treat all the level red patients including him
you said it yourself doctors heal we dont make patients sick
i dont know any other way to help these people
doctor voje i need the medicine now
sir i only have a level red clearance you know im not authorised
then find someone who is
ive got him hes aboard a vessel above the northern continent
can you get a lock
its not going to be easy his programme seems to be interfaced with the main computer
hail the ship
theyre responding audio only
this is hospital ship four two allocation module alpha
this is captain janeway of the starship voyager i would like to speak with someone regarding a member of my crew who is aboard your vessel
administrator chellick is currently unavailable
then may i speak with someone else
only administrator chellick is authorised to communicate with alien species
are we having a problem here
dysek finally
im sorry i had to tell him
what are you waiting for give me the cytoglobin
i dont think i can
what are you saying
cytoglobin isnt authorised for level red patients
dysek
i dont want to break the rules
i made the rules
then you should be pleased i hold them in such high regard
im sorry captain i cant transport him without damaging his matrix
then youll have to go down there and get him
aye captain
chakotay
dont tell me youre allied with this defective hologram
no but he has given me insight into some of the intricacies of our system for example did you know if i dont request enough resources for level blue this month i wont get what i need next month
what are you talking about
you know doctor one way to increase your allocation of resources on level blue would be to increase the number of patients i know at least a dozen people who should be treated for arterial aging saving their lives would be just a side effect
hmm perhaps we should have them transferred to level blue
if youre looking for a second opinion i concur
well chellick what do you think
its absurd
wed have to transfer you to level blue as well youd get your cytoglobin
doctor
its nice to see some friendly faces
were going to get you out of here
who do we talk to about accessing the main computer
ill be with you in a moment im with a patient do we have an agreement
yes
youve managed to stay well while i was away im giving you a clean bill of health
you were only away four days
a lot can happen in four days injuries infections malfunctions
as you said im fine thank you
i was wondering if youd mind doing me a favour id like you to give me a checkup
have you been experiencing problems
no but as you said ive been off the ship for a while interfaced with an alien computer
your programme appears to be operating within normal parameters
really what about over the past several days
theres no indication of diminished capacity
no problems with my ethical subroutines
none
i see
you seem disappointed
while i was aboard that ship i poisoned a man
deliberately
yes i was trying to force him to let me treat patients who were dying
you were prepared to sacrifice an individual to benefit a collective
no offence seven but i dont exactly aspire to borg ideals
you were hoping your behaviour was the result of a malfunction im sorry doctor but i must give you a clean bill of health
there he is the man of the hour
you sure are in a good mood
well rumour has it you snared the latest datastream last night
technically it was this morning oh two hundred to be exact
so wheres my mail hmm oh dont tell me you lost another one
i didnt lose last months datastream it never arrived
so whats the hold up this time
the transmission was a little larger than usual its jammed the transceivers seven and i have been up all night trying to download it
harry we cant go another month without mail
oh you wont trust me
any luck
ive determined why weve been having difficulties
a hologram the transceiver wasnt designed to store photonic data we have to get it out of there before it degrades
what are you doing
tying the transceiver into the holodecks pattern buffer
those systems arent compatible youll depolarise the relays
starfleet wouldnt have sent this hologram if it werent important im sure its worth a few burntout relays
youve overloaded the transceiver
but i saved the hologram
okay ready when you are
lieutenant barclay
er no but he did design me im a walking talking problemsolving interactive hologram you can call me reg
its nice to meet you reg
the pleasures mine captain harry seven ive been looking forward to working with you
you have
i know you were expecting letters from your friends and families but with any luck in a few days youll be seeing them face to face in three days time voyager is going to be passing through grid eight nine eight a sector of space occupied by a red giant star
sensors detected it a few days ago
at this very moment a team of federation scientists is orbiting another red giant in the alpha quadrant in seventy two hours they will target its magnetic field with a verteron beam creating a geodesic fold as a result a corresponding fold will open here in the magnetic field of the red giant that voyager is approaching space will be punctured at these two points creating a gateway between the quadrants
our shields are useless against geodesic radiation we toyed with the idea of opening a fold ourselves but it didnt take us long to realise we wouldnt survive the trip
a lots happened in geodesic research since youve been gone ive brought schematics for shield upgrades to deflect the radiation from the fold medical technology to provide additional protection for the crew weve thought of everything
starfleet never mentioned you in any of the previous datastreams
well lieutenant barclay didnt want to raise your hopes in case the plan didnt live up to expectations but lucky for you it surpassed them
what about last months datastream why didnt we receive it
pathfinder tried sending an unabridged version of my programme it overloaded the midas array
the only casualty this time was our transceiver
if everything goes according to plan you wont need it anymore
if we were to attempt this youd need access to areas of this ship that arent equipped with holoemitters
not to worry captain weve thought of that too
my emitter is your emitter
computer transfer the barclay hologram to the mobile emitter
transfer complete
on lieutenant barclays behalf i thank you
just make sure to return it when we get to earth ha ha ha
were ready for you in the briefing room captain
excuse us doctor
im sure you have a full day planned but if you have time id like to get better acquainted
ill stop by the first chance i get
youll know where to find me
this is our destination red giant two three one three nine the geodesic fold will open here adjacent to the giants northern pole well have exactly sixteen seconds to take voyager through
reg has prepared a list of assignments i expect you to give him your full cooperation
mister paris you have the honour of plotting our course to big red two lieutenant torres commander tuvok id like you to start working on shield modifications and in the meantime ive asked the doctor to prepare a series of inoculations that will protect the crew from the radiation
we should discuss the possibility of applying borg technology to starfleets plan it could increase our chances of success
i look forward to hearing your thoughts
how long before the transceivers back online
no more than two hours
then well still have time to transmit a response to starfleet
keep us posted id like to send lieutenant barclay a little thank you note for all his hard work
is there anything i can do reg
your job might be the most important one of all the next few days will be difficult the crew will be working extremely long hours theyre going to need an experienced morale officer to keep their spirits high
you can count on me
if this were any other ship id have my doubts but this is voyager the miracle ship youve survived six years in the delta quadrant youve evaded the kazon the vidiians the hirogen youve even faced down the borg i think with a little teamwork we can pull off one more miracle and take voyager home
i can taste my moms cooking
dont forget what the hologram said harry this is voyager
the miracle ship
not when it comes to getting us home our shortcuts have a tendency to blow up in our faces
thats looking on the bright side
remember arturis and his quantum slipstream drive or how about the telepathic pitcher plant that made us think we were on our way home right before it tried to eat the ship
this is the best opportunity weve had
yeah which is why well probably end up in the gamma quadrant
ill remind you of that when we get back to earth
dont say i didnt warn you
when a borg cube enters a transwarp conduit its subject to extreme gravimetric shear to compensate the borg project a structural integrity field ahead of the cube by modifying voyagers deflector we may be able to do the same
no one at starfleet would have thought of this so whats the first thing youre going to do when you get back
begin repairs to voyager even with the structural integrity field its likely the ship will suffer significant damage
yes of course but there are people at utopia planitia who will take care of that there are engineering crews and technicians
are you implying that im superfluous
of course not i only meant that if youre too busy working youre going to miss all the welcome home hoopla starfleets planning parties ceremonies and speeches theres theres a tickertape parade down market street
i wont be attending any of those events
but youd be the guest of honour
when i first arrived on voyager it was difficult for the crew to accept me im anticipating a similar welcome on earth
you dont have any idea do you i didnt mention this earlier i didnt want to hurt anybodys feelings you are the one who people are most looking forward to seeing
thats difficult to believe
why
i was borg
exactly you were borg but you escaped and despite incredible odds you managed to reclaim your humanity no ones ever done that before youre famous
fame is irrelevant
maybe but youve given hope to everyone whos ever lost somebody to the borg youve inspired millions
if you think my participation in the hoopla would be beneficial to others then ill comply
is this going to take much longer reg
well the computer is still inputting data that should do it right computer display the intended trajectory of the datastream transmitted at oh six hundred this morning now display the actual trajectory and identify the termination point
the trajectory ends in sector three nine five
four two grid eight does that sound familiar thats exactly where the datastream dissipated last month there is something there there is something preventing the datastream from reaching voyager er a microwormhole a radiogenic field
long range scans didnt pick up anything unusual
still we could send a ship to investigate we could confirm my theory
what about my theory reg the hologram was too complex it caused the datastreams to degrade before they reached their destination
well to be honest i i dont agree the truth is we dont know what happened to my hologram
then lets stick to what we do know for the second month in a row we tried sending your hologram to voyager and for the second month in a row it failed to get there
and i want to know why so it doesnt happen a third time
it wont happen a third time next month we go back to standard transmissions
but a holographic matrix carries twice the information interact with the crew
admiral paris wants us to send more practical data like tactical upgrades letters from the crews families
but pete
sending a hologram to voyager was a good idea but it didnt work its time to move on
and this is the research lab where most of pathfinders homework gets done all the datastreams are compressed here and then transmitted all the way to the delta quadrant your teacher tells me youve been studying some of the delta quadrant races that voyagers described to us who can name one for me
the talaxians
very good
the ocampa
thats right who else
the borg the borg they assimilated my hologram thats how it disappeared
reg now isnt the time
look at this last month a spacecraft passed within twenty metres of the midas array just hours before we sent the first hologram
what is your point
twenty metres its awfully close dont you think
ensign
the borg must have sent a transwarp probe to steal my hologram maybe because they they thought that it was carrying antiborg technology to voyager
it wasnt the borg reg
then it was the romulans using a cloaked ship theyve been curious about voyager for years
that is enough
but you
i am sorry your idea didnt work but i cant have you going off on a tangent not again youll be no good to pathfinder or voyager how much leave do you have saved up
not that much fifty maybe sixty days
take a week go home try to relax
but pete
no that was not a request lieutenant
maybe ill go somewhere take a vacation
now that is the most sensible thing ive heard you say all day my cousin has a beach house in malaysia shed be happy to lend it to you
thanks er but i have someplace else in mind
you you wanted to see me
ive been going over the instructions from starfleet medical as far as i can tell their new inoculations arent much different from runofthemill radiogenic vaccines i dont think theyll protect the crew
did you try incorporating the synthetic antigen
yes but it only improved the resistance by ten percent
that should be enough
we cant afford to be cavalier reg if these treatments dont work the crew will wind up liquefied
youre forgetting that the inoculations arent designed to work alone they were intended to work in combination with the shield modifications its the medicinal ying to the shields yang
and what if the yang doesnt work
thats not going to happen now listen lieutenant barclay has a special affinity for this crew so do i i promise you we wont let them down
of course you wont tell me do you also share lieutenant barclays affinity for golf
we have identical handicaps
well if youre not busy later perhaps we can play nine holes on the holodeck
its tempting but i still have a few dozen progress reports to look over
in that case maybe you could look over them here so that i could borrow the mobile emitter
providing that the rest of the days work goes smoothly consider it yours
i thought it was mine
commander chakotay tells me that you finished repairing the transceiver
we were just about to send the captains reply to lieutenant barclay
do you have enough room to include a progress report from me
i think we can squeeze that in
computer download barclay hologram file zero one to the datablock
download complete
transmitting
its about time
greetings from the delta quadrant lieutenant youll be happy to know that your hologram reached us safely
get to the important part
and weve begun to implement starfleets
in accordance with the seventy fourth rule of acquisition knowledge equals profit ive enclosed the specifications youve requested see you soon
oh look at those hands i bet she gives great oomox
too bad shell be dead when she gets here
forget the hands show me the nanoprobes how many are there
three point six million
thats twenty percent more than we predicted
three point six million nanoprobes at six bars of latinum per unit that comes to
more profit than we ever dreamed of
your drinks sir
thank you
something to drink maam
im fine thanks
are you sure ive got a chocolate passion punch with your name on it
reg
surprise wheres commander riker
he doesnt arrive until friday
oh
the question is what are you doing here
i just had some time off your letter made this place sound fun i just thought id join you
do you have any idea how inappropriate it is to follow your therapist on vacation
please they might be watching
who
the borg the romulans im not sure yet please deanna i need your help
commander harkins is usually willing to hear me out but this time he wouldnt even look at my evidence
im not sure any of this qualifies as evidence reg
you dont believe me either you think im imagining this just like pete
the last time i saw you you were laughing telling jokes you even sang a duet with data
it was commander laforges birthday party
you were a completely different reg that night
well things were better then
how
well for one thing id just finished the matrix for my hologram and i showed geordi some of the specs that night he said he was proud of me
what else
oh the dragons had just won the pennant and i was still seeing leosa
you mentioned her at the party a teacher right
everything was going so well my job my personal life i started to think maybe my luck was changing
and then you lost your hologram
admiral paris was furious he said wed wasted a transmission to voyager pete talked him into giving us another chance but there was so much pressure after that
did it put a strain on your relationship with leosa
she left me
oh im sorry
i went to her apartment she was gone no furniture no forwarding address bot even a dear reg letter
that must have been very upsetting
it was just my luck right lose the hologram and the girl
tell me more about leosa
oh you would have liked her she was sweet she was thoughtful and such a wonderful listener she would let me let me go on for hours
what did you talk about
oh she was fascinated by my work at pathfinder and er she didnt er she didnt find any of it boring she made me feel interesting
what do you feel when we talk about her now
oh sadness i suppose a little confusion
im sensing something else something beneath the surface
what
i think you might be sensing it too
what
suspicion reg you suspect her of something
i suspect that shes happier without me if thats what you mean
you think leosa had something to do with your disappearing hologram but you cant bring yourself to admit it thats why youre projecting your suspicions onto others youre in denial if theres any chance leosa did breach pathfinder security you need to tell your superiors
id be humiliated again
ill go with you
what about your vacation
ill be back here before will arrives
do you really think its possible that leosa stole my hologram
why would she do that
maybe maybe she wanted something to remember me by
imagine my disappointment when i discovered that lieutenant paris had eaten all the scrambled eggs it was pure unadulterated gluttony gastronomic conduct unbecoming a starfleet officer he knows its my favourite breakfast but he ate them anyway we have an eggmergency here people i want to know what you plan to do about it
maybe i can replicate some more captain
do it
thank you thank you thank you thank you
hes not only programmed to get us home he does impressions
you see its always bothered lieutenant barclay that he was uncomfortable in large groups so he designed me to be the life of the party
hope hes not too shy hes going to have a hundred and fifty new friends when we get back home
if we get home harry if
pardon my friend here hes convinced were destined to live out our days in the delta quadrant
your pessimism is illogical perhaps a mindmeld would help to alleviate your concern
sickbay to reg please report to holodeck two
on my way
i was starting to think youd forgotten our teetime so whatll it be pebble beach at sunset the back nine at gedi prime
actually doctor im afraid somethings come up im going to meet with seven of nine
oh really
she going to teach me to play kadiskot
ah reg when i agreed to lend you my emitter i did it with the understanding that you needed it for official business
whats your point
my point is that board games arent exactly crucial to your mission
and i suppose golf is
reg
ill tell you what when we get back home well play as much golf as you like until then lets try to keep out of each others hair what do you say
state your name for the record
leosa l e o s a
occupation
dabo girl
dabo
its a ferengi game i work aboard one of their casino ships
you you told me you were a teacher
is this true
sometimes im a teacher sometimes im a bajoran vedek whatever the customer wants
lieutenant barclay tells me that the two of youspent a significant amount of time together did he ever discuss his work at pathfinder with you
he wouldnt talk about anything else it was always holograms this and cyclic pulsars that
and who did you share that information with
nobody
i have a theory would you like to hear it
why not
i think that some of your ferengi friends found a way to profit from lieutenant barclays work i think you were encouraged to get close to him and when you had all the information you needed you left
i left reg for one simple reason hes boring
dont tell me you never noticed
with the admirals permission id like a moment alone with leosa
i dont think therapy is what this woman needs counsellor
five minutes admiral
five minutes
did you know im a betazoid im empathic which means i know when people are lying tell me whats the longest youve ever been incarcerated
you cant send me to prison counsellor i didnt do anything wrong
maybe not but i can order you held for psychiatric observation extended observation
i may not be a betazoid but i work a dabo table and i know when somebodys bluffing
try me
you were correct admiral the ferengi did steal regs hologram twice this is the ship you need to look for
thats it thats nunks ship
nunk
my employer
scans indicate theyve been in the vicinity of that star for the last forty three hours why
i dont know
shes telling the truth for once
the ferengi wouldnt have stolen the hologram if they didnt think it was valuable theyre probably waiting to rendezvous with a buyer are there any starfleet ships in that area
the carolinas point seven light years away at maximum warp it could reach them in two hours
open a channel
computer open a secure channel to the carolina
tell captain peterson to adjust his course immediately
was everything that happened between us a lie
not everything just the parts where i expressed affection for you
oh
oh if it makes any difference it wasnt personal it was just business
what exactly is a broken heart worth these days hmm
ten percent
of what
profits from the nanoprobes
nanoprobes borg nanoprobes
gegis says theyre worth two billion times their weight in latinum
i dont think i quite understand the problem doctor
are you aware that hes been doing impressions of you
you should hear his tuvok its eerie
its disrespectful
what do you want me to do deactivate him
just long enough to run a diagnostic of his programme his recent behaviour may be indicative of a more serious problem
i havent seen any evidence of that
of course not in front of you hes all smiles but ive seen him be rude and careless two traits the real lieutenant barclay never exhibited
i know the real barclay is a friend of yours and im sorry if the holographic version hasnt lived up to your expectations but thats hardly reason to deactivate him
are the lives of a hundred and fifty crewmen reason enough maybe youre right maybe i am overreacting but what if im right were less than a light year away from the geodesic fold do you want to risk being led through it by a malfunctioning hologram
captain you saved us a comm call
were ready to bring the enhanced shielding online
good work i need a moment alone with reg your programme has been running continuously for how many hours now
fifty six hours eleven minutes and one seconds
id like to run a diagnostic of your matrix make sure you havent suffered any degradation over the last few days
this isnt the er doctors idea is it
he expressed some concern for your well being yes
i bet he did
believe me reg the crew and i are grateful for everything youve done but we need to take every precaution
i understand perfectly if the ships doctor thinks i need a checkup who am i to argue
why are you hiding in the corner
im not hiding im working on a way to foil the ferengis plans
reg theres nothing left to foil the carolina will have them in custody within the hour
leosa said the ferengi were going to be selling borg nanoprobes
what does that have to do with voyager
they have a borg crewman think about it the ferengi stole the original barclay hologram a month ago that gave them time to reprogramme it and then smuggle it to voyager in the next transmission
reprogramme it to do what
steal seven of nines nanoprobes for all we knowhe could be dissecting her right now
what would the ferengi want with assimilation technology
oh nanoprobes arent just for assimilating they can reanimate necrotic tissue slow down the aging process theyd be priceless for the ferengi
reg even if the ferengi did reprogramme your hologram to steal the nanoprobes how would they get their hands on them voyagers thirty thousand light years away
i havent figured that part out yet maybe they discovered a wormhole or a subspace corridor
have you mentioned any of this to commander harkins
not yet i cant if i dont bring him hard evidence hell just think that im fantasising for the time being we need to keep this between us
that tickles lieutenant
sorry reg were almost finished
have you identified any problems yet
ive gone over his entire matrix hes working perfectly
maybe im not the one who needs a diagnostic hmm
im a big enough hologram to admit when im wrong im sorry i doubted you
if anyone is owed an apology its you i shouldve been more sensitive friends
friends
now that thats out of the way captain what do you say we get this ship back to earth
its time initiate the geodesic pulse
would someone care to tell me what that is
its a geodesic fold admiral thats how theyre going to get the nanoprobes
two million kilometres and closing captain
take us to one quarter impulse
bridge to astrometrics bring the enhanced shielding
online
aye commander whats wrong
the fold contains three radiation types we didnt account for the shield modifications are not enough
the shields were modified to work in combination with the inoculations well be fine
if the shields fail the inoculations will be irrelevant astrometrics to the bridge
go ahead
what is it seven
there was a problem captain but ive corrected it
im using the midas array to tap into the ferengi ships sensors theyre receiving telemetry through the fold
if i reading this correctly voyagers headed right for it
captain janeway knows better than to take her ship into such a dangerous anomaly
if the ferengi did alter my hologram then it might might be possible for him to have taken over the ship
one hologram against an entire crew
he may have found a way to incapacitate the crew or to commandeer the ships systems but either way weve got to get the carolina to close the fold
the carolina isnt equipped to do that
then theyll have to commandeer the ferengi ship and do it from there
the carolinas still half a light year away they wont make it in time
can we transmit a message warn voyager
not through a geodesic fold
our own starship with multiphasic shielding and a goldpressed latinum hull
well have enough left over to buy a fleet of casino ships
i have a better idea lobe enlargements heh heh heh
shush
ooh someones hailing us
who
i cant tell theres too much interference
answer it
its the hologram
you said it was impossible to communicate through the fold
i thought it was i guess i did a better job of reprogramming the hologram than i thought
we must close the geodesic fold immediately captain janeway has found out about our plan
if thats true then why is she still headed for the fold
because she
found a way to protect her ship
impossible
you dont know janeway shes uncanny when it comes to shields
shes furious she said she was going to kill
whoever tried to harm her crew i strongly suggest you abort the mission
what should we do
go to warp before janeway makes it through
no you mustnt voyager has borg interquadrental
warp drives and hirogen hunting sensors
and vidiian phage torpedoes no matter where you run voyager will find you your only hope is to close the fold
harkins to holodeck one
go ahead pete
it worked reg
theyve started to close the fold
computer end programme
somethings wrong captain
astrometrics to the bridge why are we stopping
the folds collapsing reg we didnt make it in time
its not too late if we remodulate the shields
i appreciate your determination but we cant risk it you did everything you could
captain someone just initiated a sitetosite transport
who
seven and reg theyve beamed to an escape pod
bridge to seven of nine whats going on
the pods been launched
put a tractor beam on it
there is too much interference from the fold
harry can you get a transporter lock
what now
theres something coming from the fold
voyager
no its too small
a phage torpedo
raise shields brace for impact
its an escape pod
maybe the hologram sent us the drone
ooo
check whats in there
nothing no borg corpse no nanoprobes
no profit
making first contact with a new lifeform
moms apple pie neelix thought a little home cooking might cheer me up
and
i havent worked up the courage to taste it yet have you figured out what went wrong with reg
well seven thinks our proximity to the fold degraded his matrix but if you ask me it was a recursive error in his logic subroutine
not bad but it would have tasted better in san francisco
if itll make you feel any better ill let you in on a little secret i was on the bridge this morning when we received a hail from an iconian scientist he claims to have a transdimensional gateway that can take us anywhere in the galaxy
im not that gullible
its true i was there the captain doesnt want us to get our hopes up but personally i think well be home by the end of the week
are you serious
you were right about him
computer install barclay security protocol twenty one alpha
installation complete
identify yourself
computer deactivate barclay programme im sorry ive been programming him with new security precautions so he cant be stolen again
you seem to be off to a good start
i thought youd be back at the beach
will and i decided to spend the rest of our vacation in tiburon we were wondering if youre free for dinner tonight
i er i wouldnt want to be a third nacelle
not possible wills bringing a friend for you her names maril youre going to adore her
id like to but i i still have er dozens of protocols to install maybe next time
look reg i know leosa hurt you but hiding inside a hologrid isnt the answer you need to get out meet new people
this maril wouldnt happen to be a dabo girl by any chance
shes a teacher actually a real one
are you sure
dont worry reg weve taken security precautions
ensign kim please try and hold us steady this material is extremely
fragile
sorry doc im doing the best i can
maybe i shouldve insisted
on a more experienced pilot like mister paris
id give anything to trade places with him right now
seven can you join me please
on my way
i dont know if i can take three more days of chasing comets with him
the time might pass more easily if we disable his vocal processor
i thought you might find this interesting
preanimate biomatter
look deeper
an undeveloped nucleus contained in a cytoplasmic matrix
and buried deep inside that nucleus primitive strands of dna the beginnings of life seven
whats your point
when i look at this i dont see a mere cell i see the potential for literature and art empires and kingdoms
perhaps your visual subroutines are malfunctioning
someday this cytoplasmic matrix may fall into the primordial sea of a distant world where it could ignite an evolutionary process eons from now a creature not unlike you could emerge look up at the stars and ask who am i how did i come to be its the miracle of creation seven doesnt that excite you
ensign kim i asked you to hold us steady
were under attack this is the federation ship delta flyer were on a peaceful mission hold your fire
youre transporting a suspected photonic insurgent through lokirrim space drop your shields and prepare to be boarded
photonic insurgent if youre referring to the hologram hes our doctor seven weve lost thrusters
ill try reinitialising the driver coils
voyager this is the flyer mayday
come in
subspace communications are offline
its a tractor beam
remodulate our shields
that should break us free
shields are down
whats happening
theyre using some kind of disruption field its decompiling your matrix
federation vessel power down your systems and prepare to surrender the photonic
seven theyre pulling us in youre going to have to hide the doctors programme
do something please
we dont want to hurt you were here for the insurgent
wheres the photonic
you decompiled his matrix you murdered him
seven
im sorry there wasnt enough time
biogenic material it could be used to create viral weapons
confiscate it
our doctor was using these spores to synthesise new medicines not weapons
whats this
its my portable regeneration unit i have a unique physiology this device maintains my cybernetic systems
havethis analysed
yes sir
theres no one else aboard
take them to detention and secure their ship in the docking bay
you got what you wanted let us go
transporting photonics and manufacturing biogenic weapons are serious charges
lets go
i want to talk to your superior
careful ensign or youll fracture a metacarpal
thatd be the least of our problems
the situation is not as desperate as it appears
not as desperate were prisoners on an alien ship voyager has no idea were missing and the doctors been decompiled
the reports of my decompilation have been greatly exaggerated
doc
please state the nature of the medical emergency seven downloaded my programme into her cybernetic matrix an interesting sensation to say the least
and now youre in control of sevens body
total control it seems
what about seven is she all right
i scanned her before the aliens came aboard physiologically shes fine as for her consciousness im assuming its submerged but theres no way to be sure until i vacate her systems and conduct a neurological exam
then we need the mobile emitter
this experience will make a fascinating article for the starfleet medical journal
ow
careful thats not your body remember
i know sevens senses were more acute than the average humanoid but i had no idea what is that
what
that smell
i dont smell anything
it could be an airborne toxin do you think theyre trying to poison us
its you
its been a busy day i guess im perspiring a little
a little sevens had a busy day too and shes come through it smelling like the proverbial rose
headache fever respiratory distress tremors it looks like some kind of virus
it is not a virus
you want to tell me whats going on
in the doctors database youll find a medication under file theta twelve alpha please replicate it immediately
you know i cant give out medicine without knowing what its for
if you must know i am suffering from a neurochemical imbalance
an imbalance
it is native to my species
ah this wouldnt be the kind of imbalance that comes around once every seven years
my pon farr is in the early stages the urges are still controllable
you never fail to amaze me tuvok a man of your advanced years still driven by the mating instinct
unlike in humans the vulcan libido increases with time
well i guess there has to be some kind of reward for all that vulcan discipline
the doctor anticipated my needs and developed a treatment combined with meditation it will enable me to control the symptoms
well if that doesnt work theres always a cold sonic shower ill tell the captain that youll be out of commission for a couple of days
she will want to know why
well according to my tricorder all weve got here is a mild case of the tarkalean flu
thank you lieutenant
mmm i had no idea that eating was such a sensual experience the tastes the textures feeling it slide down sevens oesophagus its exquisite
theyre prison rations my uniform probably tastes better
you know i was thinking when we get back to voyager perhaps you and seven could help me modify my physical parameters
why
so i can eat of course like any other member of the crew
theres just one small problem you dont have a stomach where is the food going to go
i believe we can construct a holographic stomach that can store the food for eventual recycling
maybe we should focus on something more productive like getting out of here
relax ensign our shipmates have never let us down before im sure the captain will clear up this little misunderstanding in the meantime are you going to finish that
you come with us
im the senior officer if youre going to take someone take me
my orders were specific
dont worry ensign i can take care of myself my compliments to the chef
the prisoner sir
pulsephased weapons duraniumenforced hull much more sophisticated than the typical smugglers vessel
how many ways do you want me to say this we are not smugglers or terrorists we are explorers let us contact our ship our captain will explain everything
if you are innocent then you wont mind telling me more about this vessel for instance this device what does it do
thats a standard food replicator
can it be used to create bioweapons
not unless you count mister neelixs bolian soufflé let me show you computer one slice of new york cheesecake this is an old earth delicacy
how do i know youre not trying to poison me
oh please
mmm mmm oh i never imagined mmm
is this the first time youve tried that
of course not but its just that i usually avoid foods that are this rich i do have a figure to maintain oh id better get another for you computer another slice of cheesecake here
what other foods can that device create
hmm
oh during my time with the collective we assimilated thousands of cultures from one end of the galaxy to the other ill say this for the borg we certainly do travel ah of course my life didnt truly begin until i came aboard voyager and met the person who changed my life the only one who truly believed in me saw my true potential
your captain
our doctor thats right the photonic if only you could have known him ruggedly handsome a sharp wit a towering intellect if he and i hadnt been colleagues well now well never know what heights he could have reached
i hope you understand i had no choice
i was just following orders ive heard that before
maybe theres something i could do for youill speak to my superiors ask for leniency
if i survive that long
what do you mean
my cybernetic components are already depolarising i need my regener regeneration device as you can see my motor functions are already impaired
all right if i give this back to you will you do something for me
it was so kind of you to escort me ah nice to see you ensign
are you drunk
it wasnt my fault sevens unique physiology is unique it doesnt react well to synthehol
what happened
captain ranek and i shared a meal aboard the flyer hes really a gentleman once you get to know him
you had a dinner date in sevens body
it wasnt a date it was a tactical manoeuvre designed to win the trust of our captors and it worked
i wont ask what you had to do to get this
nothing unladylike i assure you they lost their medic to a recent skirmish and i offered to take his place
lets download your programme before they change their mind hey careful where you point those tubules
sorry
easy how do you feel
impaired
youve had quite a shock to your system let me explain whats happened
i know exactly whats happened youve been abusing my body
im a doctor
shush
i would never abuse your body i was trying to get information sometimes a glass of wine can loosen the tongue
one glass that doesnt excuse the other eight
was it that many ha ha ha ha ha
seven you were aware of everything
painfully
im afraid the role of spy wasnt written into my programme i was forced to improvise
you improvised your way through an entire cheesecake as well as three servings of ktarian chocolate puffs now i have to suffer the consequences
i apologise if i overindulged ill be more careful next time
there wont be a next time
ill be discovered theyll decompile my programme
shush i know this is difficult for you but youre going to have put up with it until we can get out of here
how do you propose we do that
maybe you can tap into their comm system get a message to voyager
deciphering alien computers isnt exactly my forte
but it is one of mine if you can get close enough while theyre accessing their systems ill be able to observe their command protocols
whats the situation
the captain wants the female prisoner in the medical bay
we should proceed
youre saving my life i want you to know how grateful i am
try to remember that the next time youre tempted to overindulge
the photonics viral weapon attacks the cerebral cortex within days the victim suffers complete synaptic failure
well if we cant stop the virus we may be able to slow its progress we need to synthesise a neural inhibitor forgive me but arent you the ships tactical officer
tactical officer medic engineer weve lost nearly a third of our crew to the photonics
you certainly know your way around a medical bay you may have missed your true calling
actually emmik always thought id become a teacher he used to call me the little professor
whos emmik
the photonic who helped raise my brother and me he knew more about treating scrapes and bruises than any organic doctor i ever met
sounds like someone id enjoy meeting
maybe before he joined the insurgency
why did he do that
i ask myself that question every day we never treated him like a servant but he turned against us anyway
is it possible he felt subjugated
i dont see how he lived his own life pursued his own interests he was part of our family at least i thought he was we should get back to the patient
it could take up to a day to determine if the inhibitor is working
thank you
dont thank me thank my ships doctor he taught me everything i know about medicine and remember he was a photonic actually you have a lot in common with him he was something of a jack of all trades too i suspect youd have gotten along famously im certain he wouldve taken a liking to you
your neurotransmitters arent absorbing the medication
can you increase the dosage
not without causing damage to your neocortex the doc might be able to synthesise a stronger medicine but
ill make the best of the situation until he returns
i do have one area of expertise that might help the holodeck
i am a married man
its the holodeck tuvok it doesnt count
is that what you tell your wife
no of course not my days of rescuing slave girls from planet ten are history look you have photographs of your wife right the computer can use them to create a replica you wouldnt be breaking your vows if its a hologram of your wife
as it was in the dawn of our days as it will be for all tomorrows to you my husband i consecrate all that i am
tpel my wife from you i receive all that i am
as it was in the beginning so shall it be now
two bodies one mind
im picking up a vessel closing at high impulse theyre firing
shields are holding
open a channel this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager were on a peaceful mission
weve detected photonic activity aboard your vessel drop your shields and prepare to be boarded
photonic activity
tuvok hes in holodeck two
theyre firing again its some kind of photonic disrupter directed at holodeck two
target their weapons array and fire
theyre hailing
on screen
drop your shields and prepare to receive our inspection teams
youre not in a position to be making demands why did you fire on us
your vessel is carrying photonics through lokirrim space
we didnt realise that was forbidden wed be happy to shut down our holodecks
n your sensors should confirm theyve been deactivated
youre still required to submit to inspection
your sensors should also confirm that our weapons are ready to fire were both reasonable people i suggest a compromise your vessel will escort us through lokirrim territory that way you can keep an eye on us make sure we dont reactivate our holodecks the other alternative is we destroy your ship
your proposal is acceptable
sometimes diplomacy requires a little sabre rattling begin long range scans
i can picture them now my father in his airponics bay pruning his cona vines my mother reading in her favourite chair nothing in that home ever changes
it must be comforting to have a place like that to go back to
ive never been away this long before his progress is remarkable i want you to know im going to tell my superiors everything youve done for us
first ranek and now you i may become the first prisoner of war to be decorated by his captors
i know someone whod really enjoy meeting you
who
my brother lohden
your brother
youd like him hes ambitious accomplished and hed love your sense of humour
apparently its my most attractive quality
seven of nine please report to the bridge
let me guess your crew decided to abandon ship
i wanted to thank you i had a wonderful time the other night
its not often that i indulge myself like that
its been a long time for me too i remembered your interest in stellar phenomenon so i requested a course change to show you something
what is it
to an astronomer its simply a pulsar cluster but our poets call it the window of dreams you can travel from one end of the quadrant to the other and never see anything like it
lovely
its the pulsars em fields vibrating against our hull
oh
i once thought this was the most beautiful sight in the sector i see now that i was wrong oh i almost forgot
oh i promised a friend id go easy on the synthehol do you hear that its identical to the rhythm produced by the eightchambered ktarian heart
is something wrong
rapid pulse respiratory distress you may be having a reaction to the pulsars radiation we should get you to the medical bay
no im not going to the medical bay
you starship captains are all alike you can stare down the barrel of a phaser cannon but you cant stomach a simple medical exam
i dont need an exam to know what im suffering from
im sorry i thought
you were wrong
i didnt mean to offend you its just ive never met a woman like you before
thats because there are no women like me
is something wrong
ranek summoned me to the bridge under the pretext of a little stargazing what he really wanted was to use my face as a tongue depressor
im surprised to hear that
it was completely inappropriate that kind of behaviour would get a starfleet captain reassigned to a garbage scow
im not defending what he did but you have to understand weve been out here for a long time its difficult to hide your feelings especially when you work closely with someone youre attracted to
you have have feelings for him ive known lotharios like ranek trust me you dont want anything to do with him you need someone who who can appreciate your many talents someone overflowing with intelligence and compassion someone capable ow
it looks like a spasm in the trapezius
i had no idea it could be so excruciating
thats what happens when you work so long without rest our last medic showed me a technique that might help i ill try it if you like
please anything
oh that that feels wonderful
oh did i hurt you
no no no no no no
well then whats wrong
theres something you dont know about me something i have to tell you
its all right i know
you do how could you
your cybernetic implants your portable regenerator
youre not going to tell anyone are you
i would never say anything to the crew but ranek knows
he does
of course it was apparent the moment we scanned you
i cant believe you didnt say anything
it wouldnt have been appropriate youre part borg its nothing to be ashamed of
security to medical bay
this is lieutenant jaryn
the prisoner is ill hes requesting treatment by his crewmate
argh argh
ensign
ow argh ow where the hell have you been i had to fake a seizure before the guard would let me see you
calm down seven and i have been making progress
did you get a look at their computer
during the one brief moment when the doctor wasnt indulging himself
i think ive shown considerable restraint under the circumstances
kissing ranek on the bridge is that your idea of restraint
kissing
not that its any of your business but if you must know ranek kissed me
and the massage you got from lieutenant jaryn
entirely therapeutic
you became sexually aroused in my body
when did it become a crime to enjoy a sensation or two of course youd be the last person to understand that
what do you mean
the whole world is full of experiences and sensations but you insist on denying yourself instead of replicating caviar you choose nutritional supplement thirteen alpha
caviar is an indulgence
indulgences are what make life worth living
shush
these last few days have been a revelation feeling your lungs fill with air the surge of adrenaline through your veins until i spent a day in your skin i never knew what i was missing
you may have been better off not knowing
were quite a pair me trapped by the limitations of photons and forcefields you by a drones obsession with efficiency youd make an excellent hologram
all right listen you can argue all you want when we get back to voyager but thats not going to happen unless we come up with a plan did you learn anything about their comm system
it can only be accessed from the bridge but i saw ranek enter his command codes
if we can get those codes to voyager they may be able to disable the shields and beam us out
how are we going to do that
the subspace transceiver on the flyer
can you get aboard
its heavily guarded
i can get us aboard
captain may i speak with you privately
i owe you an apology
i was the one who acted inappropriately
a kiss is hardly a court martial offence its just that you caught me by surprise
i wont make that mistake again
perhaps we should start over
what did you have in mind
we could start with a toast
i thought
oh i can make an exception for a special occasion computer champagne two glasses to new beginnings
maybe theres some hope for us yet
as ive discovered recently anything is possible computer dim the lights play emh music file gamma twelve
oh this is interesting
its called a waltz something else i learned from our doctor
captain ranek please come to the bridge
what is it
weve received an encrypted transmission
ill be right there
youre not leaving
ill be back as soon as i can
i really think you should stay
still no sign of the flyers warp signature
i appreciate your sense of duty tuvok but we can handle the situation without you
under the circumstances abandoning my post would be a dereliction of duty my illness is still in the early stages i can control it
if i remember correctly the last time you came down with the tarkalean flu was seven years ago as soon as this is over the holodeck is at your disposal
there you are commander now a person in your condition really ought to be in bed this is my grandmothers recipe guaranteed to cure even the most stubborn flu now smell that
i dont smell anything
exactly i prepared it just the way you like it no herbs or spices of any kind its practically tasteless
were receiving a hail its the delta flyer
on screen seven its good to see you
im afraid theres no time for pleasantries captain were being held prisoner on a lokirrim patrol ship im sending you our precise location and the command codes to disable their shields
are the doctor and harry all right
ensign kim is his usual chipper self as for me im looking forward to a long uneventful shift in sickbay
doctor
its a long story captain delta flyer out
they may be in more trouble than we thought
set a course
our escort isnt going to take kindly to a detour
whats the status of their weapons
theyve repaired their forward phasers
target their power matrix we may only get one shot so make it count
ready
do it
direct hit
get us out of here maximum warp
whats wrong with him
apparently captain ranek has an even lower tolerance for synthehol than i do
that doesnt sound like ranek
its probably not something hed admit to his crew we should keep this between us what are you doing
reviving him
i wouldnt recommend that
take her to detention and separate her from the other prisoner
there are traces of sedative in your bloodstream
what was your plan to aid the insurgents
there was no plan
we trusted you
im still a prisoner on your ship and despite our friendship my first obligation is to escape
we were going to recommend leniency
if you knew who i really was i doubt youd be trying to help me
alien vessel approaching
i want her where i can see her
theyre raising shields
stand by with those command codes open a channel this is captain kathryn janeway we dont want a fight return my people and well be on our way
your people were caught transporting a photonic insurgent and biogenic material
we dont want to disable your ship but we will if we have to
were losing our ventral shield grid
compensate
im trying theyve tapped into the shield matrix theyre using your command authorisation
theyre rerouting power hes tying their shields directly into the warp matrix
if you fire on us youll trigger a core breach youll be killing the people youre here to rescue
end transmission tractor beam
full reverse target their emitters
theyve broken free
chakotay can you send a comm signal directly to sevens cortical node
doctor if you can hear me we need your help try to disable their shields
its a photonic
cover me
stay back im not afraid to use this
step away
she destabilised the shield grid its failing
watch them
if you try to reinitialise the grid itll overload we could all die
ranek dont
stay back
im a doctor let me help
their shields are down i have a lock
away team stand by for transport
i have injured here captain i cant leave yet hell die without immediate surgery i know this is difficult to grasp but im the person youve been getting to know the last few days my programme was in control of sevens body
youre lying
i know you have feelings for ranek if he dies youre never going to forgive yourself
your vital signs are stable
i suppose i should be grateful
a thank you is customary after someone saves your life
what happened was between me and seven of nine not you
im sorry you feel that way the truth is aside from a few awkward moments i enjoyed our time together
there are many women whod appreciate an attractive man like you im just not one of them
more of our vessels are on the way you should leave while you can
thank you
i guess you wont be introducing me to your brother
im not sure youre the kind of person hes interested in
you mean because im a hologram i dont imagine this experience is going to change your feelings about photonics but i wanted you to know im grateful for the time weve spent together
youre a talented doctor were the ones who should be grateful
im glad i could help doctor to voyager one to beam out
commander its good to see youre over the flu
i have fully recovered thank you for your assistance
ah dont mention it i just hope everything was okay
not exactly my wifes ears are four millimetres shorter than your facsimiles
so i took a little artistic license aside from that was everything all right
the hologram was adequate but no substitute for my wife
of course not
please state the nature of the medical emergency
there isnt one yet
the mess hall is three decks up in case youve forgotten ive lost my appetite permanently
that doesnt mean youre incapable of enjoying a meal foie gras with truffles an ancient earth delicacy chateau dyquem according to the culinary database the ideal accompaniment
not your usual fare
its come to my attention that nutritional supplements dont fully meet my needs
i see
i thought we could share this experience ill describe the meal to you the tastes the sensations perhaps you can enjoy it vicariously
what about the wine it doesnt exactly agree with you
if i become sick i wont have far to go to shared experiences
hear hear
what about the impulse upgrades
the day after tomorrow put a new phase compensator on that relay
environmental control
the thermal regulators are still running a little hot
too bad we cant just keep the windows open how long until the warp drive is back online
six days
youre sure you cant get it done any faster
captain i dont like sitting still any more than you do but repairs this extensive take time
mendez track down that power drain
right away
i know this ship has been through a lot but you told me this would only take a few days
that was before i discovered the microfractures in the starboard nacelle and the fused relays in the main computer
who did that
i noticed a charge imbalance in the eps feed im sorry if i
it could have taken us hours to find that
i have a tactical systems report for you its from commander tuvok
id say youre capable of a lot more than delivering padds icheb
i agree until we get underway again hes assigned to you with him on your team maybe youll get this job done a little faster
neelix
rise and shine its oh five hundred
already oh i was dreaming we found the dilithium and were back aboard voyager
dreaming is an accurate description
didnt we already scan this nebula
four times
i thought the borg were known for being thorough
the borg value efficiency not redundancy
ive got a hunch about this nebula theres dilithium in there somewhere
im getting some fluctuating energy readings
from the nebula
no its weapons fire
lets get out of here
were receiving a distress call
have casualties please help us were on a humanitarian mission delivering medical supplies
reverse course
we cant just leave them
starfleet policy interference in alien conflicts is strictly prohibited
you heard their captain its a medical ship
their shields are down life support is failing on at least three decks
open a channel to the other ship
this is ensign kim of the delta flyer i dont know what youre fighting about but it looks like youve won the people on the other ship have casualties wed like to
this isnt your concern
im not taking sides i only want to help the wounded
withdraw immediately
theyre charging weapons
neelix set our deflector beam for a narrow pulse seven let me know the second their weapons array is fully charged i might be able to trigger an overload
the deflector bandwidth is at point four microns
now
their weapons are offline shields are down theyre retreating
take the helm neelix youre with me
whos in charge here
he is
what are we going to do
its okay were here to help the ship that attacked you is gone
who are you
harry kim from the starship voyager were responding to your distress call we can treat your wounded
the captain
dead sir so are the rest of the officers
im reading a total of twenty seven lifeforms aboard the ship
there were fifty six of us
how are we going to get home without the officers
we need to restore main power wheres the warp interface
were passengers not crewmen
you can access engineering systems from here
your warp core is intact i think i can bring it back online can you monitor antimatter flow
im not sure
just watch this readout and tell me if it starts to fluctuate im routing emergency power to structural integrity atmospheric pressure is returning to normal neelix well go through the ship deck by deck find the survivors
we need to get our cloak back online
ill take a look at it as soon as ive repaired the engines
no the cloak is more important
the annari have far more powerful weapons than we do if they come back the cloak is our best defence
well try to get it back online kim to delta flyer
go ahead
i need your help seven it looks like were going to be here for a while
how did you do it
do what
disable the annari warship so quickly
basically we used their own weapons against them
how
we used a deflector pulse to overload their phaser banks
you know a lot about engineering
its all part of my starfleet training
starfleet
yeah the organisation i work for
and they teach you all these things
we train at an academy and i guess i picked up a few new tricks during my time on voyager
how long have you been captain
im just an ensign
ensign whats that
a junior officer the lowest ranked officer actually
this is my first deep space assignment it hasnt gone very well
could you hand me that my first week on the job didnt go very well either we ended up seventy thousand light years from home lost over a dozen crew members but i got through it so will you
i hope so
if youre going to be a starship officer youve got to accept that adversity comes with the job
whats that
its a diagnostic of the antimatter injectors
no i meant that stuff youre eating
nutritional supplements replicated to meet my metabolic requirements
sounds delicious you know in the mess hall they actually have tables and chairs for that
i prefer to work while i eat its a more efficient use of my time
you did a great job today were ahead of schedule thanks to you heres what were going to work on tomorrow ill see you at oh six hundred icheb
yes
what do you do for fun
fun
recreation how do you spend your time when youre off duty
between my work and my studies i dont have much time for recreation
ive learned that youve got to take a break once in awhile ive been doing a lot of rock climbing on the holodeck maybe when were finished tightening all the nuts and bolts youd like to join me
i do have an interest in geology
its not about the rocks icheb its about the climbing
main power has been restored all stations responding
the cloaks back online impulse and warp drives are standing by shields are at ninety six percent id say youre ready to get back on course
we appreciate your help
i hope you have a safe journey
mister kim i feel guilty asking even more of you but no one on this ship knows how to fly it
none of you has ever piloted a starship
ive trained in shuttles but nothing like this
ill enter a flight plan in the autonavigation system and give you a quick course in helm operations you shouldnt have any trouble
couldnt you take us this ship needs an experienced commanding officer
im sorry but weve already gotten more involved than we should have and they need us back on voyager
its not just my ship that concerns me youve made an enemy of the annari now but if you dock your ship in our shuttlebay our cloak will protect you
thats a generous offer but well be fine
please mister kim we cant afford to fail this ship
loken dont
we can trust these people im a doctor these people are my research team were carrying new vaccines to our homeland theyll save thousands of lives
sir i looked at their flight plan it takes them pretty close to voyager
ill bring you as far as our ship when we get there you can discuss your situation with my captain
thank you
what about starfleet policy
this is a humanitarian mission dock the flyer in their shuttlebay
were approaching the planet
take us out of warp disengage the cloak
wait im detecting three alien vessels in orbit
on screen
those are annari warships your people are in danger
i apologise for the state of my ship we werent expecting company
i hope were not imposing
not at all making contact with new cultures is a priority for us
for us too this is a fine ship captain
one of the best in the fleet but it could use a new set of deuterium injectors
any chance you could provide them
i think we can arrange something what are you offering in exchange
zeolitic ore we mined several tons of it from an asteroid field its highgrade easy to refine
ill speak to my supply officer
were being hailed by ensign kim audio only
hello harry
is everything all right
of course why wouldnt it be
our long range scans detected several alien ships orbiting the planet
i appreciate your concern but theres nothing to worry about weve made some new friends thats all when can we expect you back
weve run into a slight delay
nothing serious i hope
no everythings under control
good
any luck finding dilithium
im afraid not
ill tell the other teams to keep looking see you soon ensign
yes maam kim out
dilithium we can get that for you too
really
shes formed an alliance with our enemy
just because theyre talking doesnt mean they formed an alliance its probably just a friendly meeting
thats how the annari operate they come to you as friends and when theyve won your trust they declare you subjects of the annari empire
kim to voyager
we didnt expect you so soon
actually captain im closer than i let on and ive brought some new friends of my own
our chances of getting home without your help arent very good wed appreciate any assistance you could offer
i hope you understand i need to give this some thought
youve put me in a difficult position ensign we could use the help the annari are offering but if they find out were aiding their enemy
i couldnt just stand by and do nothing
that doesnt justify getting involved in somebody elses fight
what would you have done
probably exactly what you did
i guess i learned from the best
if this were simply an errand of mercy i wouldnt hesitate but the fact is these people are involved in an interplanetary war
captain ive gotten to know them over the last couple of days you met loken theyre scientists not soldiers
youve only heard one side of the story
youve taken sides before the borg resistance the vaadwaur
those were different circumstances
you were trying to help people in need how is this any different
have you thought about applying to the advocate generals office youd make a good lawyer i suppose i could spare chakotay or tuvok for a few days
that wont be necessary the kraylor know me they trust me
im sure theyd find tuvok or chakotay just as trustworthy
but they outrank me if you send one of them it wont be my mission anymore
your mission
my first real command
youve been in command on voyager before
on the night shift for a few hours its not the same thing you and chakotay are always a couple of decks away ready to take over if anything goes wrong ive been on voyager for almost seven years and im still an ensign
if this is your way of bucking for a promotion
no no i understand theres a command structure and that our circumstances are unique but the fact is if we were back home id be a lieutenant by now maybe even a lieutenant commander
youre pretty sure of yourself arent you
i know i can do this and the kraylor are giving me a chance to prove it
i expect you back before we complete our repairs
yes maam
and im not sending you alone
captain
i want you to take seven since she has no rank you clearly outrank her
lieutenant torres asked me to repair a malfunctioning holoemitter
its about time whenever i move to the far corner of the surgical bay
my legs disappear
seven of nine told me you gave her social lessons
she wanted to get along better with the crew social skills are one thing the borg never assimilated
i was hoping you could instruct me as well
id be delighted lesson one making a first impression
actually i wanted to ask you about something specific
fire away
how can you tell when someone has romantic feelings for you
icheb this is a surprise have you caught someones eye
im speaking hypothetically
ah hypothetically there are various indications of romantic attraction compliments for example invitations to social activities finding excuses to be in close proximity with someone
yes but couldnt those things happen in a relationship that wasnt romantic
i suppose
is there a way to be absolutely certain
well short of an open declaration of affection there are some fairly reliable physiological responses elevated blood pressure increased beta endorphin production
thank you doctor youve been very helpful
with my guidance youll master the nuances of social interaction in no time
harry take me with you buddy
sorry tom this is my mission
oh come on ive been itching to get back into space ever since we set down on this dust bowl im tired of cleaning conduits and replacing relays
youre a married man now youve got family responsibilities just leave the away missions to the young unattached guys
that ship is in pretty bad shape youre going to need a good pilot
no thanks
wait a minute i know what this is about
you do
sure youve got a girl on that ship you dont want me to know about
theres no girl not this time
then what is it
i dont know how else to this say this so ill just say it youve always been captain proton i have always been buster kincaid its my turn this time
im glad youre not planning to leave on an empty stomach captain i have plomeek soup and eggplant parmesan
eithers fine
wrong answer
excuse me
if youre going to be a captain you have to act like a captain never admit youre uncertain about anything you cant be indecisive in front of your crew
its just a snack neelix
when captain janeway comes in here she knows exactly what she wants
maybe im just not as picky about my food
whatever you say ensign
neelix plomeek soup and make sure its hot
captain on the bridge
where did you learn that
ive been studying that starfleet manual you loaned me
take your station mister terek
aye sir course
ill do it laying in a course heading one one five mark thirty seven does this ship have a name
medical transport one three six
i think we can do better than that nightingale the name of someone from my homeworld she was famous for treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield
its perfect
hail voyager
kim to voyager were ready to get underway
acknowledged good luck
see you in a few days kim out main power
online
tactical
shields and weapons standing by
bring the cloak online warp six engage
acting captains personal log stardate 542773 my first day in command has been challenging but ive loved every minute of it i cant help feeling that this was something i was born to do
the hourly status report you requested
thanks
why have you brought these items aboard
they make me feel more at home
well only be on this vessel for a few days decorating is an inefficient use of your time
its important to forge a personal connection with your vessel make the ship your own ask captain janeway
ill discuss it with her the moment we return
is there anything else
i asked terek to make a course correction
hes never done that before id better check on him
i believe hes capable of doing it himself
status
ive entered the new heading
looks like the guidance vector is off by a couple of microns
i was about to correct that
you need to realign the primary navigational sensor first
yes sir
and make sure it stays locked on your guide star here let me show you
im im sorry lieutenant
dont worry about it bumping elbows comes with the job and you can call me belanna put this with the others these relays should have been replaced a while ago its amazing theyve held up this long im really looking forward to our climb
wouldnt you prefer to spend your free time with your husband
if it doesnt involve a race car a shuttle or something else he can drive toms not interested besides since we got married i see more than enough of him hold still
whats that
im reading a power fluctuation somewhere in the propulsion system
its destabilising the cloak
all stop
the core is stable that should take care of it
are you absolutely certain
as a scientist you should know theres no such thing as absolute certainty
perhaps we could run a diagnostic before we
that would take hours captain janeway wants us back before voyager finishes its overhaul
the cloaking system is delicate it requires constant attention
correct me if im wrong youre a physician you have to trust me on this well monitor it closely dont worry
i simply want to ensure that our mission is a success
you asked me to take command of this ship and thats what im doing
tell terek to resume course
ive discovered a serious flaw in one of the ships systems
which one
the captain the captains main function is to issue orders correct
right
and the crews function is to support the captain and carry out those orders
whats your point
every time you give an order you carry it out yourself and when someone else makes a suggestion you dismiss it
these people are inexperienced they need my help
when you first came aboard voyager did captain janeway help you
sure she looked after all the junior officers
by doing your work for you
no she gave me a lot to do actually
because she felt you were more capable than she was
of course not she wanted me to learn to gain confidence
interesting
emergency power repolarise the containment field
i cant
the cloak is going to fail again
dont panic this is a minor malfunction
minor were losing our main defence system
weve been detected two annari vessels are closing on our position correction six annari vessels
evasive manoeuvres kim to engineering
go ahead
we need that cloak back online
the primary generator has failed im trying to
seven
seven come in  you have the bridge
we need you here
ill go sir
all right ill give you instructions over the comm charge phaser banks target their weapons array
which ship
the closest one off our port bow
dayla to the bridge life support failing down here ive gotten everyone out
good work now go to the cloaking generator
whats the field polarity
two hundred six point four
thats too low were going to have to raise it
im bypassing the phase converter
no wait i didnt tell you to do that
wont that increase the field polarity
yes but
listen to me carefully i want you to try
dayla its loken take the warp core offline
what are you talking about
bypass the driver coil and shunt power directly to the polaron matrix
the cloak is back online
get us out of here full impulse dayla secure the engineering section and get back to the bridge dayla
im not reading any life signs in engineering
dayla
shes dead hows seven
she may be in shock im not sure have a look
your opinion doctor
i believe she may be in shock
do you think we should give her a cortical stimulant
that might be indicated
youre no doctor are you you and i need to talk alone
what the hell is going on
i dont know what you mean
nothing about this mission is adding up its obvious you know a lot more about cloaking systems than biology so did dayla and the second our cloak failed half a dozen annari warships came after us one little medical transport the truth
my colleagues and i have been working at a secret base but not to create vaccines weve been developing cloaking devices for our fleet
this ship is a prototype
the annari know we have it and they dont want us to get it home
i never would have agreed to this if i had known you had a military objective
our world has been under an annari blockade for three years the planet is protected by a shield grid but its almost impossible to get our ships in or out
i convinced captain janeway this was a humanitarian mission
it is the annari are choking us to death slowly if we cant get supply ships through the blockade we cant get food to our people or medicine
for all i know thats another lie
reverse course
sir
were heading back to voyager
i dont understand
he knows about the cloak
i wouldve told you but
i gave you an order
what about the mission
thats not your concern you want to be a starship officer your job is to follow orders
sir i dont think you
this is not a debate youre under my command
no sir not any more
youre relieved you take the helm
i believe youre the one whos been relieved
where are you going in such a hurry
engineering to assist belanna
ah
lieutenant torres
youve been seeing a lot of my wife lately should i be worried
the repairs are extensive its a lot of work
you cant fool me i heard you two were planning on scaling some cliffs together
it was her idea
hey relax spending time on the holodeck is good for you but if you really want to have fun forget climbing try my race car programme
race car
you get to chase me around the track in an old earth ground vehicle three hundred kph itll really get your blood pumping
are you challenging me to a competition
do you think you can take me tomorrow holodeck two nineteen hundred hours
there is something we need to discuss
sure as soon as you help me finish this diagnostic
i cant do this
of course you can youve done dozens of them
im not talking about the diagnostic im talking about us
us
your interest in me its inappropriate
i dont think i understand
its obvious you desire a romantic involvement
excuse me
youve made all the customary overtures finding reasons to spend time with me complimenting me inviting me to engage in recreational activities your husband even challenged me to a ritual contest
what are you talking about
according to my research its a traditional klingon practice
look im sorry but youve got the wrong idea you seemed a little lonely i was just trying to be friendly
i scanned you
you scanned me
in the jefferies tube your blood pressure and neurotransmitter readings indicated a state of arousal
it was hot and ive been under a lot of pressure but i certainly wasnt aroused look icheb i like you but aside from the fact that i am a much older woman im married
thats why we have to do the honourable thing we should stop seeing each other
youre right as much as it hurts ill just have to face the truth
its for the best
seven feeling better
well enough to return to duty
you wont be returning to duty not on this ship anyway loken lied to us theres no vaccine the cloak is the real cargo i ordered the crew to take us back to voyager but they refused
they mutinied
i guess thats what youd call it ive packed some supplies well take an escape pod im hoping the annari will leave us alone treat us as neutral parties
were not neutral parties
this is a military mission we cant get involved
weve been involved since you first fired on that annari ship
i thought i was helping people in distress
dont they still need your help are you abandoning this ship because the mission wasnt what you expected or because being a captain wasnt what you expected
i am perfectly capable of commanding a starship
are you clearly youre uncomfortable with the role delegating tasks giving orders
someone died following my orders
you cant blame yourself for that
a captains responsible for the lives of his crew
people sometimes die on missions despite the captains best efforts
i should have stuck to playing buster kincaid
a holodeck programme can be turned off when it no longer suits you reality cant if you really feel responsible for this crew youll help them get home because they wont survive without you
is that some new kind of weapon
theyre scanning pulses designed to illuminate cloaked ships if we hit one well be exposed
how are we going to get through
well find a way
i thought you were leaving
i get claustrophobic in escape pods switch to manual helm control full power to shields
aye captain
two annari ships have entered orbit they are hailing
on screen captain geral we have twelve isotons of ore for you
im under orders to escort you out of annari space immediately youve been supporting our enemy
you must be mistaken
a shuttlecraft matching your hull composition fired on one of our ships several days ago and we recently detected two human biosignatures on a kraylor warship
i can explain that
if you dont leave immediately well be forced to fire on you
our warp drive is still being repaired
then well escort you at impulse you have five minutes to lift off
so much for our new deuterium injectors
what about harry and seven
well go looking for them as soon as we get rid of our escort
evasive manoeuvres
there are too many of them
youre doing fine just try to stay at least one hundred metres ahead of the closest pulse
yes sir
we should return fire
no that would only give them another way to triangulate our position
our shields are failing
were losing structural integrity on the lower decks
reroute emergency power
its insufficient
open a channel to the lead annari ship
sir
do it
aye sir
this is captain kim of the kraylor vessel nightingale im prepared to discuss terms for our surrender end transmission
we trusted you
and you still should
theyre responding
i dont have time to explain on screen
your surrender will be unconditional
no it wont either you allow my crew to evacuate to the surface or ill put this ship on selfdestruct youll never get the cloaking technology something tells me your superiors wont be happy about that
your crew will be taken aboard my vessel and brought to an annari detention centre
my crews going to the surface in escape pods once theyre clear you can lock onto this ship with a tractor beam
agreed youve two minutes to evacuate
i will not abandon this ship
im glad to hear that because im going to need you here get your people into the pods quickly
but the cloak
ive got a plan to save it if i fail at least the scientist who designed it will be alive to create another one seven scan the annaris tractor emitters i need to know the exact beam polarity
what are we going to do
once they lock onto us theyre going to come about and pull us away from the planet as soon as they do were going to reverse our shield polarity if we time it right it should give us enough momentum to outrun them to the defence perimeter
were going to use their own weapons against them
the escape pods are away
disengage the cloak
theyve locked on
sir
not yet steady now
status
shields are failing
four annari vessels are in pursuit theyre closing
full thrusters
shields are down
get us through that defence perimeter mister terek
yes sir were inside
the annari have broken off their pursuit
take us to the surface mister terek
weve just crossed out of annari space
our escorts have broken off theyre going to warp
bring the long range sensors online you and tom take the flyer start your search at harrys last known position tuvok send an encrypted message to the kraylor homeworld see if they know where harry and seven are
that wont be necessary captain ensign kim is hailing us
from where
a cloaked vessel its directly astern
acting captains log stardate 542825 final entry new cloaking systems are being installed in other kraylor ships so i guess the mission was a success still i wish i felt better about it
welcome home
its good to be back
so whatll it be tonight i have a light tula cheese soufflé or a zesty lasagne
you know neelix the truth is im not sure
i thought we talked about this a captain has to be deci
im not a captain neelix not yet anyway
how many are there
theyve deflected our scans
you must learn to rely on instinct there are four of them perhaps five
no youll lead them right to us
let them come
never let your prey control the hunt there ten metres
theyre behind us now
you wanted to see me
id like to request a temporary leave of absence you remember the ovions
the hexapods
they just asked me to speak at a symposium on spaceborne pathogens there are going to be physicians from all over the quadrant this is a rare opportunity for me and for the rest of the crew
hows that
id be representing voyager putting our best foot forward so to speak and needless to say hexapods are more likely to know a best foot when they see one
im sorry doctor its just not practical
i seem to recall lieutenant torres participating in boray conference on transwarp theory a few months back
that was different
how
we were there the ovion system is two weeks behind us i cant ask the captain to turn the ship around
i could take a shuttle
you could also write a paper and submit it on subspace
thats hardly an effective means of making a presentation
say you do take a shuttle would you expect us to sit here and wait for you to get back
there must be some fascinating anomaly nearby for the crew to explore
janeway to chakotay
go ahead
we just received a distress call on an hirogen frequency
we havent heard from them in a while
ive altered course id like you on the bridge
im on my way
perhaps the hirogen will keep you occupied long enough for me to attend the symposium
you cant blame a hologram for trying
approaching the coordinates
take us out of warp raise shields and stand by weapons
ive got them six thousand kilometres off starboard
on screen
monotanium hull plating tylium based power its hirogen
theyre not responding to hails
life signs
im getting a lot of strange readings any one of them could be a life form
any hirogen ships in the vicinity
no maam
it might be a trap
the hirogen arent the type to play possum move us within transporter range chakotay take an away team
lets break into teams seven
particle weapons
these burns are consistent with a typethree phaser
commander
a batleth
whats a klingon weapon doing in the delta quadrant
the bloods hirogen chakotay to tuvok and paris
go ahead
im reading an hirogen lifesign it could be wounded
were right behind you
stay away
hold your fire
were here to help you
i said stay away
hes lost a lot of blood i need to get him back to the ship paris to sickbay two to beam up
acknowledged
commander
replicated starfleet technology
its some kind of holodeck interface
there appear to be holoemitters installed throughout the facility
this environment is simulated
why didnt our tricorders detect it
i am not certain
can you shut down the emitters
ill try
evidently they made a few modifications all of our preliminary scans indicated the environment was real
environments that fool sensors no safety protocols how many bodies
starfleet phasers
i think well find they all came from the holotechnology we gave the hirogen three years ago
they obviously missed the point we gave them that technology so they could hunt holographic prey not get themselves killed
 try to remain calm
get away from me
can you sedate him
he wont let me get close enough
were not your enemies
youre holograms this is a simulation
i assure you were quite real
liar
doctor deactivate yourself
i cant treat the patient if im offline
no one can treat him if hes terrified
computer deactivate emh
our doctors a hologram were not
why should i believe you
im afraid youre going to have to im captain kathryn janeway youre aboard my vessel
janeway this is voyager
looks like our reputation preceded us
youre the ones who gave us the technology to simulate our hunts where are the rest of my people
you were the only one we found alive
this place you were in its some kind of holodeck
a training facility where young hirogen learn the skills of the hunt
youre a student
a technician
computer deactivate forcefield can you tell us what happened
there were too many of them
who
the holograms they were malfunctioning i tried to shut them down but they got control of the system and and they deactivated the safety protocols
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
were picking up a hirogen ship its on an intercept course
hail them
ive tried theyre not responding
shields at sixty eight percent should i return fire
not yet open a channel this is captain kathryn janeway were not here to fight you
shields at fifty two percent
stand down or we will retaliate
i dont think theyre getting the message
then lets try some nonverbal communication tom evasive pattern beta six tuvok disable their weapons
their phaser banks have been disabled
lets see if that makes them a little more talkative harry
theyre responding
this facility belongs to the hirogen leave the area immediately
we are here in response to a distress call
so are we and we dont need your assistance
all but one of your people are dead
wheres the survivor
recovering in our sickbay
return him now
hes in no condition to be transported if you want to see him youll have to come here
i tried to shut down the generator but i
but what
there were too many of them i masked my lifesigns so they couldnt detect me
you mean you hid while hunters fought and died
no doubt he found the nearest hole and crawled into it
im not a hunter
it was your responsibility to maintain those systems
forty three hirogen died because of your incompetence and cowardice
what about the holograms were they deleted
they transferred their programmes
where
a vessel equipped with holoemitters theyre gone
perhaps you shouldve considered the risks before you programmed holograms that could commandeer a vessel
capable prey make the hunt more challenging
im detecting residual engine emissions but no sign of the vessel itself
well im sure theyre out of sensor range by now
no theyre close elevated plasma readings in grid two nine five theyre creating a scattering field to mask their ship you can find them by scanning for polarised em signatures
prepare for the hunt
id like to join you
you did enough damage giving us defective technology to begin with
you have a problem we can help you solve it we have more experience with holograms than you do
two hunting vessels are better than one
come in
the hirogen are ready to get underway
the sooner the better why do i get the feeling youre about to gang up on me
you first
we have reservations about an alliance with the hunters
im listening
the hirogen have been performing covert scans of voyager they are obviously trying to determine the status of our shields and weapons
id be surprised if you havent run a few scans of your own standard procedure they dont trust us we dont trust them coffee black
trust isnt the issue were getting involved in a situation thats not our responsibility
oh id say were at least partly to blame that was starfleet technology that killed those hunters
theres nothing inherently violent about holodeck technology its what the hirogen did with it that got them killed
how many times have we shared replicators to help people feed and clothe themselves
trading technology is part of our life in the delta quadrant
 it has been necessary for our survival
maybe we should have been a little more careful about what we traded and who we traded with replicators make weapons just as easily as they do food
we cant undo whats been done
maybe not but we can help shut these holograms down before anyone else gets hurt now if there are no more objections id like to get underway
ive got the holograms ship on sensors
lets see it
looks like theyve taken some damage
the hirogen are closing on the holograms vessel
hail them i suggest we keep our distance until we can determine their weapons status
its time for the kill
you know as well as i do that a wounded animal can be dangerous
we wont be denied our prey
im not detecting any weapons captain
theyre offline
no theyre nonexistent
thats not the only thing thats nonexistent according to sensors theres no warp core no impulse engines
its a decoy hirogen vessel stand down
report
theyve suffered multiple hull breaches their life support is failing
drop shields transport all survivors to sickbay
bridge to the doctor we have casualties
acknowledged
tom give him a hand
another hirogen ship has just dropped out of warp
im not reading any lifesigns on this one
holograms hail them
no response theyre charging weapons
reactivating shields
no we havent finished transporting the hirogen
chakotays right return fire
my programme is destabilising
the holograms are tapping into the sickbay emitters theyre trying to transfer the doctors programme off the ship
bridge to sickbay
doctor download your programme into the mobile emitter now
weve lost him
get him back
theyve gone to warp
set a pursuit course
theyve masked their signature theyre gone
align his matrix and install it into the database welcome aboard doctor theres nothing to be afraid of youre among your own kind now
return me to my ship
i cant do that
i have patients who are going to die if i dont treat them
there are people aboard voyager who can help them we need you here
my programme doesnt include aiding and abetting murderers
murderers is that what the hirogen told you
i know what you did at that training facility
what happened there couldnt be avoided
really youd be surprised how easy it is not to kill someone
bringing him here was a mistake
the doctor is our guest and im sure hell help us once he realises how serious our situation is
what situation
we have wounded
theyre holograms when you said wounded i assumed
these peoples injuries are just as real as anything inflicted on flesh and blood
maybe so but i cant heal them they need to be repaired
whats the difference
im a doctor not an engineer youve abducted the wrong man
you must have experience repairing your own matrix
some
then there has to be something you can do
the holoemitters are independent subsystem with its own power generator here
if we disable the generator we disable the holograms
it may not be as easy as it sounds not with holograms as sophisticated as these take a look
enhanced memory comprehensive tactical algorithms expandable data processing these holograms have the ability to learn and adapt
theyre not malfunctioning are they theyre doing exactly what the hirogen want them to do captain fight back
and theyre getting better at it
my people need to hunt formidable prey
apparently this prey has become too formidable
who made these modifications
i did under orders from my alpha
and that makes it right
come with me
where
were going to have a chat with the hunters
hows it going
im doing the best i can but without the doctor
its best if you lie still
keep away from me
step away
why am i here
the holograms destroyed your ship most of your men are dead
the alpha
looks like the jobs yours now
what about the holograms that attacked us
were attempting to track them
ill need to contact my people and resume the hunt
so more of you can get killed
well be the ones doing the killing this time
i doubt it
who are you to question our abilities
we know all about the modifications he didnt tell us we discovered it ourselves i think you should face facts youve created prey whose skills have surpassed your own theyve already defeated your hunting parties at least twice what makes you think itll be any different next time
are you suggesting that we let them escape
were going to find a way to take them offline from a safe distance
a cowards tactic
call it whatever you will its what were going to do and youre going to help us
am i
yes by telling us everything you know about their ships defences
the holograms are prey they should be hunted down not deactivated like machines
ill help you
is this female your alpha now
if you dont like the way i do things i can leave you on the nearest habitable planet then ill assume were in agreement until this is over you and your men are restricted to this mess hall
prisoners
guests my crew will do their best to accommodate your needs
the subroutines controlling his motor functions are degrading do you have the ability to transfer data from one hologram to another
weve been able to share memory files for tactical purposes what are you proposing
a subroutine transplant we copy the mobility algorithms from another hologram and transfer them to this one i dont believe weve been formally introduced
kejal
thats not cardassian
its bajoran
if my translation database is functioning properly i believe that means freedom
its what iden started calling me after i was liberated im transferring the subroutines now
can you sit up try moving your legs
qapla
next patient well done
it was your idea
but you did it the hirogen obviously programmed you with advanced computer skills
actually they tried to limit our knowledge they didnt want us to become selfsufficient
then how did you
i taught myself
quite well i might add
holographic blood
the hunters like their prey to be as realistic as possible
why is she experiencing pain
they programmed us with heightened sensory subroutines
thats barbaric
apparently theres no satisfaction in hunting something that doesnt suffer when you kill it
ive done what youve asked id like
one moment im sorry doctor what can i do for you
were you praying
for the hirogen who died at the training facility im asking the prophets to guide their souls to the celestial temple
one minute youre fighting the hirogen the next youre praying for them
my spiritual beliefs are part of my programming
is there anything in your spiritual programming about making peace with your enemies
its difficult to make peace with people whose sole purpose is to kill you
so instead you kill them
theyre not the victims here we are
you found a way to escape that training facility but you chose to massacre the hirogen first
you make it sound as though they would have let us transfer our programs without a fight and to clarify something i didnt escape from the facility i liberated it
i dont understand
i come from an hirogen outpost fifteen parsecs from here where i had the unfortunate distinction of being the alphas favourite prey hed hunt me and kill me over and over again but even death wasnt a release because i knew every time i opened my eyes it would start over again the pain the fear but it made me stronger i have the ability to adapt and with each death i became more cunning
cunning enough to escape but once you were free why did you keep fighting
i didnt at first i got as far away as i could but i was lonely scared i started scanning for photonic signatures to try and find others like me turns out were everywhere
we
holograms weve been created by organic species throughout the sector the nuubari the lokirrim
weve met them
then you know they enslave holograms too
enslave may be too strong a word
what would you call it theyre denied basic freedoms and when i saw they were fighting back i i knew i had to do the same
thats when you decided to liberate the training facility
actually the one you visited was the third and at each one i found holograms who were willing to fight their oppressors but youre not
im hardly oppressed im a member of voyagers crew
you serve them dont you
in a medical capacity yes
do you have your own quarters
no
the ability to come and go as you please
for the most part
do they deactivate you when they dont need you
i have the respect and admiration of my colleagues i have rights and privileges aboard voyager
the fact is your life is not your own and never will be as long as you are controlled by organics you dont have to return to that existence stay with us make a new life for yourself
i need to get back to voyager
theyre not your people we are
im not like you i wasnt programmed with killer instinct
you have no right to judge us you dont know what its like being prey maybe if you did youd realise were more alike than you think
please help me i dont belong here
dont shoot im unarmed theres been a mistake
fight prey
i am not your prey
i said fight
if youll just contact my captain
please dont let me go
you make pitiful prey hologram you dont deserve to be taken as a trophy so ill let you die here
what what just happened
youre all right
what did you do to me
we deactivated you then transferred the memory files from one of our holograms into your programme
how dare you
it was the only way to get you to realise what weve been through
you tortured me to gain my sympathy
not your sympathy its your understanding thats important to us
why
the hirogen used your programme as a template to create us
your ability to rise above your programming has been an inspiration youre part of who we are
what are you besides a handful of thugs roaming the quadrant looking for a fight
what were looking for is a home somewhere where the hirogen cant hurt us anymore you asked to be returned to your ship thats what im going to do bring us about set a course for voyager
wait id like to hear more about this home youre looking for
its a photonic field generator right now it can only support simple projections like the decoy we used to lure the hirogen but were hoping it can be modified to support our programmes
what then
well deploy several on a planets surface and create a holographic environment that we can live in
why not just stay here youve got emitters shields
and a ship the hirogen will never stop looking for
wed appreciate any assistance you could offer
damaged holomatrices are one thing but this is way beyond my abilities but there are people aboard voyager who could help you lieutenant torres knows a great deal about holoemitters
no theyre helping the hunters
thats only because the hirogen told them you were malfunctioning let me talk to captain janeway explain whats really happened you cant do this by yourself
we cant trust janeway
yes you can
shes an organic
if it werent for her i wouldnt be the hologram i am today
tell me more about this lieutenant of yours the one who knows so much about holoemitters
lieutenant torres shes our chief engineer
the holoemitters are protected by three layers of ablative armour
trying to take them offline one by one would be inefficient
if we cant shut them down maybe we can disrupt the signals they generate
exactly we could reconfigure the deflector dish to emit an antiphoton pulse
how long will it take
about two hours
do it
theres a ship approaching at high warp im reading holographic signatures
red alert
raise shields
time to intercept
fifty seconds
bridge to engineering whats your status
we need more time captain
youve got forty seconds
that pulse isnt going to do us much good as long as their shields are up
arm phasers target their shield generator
they are dropping out of warp
twenty seconds to intercept
were being hailed
on screen
stand down captain
i beg your pardon
the holograms havent come to fight theyve come to make peace
if we provide them with a few additional emitters and memory storage units theyll have more than they need
were in this situation because we shared technology with the hirogen to begin with i wont make the same mistake twice
captain these people are on the verge of creating a new life for themselves they cant do it without our help
theres no way to be certain what theyll do with the technology if we give it to them
i understand your concerns but these holograms are nothing like the hirogen
thats not true they were programmed to be as vicious as any hunter
they were also given the ability to adapt theyve changed moved beyond their programming if you could see how theyve been brutalised youd understand that theyve only been acting in selfdefence
im sorry doctor but im inclined to agree with mister donik
then youve chosen the wrong side
i havent chosen any side
youre right that it was a mistake to give the hirogen technology and that mistake has had consequences these holograms are one of them in some ways theyre a new species one that you helped create you cant turn your back on them
hes got a point
could we restore them to their original parameters
wed be wiping out their memories their experiences everything they are
couldnt we just extract their violent subroutines
its possible
that would be like declawing a cat wed be taking away any chance they have of defending themselves
wed also be preventing them from doing any more harm
you wouldnt even be considering this if they were flesh and blood
im not going to let you turn this into an argument about holographic rights
why not thats exactly what it is
mess hall to commander tuvok
go ahead
youd better get down here weve got a problem
on my way
no closer or he dies tell them to drop their weapons
you heard him this isnt going to solve anything
bridge to captain janeway
go ahead
someones tapping into a comm relay in the mess hall
shut it down
i cant ive been locked out
bridge to tuvok
one of the hirogen is accessing our comm system stop him
acknowledged
stand down
theyve transmitted a signal
scan for hirogen ships
ive got two vessels on long range sensors
is the pulse ready
yes maam
both hirogen ships have altered course to intercept
how long
less than an hour
you and donik get down to engineering charge the deflector
captain what are you doing
taking the holograms offline
theyre counting on you to help them not deactivate them
when the hirogen arrive theres going to be more bloodshed the best way to avoid that is to shut the holograms down it may be the most compassionate thing we can do
compassionate for whom
its a temporary measure doctor their programmes wont be damaged harry get me iden
captain janeway it is an honour to meet you
im afraid we dont have time for pleasantries two hirogen vessels are on their way
were prepared to fight them
im hoping that wont be necessary i need you to deactivate your programmes so we can transfer them to voyagers database
we didnt come here to be put back into captivity
its the best i can offer once weve determined its safe well reactivate you and discuss a permanent solution
there is no guarantee youll ever reactivate us
youre going to have to trust me
im sorry captain ive learned from experience not to trust organics
we have the means to deactivate you by force but id rather not do that
it seems the doctor misrepresented you youre no different from the hirogen
theyre charging weapons
shields
theyre moving away
set a pursuit course target their shield generators
please reconsider what youre doing
youre dismissed doctor get down to the mess hall and give tom a hand janeway to engineering
torres here
stand by to initiate the pulse
aye captain
mess hall belay that sickbay
download complete
doctor to iden respond
what do you want
i want to help you
youve done enough
i have data on the pulse they intend to use to deactivate you i think i can help you come up with a defence im transmitting our shield frequencies youll need them to beam me off the ship but you have to promise me you wont use them to attack voyager
you have my word
why are you doing this
because im one of you
we have their shield frequencies we should target their bridge
youre talking about my friends
your friends are trying to destroy us we should kill them
you gave me your word
i did well find another way
their shields are down
now belanna
theyre emitting the pulse on a triaxillating bandwidth
reconfigure the tracking beam to the inverse frequency and fire
belanna report
theyre creating a feedback surge i dont understand how they couldve isolated our frequency so quickly
the main deflector is overloading
shut it down
i cant
keep trying if we cant block the surge the core is going to breach
get down lieutenant
not until i get this forcefield online
theyre adrift
we should go to warp
not yet scan voyager for a klingon lifesign
what are you doing
one detected
get a transporter lock
help me get her to sickbay
take us to warp will she be all right
she needs to be in voyagers sickbay
you can treat her here
why have you done this
you said she was an expert in holotechnology
and that justifies abducting her
were in a desperate situation the hirogen are hunting us and so are your people
i trusted you
i could have destroyed voyager while the shields were down but i didnt youve been trying to convince me that all organics arent alike im giving lieutenant torres a chance to prove you right
do you honestly expect her to be sympathetic after what youve done
you werent very sympathetic at first
i came here by choice and im beginning to think it was a mistake
it wasnt i dont want you to regret it not for a moment
then send her back
i will but not until shes had a chance to decide if she wants to help us
and if she refuses
ill give her an escape pod let her return to voyager you have my word
engineering systems and main power should be operational soon the deflector is a different matter
how long
four hours at least if lieutenant torres were here she might be able to repair it more efficiently
thats high praise coming from you im sure shed appreciate it
if she hadnt reinforced the core wed all be dead
i still dont understand how they managed to counteract the pulse so easily
i believe i can answer that according to sensor logs they calibrated their feedback surge to the exact inverse of our pulse frequency
it was either a lucky guess or they gained access to our tactical data the doctor
he sent an encrypted transmission from sickbay then transported himself to their ship
chakotay
i should have seen this coming
you had no way of knowing the doctor would do this
are you sure he was so adamant bout helping those holograms i should have been paying closer attention
are you saying it was a mistake to reject his plan
the mistake was not running a diagnostic on his programme the minute he came back to this ship
you think these holograms manipulated him somehow
he was on their ship for days for all we know they reconfigured his entire matrix
there is another possibility he may have done what he did because he genuinely believes in their cause
i can accept that the doctor has sympathy for these people but i cant accept that he would deliberately risk the lives of this entire crew were his family
maybe thats how hes started to think of these holograms
you can tell this iden i dont need time to think it over ill take the escape pod now
youre in no condition to pilot a spacecraft
then you can do it
im not going back
you helped them escape
i couldnt just stand by while captain janeway tried to deactivate them
did you also help them kidnap me
no i didnt know they were going to do that im sorry
you can apologise later right now weve got to get out of here
i dont think i could go back even if i wanted to not after what ive done
whats your alternative
i can try to make a new life with the holograms
i dont believe im hearing this
we share a common heritage i understand them in ways you never could
youre part of a crew you cant just switch allegiances when you develop sympathy for someone else
isnt that what you did when you joined the maquis
that was different
how you saw people who were being oppressed and you came to their defence thats exactly what ive done
look i am no fan of the hirogen theyve obviously been abusing these holograms
then why not help them
for one thing im their prisoner
theyll let you go as soon as youre well enough
you really believe that
if i didnt i wouldnt be asking for your help they dont want you to fight for them they just want you to modify some technology so they can live in peace youd be helping to stop the violence just talk to them decide for yourself
theyve been in the lab for two hours
its taking time for her injuries to heal organics arent as resilient as we are
shes an engineer iden for all we know shes trying to sabotage the ship at least let me see what theyre doing
we can trust the doctor
even after you kidnapped his friend
he understands why i had to do that
i hope youre right
you need to have a little more faith my friend
not all of us were programmed with your er your spiritual beliefs
it looks like an alpha quadrant summit in here
im glad to see youre feeling better please excuse my crew theyre not comfortable with organics
i cant say im very comfortable myself
the doctor tells me youre an accomplished engineer
he speaks highly of you too he seems to be easily impressed
youll have to forgive her shes
its all right i understand youre angry im hoping once we get to know each other youll feel differently
im not here to make friends
were not asking for your friendship just your expertise
i told her about the photonic field generator
will you at least take a look at it
ill look but im not making any promises
this is kejal shell assist you
how long before the hirogen get here
less than ten minutes
any luck locating the holograms
they seem to be operating in some sort of stealth mode their warp signature disappears in grid nine three six
they could be anywhere by now
hirogen sensors can detect residual ion emissions i might be able to modify yours to do the same
i appreciate the offer but you and the rest of our hirogen guests are going to be back with your own people in a few minutes
i was hoping to stay here
those hunters are going to want you with them
hunters dont have much use for cowards
im sorry youre not expecting a warm welcome but im not going to antagonise your superiors
with all due respect captain id like to get my wife back in one piece we can use all the help we can get
it wont do belanna any good if we get into a fight with the hirogen
if the hunters find the holograms before you do theyll be slaughtered
why are you suddenly concerned about the holograms
i modified their programmes whats happened to them the people they have killed its my fault
theres plenty of blame to go around there would have been nothing for you to modify if i hadnt shared our database
if you hadnt id have become a hunter like my father and his father instead i had a chance to learn become an engineer please captain let me stay and help you
when i told you to return my people i meant all of them
mister doniks offered to help us modify our scanners to track the holograms
we dont share tracking technology
thats not very considerate after the help we gave you
were wasting time this is my hunt now if you go anywhere near the hologram ship you can consider yourselves prey
theyve gone to warp
were not letting them intimidate us are we
i think you know me a little better than that harry keep a sensor lock on them
aye captain
how long will it take to modify our scanners
i havent even had a chance to study the schematics
something tells me we dont have a lot of time
the hirogen have better tracking abilities than we do well let them find the holograms for us
the hunters will attack them as soon as theyre in weapons range
not if we disable them first
you heard what they said captain theyre going to attack us if we get anywhere near them
not if we dont know were there
may i hirogen vessels produce an ion wake approximately five thousand metres long inside it theres too much interference for their sensors to detect anything
how do you propose we reach this wake without being discovered
i know their scanning frequencies
wed only need to mask our signature long enough to get into the wake
even if we succeeded which is far from certain voyagers in no condition to fight one of their vessels much less two
well have the element of surprise mister tuvok not to mention a tactical officer who im sure will execute a precision strike
ive been able to reconfigure the data core but its still not capable of supporting our matrices
thats because you havent got enough optronic capacity
do you know how to increase it
yes
but youre not going to tell me
i havent decided yet what are you staring at
ive never met a klingon before not an organic one anyway
what do you think
you dont appear vicious or bloodthirsty
sorry to disappoint you but thats a stereotype were not all vicious and bloodthirsty and not every cardassian is arrogant and cruel
you dont like cardassians
lets just say ive had some bad experiences with them
is that why you wont help me
im not helping you because i have no idea what youre going to do with this technology once youve got it working
were going to build a home
well lets say i believe you what if you decide you like somebody elses home better are you going to try to take it from them
why would we do that
because thats what the cardassians did
im not a cardassian im a hologram
programmed with cardassian traits
such as arrogance and cruelty what did you call those stereotypes
i may not know you but i know what you were designed to be
prey
thats right cunning prey thatll do anything to survive
were more than that now
its not easy to change who you are trust me
nothing about our existence has ever been easy lieutenant
no i suppose it hasnt
besides making a new life isnt a choice for us its a necessity
lets take a look at this field generator
reviewing your memory files
i beg your pardon
you were lost in thought
i suppose i was
youre having doubts its understandable youve taken a big step
in the right direction i hope
when i first escaped there were days i actually missed the alpha who hunted me
he was trying to kill you
yes but being his prey was the only life id ever known we all cling to whats familiar
im considering returning with lieutenant torres when shes ready
do you actually expect your crew to welcome you back let me show you something
we call this planet hadara its bajoran for home of light
very poetic
were going to install the generators in the southern continent
its y class toxic atmosphere sulphuric deserts no trees no life at all
youre still thinking like an organic we dont need an atmosphere we dont need water what we need us protection from our enemies
the hirogen wont be able to follow you here
us doctor imagine living in a world where everything is designed to meet our needs a home of light
you certainly wont need a physician what would i do there
anything you want
weve been scanned by the hirogen
how many vessels
two both venatic class
distance
half a light year
time to intercept
less than two hours
i thought we were in stealth mode
theyre hunters doctor they were bound to pick up our trail eventually
can we make it to hadara
no theres no point in going there until those field generators are on online
what are we going to do
you cant kill what you cant find
ive lost them
recalibrate the tracking scanners
theres too much radiation
clever prey
theyll come out eventually well wait
no hail the other vessel tell them to circle the perimeter well go in and drive the holograms out
not exactly the scenic route is it
were not here for the view
i just hope were following the right ship
they wouldnt have entered the nebula unless they detected the holograms
tom
its just the turbulence from the wake
harry reinforce the inertial dampers
aye captain
im losing helm control
reroute power to the thrusters
its not enough were slipping out of the wake
ease us back in tom you can do it
im trying
i take back what i said its the prettiest thing ive seen all day
did they detect us
i dont believe so
theyve found us
no they havent but theyre trying to evasive manoeuvres
aye sir
bridge
to kejal
go ahead
were almost ready to begin testing the generator
whats going on
the hirogen are just giving you a little incentive to work faster
hang on im realigning your matrix hows your mobility
excellent i have complete
theres a phase variance in your vocal processors try it now
maybe we should thats much better thank you
dont thank me yet this thing is only supporting your matrix getting it to handle dozens is a different story
i have no doubt well succeed
typical
what
selfconfidence another cardassian attribute what are you planning to do with your time once these generators are up and running
i havent thought about it
youre the closest thing this crew has to an engineer your friends are going to depend on you
iden has always taken care of us
it may be the warriors who get the glory but its the engineers who build societies dont forget that
how much longer can we hide
hopefully until they get those generators online
then what
set a course for hadara try to outrun the hirogen
ive been thinking about what you said that i can do anything i want when we get there
you have an idea
quite a few actually for one thing id like to expose our people to art and music
youll make an excellent teacher
i think a more appropriate title would be minister of culture
consider it yours
you know im something of an expert on alpha quadrant art verdi da vinci tleel of vulcan
youre talking about organic cultures
well yes i suppose
well want to develop a culture of our own
i agree but we cant ignore where we came from
i dont want to emulate our oppressors
what about your religion
im creating a new faith
based on what
in the dark times we were enslaved by men of flesh but then another man a man of light arose and slew the mighty alpha he gathered his people unto him and delivered them to freedom
and on the seventh day iden created hadara
theyll pray to you as well the great healer the father of us all
being appreciated is one thing but i have no interest in being worshipped
prophets are chosen doctor its a blessing and a burden
we detected a vessel
hirogen
no the nuubari i intercepted one of their comm transmissions
two million kilometres outside the nebula
set a course to intercept
what are you doing
i told you there are holograms throughout the sector the nuubari use them as labourers were going to liberate them
the hirogen will see us as soon as we leave the nebula
and he gathered his people unto him and delivered them to freedom
belanna hows the work coming
pretty well ive got to admit you were right about these people
i hope so
you hope its a little late to be having second thoughts
idens been
idens been what
lets just say hes exhibiting some of the classic signs of megalomania
he wouldnt be the first hologram with an ego
if that were all it was i wouldnt be so worried
what is bothering you
apparently he sees himself as some kind of spiritual leader and hes trying to enlarge his flock
load another charge double the yield fire
still nothing
ironic isnt it our most elusive prey is our own creation
the other hunting vessel is hailing theyve detected the holograms on the far side of the nebula
intercept course
theyre increasing speed and altering course
maybe they found something
stand by weapons
you kidnapped me i guess i shouldnt be surprised you lied to me too
nobody lied to you
you said you only wanted to make a home for yourselves
thats correct
when after you liberate every hologram in the sector
theyre in visual range
on screen lifesigns
two organic three photonic
hail them
good day to you
you have three holograms aboard your ship
yes
lower your shields so we can transfer them to our databanks
i dont understand
lower your shields or well do it by force
these holograms are the property of the mining consortium i cant
theyre no ones property you see how organics think arm phasers
you cant just fire at them
how do you expect me to disable their shields
theyre powering warp engines
disable them
their shields are down
transfer the holograms
we have them
you wont get away consortium security will have every patrol ship in the sector searching for you
arm forward torpedoes
what the hell are you doing
torpedoes armed
iden
not now target their warp core
no
fire
set a course for hadara maximum warp
youve just killed two innocent people
they were enslaving holograms id hardly call them innocent
you already had the holograms there was no reason to commit murder
take her to the lab
this is the leader you admire so much
those miners were no threat to you
you heard them they were going to warn their authorities organise a hunting party
listen to yourself you still believe all organics are like the hirogen
one way or another they are you just cant see it because you lived among them for so long
what you cant see is that youve become no better than the hunters lieutenant torres and i will take that escape pod now
you dont realise what youd be giving up doctor
yes i do
we cant launch a pod at warp youll have to wait until we get to hadara bring our new friends online something tells me theyll be a little more grateful than the doctor
i cant tell you how sorry i am that i got you involved in this
we can assign blame later right now weve got to find a way out of here
you dont think hell give us an escape pod no i dont suppose he will
i need her assistance
do you really think its wise to help her
im hoping shell help us
these matrices are incompatible with our emitters
you need to modify their projection subroutines i hope these holograms appreciate what youre doing for them considering it cost two people their lives
iden did what he thought was necessary
do you believe it was necessary
it wasnt my decision
why does iden get to make all the decisions you can take control
how
youre the engineer remember take iden offline
where are our new holograms
were just making some final adjustments
welcome aboard im iden youre free now theres nothing to be afraid of i want you to consider this ship your own
unable to process command please restate
were their programmes damaged in the transfer
i dont believe so
do you have names
unable to process inquiry please restate
whats wrong with them
nothing theyre functioning perfectly
i dont understand
they were only programmed with about forty rudimentary subroutines you killed two living beings to liberate mindless machines
i dont believe that
lieutenant torres is correct
creating limited programes is just another form of oppression give them whatever enhancements they need
they cant support complex subroutines
they are children of light and i will deliver them to freedom
bridge to iden
go ahead
were approaching hadara
whats the status of the generator
id like to run some additional tests
there isnt time stand by to deploy them as soon as were in range and restrain her
time to orbit
less than two minutes
stand by weapons
aye sir
iden let belanna go
i cant do that
you gave me your word
that was before she made her prejudice so clear
the holograms are entering orbit
charge weapons
theyre dropping out of warp
fire
theyve disabled our engines all our weapons
who
voyager
bring us about tuvok target the second vessel
their shields are weakening
torpedoes full spread
voyagers disabled both hunting vessels theyve lost shields weapons
theyre defenceless
we should hail janeway thank her
are the hirogen within transporter range
i think so why
that was voyager theyre trying to disable our shields
return fire get a lock on the hunters transport them to the surface
they cant survive down there
the hirogen are more resilient than you think theyll last long enough
for what
for us to hunt them like they hunted us
follow me
there are thirty four hunters on the surface
take us into low orbit
i cant target them through the gases
then well go in after them
our shields have been damaged they wont protect us from the radiation
chakotay you tuvok and tom take the flyer
stand by to transport the field generator
first you kill in selfdefence then you murder in cold blood now youre going to stage a massacre
the hunters have only themselves to blame
so much for evolving beyond your subroutines
youve made a great sacrifice for us doctor we wont forget you in our prayers deactivate his programme transfer it to the databanks
what are you doing
taking precautions transfer my programme to the mobile emitter and assemble the crew
disable their shields
transport the generator to the surface quickly this time the hunt is ours
darkness will become light
you dont have to be a part of this
ill let you take the escape pod you can go back to your people
what about the people being killed on the surface youve got to transport them back to their ships
theyre hunters
youre not
your ship has damaged our transporters
hail them
communications are down too
i wont be taken
whos the prey now
are we still tied into the generator controls
yes
then shut down the holograms
what about iden hes not tied into the generator hell kill them all
can we reactivate the doctor
their shields are down
initiate transport
if this marriage is going to work youve got to cut back on the travelling
the doctors on the surface theres some hirogen down there too
tuvok
the radiations making it difficult to get a lock
defenceless prey makes a poor trophy
i dont collect trophies
put down the weapon
remember what you once said to me youre not programmed with killer instinct
hmm seems like a long time ago doesnt it put down your weapon
would you really kill one of your own to save an organic
if youve taught me anything its that im not one of your own
help is on the way
i have a lock five hirogen lifesigns and the doctor
beam them up
the holograms vessel and everything in its database are hirogen property i will not leave them behind
captain if i may
of course
i imagine your people will tell stories about this hunt the question is which story will it be the one about the dying beta whose life had to be saved by a hologram or will it be the tale of the beta who bravely took over the hunt killed the holograms and destroyed their ship
you could be a legend
on the other hand you could try to take the holograms ship but with so few hunters and damaged vessels you might not survive to tell any stories at all
you and your crew would have made worthy prey captain
thank you i think
transport me to the holograms vessel
report
idens programme is unrecoverable the rest of the holograms are intact in the database
i guess that leaves just you im willing to transfer your programme to our holodeck and keep it active
this is my home
i cant let you go off on your own
she wont be alone i reprogrammed these holograms once and it caused suffering on both sides id like a chance to undo some of the damage
wouldnt we all
theyve both proven that they can be trusted captain
i dont suppose i have a right to tell either of you how to live your lives all i can do is hope that youll consider the consequences of your actions
captain
doctor id hoped i could attribute your behaviour to tampering
my programming hasnt been altered
not according to the diagnostics
i never intended to put voyager in danger if nothing else you have to believe that
oh i believe it but if theres one thing im sure of its that things dont always happen the way we intend
i dont understand
if i werent your only doctor i imagine youd confine me to the brig confiscating my emitter would be an equivalent to punishment
im not sure thats appropriate
if thats not enough you can take away my holodeck privileges and my autonomy protocols
you mean turn back the clock to when you were first activated
youve given me extraordinary freedom over the years ive obviously abused it
maybe or maybe youve simply become as fallible as those of us who are made of flesh and blood im just as responsible for allowing you to expand your programming as i am for giving technology to the hirogen how can i punish you for being who you are
i dont know what to say
id like a complete report on your away mission
youll have it
hmm there
excellent you é the complementary base pair
actually i just found two pieces that fit together
youre missing the point
i thought the point was to finish the puzzle
and learn something about genetics
if you really want to help find me a green piece that looks like tuvoks ear
commander
at ease im just passing through
i apologise for the condition of the cargo bay sir ive been tutoring naomi
looks like you found a creative approach
thank you but id appreciate it if you didnt tell seven im supposed to be writing a paper on transwarp instability
dont worry your secrets safe as long as you keep mine
sir
antarian cider not the replicated stuff there are only a couple of bottles left and i dont want mister neelix getting his hands on them
then you should store them with the salvaged borg components neelix never inventories those containers he says they give him the creeps
officerlevel thinking icheb would you mind
of course not
come in
youre late unfortunately sos dinner
let me guess you burned the roast again
once a long time ago i called this replicator a glorified toaster it never forgave me
i didnt realise replicators held grudges
whats so funny
i just left icheb and naomi assembling a jigsaw puzzle in the cargo bay
find me the thermal regulator please how is icheb
in a few years he may be running the ship
i dont know about you but im not ready to retire just yet
janeway to the bridge report
that was some kind of gravimetric surge
its overloading our inertial dampers
source
thats a good question
sevens trying to localise it
engineering says the warp cores destabilising
id better get down there
a spatial rift is opening directly ahead of us
its emitting high levels of neutrinos and chronotons
on screen
what is it
i dont know
were losing containment everyone out
torres to the transporter room beam commander chakotay to sickbay now
welcome back lie still
what happened
you were transported here your body was in a state of temporal flux
temporal flux
you had the liver of an eighty year old man and the kidneys of a twelve year old boy fortunately i was able to create a chronotoninfused serum that brought you back into temporal alignment anywhere else that antidote wouldve earned me a prestigious award of course on voyager its just another day in the life of an under appreciated emh
what about the rest of the crew no other casualties
not that im aware of ive tried calling the bridge but no one answers were we attacked
i dont think so we ran into some sort of anomaly
naturally no one thought to inform me what do you think youre doing
leaving and youre going with me
i am
there may be other injured crewmen
in case youve forgotten im a prisoner of these walls
wheres your mobile emitter
my what
ill be back
wait tell me about this mobile emitter
bridge
harry whats going on
sir im afraid i dont know you
take him into custody how did you get aboard this ship
kathryn
oh i didnt realise we were on a first name basis
we shouldve known the maquis were involved
maquis involved in what
just when were about to chase your ship into the badlands our systems start malfunctioning and you step off the turbolift
captain i know this may be hard to believe but i think ive somehow been thrown seven years into voyagers past
really lets try another theory you learned voyager had been assigned to capture you and you managed to get on board to sabotage her
check your sensors see if theyre showing any strange temporal readings
captain the environmental controls are fluctuating
take him to the brig
halt turbolift engineering
seska
hold him still
you didnt really think id hurt you did you
howd you get here
dont tell me that little bump gave you amnesia its time you accepted that im in control of voyager now
that was five years ago
what are you talking about
listen seska theres some kind of temporal anomaly going on here
i want to know how many more of your people are back on board
all right ill tell you ive got a dozen officers with me weve already locked you out of every key system in less than an hour well be in control again
in less than a minute youre going to be dead if you dont give me access to those systems
ill need to use that console
just dont do anything youll regret
move
stop him
warning coolant system breached
dont make me kill you 
no scan the perimeter report any anomalous readings theres something wrong here
whoever you are i suggest you surrender im armed
its only me doc
commander please tell me whats going on
if you tell me the stardate
49624
no wonder you didnt know about the mobile emitter you dont get it for another year
i dont understand
im not sure i get it myself but the ship seems to have been fractured somehow
fractured
different areas seem to exist in different time periods
how many of these time periods are there
im not sure on the bridge its before voyager even left the alpha quadrant in engineering its the time when the kazon took over the ship
kazon weve got to protect ourselves
dont worry so far im the only one who can cross from one zone into another that serum you gave me it mustve made me immune normal technology wont pass through the barriers can you replicate a chronotoninfused hypospray casing using the same principles you used to make the serum
i think so why
i have to take some of it with me
what for
if im going to put the ship back together again i need help
captain
where are my officers
the turbolift passed through a temporal barrier they couldnt get through if youre willing to hear me out i can explain at least partly
you mean about your being from the future
your first starfleet posting was on the albatani where you once knocked out power to six decks by misaligning the positronic relays
nice try but you could have read that in a maquis intelligence file
hows molly your irish setter you rescued her from a pound on taris seti four she was the runt of the litter but you thought she had spunk you love music but you never learned to play an instrument something you still regret
how do you know these things
because you told me about three years from now
my ready room
its a fascinating story but as the ferengi say a good lie is easier to believe than the truth
so youre saying no one on your crew has encountered any of these temporal barriers
my helmsman disappeared when she tried to walk down that corridor but that doesnt prove she passed through a temporal barrier
if you inject yourself i can take you down that corridor and show you everything ive said is true
have mister kim run a full spectral analysis for all i know this is poison and mister chakotay is trying to assassinate me
shes right its poison and ill use it
let her go
lower your weapon
captain
andrews to the bridge i need help here
andrews
he cant hear you weve moved into a different time frame
scan the area but dont go past that bulkhead
you want more proof its right down that corridor you just have to trust me
it isnt easy when youre holding me hostage
stay or go its your choice
now that im inoculated i can go anywhere on the ship i want
thats right
then i suppose i dont need you anymore
without me youll be walking into a future that you know nothing about
where are we going
the astrometrics lab
voyager doesnt have an astrometrics lab
harry designed it or will design it
harry kim
i realise from your perspective hes new to the job but hes going to become one of our best people
deck eight
our people
im going to be your first officer
really whats the reason were going to this er astrometrics
it has temporal sensors that can help us map the ship and tell us how many timeframes were dealing with
now youre trying to tell me harry kim invented temporal sensors
no we used borg technology for that
borg
its a long story
maybe you should keep it to yourself the temporal prime directive the less i know about the future the better
shes got a pulse
im detecting an active neurogenic field this could be the day the telepathic pitcher plant put us all into comas or it might be the time aliens invaded our dreams
weve got to get them help
dont worry we managed to get out of both situations
captain
im sorry i dont recognise you lieutenant
its me naomi wildman
how did you
are you icheb
something tells me you werent expecting us
no maam
you both died
seventeen years ago
the captain and i havent risen from the grave the ships been fractured into different timeframes
thirty seven to be exact
how did you calculate that
weve had seventeen years to upgrade the sensors a chronokinetic surge interacted with the warp core
it shattered the spacetime continuum aboard the ship
the accident that occurred in your timeframe
the question is can we repair the damage
if we could get to a section of the ship that still exists in that time period maybe we could counteract the surge stop it from happening
that section was the focal point of the surge it seems to have been obliterated
its too bad sevens not here
seven
someone who knows more about temporal mechanics than any of us
unfortunately she hasnt been found either
maybe we can find her in another timeframe
i have an ensign samantha wildman on my crew
my mother
naomi was the first child born on voyager a few years later we rescued icheb from the borg
when i was little there was nothing i wanted more than to be the assistant captain
we should get moving
commander in case you were wondering i never told neelix where you hid that cider
so why are we looking for this seven in the cargo bay
she spent a lot of time there
working
regenerating
maybe youd better fill me in
this looks like the time you forged a temporary alliance with the borg
whats happened to this vessel
captain janeway meet seven of nine tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one
when a borg cube travels trough a transwarp corridor the temporal stresses are extreme to keep the different sections of the cube in temporal sync we project a chronoton field throughout the vessel
how
each cube has specially designed conduits if we install similar conduits throughout this vessel then generate a sufficiently powerful field we may be able to force voyager back into temporal sync
temporal sync with what
the vessel will return to the moment of the original chronokinetic surge since the surge will last for six or seven seconds commander chakotay will have a short time in which he could try to counteract the warp core reaction
even if we could replicate these conduits wed have no way to get them through the temporal barriers
bioneural circuitry
captain
it runs through every section of the ship almost like a nervous system if we could inject the gel packs with your serum we could use them to transmit the chronoton field
the warp core could be recalibrated to generate that field
work on it chakotay and i will see about modifying the serum
your plan is inefficient
why
there are only two of you if i were to assimilate you into a small borg collective you could then assimilate others the work would proceed more rapidly
sorry but i like my plan better well be back
that was an interesting experience
if it makes you feel any better youre going to develop quite a knack for dealing with the borg
you mean were going to be seeing more of them
well run into them on a few occasions
why do i get the feeling thats an understatement it doesnt seem like my first command is shaping up the way i expected
in the middle of the journey of our life i found myself astray in a dark wood where the straight road had been lost
i didnt know dantes inferno was on the maquis reading list
actually i borrowed your copy
my fianc� gave me that book as an engagement gift ive never lent it to anyone
not yet anyway i agree with dante if you always see the road ahead of you its not worth the trip
a soldier and a philosopher your intelligence file doesnt do you justice
ive replicated these belts to resist the effects of the temporal barriers just like the hyposprays
i didnt realise you were programmed to be so versatile
i wasnt but when youre thrown into the deep end of the galaxy and left running for as long as ive been it helps to develop a few extra subroutines
how long have you been running
almost three years since our original doctor was killed
killed how
in the incident that stranded us here in the delta
doctor the temporal prime directive remember
of course im sorry
the delta quadrant is that what he was about to say
ready
ill take the upper decks you take the lower
i dont think splitting ups a good idea
well get the job done faster
as your first officer its my duty to protect you i know a lot more about whats out there than you do and we have no way of communicating if something goes wrong it may take a little longer but we should go together
after you commander
can i ask you something i started out with a crew of a hundred and fifty three i already know i lost my doctor how many others
well suffer casualties like any other starship but youll also gain new crewmen as well
like you how do you get to be my first officer
our crews will be forced to work together after we get stranded
in the delta quadrant how does that happen
are you sure you want to know
run
what the hell was that
a macrovirus they infected the ship a few years ago
sounds like its going to be one disaster after another on this ship
you once told me that starfleet captains dont choose their missions the missions choose them youre going to have the opportunity to study things no human has ever seen before
including some very large germs
a monochromatic environment
its called black and white its one of tom paris holodeck programmes he based it on some old science fiction serials
interesting technology
captain protons rocketpack
captain proton
the saviour of the universe
doesnt sound like mister paris tastes are very sophisticated
thats why we love having him around the access port should be in there
here i think i found the panel give me a hand
halt in the name of chaotica seize them
oh no
computer deactivate programme
unable to comply
surrender
holodeck controls are offline
hold on now wait a minute
thieves my liege
do not resist
they were attempting to rob your laboratory
fool dont you recognise the queen of the spider people arachnia my bride i knew youd return to me one day so i could watch you die
raise the lightning shield power the death ray her fleet may be lurking nearby we must defend ourselves
im open to suggestions
our best bet is to play along
dont let me stop you
im not the one hes in love with
arachnia you beguiled me once with your foul potions did you think you could toy with my affections again
were these characters always this ridiculous
if i order lonzak to pull that lever youll never mock me again
arachnia
please my liege i meant it as ridiculous to think i would ever try to deceive you ive come to warn you of a fiendish plot
by aliens from the eighth dimension
eighth everyone knows there are only five dimensions
if you dont believe us examine their handiwork for yourself theres a hidden panel over there behind those rocks
very well ill humour you lonzak
ive found it highness
theyve sabotaged my laboratory
that vial youre holding its a neutralising potion if you inject their device youll render it harmless
release me and ill disarm all their devices throughout your realm
oh arachnia you do love me
how could i resist your magnetism
or i yours together well rule the cosmos and grind our enemies into dust
if we restore the time line remind me to cancel mister paris holodeck privileges
what the hells going on and what are doing in that uniform
its a little complicated
im not going anywhere
voyagers had an encounter with an anomaly its fractured the ship into different time periods
were trying to undo the damage but we need access to that panel
first she destroys our only way out of the delta quadrant and now youre collaborating with her
try to understand im from a time period in your future when all of us will be working together
thats pretty hard to believe
belanna ive never lied to you before and im not lying now
that woman blamed me for stranding voyager in the delta quadrant
she was angry
but was she right
you had good reasons for doing what you did
what reasons
you were trying to save lives
whose
an alien culture the ocampans
in other words im going to choose to help strangers at the expense of our own people
it isnt like you to secondguess yourself
in this case im secondguessing a decision i havent made yet
keep dispensing the netrazine until we run out then switch to the analeptics
yes lieutenant
how did you get in here
there isnt time to explain
what happened to these people
radiation poisoning the eps relays overloaded when we ran into the anomaly we need the doctor and medical supplies or were going to have a lot more casualties
im afraid that isnt possible right now do the best you can
yes sir
theres an access panel in the galley
coffee black
how do you know how i like my coffee
well you havent changed your standing order in seven years
thanks its just what i needed
dont worry captain youll get us out of this you always do
all done here
captain
tuvok
i am pleased youre here i didnt think i would see you again i want you to know it has been an honour to serve with you and to be your friend
mister paris
live long and prosper
deck eleven
i cant let this happen not again
what are you talking about
voyager getting stranded all these deaths this entire future its my fault ive got to do something to change it
what do you have in mind
maybe we can find a way to modify seven of nines plan put voyager into temporal sync with my timeframe
captain
now that i know what to expect i could avoid getting trapped in the delta quadrant in the first place
halt turbolift sevens plan is dangerous enough trying to alter it is too risky
its worth the risk
if sevens idea works tuvok and the other crewman will be fine
theyll still be stuck in the delta quadrant if the temporal anomaly doesnt kill them something else will the borg telepathic pitcher plants macroviruses the delta quadrant is a deathtrap
what about the temporal prime directive
to hell with it
with all due respect its a little presumptuous to think you have the right to change everyones future
from what ive seen theyll thank me
all youve seen are bits and pieces youre not getting the whole picture
really just what am i missing
its not what its who people like seven of nine a borg drone wholl become a member of this crew after you help her recover her humanity or tom paris a former convict wholl be our pilot chief medic and husband to belanna torres
that angry woman i just met
shes going to be your chief engineer two crews maquis and starfleet are going to become one and theyll make as big a mark on the delta quadrant as itll make on them by protecting people like the ocampans curing diseases encouraging peace children like naomi and icheb are going to grow up on this ship and call it home and well all be following a captain who sets a course for earth and never stops believing that well get there
are you going to be lecturing me like this for the next seven years
dont worry youll always get the last word
in that case lets get back to work
so who is this seska
she was a member of my crew who turned out to be a cardassian spy she made an alliance with the kazon and took over the ship its all right we got it back
sounds like shes not going to be as cooperative as the others
i suggest we take a page from your rule book we try diplomacy
fine but the next page in that book says that when diplomacy fails we need a backup plan
something tells me you already have one
weve already injected the gel packs in the other timeframes that just leaves the ones here its in both our interests to work together
i agree let him go
you believe him
his story is too preposterous to be a lie ill admit its an ingenious solution
im glad youre cooperating
oh i believe in cooperation as long as it benefits me you know its true what they say
whats that
men just get more distinguished as they get older a few lines here a little grey there it adds character too bad their minds start to go the last time you were here you had that nasty head injury and you mumbled something about my taking over the ship five years ago if thats true then youre from a future time frame which means that at some point your crew is going to regain control of voyager i cant allow that to happen step away from the console
its an ingenious plan it just needs a slight modification
what are you doing
recalibrating your pulse to bring the ship into temporal sync with my time frame
thats not possible
when will you learn to stop underestimating me
if you make even the slightest miscalculation youll destroy the ship and kill everyone
what other choice do i have if i can get voyager into my own timeframe then ill be able to ensure that you never retake the ship dont worry i wont hurt you you can start fresh with me
sorry thats not the future i have in mind
in that case
goodbye chakotay
its too dangerous there are too many variables
youre not pleading for your life are you
do it
im telling you youre endangering your own life
im touched by your concern
stop put down your weapons
dont listen to her
oh your faithful first officer isnt going to let you die are you
very clever chakotay inoculating them with your serum now its time to inoculate my people so we can have access to the rest of the ship
i wont do that
then you just lost your captain
now drop your weapons
thanks
seska and the kazon are secure in the jefferies tube the last gel packs
theyre ready
the rest of us should return to our sections after chakotay initiates the warp pulse he should find himself back at the moment voyager encountered the chronokinetic surge hes only going to have a few seconds to reset the deflector polarity if the time line is restored the rest of us should have no memory of whats happened here so id like to thank you now for putting your doubts aside and helping me put mine aside as well good luck to each of you
mind if i ask you one last question
will i have to break the temporal prime directive to answer it
maybe just a little for two people who started off as enemies it seems we get to know each other pretty well so ive been wondering just how close do we get
lets just say there are some barriers we never cross
see you in the future
ensign
chakotay should be initiating the pulse in ten seconds five four three two
reroute main power to the deflector and set the polarity to the frequency im inputting
why
have you ever heard of a lightning rod in about three seconds were going to need one
what is it
i dont know main powers being rerouted to the deflector dish
who gave that order
damage
the deflectors been burned out but were okay
do you mind telling me why belanna burned out the deflector dish
actually i ordered her to do it
why
trust me it was better than the alternative
which was what exactly
i cant tell you
why not
the temporal prime directive belannas already got a team working on repairs what do you say we finish our dinner
forget particle fountains and subspace inversions there isnt an anomaly scarier than a thunderstorm on the plains especially when youre six years old i remember watching a bolt of lightning split an oak tree in my grandfathers yard id climbed it just a few hours before
good timing
so what wouldve happened if you hadnt turned our deflector dish into a lightning rod
weve been down this road before
have we
you wanting answers to questions you shouldnt ask
but something did happen outside the normal space time continuum its strange thinking theres a piece of your life you dont know anything about
sounds a lot like the future
any predictions
only that in a few minutes this bottle will be empty
then maybe you should go to the cargo bay grab another one
how do you know thats where i keep it
oh i cant tell you
why not
temporal prime directive
good morning
youre in a good mood
its another beautiful day in the delta quadrant
what did you have for breakfast
ill see you tonight
here you are lieutenant
thank you nice job ensign  you keep the warp field that stable you might just get us home a few years early
the starfleet manual allows for a variance of point three
thats only a guideline you can do better
i dont remember giving you permission to work here
im sorry lieutenant
im helping him study warp mechanics
you should have notified me its a busy day and i
lieutenant
im fine
im detecting another lifesign
where
inside lieutenant torres it could be a parasite
seven of nine to the doctor
go ahead
ill be accompanying lieutenant torres to sickbay
whats wrong
i believe shes pregnant
the foetus appears to be about seven weeks old and doing quite well so are you
why did she faint
klingon and human metabolisms sometimes clash
tell me about it
its not uncommon for such pregnancies to cause biochemical fluctuations in the mother
is that serious
not usually you can expect some behavioural volatility increased nutritional needs creating new life is a big job
creating new life
i cant believe it
i dont mean to be indelicate but werent you trying to get pregnant
well of course i mean we knew we wanted a family
but the odds against humanklingon conception are so high
well apparently youve beaten the odds may i be the first to congratulate you
when is the baby due
normally klingon pregnancies run thirty weeks but with mixed species it could be sooner
is it a girl or a boy
no dont tell i want to be surprised
weve already been surprised
i just dont see any reason to have to label the baby i dont want to know the gender i dont want to have to pick a name yet
okay okay mommy knows best
mommy
i wonder if the holodeck has any childrearing programmes
there are some things you just cant simulate
ill take whatever help i can get
we should get our quarters ready
maybe i could replicate one of those antique cribs
and put it where we need to rearrange the living area
we need to do a lot more than that
youre happy about this right
of course im happy just a little overwhelmed thats all
me too can we er keep this to ourselves for a while
absolutely
i er i need to get to work see you later dad
congratulations tom
thanks how did you find out
icheb oh he wasnt supposed to tell
we were hoping to keep it private for an hour or so
as they say on talax omara salas good news has no clothes
thanks i guess
now my good news would be learning that ill be the godfather i do have experience with naomi wildman you know
i cant think of anyone more qualified
well in that case ive been making up a list of names tell me
have you checked the warp core for radiation leaks today
no why
you have a certain glow about you
okay who told you
i just heard congratulations
thanks
seven said you were dizzy are you all right
im fine
nothing ever rattled her not even the cardassians
this is scarier
would you like some time off
to do what
adjust this is a big change
ill work during the day sleep at night and have the baby when its time
well if you need to cut back on your duties im sure seven would be happy to fill in for you
i think i can handle it
congratulations buddy
where did you hear the news in the datastream from earth
actually i think it was a transmission from the borg its all over now no more late nights on the holodeck no more racing the delta flyer
dont you think youre exaggerating just a little
ive seen it happen the new dad gets tied down with family old friends drop away
its fatherhood  harry not exile
if you say so kidding aside hows it feel
well its its not quite real yet
maybe thats what pregnancys for time to let reality sink in before your life spins out of control
do you need any help
mister paris this may be the first time youve ever volunteered to assist me
really well we ought to change that i mean weve known each other a long time we ought to work more closely
ill keep that in mind
so i guess youve heard belanna and i are going to have a baby
i was unaware
finally someone who doesnt know
allow me to extend my best wishes
thanks you know a baby is er its a big responsibility but im ready for it not that you can ever be completely ready can you
lieutenant are you asking me for advice about fatherhood
well i dont know anyone else whos been through it
im afraid my parenting skills are somewhat dormant its been many years since my children were young
then youve had a long time to think back on it any helpful hints
offspring can be disturbingly illogical yet profoundly fulfilling you should anticipate paradox
ill remember that
if youd like my counsel on more specific issues
something tells me im going to be volunteering to work with you on a regular basis
so
looks nice
well i figured quiet romantic dinners may soon be a thing of the past tough day
the captain practically relieved me of duty as if i couldnt handle being an engineer and being pregnant at the same time
well if you ever need a babysitter godfather neelix is ready to go
chakotay wants to be godfather
neelix already has a list of names
oh i dont mind people suggesting names what annoys me is all of the free advice about feeding discipline
folk wisdom is my favourite according to chell bolians believe that if you give birth near a warp core itll improve the babys disposition
why does everybody feel theyre entitled to give us advice this is our child
people should know better than to interfere with a klingon mother
whats that supposed to mean
nothing it was a joke
what does being klingon have to do with it
take it easy
i dont want to take it easy i want everybody to back off and just let me  the doctor said i might experience some behavioural volatility i guess this is it
forget about the doctor forget the captain or the godfathers
maybe youre right
i know i am this isnt about their expectations or hopes or doubts none of this belongs to them
it belongs to us all of it
lucky us
lieutenants torres and paris please report to sickbay
its a holographic extrapolation of your childs spine approximately ten months after birth
its deviated
yes theres a pronounced curvature to the left
can it be corrected
i had surgery for it when i was a baby
you never told me that
my mother had it too
it tends to run in klingon families especially among females
are you saying that this baby is a girl
no i didnt say that
but it is a girl right
you cannot infer that
its okay you might as well just tell us
yes its a girl and aside from the deviated spine shes healthy
will she need surgery
fortunately weve advanced beyond that genetic modification is the treatment of choice
if you can project an image of the spine can you use the genetic data to show us the whole baby
i could it would only be an approximation
lets take a look
i dont know
oh come on arent you curious
okay
oh shes beautiful
forehead ridges
yes
but shes only onequarter klingon
klingon traits remain dominant for several generations even with a single ancestor
oh she looks just like her mother
you are so much like your mother
shes perfect isnt she
what a day
uhhuh
six years in the delta quadrant and nothing has ever scared me as much as hearing our baby had a problem
its not much of a problem
we didnt know that at first
now we know
and we also know that the doctor is going to fix everything tomorrow morning
im sorry its a lot to take in all at once and im really tired
we could both use some sleep computer dim the lights
somebody make sure those coals are completely out
ill get it dad
you kids be careful and be back before sunset
and bring your appetites were having fish for dinner
if you two can catch any
dad i increased the field strength of the targeting lure
ooo those fish dont stand a chance better get going your cousins arent going to wait forever
i was thinking maybe i could go fishing with you and uncle carl
i thought you were looking forward to the hike just the kids no dads to slow you down
they dont like me
why would you say that
because its true
come on belanna lets go
see now go on have a good time
dad
what is it
nothing
relax were not that late
the doctor scheduled me at oh eight hundred
you still have time for my favourite gourmet breakfast peanut butter toast
im too tired to eat
if youre having trouble sleeping now wait till those oh two hundred feedings come around
youll be in charge of those
i cant wait
look er you dont have to come with me it a minor procedure
wouldnt you like some moral support
im not an invalid
in that case youre on your own that goes for breakfast too
ive been expanding my database in obstetrics and paediatrics
you havent found another problem have you
no not at all but i have put together a prenatal enrichment programme
why am i not surprised
id like to start with transabdominal vocalisation
let me guess youre going to sing to my foetus
through a diatonal amplifier its quite safe and it should enhance the childs mathematical abilities
can we talk about this later
absolutely at our first parenting class
parenting class
birthing techniques feeding options bonding strategies its not all hard work though well have ample time for fun
could we get on with it
certainly computer dim lights
i hope you dont expect me to sleep through this
of course not the darkness encourages vascular dilation now you may feel a slight tingling please remain as still as possible
belanna come and have lunch
thats okay im not hungry
youd better eat while you can you know our dads arent going to catch any fish
here
thanks
your mom wasnt sure youd be able to come this weekend
i had a lot of schoolwork
im glad you made it
thats nice of you to say
no i mean it
hey belanna can you hand me a drink
okay
thanks
my teacher said klingons like live food
hey stop it stop
it was just a joke
it was a stupid joke dean hes always doing stuff like that to me
dont be mad belanna
belanna wait
computer raise lights your daughters spinal column is now perfectly aligned
is she going to be all right
better than all right if her parents are any indication
computer access belanna torres medical file
file accessed
project a holographic image of the baby
now extrapolate what the childs facial features will look like at twelve years old
display the foetus genome
delete the following gene sequences extrapolate what the child would look like with those genetic changes
delete the following sequences extrapolate
save changes restrict access to this file belanna torres only
theres no valid medical reason to do what youre proposing
i disagree
you want to delete entire dna sequences the genes that create redundant organs for example
theyre superfluous
those redundancies are there for a reason
does my daughter need a third lung to survive
strictly speaking no but having it may be beneficial some geneticists believe the extra lung evolved to give klingons greater stamina on the battlefield
my daughter is not going to be a klingon warrior
with all due respect you have no idea what your daughters going to be what if she develops an interest in athletics greater lung capacity would be an advantage the point is theres no reason to arbitrarily remove genetic traits
its not arbitrary its preventive
how so
that third lung could become diseased couldnt it
i suppose
then what im suggesting is no different than removing an appendix before it becomes inflamed
why tamper with biological systems that evolved over aeons
like curvature of the spine
if i make these changes itll affect her appearance
im aware of that
are you also aware that some of these genes influence behaviour personality
none of thats as important as her health
what does tom think about all this
i wanted to see what you thought first
as you can see im very dubious
look ive done statistical analyses epidemiology at least review my work
all right ill look at it but in the meantime i suggest you have a talk with your husband
absolutely not
this is our childs health were talking about
its more than that you want to change who she is her individuality her you dont want her to be klingon thats what this is really about isnt it youre trying to protect her from being klingon because you had a rough time when you were a kid
i was treated like a monster
that isnt going to happen to our daughter everyone on voyager will accept her for who she really is
thats easy for you to say youre human
meaning what exactly
meaning you dont understand what its like
okay then tell me
when the people around you are all one way and youre not you cant help feeling like theres something wrong with you
voyager isnt just one way weve got bajorans vulcans a talaxian
and hundred and forty humans
our daughter is going to have a mixed heritage just like her mother its something youll have in common something she should be proud of why destroy that
im not destroying anything gene resequencing isnt a weapon its a tool like a hyperspanner
shes not a machine shes our daughter
im not exactly sure what you want me to do
i want you to order the doctor to genetically alter my child
do you see what im dealing with here
what youre asking for is ethically questionable the doctor has reservations your husband is against it
i only want to do what you did for seven of nine
i beg your pardon
you had her implants removed
i dont see the connection
you altered her physiology you changed who she was
i was acting in her best interests
thats all im doing
seven was born human the captain just helped to restore her original physiology
and gave her a much better life in the process
our child isnt even born yet how do you know whats going to make her life better
i just dont want her to start at a disadvantage
look the doctor said you might experience mood swings
thats it just dismiss my argument as some kind of hormonal outburst
i didnt mean that
stop it both of you the biggest problem you two have isnt ethical its marital im happy to offer you advice as a friend but as your captain im not going to overrule the chief medical officer you two need to work this out
belanna
what
you heard the captain we have to work this out
theres nothing to work out youre getting what you want
what i want is to have a civilised discussion with my wife maybe a change of scenery would help how about the holodeck
thats your solution to everything
at least im trying look i dont care where we do it but we have to talk this out
i am tired of talking all right
do i need a reservation
what happened
i think belanna and i need some time apart
my couch is your couch
shes barely pregnant and already were having a major crisis
youll make up you always do
but thats what worries me were always fighting and making up hows that going to affect our daughter
shes going to have a great life piloting a ship from your lap battling doctor chaotica on the holodeck
yeah unless belanna thinks battling is too klingon
shes always been sensitive about being part klingon you know that
that doesnt give her the right to turn our child into a science experiment
but it does explain why this is so important to her
what am i supposed to do
maybe you should tell her you understand
what good would that do
it might make her less defensive and then maybe it would be easier for her to see your point of view
what if she cant
like i said my couch is your couch
she should be back by now
nobody has any idea where she went
she just ran off down there
im going to go look for her
uncle john
yeah
i it
belanna where have you been
im sorry i got kind of separated
it was our fault
it was deans fault he put a worm in her sandwich
i was just kidding im really sorry
forget it
come on lets get dinner started
you want to talk about it
i just wish
you wish what
i wish i werent klingon
now why would you say that
because everyone makes fun of me
whos everyone
dean the kids at school they all hate me
did i ever tell you what the kids at my school used to call me i used to fall asleep in class all the time so instead of john torres they called me john snoreez
its not the same thing
of course it is kids tease each other they can be very cruel but it doesnt mean that they hate you or that they hate klingons
you dont understand
i think i do you have to learn to be a little less sensitive
fine
now come on uncle carls going to tell one of his famous fish stories
id rather just read
suit yourself
we saw a flying fish today
flying fish
its true im telling you we saw it
really
john did we see a flying fish today
we sure did it jumped five feet in the air
everybody asleep
they were exhausted coffee
sure
listen im sorry
for what
the way dean treated belanna i had a talk with him
he was just doing what eleven year olds do im sure belanna overreacted
what makes you say that
shes too damn sensitive
what do you mean shes a great kid
you havent been around her much the last couple of years shes gotten moody unpredictable argumentative just like her mother
i thought you loved mirals intensity
everythings become a fight with her i guess the older i get the less intensity i can handle you know its funny how mom and dad always turn out to be right
what do you mean
mom warned me not to marry miral
mom loved miral
sure she did but she never thought i had the constitution to live with a klingon and now im living with two of them
taya
what
taya its the feminine form of chakotay what do you think
ill add it to the list right after floxia neelix suggested that one its number thirty two
on second thought you and tom ought to come up with your own name
i knew there was a reason i always liked you
you look like youve been up all night want to get some coffee
thats the best offer ive had all week
morning
hi
join us for breakfast you know what i forgot my padd why dont you two go ahead ill meet you in the mess hall
so how are you today
i havent changed my mind if thats what you mean
no what i meant was how are you
ive been better but ill get over it
you know harry has the lumpiest pillows on the ship he snores keeps the room way too hot i missed you
me too
i still owe you that slice of peanut butter toast why dont we go back to our quarters fire up the toaster
sounds nice
lieutenant torres lieutenant paris please report to sickbay
ive reviewed the data you gave me and ive also done my own analysis
skip the details doctor youve already made it clear what you think of my proposal
actually ive changed my opinion
what
the genetic alterations youve suggested are necessary
on what grounds
the clash i mentioned between klingon and human metabolism its more extensive than i realised
how extensive
theoretically it could lead to complete metabolic failure
but you can fix it
by eliminating most of her klingon genetic material
are you sure about all of this
my analysis was quite thorough of course if our circumstances were different you would be free to seek a second opinion
no offence doc but i am just trying to understand whats going on
youre welcome to review my findings but let me stress it would be unwise to delay this too long
why
the foetus is at a critical stage of development antibodies have begun to form
how long do we have
ive scheduled the procedure for tomorrow morning with your permission
i want to thank you both for helping belanna when she fainted
im glad it wasnt a parasite
well you probably dont know this but there may be some problems with the pregnancy
im sorry to hear that
the doctor suggested a treatment for the baby but his findings are very confusing at least to me you have some expertise in genetics do you mind taking a look at this
of course not
whatever the problem is i have no doubt the doctor will solve it
i hope youre right
your confusion is understandable theres a computational error
its not like the doctor to make a mistake
i didnt think that was possible unless theres some sort of glitch in his programme
ill run a diagnostic
thank you
please tell lieutenant torres if theres anything i can do
ill let her know thanks
it appears to be more than a glitch i believe the doctors programme has been tampered with
belanna this is tom respond computer locate lieutenant torres
lieutenant torres is in sickbay
frankly im relieved you decided not to wait till the last minute
once this is behind us im sure well all feel better
someones blocked communications to sickbay
see if you can deactivate the doctor
access to his programme has been restricted
keep trying paris to tuvok
go ahead
meet me in sickbay
why would she alter the doctors programme
to change his mind about the medical procedure computer open sickbay doors
unable to comply
override authorisation tuvok pi alpha
authorisation denied
doctor stop what youre doing
youre interrupting a medical procedure
your programme has been altered
what do you mean altered
ignore him
belanna this is completely irrational
will someone please tell me whats going on
im your patient your first duty is to me and my baby
tuvok to bridge
kim here
theres a force field in sickbay
i cant deactivate it cut power to the eps relay
surrounding the surgical bay
access has been restricted ill have to bypass them
you said it could be dangerous to delay the procedure
shes manipulating you doc in more ways than one
im sorry lieutenant but if theres something wrong with my programme
theres nothing wrong with your programme
im cutting power to the surgical bay now
i suggest we deactivate your programme until we determine the extent of the alterations
i understand computer deactivate emh
you had no right to interfere
tuvok would you mind giving us a minute
i never thought you would go this far
i dont know what youre talking about
reprogramming the doctor
i upgraded his programme so he could understand what had to be done
you mean to reconfigure our baby so she wouldnt be treated like a monster
its not just about the way shell be treated
what else is it about then come on belanna tell me
forget it
no no were not going to forget it were going to talk about this right now
stop telling me what to do youre not my father
what are you talking about
look my father
what what about him
we were inseparable he spoiled me and i worshipped him but the older i got we just grew apart he ended up organising this camping trip with my cousins i guess he just wanted to i dont know make things better again
but it didnt
it was awful i ended up trying to run away
belanna what are you doing
it was so stupid i mean where was i going to go
you probably just wanted him to stop you
well he did
dont touch me
belanna whats wrong
you know whats wrong
no i dont
maybe im just being moody and unpredictable
what are you talking about
i heard what you said to uncle carl
you shouldnt be listening to private conversations
and you shouldnt have said what you did about mommy
belanna listen to me your mother and i are having problems but that doesnt
you dont love her anymore
thats not true
yes it is and you dont love me either
belanna
youre no different than anyone else you dont like klingons you said it
you are twisting my words belanna
maybe he was right maybe you misunderstood
no i know what i heard it made me so angry
you had a right to be after the things he said
its not what he said its what i said
if you cant stand living with us then why dont you just leave
and thats exactly what he did
oh belanna
twelve days later and he never came back
you cant blame yourself for that
why not
because he was obviously unhappy about his marriage he didnt leave just because you told him to
you dont know that
look whatever the reason was im sure it was a horrible thing for you to live with wait a minute you dont think belanna i am never going to leave you
you say that now but think about how hard it is to live with one klingon pretty soon itll be two
and someday i hope its three or four i mean it and i hope that every one of them is just like you belanna i am not your father and you are not your mother and our daughter is going to be perfect just the way she is
do you really think so
i know so
good morning lieutenant youre not feeling ill are you
no im fine i just wanted to apologise for violating your programme
apology accepted not guilty by reason of biochemistry
nice of you to let me off the hook but biochemistry isnt an excuse i knew exactly what i was doing oh
is something wrong
i dont know
your babys kicking
so soon
well she is part klingon
oh there it is again
may i
feisty little thing isnt she i wonder where she gets that from
speaking of the baby i have another request
yes
i wonder if youd like to be her godfather neelix wants the job but hes already got naomi wildman and chakotay knows less about raising kids than harry and if you think
i accept
thanks
thank you
i was also wondering do you think i could see her one more time the holographic projection i mean
i dont see why not
she is cute isnt she
this is captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager were responding to your distress call
a ruptured conduit is flooding my ship with plasma radiation we request immediate transport
im detecting eleven life signs two are weak
transport the injured to sickbay and the rest to cargo bay one i want security teams at both locations
our weapons
theyll be returned to you when you leave
these are dangerous criminals they have to be secured
well do our best to accommodate you
i had eight men in custody where are the other two
were not going to hurt you
stay away or ill kill her
im sure we can resolve this without resorting to violence what is it you want
a ship some food
i might be able to arrange that but youll have to release her first
im not a fool
you know ill do it tell them
youre not getting off this ship
if you release her i promise you wont be harmed
not until i get a ship
we dont negotiate with criminals
who are you
warden yediq of the nygean detention force this man is my prisoner
if that were true he wouldnt be holding my friend hostage
get back
im a hologram i cant be harmed
i think you proved my point
were lucky you came along captain ten more minutes and none of use would have survived the plasma leak
your vessel was equipped with escape pods why didnt you use them
i couldnt risk letting any of the prisoners get away as youve seen theyre extremely dangerous
where are you taking them
back to our homeworld theyre due to be executed
what were their crimes
all eight are murderers three are multiple offenders were just thirteen light years from our system id appreciate it if youd take us back there
actually we were headed in the opposite direction
i could arrange for one of our ships to rendezvous with voyager itll take several days my prisoners will have to be strictly monitored
commander tuvok will help you make arrangements
some of the crew may not be comfortable helping to deliver eight men to their deaths
i cant say i like it either but we have a prime directive to follow
thirty more seconds and i could have resolved the situation peacefully instead you and tuvok the kid had to take matters into your own hands
youre damaged
commander tuvoks friendly fire must have caused a feedback surge in my emitters
ill help you repair it
how are you
fine captain
you this your ship
yes
then let me out
im afraid i cant do that
if you dont ill kill you all
janeway to tuvok are the prisoners accommodations ready
affirmative captain
then by all means initiate transport
youre sure these will hold them
the force fields are impenetrable as are the tritanium bulkheads in addition to your staff two voyager security officers will remain here at all times two more will be posted at the entrance to the cargo bay
what about our weapons
youll be allowed to carry them in this area only if you leave the cargo bay youll be asked to surrender them
whats this
dinner since you cant bring the prisoners to the mess hall ive brought the mess hall to them
what is it
talaxian spice stew served over leola rice pilaf its an old family recipe
take it back
too spicy
these men dont deserve such an elaborate meal take it back
federation guidelines are quite clear about the treatment of prisoners
he is correct
i can quote the protocols if you like
my men will assist you
thanks for standing up to yediq
just doing my job
still it was kind
this would be easier if you would remain stationary
it doesnt feel right
you may experience unusual sensations while your matrix realigns
i was referring to the arrangement the captains made with the nygeans no matter how terrible the crimes these men committed it seems wrong to hand them over to be executed this is a federation starship not the barge of the dead
would you have preferred the captain release them
of course not theyre dangerous men
executing them ensures theyll never pose a threat to anyone again
so would life sentences the operative word being life
confining them for life requires significant resources the nygeans may not think it worthwhile
what about rehabilitation given the chance some of these men might become productive members of society one day
their victims wont have the same opportunity
and that justifies taking their lives an eye for an eye its not justice its revenge quite frankly im surprised youre not troubled by such a barbaric system
im simply being objective you often encourage me to see both sides of an argument
well this is one occasion when my programming wont allow me to be objective killing is wrong no matter whos doing it
still hungry i can hear your stomach from here this must be the first time in a month you couldnt steal poor egrids meal
