standby proceed
okay well wait until we get through staging here i think houston
okay soon as you can reach it thats the way to go
where the hell is it
imu powers over on   
oh  side
12 houston go for staging  day 1 page 1
roger were go for staging
  gn power  
yes
okay you want the lmp to turn off the gn power and then bring it back on and you want me to use my imu caging switch is that right o0 00 08 44 cml no dont hit that caging switch  
no no no
stand by on that pete
dont hit that cage switch
0848
okay stand by
0850
0911 is shutdown huh
yes 0911
i think we got hit by lightning 00 00 09 04 cmplmp i do too

look at that stuff go by
roger pete your thrust looks good
okay give us more words on the imu now
i got ice all over the windows out here yall i got the horiz dont have the horizon but i got the sky
pointed down pretty good
hope those thrusters dont have the ice  
stand by a minute pete were still talking
okay o0 00 09 44 imp no were  were in good shape wheres your card here dick were at the 9   o0 o0 09 47 cml okay hold still
   low 00 00 09 51 cml yes okay in 10 minutes we should be at 246
that was right on the profile good 
ten minutes
all right get your  get your shutoff checklist out
i got it now listen dick all this  best thing i can  
you havent pushed this gn power by the way
yes yes  
 mode iv
roger mode iv
i got a restat  i got a restart program alarm and all   theres the gimbal lock get it out of gim bal lock  my timer i 
well this ones running
 36 00 o0 10 38 cml shutdown weve got less than a minute to shutdown
now get the gimbal motors off 
got about a half a g
yes sir were getting   
well ill tell you one thing  
  just do it right 00 00 10 54     right
yes lets get  right behind the eightball and get ahead 00 00 11 05 i24p cabin pressure looks good
yes we ought to get shutdown here in about  
houston cutoff 11 plus 35 00 00 11 12 cml 35
11 plus 35 rogerroger we get this platform  turned up on the sivb
i hope we can iron out  
i hope 00 00 11 21 cml yes i do too 
i dont either i think it was the low voltage it just fell off maybe it got hit
okay stand by for shutdown
stand by 31 32 
there it is 
shutdown time skip
022527 roger and as soon as we get into dark ness well give you the other p52 sir
roger dont forget option 3 pete
rogerroger option 3
okay my mistake is putting all this junk in this pocket but this is the obvious pocket to put the goody
well you did take a long time
give me a paper   
 the ems
good boy
down in that righthand lower pocket of mine put this there too  and this
 righthand lower pocket
right  
how come you got that pocket over there this one huh
gdc align ail right ill do that right now byby see you at carnarvon heres a couple of more data for this
lower your foot if you can
okay
there you go thats a boy you got a book over here too you know
yes i got to get that out of there
didnt you want it
yes o0 01 55 46 cml huh

i bet old baby  and guys almost fell off their consoles
bet they did
they werent the only ones that almost fell off their consoles
okay got to align the gdc 00 01 56 03 ij4p why bother why do you want to do another alignment
its the time  its the time you said you wanted pete
laughter i was kidding  i was kidding verb 48 enter
what are you doing with the dsky now
im loading it 31102 all balls zero pro 63479 32563 pro gimbal angles are minus 54 plus 133 good set ordeal verb 83 enter verb 83 enter at canary los were supposed to do this and im supposed to bring the pyros up and on translational control power up and on
after you put all that in the dsky ill do my align  
wait wait let me finish
i will i will
youre not all the way in darkness yet anyhow
yes but i got stars 
got them in the

laughter
laughter that platform 
ail right dick gordon the computer is yours and im arming the pyros gang be advised the pyros are armed now  trans control power is coming up and on rot control power is going to acdc rot control power direct to main amain b launch vehicle indicatorgpi siisivb verify it is launch vehicle guidance should be iu verify
circuit breakers clears throat  no wait a minute im right at the place where i got to stop right now ail right no direct ullage breakers yet stop right there pick it up again after dick gordon gets done his nambypamby  
well theres p52  and i dont see a single star  day 1 page 17
 right over got it in the sextant
yes sure have
isnt that interesting why dont you look back in the telescope
i have its not in the telescope pete
well you got a lot of daylight on you still out there dick
i couldnt see a damn thing in the telescope and i dont see any star right now
okay   
that things right smack  great big one  right smack in front of 
okay
whats that  hitting me in the shoulder
which shoulder
right
hey a1 bean
yes sir
  our cabin heats down isnt it its 54

ive got my  pencils ready to go here
1212  two stars  45  
nats okay 
  should be fomalhaut
all that stuff is in there just perfect ail con nected this camera looks like its ready to  
pete i used star number 1  
ail right just a minute let me write all this good stuff down
  which is aipheratz and star number 45 which is fomalhaut
star number 1 and star number 45 yes
okay and hes in the middle of this sextant
thats beautiful thats beautiful
but hes sure not  00 01 59 36 i24p thats  00 0t 59 39 cmp right in the center of the sextant
should be getting something out of this  its the best look i got and i cant get any  too much of a  
there you go all balls now youre learning dick gordon
laughter i appreciate that
look at the torquing angles
okay there you go
oh ho ho ho is that beautiful minus three balls 14 minus three balls 28
plus three balls 18
plus three balls 18
two hours and 20 seconds 
mark
two plus 20  plus 20
and ill do a star check  day 1   page 19
ail right and im going to go ahead and do the gdc align  while youre doing all that good stuff
uhoh well thats all right
yes 00 02 00 35 cml 405 no stars available  
available yes
how do you do a verb 307 i always get stopped by 
thats done
well there ought to be a star out there  
no we just  theres not much  
theres not any stars since we 
thats not a pair see im just going start  now  
ail right now  
proceed and enter  
no enter enter o0 02 o0 59 cml why

i dont want to use the same one im doing see
oh isnt there another star thats in that area
no alpheratz and fomalhaut  
 make a pair
how about  i wonder if enif would be there thats on the other side of  well lets see if enif would  
you could enter and load enif
now lets see here enif  i think we could do that 44 is enif shaft is  is 18 trunnion is 45 i dont  181 and 45  i dont know if ill make that or not we will shortly though no its going out  yes there it is right in the middle of the cross hairs
we got  yaw drift
who has
dick does   00 02 0t 53 lmp 
yes its  
and that little old star enif is right in the middle of the sextant
you must have wanted it quite  quite extensively 00 02 02 01 cml that sextant is gorgeous in the middle of the sextant but i sure dont have anything in the tele  no wonder i had a hard time the first time around
yes if you look out in the daytime you see what you see
huh
look out that thing in the daytime you  see  terrible
man im telling you there isnt anything in the telescope and that star is as bright as it can be in that sextant
well be glad its that way and not the other way program alarm again
its going out past 50 degrees thats all right  go to zero optics little hot
yes but now im cooling off a little
cabin temp in auto im going to put this thing in    day 1 page 21
cabin trp in auto
  back to p00 in this and im going to stow these optics for this  
dick gordon should i put the cabin temp in aut
yes you going to cool it off
yes
huh
 bag
 there you go
hey the way to do  is to learn to housekeep in this thing hey dick gordon
yes sir
when we trade seats were going to have to 
yes sir
ail right  lot of space
yes  thats really something else
thats was what  i was really enjoying that ride it was a very comfortable one
i loved that first   
oh   00 02 03 5h cdr   for 45 seconds
yes
i couldnt even believe that
i couldnt either i thought they were kidding me laughter
i thought  
the best part of all was a1 bean kept saying back there this little voice kept saying i have power on my buses i have power on my buses laughter o0 02 04 ll  laughter
and i kept looking at all those lights and   
no wonder the shaft and trunnion 
huh o0 02 04 19 cml i had the shaft and trunnion 
you zero the optics is it in cmc or in manual · 00 02 04 30 cml cmc all right optics zero
funny how slow you think up here
there they go 00 02 04 42 cml 
it just takes you a while to get going thats all 0002 04 52 lmp it does
 00 02 05 o0 cml its not a natural environment my friend you havent been here before neither has anybody else for very long get that freaker in there somehow or another where its going to stay  until some body  it  
youre not going to leave it there for tli are you
oh no i just want to set it there now i want  i got to figure out what i got to do so ill be ready
 how about radiators water  and all those  
ill check  ill check them again put that in there
hey you got some room to put some goodies up in your place how about putting this lunar landmark map up  up there in the stowage place
yes thats a good idea 
get all that in  in the overhead right now check the  
put that up there
eds power translunar inject eds power is on
heres a couple more
yes all right 00 02 05 54  if you want to get out the card book ill get out the proper card
for what
for tv and stuff
what cards are that do you have cards for tv
for that camera and stuff youve got to start taking pictures 00 02 06 07 cml okay
 bright  and im at the same place on that card as i am in this book
see if we got any other place 
you want any other   here it is
 that card yes let me have the  the burn card
what burn card
sps burn
here you play with this
all right i will but ill hand it back to you
all right whats the cabin stabilizing at
the third light  
its down to 553 now
i know what it looks like
what did we say were going to stabilize at
49 or something
had a rate valve that was high
boy i heard that 
that was the last thing i heard
that was the last thing i heard too because that was about the time all the lights came on i was saying to myself at the time bean youre sure cool to notice that right on schedule i was watching it at 25 seconds

yes yes i kind of glanced up and saw that disappear
i looked out some on the launch to see it
i didnt know where we were what we were doing i just knew that 318 was time to get rid of the tower laughter

thatll make it  laughter thatll give them something to write about tonight laughter
boy theres a lot of it 00 02 08 20 cmp yes
 starch
hey where did all that come from
whats that
well you just bent over and some real nice cold air  is it coming out of your suit yes oh man is that nice
you like that huh
yes
when  when do we do tli
tli comes  time base 6 comes  
im going to leave this chair flat
shoot 2 hours and 6 minutes ago youd have been sat isfied with a safe abort now you want to do tli
the what abort
laughter safe abort
oh safe abort
time base 6 starts at 023742
hey were almost there now you want to use this handydandy little program in the computer
might as well
and get all good things done
im down at  im down at carnarvon aos 0225 where i push in the direct ullage breakers i got the event timer set to 51 and then the   
 stay up there or what
no
al baby you put that in block
i cant  i can now that ive cleaned out some of that junk 0002 09 18 cmp  back to a96
light flash whats all that junk 
you sure dont hear those service module engines but you  
i see  you see those rcs flash theres another one
thats got to be the sivb 00 02 09 34  yes everybody said they saw them
i got a bunch of stars out my window now let me see anybody i recognize upside down looking out   o0 02 09 45 cma thats the problem i dont know what attitude i was in
looking south
i couldnt believe all that  looking  looking 
why dont we get some string 
you want some  you want some string
i want 
yes wait until after we get on the  
  just kidding of course right this minute but  
  get on to the  to the lm
  get this out
hey you know this is neat oh boy that was a big one
what was that lightning flashing on the ground 00 02 t0 12 cdr no its  its the aps
oh the aids
it looks funny because you  does look like youre horizontal doesnt it theres capella
hope the cameras ready  launch with that eight ball 00 02 10 42  yes
and all those lights on
laughter
i couldnt believe it
yes
i couldnt even read the pan  the panels hell i said everythings on a1   00 02 10 50  you know one of my first  
  i said you got everything
i figured what had happened is that the command module had separated from the service module elec trically something like that i mean you could 
were off a little
yes i wandered off in yaw just a little
i wonder why they never gave us that one before
yes sim supe never gave us that at all
i dont think they ever expected   
they never imagined 
the batteries didnt go my circuits  
ill bet  ill bet they   00 02 ll 19 cmp i didnt give you your pad for that thing did i al
what pad dick
your pad 0002 ll 24 lmp yes i didnt take it because i was trying to get some other things done
yes mine was  00 02 ll 28  were supposed to  how far are we from tli
an hour and 20 minutes
no we got longer than that were in 6 time base 6 o0 02 ll 35 i24p okay im going to take time to look over these circuit breakers a little bit
hey guys i need a pad because  
what do you need
well i want to use that  use that thing for my 
okay you want a countdown on this
well let me read it to you where is it
let me give you the pad right here
theres that tuning fork again 00 02 11 53 i24p let me turn to the proper page here
i wish somebody could check down in that leb  before 
ill go down there  
no no you dont have to do that
why dont you stick around here  
wait until after the tli
hey wait a minute hang on get back here you got your belts all messed up you got your  here you go
what you got these pamphlets here for
i dont know
what do you need on the pad dick time base 6  
i need  
  starts at 2 hours 37 minutes and 43 seconds
37 boy were coming  now
okay things look good here gang i need that now look at that a little bit
yawn 
what 
 any more stumbling blocks today
tli and get the lm out
laughter
and we got a couple of p22s to worry about too
oh you got a problem got to keep this auto optics running if you dont  
i dont  i hope we dont dump the platform any more
yes lets concentrate on that
what are you doing down there dick
hey dick gordon
what
what do you want to do start this coas dick
no no  in that  in that and the optics  i want to look at this  get the whole field of view  there he is the belt was right up the very edge of it 00 b2 13 28 cdr okay
and the  goes down here and then 
 down in the center of 
yes
you hate to look at in the daytime
dick you want  you want to start this program now
not  not  not particularly no
you want to take this  did you all take off the 
no hell just leave everything where it is we can clean up this whole thing when we get the lm out and get on our way f
thats a good idea
we got until 5 oclock tomorrow morning o0 02 13 56 limp here take the flight plan let me put that up
is that in the right place
i dont know o0 02 14 07 cml i wonder if that erasable program got wiped out
i wonder why it took the fuel cells
just disconnected them thats all it did
but why and nothing else
i dont understand that either
we must have gotten some horrendous spike on some 
that must have been what done it theyre both spiking simultaneously because you know if you spike one up it takes the fuel cell off the other
yes and if you spike both of them you got the whole shooting match i think we just gave off a big static electrical discharge that just drained the spacecraft for about 2 seconds worth of power you know and then it just fell off
that must have been it
i imagine they can sort it out on their telemetry dick
sure they can o0 02 14 55 cdr theyll see what  theyll know when those things came off
i dont like this strap in the way up here al
well lets move it
how about getting locked in for tli
i thought we had an hour or something or more
would you believe that tli is at  at 2  time base 6 is what 0236
seven
0237 so mine  about 0247
when are we going to start  when do we start burning nine minutes later
nine minutes after 0237 0246
do we have ground at  00 02 15 32 cdh we got to we never got a go
did you copy the  
carnarvon at 2 plus 25
did you copy these  the torquing angles anywhere
i have them ready to give to the ground right here
okay
i think we roll first
oh no youre right im sorry i didnt see them 
hey dick let me look at your book a minute please
okay dick  you look at yours and ill just make sure i got all these things put away
 settling back in your couch get your chair the way you want it
thats what im doing right this second
you want this card up here any more
no
i even glanced at that baby i said i cant believe that cards up there and that ac bus 1 lights on laughter
what a way to start
theres a better way
yes
lets hope nothings wrong with the lm or anything  that baby protected  
protected yes
  it has no power on it whatsoever now
why
well the umbilical drops out and when the umbilical drops out it  it  it  it just goes dead on power until we get in
yes
yes  it doesnt have  it doesnt get battery power from the sivb i thought it did but it doesnt right beano
thats exactly right it doesnt
its running on internal batteries right now on low voltage
yes its running on internal batteries
uhoh
whats the matter
 falling off the line  battery
yes they can they get in that automatic disconnect  
hey theyve got automatic disconnect just like those fuel cells its not like  its not llke this thing here we got those  controls and everything
 circuit breakers out of there 
what would that mean 00 02 l 16 lmp that would mean that your imuwouldnt be as good as you thought but i guess weve  
i mean when we put power back on well get power back on even if those ecas dropped out wouldnt we
yes  havent thought of it yet
when we undocked here i guess we need to look at that to make sure that all these things are right for undocking nobodys been separating that stuff
 dont know 00 02 17 55 cml tv cameras ready to go
okay i can eat my sandwich
high gain antenna angles are  verify operation   right after we turn around 00 02 18 16 i24p our rcs looks all right
look at that el its pink
im going to look out the window an 
turned everything out okay
turned everything down
everything looks good to me
 out there 
have you checked the coas pete
i didnt check that it works but ill turn it on right now and give  yes zap does it workl whew  down super there you go
is that on zero set it on zero  00 02 19 0g cdr its set on zero and i presume i got it in the right detent
coas power off boy these struts are really loose in here look at them
yes
 no way 
boy theres no doubt in your mind when that thing lifts off that bitch hauls out
thats what its supposed to do
it does god
it seems like it took them a year to say towers clear though
you were counting the seconds i was watching the clock
yes they called it way late
yes about 12 13 seconds  
roll program didnt begin until 32 seconds either
man alive but it  
yes it 
 i looked at my clock it said 43 minutes 15 seconds and it was stopped big deal 00 02 20 00 cml this one was still running  rolling right along we took it at 2 
id sure like to have somebody standing down there in the leb and see whether it says it on that other clock itd make me feel a lot happier
 check it 
im going to have to force myself to get back to my old habits and relax
yes
hand me that book a minute ill give it back to you
doing that al
not yet
just relax your  turn loose you can go to wherever your normal park position is
yes you do youve got a different place  over my head
get that sivb broke in
glad your iu didnt glitch with it
that would have been something 00 02 20 57 cml  pad
you know an interesting thing  whats our oxygen 6040
yes
that the way we lifted off
yes
well you know that thing happened right around the time for cabin relief
how come that
i dont know was that a water   day 1 page 37 00 02 21 17 cml  supposed to do that
whats the cabin
 15 seconds  
hey were venting the cabin arent we
were venting the cabin the vents are open
yes but we shouldnt be doing that should we
yes because its now fallen down to where the  the  
well make it up   00 02 21 33 ·cmp  starting to pick up the reg now isnt it
yes your waste vents open and  and thats normal to get the 02 high flow in flight  
yes yes you   
youve got the waste vent open down there and this is how were purging the cabin okay
yes
it happens to everybody
yes
except we can record that it happened at 022130 dick did we  
here reading the oxygen at  that come out before we still bleeding off
yes its bleeding off
 regulate right at the 5  5 point  
somewhere after tli i know i get down there and turn that baby  that waste vent off
and ill get them off   ill get them off with the circuit breakers and you get over on 
yes you close it after we get out of  do tli
man i recognize  oh theres my old buddies alpha and beta centaurus  southern cross theres the magellanic cloud 
there you go did you align the gdc after i  
yes after the platform
 read out my  
ail right im going to wait until we get carnarvon see if they want to do anything to the dsky before · i put the erasable fighres in there
okay
you want the lights on now
no wait until 
man those thrusters are bright
that the aps
i thought it was the aps  rcs check
no
here a1 bean  getting 
okay and the other thing is i got to remember to get hot on those propellant valves
yes 
why dont we have  i thought  we want those 
no you want the lights up you want them up
yes sure    day 1  page 39
then lets have them up
check those after we get off 
okay there we go we got sband signal  lock these fellows in 
you did align the gdc
yes im going to direct ullage breakers in right now
one
two
the event timers still set at 51 and im beginning to get monitoring for time base 6 cmp to the couch im waiting for all this good stuff to start
hello houston apollo 12 over carnarvon
apollo 12 houston loud and clear
roger i got some torquing angles for you
roger would you do some work for us tape recorder off and high bit rate
ail right tape recorder off
try again al now
 okay gang    time skip
doesnt that make you nervous
oh i see i was upside down
yes everybodys upside down  
were  were upside down were going around the world upside down
yes the blocks on the top thats all

solid as a rock boy that thing hasnt even moved
check the nitrogen looks good not a thing
okay it looks to me like we got a hot engine and were going to shut down early
okay
about 5 seconds early
okay
ill keep watching her
did you get crossover yet al
no no 
55 were just about finished
 that chamber pressure everybody is going to 
boy this engine is really running hot looks like its going to shut down quite early
100percent chamber pressure
yes i couldnt tell crossover here
 going to shut down at 552
its going to shut down 6 seconds early
yes its perfect
100percent chamber pressure
its up high in the increase range and its still there
six seconds until shutdown its going to shut down at 52 going to shut down 6 seconds early
twenty seconds

yes 5 4 3 2 1

over 
ail right lets check all those sps injector valves and close the helium valves  
wait a minute let me get the residuals
ooh god damn it  plus l plus 1
okay minus 1
plus l plus 1 4  day 4 page 83
minus 1 plus 1 plus 1 okay
look at that moon
son of a gun look at that place 03 11 32 08 i24p gosh look at the size of some of those craters

okay
the  is cleaned up and the deltav m is  
now let me just make sure here 03 11 32 19  did you get this pete

got it  man look at that place outstanding effort there dick gordon flash gordon pilots again 
170 by 618
that is absolutely 
got it
yes were circling around  place  
let me see your fuel and oxidizer
okay the fuel is 34  correction 384 oxidizer is  
fuel  wait a minute oh here it is i see 38  
  and 387 and unbalance is about 80 pounds increase
okay
look at that moon bugger ill tell you i may be colorblind but that looks gray as hell to me
what are you doing oh youre rolling
im rolling for attitude pete for attitude im working
save that gas babel save it
im saving it
good godfrey thats a godforsaken place but its beautiful isnt it
that old turtleback dome hanging there  look at it
look  look how black the sky is 
thats gray and something else
chalky white  those craters have been there for  
a few days
yes
man this is good to be here is all i can say
has quite a horizon to it doesnt it
yes
it is smaller  and its got a nice arch to it
okay
okay now  dick youre going to roll 180  
pitch 302
  pitch 302  
yaw zero
  yaw zero 03 ll 34 51 cp youve got the high gain angles right there   there you go
yes were minus 68 and sitting here at 39 reacq
yes if you want there you go that ought to do it okay
thats it
lunar surface attitude hatch window heads down go orb rate by 84 hours give me that update for time that first lunar rev  
its right there
oh 03 ll 35 20 ip orb rate
what was the first orbit update pad
the map update
yes
832435 over the 180degree burn angle
how about 8325
sounds good okay well get aos here at 834357
do you want the tv camera out
no we dont need it yet
 we ought to be getting it out  
well get it out then  find a spot
where are we does anybody know
yes 83 were 10 minutes out ill show you right where we are
10 minutes  time
were right over at this spot right here i dont know were upside down so i guess that would be out  
no were rightsideup now
yes
i saw that turtleback crater its right in here
at 10 minutes thats  we went by here at 25
go get the tv camera
when i think you need it ill set it right here 03 11 36 50 cml a stopped the roll huh
says youre going to be doing this  coming around in here
oh gosh what a sight
whatd you see
laughter its rightsideup in my window now it looks fantastic of course were getting higher sun angles  look at that
yes this  sure enough its leaking 03 11 37 29 i24p everythings staying just like it was when we shut down which is a swell idea i think
boy youd never guess it doesnt look like were 60 miles does it
thats because everything is so much bigger the craters are so much bigger  than anything youve ever seen and i think thats why
guess youre right
i was looking at them you know as we came in and theyre just huge
i marked this so wed know where we were whos got a dry cloth hand me your  
were 5 minutes to aos
  hand me your cloth please pete
thrusters going
man thats got to be spectacular
okay looks good dick 03 11 38 3h cdr boy thats good right there there you go
there you go
heres your thing back pete got it all done
yes youve got me all discobooberated perspectivewise now that were in orbit you feel the same way
hey whos that big guy
were going to have to learn which way on that map whether were going backwards or forwards  what were doing for example were right now at 25  
were right in at 25
 ph 39 so its 14 minutes fourteen minutes  heres 20 were right around in here now  were looking backwards we ought to turn this map around the way were going see
hey i see  i see the crater 
heres the thing you put our map around the way were going  see and out your side you ought to see a huge old one
where
right out there
i do  a monster   03 11 39 47 cml right here theres about three or four right in the middle of  
theres one thats got a whole bunch of craters in the bottom of it wheres  03 11 39 52 civil thats this one  great big thing
no its not the same one
ill tell you what you could use this other map  its a 11 it may be a better one take a look at this one dick try this one for size look at about  15 minutes the secret is to point the map down towards the leb
is it firing
yes
why 03 11 40 31 cml  set to hold
man it was firing everybody complains though
 the firing   03 11 40 44 cml theres a huge monster with a central peak look at that  03 11 40 48 i2pcdr where
out my window take a look
oh yes right out there thats  thats  thats the one 
thats the one you said was called tsi  tsi  oh yes tsiolkovsky  tsiolkovsky
is that the way were going
tsiolkovsky  yes see put this like this where this points at the leb and then   
is it a double crater al
well hold it like this this is the way were going thats your side  
yes but this  thats not a double crater this is a double crater this is the big crater  
that one right there with the central peak in it is that the one youre talking about
no way out here look at this  
oh  oh laughter goodness youre right wow
its got a mare with it
there it is yes look at that
just go ahead and slide across
which one are you looking at al

oh yes isnt that pretty
 hold this tv or scething i shouldnt have got it out because i can take pictures

oh yes were almost gone
lets see whats the trouble with   03 ll 41 54 i34p i just had your strap dick
oh you had just a minute and ill get mine out of the way clean up the  
heres your strap
were going to have acquisition here in about another 2 minutes
we do will check it on our high gain
boy that does have mare in it doesnt it
yes
what did we end up percent on fuel 03 11 42 14 i24p good god 384 for fuel and 387 for oxidizer
i hope we burned enough did the ems say we did
no  shut down early
huh oh yes  degrees
oh okay i couldnt tell
ems has 10
ail right
unbelievable just think just the little bit tiest ones down there we can see are going to be our crater hey theres one with collapsed sides over there see it
where
out your side  straight ahead sort of
oh yes ail clumped
i wonder if we ought to have sunglasses for this  its white down in here you notice
where im looking is a  a higher  higher sun angle yes we are climbing
you can tell
boy look at that black horizon thats black
its the white and black  its 
i dont think  i dont want sunglasses
it does something all right it doesnt seem to have  well lets dont use them for a while we may get  eyes may hurt later
look at those craters man theres been a lot of action down there
pretty out 03 11 h3 44 cmp eighteen minutes
25  noun 43  
its 18 minutes
go orb rate at what time  84 right
by 84  
right here
  we got to get hous  there he comes hes just coming in
huh there you go  howd you know 
a1 bean you keep forgetting about that gain
he thought it was zero when we looked at it wait until i tell them the good news yall  they dont know thats the reason they got us but 
hello houston yankee clipper with intrepid in tow has arrived on time are you ready for the burn status report
thats affirmative go ahead clipper
okay the burn was on time the burn time was 5 plus 52 the residuals   time skip
that and man if they were hot wouldnt that be something
 control  freezing your ass off
want some
yes
is it a superdo like the good one
say  youre the only guy that knows
what
hey theres a good one singing 03 13 09 50

we can always start talking about 
sorry im not too familiar with those
laughter
sing als song
singing hey dixie steady as you rove  
thank you richard this looks delicious

ive eaten worse food in the last 3 days than ive eaten in my  03 13 12 h9 cdr got to start watching this baby here  see what happens
that waste water dump is  too
hey were supposed to do this fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 8530 r day 4  page 95
wonder what they want us to dump it to they never did say
dump it to the nominal 25
just to normal
why dont we dump it to 10 just to be safe
there it is wont hurt a thing
laughter
hey dick where are you going to sleep at night when youre by yourself
im going to sleep underneath the couches like you
oh its only one night pete  worried about it
thats right i keep thinking that  
say it isnt only one night
  yes i keep thinking its tonight
tomorrow we do the landing  eva  thats kind of a  
hey this tastes good
whats that
apricot you want one
no thank you
al
no thank you pete ill 
so long as you like it pete its a good deal
whats your new logic
 i like to eat on earth  03 13 16 51 cdr ate what they gave me or what i could stuff down theres a couple of times i stuffed down a whole lot more than i ever ate on earth this  feels good

watch your fingers 
all right clean out this tsb one more time too  
 nicely  
  before you guys go  
  leave you a clean spacecraft
  so i can  keep it up 
yes
there goes the 02 flow high  id say the waters  day 4  page 97
thats exactly what it was 03 13 21 36 cml are you going to help me 
yes
huh
thats right
were going to go through that data and make sure we got every single one go
heres number 2
twentyfour hours from now youll know were on our way down al thats when i get nervous find that little mother  and ill land it right side up
you got to stop it if youre going to land it rightsideup 
ail right
what you looking for dickydick
yes that lunar landmark you knew you had to get that out sooner or later
 03 13 24 55 i34p that food package is exactly the same size if not just a little bit bigger than the one i set out
that means you didnt eat much
what are you trying to tell me
im trying to tell you you didnt eat
no its just that they dont  they dont fold up any smaller than they come
hi where are you h1  there it is h1
boy the sun moves pretty fast doesnt it moltke was in the damn  was moltke in the termi nator
right at the terminator right at it
were trying to track what this little fellow right there  is it this one right here
good luck hope you see the 
laughter
gad theres stars out there cant believe it
not much difference  simulator
which stars should we be looking at 03 13 27 04 cml were at 245 pitch and we ought to be looking at  i get enif 03 lb 27 15 cml right in here
hey i eau see the pleiadesl
there you go
eureka hey thats pretty damn good for this little fellowl 03 13 27 33 cml which fellow 03 lb 27 34 lmp the goddamned tele  telescope right
 the suns shining in there  03 13 27 53 imp what else is out there theres all kinds of stars but i dont recognize any
hey you know one of the  dick
huh
how could this goddamn 
yes  dan 4 page 99
hey theres all kinds of stars out there now 03 13 28 20 imp i ought to recognize something but i dont whats around the pleiades name some things
aldebaran
whats he in
 03 13 28 32 cml hes in  menkar 
whoops whoops that did it 03 13 28 40 cml came up
that did it the sun came up zap  the quads and everything else 
there they are that blew it right there i need a schedule what time is it thats the real time 03 13 28 56 cml  30  were here
okay is our inlet temperature of the radiator  and the outlet  flight plan
let me have  al you want to start on the h2o2 purge and if youll give me the tool  
ill get it
  tool e ill go start the water dump
ail right turn it off im watching the waste right now
turn off potable  
now ill dump the potable  potable too
dump a potable closed
hold on
whoo man is it dumping whee
purge the fuel cells 03 13 29 42 imp theres bound to be some somewhere  in the flight plan  
look at that thing spray out of the side of the spacecraft i never saw  look at that that is propulsive too
you better believe it
sure it is
gum anyone
yes please
im sure this books from somewhere  probably up there
how come you dont 
you ought to  some faster than that you sleeping
your 02 purge
huh what 02 purge 03 13 30 b1 cmp why did the flow go high
i aint through
huh
its not down there
thats closed
had a water 
yes  day 4 page 101
well why would that make it go high
 switches momentarily
cabin pressures okay
cant give any reason for that  are pretty shook up too
well why is it high right now i know water dump i bet you
you got to push it to oxygen to pressurize 
no afterwards prepare the ship for us
no they say your   
 told me 
you got to keep the  in condition
 for your return trip home you see 03 13 31 26  what good would it do if i had a stoppedup nose none
where the hell is my  
boy that thing is propulsive
which ways it going  its going out  
right out that way right out that way
its radial  its radial for that its perpen dicular to the xaxis but its going out about 45 degrees here
here dick
 can see it better from this window dick take a peak out of that there
whats waste water
h2 coming on
okay
through the supply valve
okay yes
knew there was something i hadnt done
 when you get this shit in here
its hard to work in a  with all that other stuff
have we picked up the moon yet
no
i thought it was the moon  possible  radar okay h2 off
fuel cell i has been purged  are you going to go for 2
yes i think ill go to 2 
thats the first time i could notice chlorine in the water
i never did
i havent either
boy i can right now  i can right now
wonder why
 little  purge 
probably getting ahead of the chlorination
yes
like building up a chlorine content
might  you get that one side 
you know its over 
singing
 03 13 39 27  no its not  now he opened that last little vent like a bunny
sure does
potable open potables open
 thats never going to stay there dick
okay another 
gosh isnt that nice oh god damn there it is  the moon
funny · 03 13 41 18 lmp wait until you see it out of our window
whatd you do right there music freight train
okay goldstone 2 
number 3
h2 master alarm
you really think that moons all the same color huh
i dont know but it looks it to me
no theres some  white  look at some  look at some of the slopes see if they dont look a  gray as the others do
it looks a whole lot whiter over here even in the shadow look at that shadow down there would you look in the shadowsl theyre something
theres some mighty healthy craters down there
wow you 
very big  very big ones
christ were iow over here again
matter of fact there we are right were  no were not at our low point were exactly 180 de grees from the  from the  the landing site
look at those mountains dick god dmn 03 13 43 39 cml yes
58  i wonder if that  degrees is right in my loi 
wow look at those mountains
look at that row of craters right there
yes but thats not craters you know what that is
those are vent tubes
yes
vent holes
yes
hey we ought to get a picture of that i havent seen anything like that before 03 13 44 24 cml give me the camera  the camera
hey whats the right setting here
what was our time  day 4 page 105
what time were we supposed to do that tell me what time it was and ill write it down up here
hurry up pete or ill miss it
okay 180 degrees  180degree point at 8531 13  
give me the setting al
f4
at what 1250th
always yes
can you get that string of vent tubes  get all of that stuff if you can
whatever happened to that  here it is
pete if youll write the time down over here for each rev then well have it out and we wont have to look back tell him to  it here
853116 aos is 52  7 minutes you still watch ing the fuel cell purge
yes theyre getting a little thicker here
weve got to get tei 5 block data map update and then that right there dick does it p52 man thats not bad i never saw pictures like that from the moon
theyre all purged and they all look good theyre all balanced  
can you come up a little al
can it pick them up any
i swear its a different color over here dick i dont think the fact that youre looking at it this way  makes any difference
it looks lighter to me t
sure as hell does
theres a lot of slumping in that crater
well i had just decided  when we were looking straight down we were going so goddamned slow i just figured we were going to fall into the moon
01d you know that has got to be old old old old
it looks just like it was when it was made too
singing
i  physically youd really want to land on the back side look at either that  either a crater or mountain sticking up z dont know whether its a crater or rim or what right on the horizon
probably a crater rim i would guess
what do you see down there al
you look through this one  it looks like the optics are going like this music those were the days
damn its bright down there give me a camera al and tell me the settings
okay
is it on the right settings
i cant tell  there you go
its 250 millimeters same settings
you can go to f8 if you want it was right on the borderline a while ago 03 lb 51 41 cdr gee but this is spectacular back here i was photographing that new crater thats got a mountain in the middle of it see it 03 13 51 45 lm yes i see i dont know which one it is
hows the tracking coming dick
good
good
easy
is it really
yes
is it easy to find the one you want
thats the trick thats the trick
damn windows really make me mad
isnt it the truth sickening
its really sickening
got aos
hello hou   time skip
actually were  its kind of interesting dick and a1 and i have really switched over to this time schedule and were quite happy on it we  were not really aware of the fact that its the middle of the night back there
man is that good cold water now whooo
thats the good kind 03 15 15 37 cml how did it get cold
i just drank long enough to start getting it out of that tank you know emptied the line its cold now isnt that cold
 p40
and we have not maneuvered is that right 03 15 16 23 cml we have
we have
wait a minute
hows the gas economy doing dick 03 15 16 35 omp i dont know not too well im afraid i let this thing get away a couple of times from me
okay weve got ullage on here we havent had ullage before how many seconds
nineteen seconds
thats whats going to cost the gas pal did you pick b and d to do the ullage on just twojet huh
yes
we lost thetm  right on schedule we get them back again at 8801
are those the high gains we use
high gain  we should be at minus 71 and 206
8801  look at that god were so much on the nominal flight plan i cant believe it
keep it up
8801 it has msfn acq and thats spectacular would you believe that
the burn was 4 seconds off loi 1
yes but that 4 seconds just made up for the whole  what was different in the trajectory it put us back in the right place i guess thats phenomenal  day 4  page 109 03 15 18 33 cml where are we  39 from the burn
how are we coming out just like you said  at 1700 pounds on the helium huh
that was the big one now it doesnt go down so fast 03 15 19 09 cml ive got blowdown capability now dont i
oh yes
we have blowdown from what
i think it was a fairly big number
they are putting us in a different orbit though
are they
well theyre putting  
 by 54 and were showing about 65 by 53  i mile
singing
dadadadum dadeedledede theres old cassiopeia
you got dse motion al
yes
all right i just forgot to ask
 hell out if  do
theres aldebaran right straight ahead 03 15 22 15 cml there you go
menkar
man look at the  wow
 im going to look out this window this is by far the best window 0h theres orion
yes right over here
i cant figure out where rigel 
there it is
okay
whats this bright one down here kind of to the right
mars theres canopus
i dont see canopus
its over here its over on this corner down south of orion  theres one with a big  
man that docking target is bright
dick lets see how bright it is
you could dock on that son of a bitch at night with no strain
i know those little  god dog that things bright those little things on the handrails are just that bright
twentysix minutes
all right
yes
59 
okay you did the verb 49 and you have trimmed huh
no
huh
i havent trimmed in roll
you havent trimmed in roll okay
weve done the sextant star check lets take her down to 8 minutes  day 4 page i
let me check my circuit breakers first
okay
yes this is much better
wheres the flight plan
right there what do you need
ail right give me the trim  firing
oh
 plus  1 foot
trim x to 1 foot otherwise you just take what you get
i dont see any trim needed not the way this beautys performing
gee i hope the  performs this well
you know they made a gross tactical error they should have rigged the lm up so the csm power could power the imu and you could bring the imu up enroute and align the goddarn thing you know maybe get a good drift check on it and all that crap
okay all my circuit breakers and everything look good
do you always take the radio with you and cut the rest of us out
yes therest of us would like to hear it a little bit
you dont like this son laughter its an a1 bean song
well let you listen to  whatever the cats name is
got to watch the end of it got to rewind we ought to shut down you want to shut down
cant we hear your song
thatthe end of it w wmw l
we cant hear your song huh
you want to hear it lets hear it again huh laughter you dont like it i know laughter its got to be loud to be enjoyed
lets hear your song

yes i think weve got everything in order
if they put this in  if they made up a hollywood movie just like this you wouldnt believe   
what do you mean
listening to this music on the back side of the moon
thats right laughter
whats the matter  
 thats so flashy and    03 15 28 24 cml   you got something against music
no im just saying that  
nobody would buy it this is corny cornball youve got to be hard out there
say the biggest thing i missed on gemini v was not having any music every once in a while theyd pipe some up over hf but  our old nickeldime tape recorder there id have given my right arm for it
whats the burn time
burn time is 17 seconds  
what  we going to come on with it   03 15 29 02 cmzp thats interesting it says burn time plus 1 second and if the engine performs like it did the last time its going to shut down about  on time thats too sh burn not for us to n ice it
theyve probably got a handle on it
they may have yes hey you know weve an awful hot engine and that very  you know we may get  if this engine stays like this we very well may get 24 hours knocked off our translunar coast  
oh that would be nice
oh im sure it will
that had to be an extra hot engine to save the propellant to do it 1
yes why dont you rewind it right now then were in good shape
okay after the burns over we can have a little more music
i like the kind of ship you run  happy
laughter
keep the sailors happy  give them exactly what they want
we sure have
laughter
ill be glad when you shave that fu manchu  off your face laughter
yes thats terrible
doesnt it look good i might keep it now that i hear that comment
you wouldnt like it if you saw yourself go look at yourself
its too iow it needs to be shorter
if its that repulsive i ought to wear it
pete there isnt enough there to even see it

hell yes 03 15 31 26 cml how about the backside sand go play in the sand on the back side
laughter yes lets take the lm down and land on the back side wouldnt that shake them up laughter
we could do our old doi burn an hour later we saw something on the back side that mas a little more interesting than the front side
look at that the glycol pumps back down again
yes that baby really cycles it
so far dick i imagine we havent stabilized yet its got up to 55
what time is it how much time we got for the burn
seventeen minutes
okay
play that music just before reentry and get us in the proper frame of mind we could get it out and play it coming down in the chutes
wouldnt that be cool
yes were here houston listening to a little music as we come down in the chutes everything in chickieboo  wheres the ship laughter we could drive them crazy with that stuff
we ought to get 
singing
singing
fifteen minutes
boy that would just put the frost on the cake you know that
what a 24hour return
yes knock 24 hours off the return boy  
just think of that
how much more deltav do we need to do it
a thousand   
we got enough right now  we got enough right now but we didnt have the reserves for midcourse we were within say 1 percent of running it out of gas so  
were not  on the sps for the midcourse anyway are we  day 4  page 117 03 15 35 12 imp we might  
i think for some disperse cases they got to   dont know what the reason is but i can tell you out 3f my  because it said we had to have a  it said  had enough to do it right now but we had zero reserves for midcourse and it said  you know if we had a particularly good engine they uldnt plan on it and it said  you know nobody usually has that good an engine it sounds like this engines pretty good  most engines have been overburning you know
historically here we can shut down 6 seconds early that baby had to really flat be honking
you know our gdc seems to  did you just align that thing or something 03 1536 10 cmp not too bad when youre standing still 03 15 36 13 i24p yes i wonder what the rotation is

i dont understand
give me the water gun pete if you got any  a  few moments while were talking about things i could go for another grink

i copy about 5 degrees sun angle right there dont i right back theres going to be about 5 degrees r sun angle god damn its going to stand out those shadows are going to be sharp as hell  day 5 page 191
they are  a lot more sharper than the simulator arent they
we could  wherever that is you know
the trouble is theres a lot of other   yes i think youre going to find it dont  dont de that youre liable to get amongst them again that worries me a little bit
well probably be better off targeted right to the crater
huh
probably better off targeted right to the crater
thats right
if we got any error were going to be long any how
if its good and low we can really burn it up and just float along
you know weve got one hell of an inclination to the sun will you look at that  inclination angle of those shadows
yes beautiful going to make it nice to see in
i hope so i wish i could see what im  were 60 miles how big do you suppose those craters are down there how many meters across the goddamn thing it must be kilometers
well we ought to be able to see ours just past this  lets see our sun time 
if we pull this off we could be slicker than owlshit
its driving me buggy i just dont know what im going to see when i pitch over take a look and im going to say ahhhhhhhx there it is im going to say oh freeze it i dont recognize nothing laughter then im in deep yogurt then if i dgntrecognize anything im just going to let it keep going thats the best i can do
thats right
if you dont recognize a thing ill look  just tell me  ill look out my side 
yes yes
  and you look at the computer for a few seconds and let me see if i see anything out there what altitude now 60 miles and its pretty damn high and youll 
thats that  thats that crater vent tube
isnt that fantastic
hey and thats going to be in the dark  not too long after 
thats ridiculous howd we ever get here anyway
laughter
why would a guy want to put his ass on the line like this
laughter
bet you those prunes are going to lay in my stomach like a rock
god dan  dmn i hate you water bag look at that
thats a deep crater that great big one there
oh yes
the one thats a hole with all that tucked in
yes yes
you know i think thats something that the scientists just didnt really realize at all is  day 5 page 193 that the moon has been relatively untouched for billions of years
look at that fantastic freaker right here 04 05 43 i8 cmp  must have been like  
wow
  to be around here one of the interesting places is over there  i wish i had taken some pictures  where all the craters were kind of  look like where you shoot balls into mud you know  
yes yes
  they made angles but they didnt  they never b
yes sir anything like that  
  they didnt look  nothing  looked real weird
they got the idea just like you said that that stuff caved in while it was still molten
do you have a wet pack in the lm
for dinner

no you can only have one wet pack i dont know i dont remember
ail you  
yes you got one
good grief 
oh just got a vent tube
al right down in here j
yes
yes they got to be  they got to be volcanic but look how crude this got
yes that stone is like you say billions and billions of years hey are we maneuvering
what
funny sort of looked like we were
120 degrees roll
okay man thats strange must have been just the way the crater was
weve got quite an inclination to the front dont we
now look at these little tiny vent tubes thats what they got to be down there they make them look like  
yes i see the little dots 04 05 5 24 cmp yes and it makes them look like 
theyre birds that run across the sand
yes
 that down theres got  thats got to be volcanic
how small a crater can you resolve with your eyes from 60 miles

now which way are we doing it 04 0742 56 lmp put orange to orange on both see now that one clamp has a little orangetoorange dot and then the circular has an orangetoorange dot the best thing to do is take it over by the window because otherwise youll never guess it in a million years stick this thine in the hole and youve got  
what are you doing to  here
what i  i cant remember it either let me do the orange one though ill rig this and you just go over  i dont know whether it sits on  this one or the side one i never can remember but ill fix this where it works okay that goes there and this color tv one goes  orange to orange now that should be pretty close but when you stick it over there you may find out it needs to be on that bracket im not for sure which okay and take this with you and put it right by  in the tsb good

hey what  
i  i dont know
i  ive got some of those actifed  
thats great it says decongestant  
ive got some of those antihistamines somewhere
 aspirin  aspirin tablets
you got some  pete
 enable power off 0mni 
hey did we ever chlorinate the water last night we did didnt we
no we didnt
did you do it the last couple of nights
i did it the night before last
okay
wonder what this decongestant has 
it clears your head
magazine r the great magazine magazine r  
well shit ill let them figure out on the ground i got a cold i aint going to tell them ill tell them i took the pill  cdr took one  
 65  
  decongestant or 10 or whatever it is
165 okay im just going to put this back
how did i get the worlds greatest cold on the moon for christs sake
because you had the worlds greatest lmp with you at the moon
who had a cold and i kept bullshitting houston and saying aw  its just stuffy up here
thats the way to play it though
and a1 bean was  thats right thats the way i got to play it right now ill tell them i took the decongestant but i aint got a cold like  sneeze nothing let them figure that
how come youre taking 24 minutes to track it and im only taking 8 minutes of pictures
 tracking
im just reading this shit right here
oh its six frames a second 112 magazines 24 minutes of film thats why hes doing it
whats he telling you oh is that what hes trying  try one of those 
well i dont see why  
so you know how much film you got how long it will last how many minutes
   must be at least six frames must be at least  in there and somebody will want to know it so 
i guess so they dont know what the assignment is and what they do they want to let you know what the film capability is okay ill get on with the film now
are we on the back side of the moon yet
yes 06 18 15 42 cml were in the dark
can i dump
no were in  were aos
los 06 18 15 54 irfp  sound
oh shit i keep forgetting to get my rag for these goddamned pissers
hey what the hell difference does it make to those guys where you dump
they can see it on their msfn data 06 18 16 05 cml well what  
well  
maybe they want to  
tell me what difference it makes
ail right when you come out on the front side they pick you up and they track you all the way across and they can project ahead okay if you dump on the back side you  pop at it just like pdi and youre not where youre supposed to be o6 18 16 20 omp so
they  then  then they have your error right there theyd know what the error was you put in apparently it doesnt do that it just freaks up the way their processers work if you  
i think thats what it does
  disturb it during their tracking  
 point  
    the main thing is that the proeesser assumes that youre not making any deltav if you make it on the back side  
yes thats right
  it can accouat for it
youre right thats right lets forget all about it
 good way 
they donrt need that information
oh yes what they  what they  
going home
oh well thats what  why they want that informat ion
going home
thats why they really need it  
they  they start that long range  
   midcourse or something
we could burn this  
  long range
 tei pad to rev 43   
wouldnt that fool the shit out of them come whistling out from behind the moon and say well  06 18 17 20  i want  here  
what
how many

that already  shit you guys could be doing that while im tracking
hell yes
yes yes
theres nothing there
besides we can he  in fact its early
could do  
what the hell are they going to give you  a nogo
you could do those pretei system checks right now
thats right whats it going to do if you got a bad system you want to go home more laughter that s ridiculous
laughter you know its really funny we just    06 18 50 12  were nogo for tei  
  the ecs system is nogo for tei
itll work in lunar orbit but it wont get you home
well get it
oh check that  give me 4 minutes
one burn
ail you need is 4 minutes yes well get a dividend out of it
herschel
herschel thats right freak you know whats going to happen dont you gordon ill make a prediction
theyll probably name it herschel
not only that not only that but they are going to look at the freaking high rev photography of herschel and they are going to make some great discovery
thats right  
  
theyre also going to decide to land there or something  
  just like when we photographed the wrong freaking star that  that  that whatshisname told us to  he says i know i can find those two stars why dont we get the other in the wrong attitude no he said thats where we go uv in that spectrum region of the stars and that  if they dont call highhanded statements for christs sake  
did you really
yes 
i read all of his reports too it didnt say anything about us photographing the wrong one
oh is that right
i couldnt see and dick was standing outside because hell with all those  you know you turn the camera on and off
oh here comes the sunshine off to my window  pane
ill tell you that onesixth g was really great and you need a goddamned  with you if youre standing on the floor and you want to go sit on the engine cover you just go whistle hum  
the things you couldnt reach  you  you know  and that plss  
youd just go  
  didnt that plss feel great
  youd just go whistle and grab it and youd fall right back down gently a1 would say hand me my plss and youd reach over and youd pick that  
one hand  
  son of a bitch up like  laughter
hey ill tell you what we need with that plss on and your suit on you were better than just your suit on in one g didnt you think so
oh yes oh yes  
freak you can run and  
you know me i hate to run shit thats all i was  did was  
you cant walk up there you got to run theres no way you can walk and you have to botmce you land flatfooted like this you see you cant bend your knees so you land flatfooted like this and you go boing
thats why your plss comes in handy 06 18 52 52 kmp yes and so then you  so that means you can take turns but you have to have your center of gravity over your  over your foot so you end up going  rocking from side to side its real funny you go like this  way over because when you come down youll  
 go bong bong  
  center of gravity and  and its fun you can run up hills and everything else
except i noticed we didnt get too speedy coming up out of that surveyor crater
yes because  because we kept running on the edge we didnt just hit one we  you cant  we all  heres how we were running coming out of that surveyor crater you cant do that so it just took one high bounce to get us up  high  if you dont go up all the way on it coming down 
thats too bad that cottonpicking tv didnt work after all that effort
hey ill say it is id have loved to show them that surveyor we could have pointed at it   that surveyor
we could have pointed out the alsep too because even at 400 feet it looks like youre  
yes
  standing over there
yes
they could probably have seen that whole alsep thing when they found a1 bean freaked it up oh
heard you freaked up
oh you didnt freak it up
im telling you i suspect i did i  
no   06 18 54 26 imp   cant figure out it ever did anything else
al you didnt do it god damn it
there aint nothing i could do  if i did
if you  if you did they sure as shit didnt give you adequate warning that  they  they should know that the lm structures are too bright for that sun light and they should have told us christs sake i didnt  i  stopped down to f22 i would have thought you could have shown it on anything except directly into the sun
well well have to see what happened
im really  i got the lunar crud i really do i 
hey make sure that thing is stopped down the low setting is 22 the high setting is 22 and you cant tell the difference hardly i never saw the freaking camera
i dont know what they had it set on for  course  
probably 22
theoretically i was in the shadow you know
thats right because if i had it on 22 
i got to get the gimbal angles on that  man i yawed that bastard around about 35 degrees i pitched i rolled i was really wheeling and dealing
hey there they come
bey there we go
you know what itll turn out to be i yawed 5 degrees and rolled 5 degrees
thats  probable
exactly 06 18 56 13  god this is weird 06 18 56 15 cml isnt that a speetaeular sight that sunrise
its unreal
like its a different world
if you saw that in the movies you would say god thats fakey thats just what i saw as we were burning loi
i think you can see what i saw out the window if you get real close to this its about as big as a  except it was black it was real funny it looked like that moon  it looked like that moon was right outside that window but it was just black   06 18 56 55 ip   
pdi havent i showed you i mean not pdi but  when  when dick had us on the nose
oh yes
and when you were sitting sideways  i could see all these stars out that window and all of a sudden it just was black in fact it was like that  thing  its like somebody in the simulator put a  a  and they had had a  one that was too small  you know the  the sphere was too small
thats exactly what i think its not but 70 degrees over the flight path
hey look at that crater over there pete
wait where
look at that son of a bitch i ought to take some views of that  both sides it looks like a little copernicus see
yes look at that

 flight plan 
yes i need  other charts here
trade places with you i need to go over 
you can have the middle
oh okay
got to have the 
hey we ought to get some pictures inside this son of a bitch we havent got any
a whole roll

fra mauro
fra mauro that youre not doing anything
you cant do it   you really cant
no way
hey you can get it  
heres fra mauro its got to be on here maybe somehow it just didnt  that thing looks pretty good
the thing that keeps us happy a little is that little white one thats way around on the  side but when i checked it a minute ago she was jumping 60 to 62  
wait a minute now where is it
wheres what
theres 190 on this roll thats onethird of the way right

you know what ive been marking
what 06 20 32 21 cml herschel
okay i bet herschel is on here and i bet the first part of  
descartes

could be
because i dont remember  i cant honestly say i went around there and looked at this number
 all on here
hang on there you son of a bitch
whose is this
 watch it  go on around
i dont think i even dismounted it to see those  i know i didnt take 60 pictures of herschel pete did you have anything on your camera before
not a thing
youve got to have part of it at least some of it  maybe youve got all of it
i dont want any more
 get it
 up there could have stopped in the middle i guess okay
where you going to be working
right there
wait a second 
ill tell you what i do remember  one time in the middle of the first one i looked back  like 
no thats probably all right
 under the couch
but i didnt have time to keep checking it at 6second intervals 
the smartest thing for me to do is crawl under the bilge down there and go to sleep for a couple of hours
why dont yo do it
thatll be good thatll let me move my  off the couch what do you want 
the way i feel 
whats our attitude going to be dick 06 20 37 30 cml 
 ought to be changed
some of these are far from 
dick
yes
where are those lines and ill get them out of your way
 06 20 38 16 cm got two revs   lets get ready
 the cryogenics
two revs of this 
 cryogenics 
 in orb rate 
yes  okay
theres no way to do that 
well you could have just  pretty soon
yes but i cant put that thing  intervalometer
okay now heres what ill do let me look and see what we got to do
use the 85millimeter lens on it
getting hairy out here too
125 is the  probably be  on that stereostrip you always use the same setting huh  attitude  fra mauro
you could probably  put the  on 
oh yes
yes i think i will
 zero phase  of which is 4 56ths let me  that would be  that would be  4 56ths
yes
 let me look at this  the object is to minimize  do that and we want to get the stuff out of the side too
okay heres what im going to do im going to shoot the 250 from the right side 
no i just want to see it
thats right 250  well probably write it down in here on 
okay 
get it out this window
yes 
 get it out of mine 
thats right ill have eight colored  second run ill just  okay that ought to get it all right there
 a little bit
oh well

 babe 
landmarks
oh look at that
look at that
 babe
 going to be all right
theres nothing else  
you can think about that on the way  
  
everything gets nearer and nearer  you know i think that had a lot to do with a lot of guys  when you get out here babe you 
 way off 
huh
i have were still in orb rate
yes that alignment stuff  looks okay still too early thats langrenus straight ahead
langrenus ought to be you get  hell thats  get the other one though   
yes
behind him is  though
yes
okay 
look at that earth look at that earth i cant believe that
what
that earth i just can hardly believe that 06 21 07 28 lp oh man ill tell you i wish i had those pictures more than anything the thing that reaily fouls you up is the    time skip
forty two mag f
yes this one has that
hell i dont ill get them
okay
okay jerry go ahead
okay these are the ones on page 3149
roger
the first one is charlie papa 1 ti is 1665123 1665629 north 02 well have the latlong in formation for you in a few minutes charlie papa 2 ti is 1670942 1671442 north 14 delta echo 1 1672246 1672743 north 02 foxtrot mike 1 167330  correction 32 1673832 north 12 over
roger we copied cpi 1665123 1665629 north 02 cp2 1670942 1671442 north 14 delta echo 1 1672246 1672743 2 north fm1  that sounds like an airplane  1673332 1673832 12 north over
thats  well have some other information 
i get the same landmarks with what im doing right now jerry
12 houston were going to take your noun 89s and convert that to your latlongs for this par ticular pass over
oh okay i see
apollo 12 houston
go ahead houston
roger on that p22 stuff i just passed up to you go ahead and use your flight plan latlongs and mark on the same figures you did on the previous pass
you understand that dick
yes yes
okay
i do i do i do
okay
okay jer understand well mark on the same thing as this pass here
whats that one fortytwo or 43 i never can remember fortytwo
fortytwo mag see how the numbers are counting out dick  theyre doing okay they dont usually go
okay the next thing  06 21 32 36 lmi three in a row big ones
were in 3 i want that to be right
hey houston apollo 12
go 12
roger do you want me to use the same latlong thats in the flight plan or the one that i just calculated for p227
dick use the ones in the flight plan not the noun 89s
okay thank you
 on the back side
what was that
remember to get that battery  on the back side
okay
ohhh damn these four are tough marks
what
houston 12
12 houston go
hey jerry have the boys check the  the  speed setting on that one that was a pretty bright target and i put the film on 160th i think it ought to be about 1125th will you check them on that
roger which target was that
this last one fra mauro 1
okay
its still pretty bright
okay dick while i have you sometime on the backside pass here i think you can expect to see the manifold pressure on the rcs quad c start to dis  decrease meaning that youve depleted your primary tank
okay
wed like you to switch to secondary on that quad only ail right
okay secondary on c only thank you i wont switch unless i see them de  
do that just when the manifold pressure starts to decrease  
thats what i was going to say i wont switch until i see it decrease
good show dick
12 houston go ahead we concur with you on your setting for fra mauro 06 21 44 30 cml3 okay ill make it 1125th on the next pass time skip
okeydokey
houston 12 06 22 10 tl cc go 12
okay a1 just put in a connent about starting these a little early i felt that i had to because that last mark the target is going out of sight thats because our field of view in the telescope isnt as much as it is in the sextant and i think wed better start a little bit earlier than 40 seconds after t2 and ive done that purposely any comments 06 22 11 48 c give me that camera please 
got it
yes just hand it back to me 
okay now you put  06 22 12 17  seemed like we 
 youd like  already  quad a  gdc 
huh
i think it probably needs to be in 
 color or black and white 
did you  them up
this is  other things to do 
huh
do you have 
 i keep holding on to the nose of this thing 
what
its the   the  it looked good hold this time skip
youve got black and white left 
thats what i said was weve got more black and white  
 that was 16 millimeter well just have to do it without 16 millimeter  they want the  with 16 millimeter and they want a bunch of photos youve got this running already its orb rate at we need is to get this stuff  go to optics but  broken  came apart
came unglued but i think i probably screwed up i think i probably opened it and didnt know it 06 22 33 35 lhp  a lot with these things
you couldnt get it back together though pete
no but that  you know i dont know anything about these things maybe if you got your film loaded it wont go back together and  i dont know about  
where did it come apart right here
no no no its when you move it  when you move it
oh on the side yes
 instead of the p22 06 22 34 08 crp i think that the p22 is the way to do it i really do
 stay another rev 
 stay another rev we ought to do that did you get latande the last rev
youre right lets do that
 stay for another rev
lets do that that would salvage the whole freaking thing and we would have it all on film 06 22 34 32 civ 
tell them we got to do that thats right  salvage the son of a bitch otherwise we could 
yes i think we ought to do  going to copy p22 and get the right edge 06 22 34 52 cd yes tell them we had a camera come apart up here 06 22 34 55 lp yes you know too damn it we can give them lalande we get two of them in one run and one of them in the last run like we were going to do   00 22 35 04 c  06 22 35 08 v  you are not reserving it   
 looked at that earlier and you said you couldnt do it 06 22 35 17 mp  no no  between fra mauro and descartes
thats right thats why you couldnt do it all  without  06 22 35 24  we already  lalande anyhow the last run right isnt that what the ground said 06 22 35 29 cip yes 06 22 35 30  i mean what did the ground say about the last one
 if we can do it 06 22 35 36  i think we ought to do it thats what  oe 22 35 42 i h are wo going to do the last one 06 22 35 h5 cm  get lalande o6 22 35 48 clp  sitting out there  have any batteries running j 22 35 52  i cant remember to find any of that stuff
shoot yes i cant find that first mark
is that right
well maybe we ought to get lalande  just get non and tell him to set up the attitude and the lighting  get the chance to run the computer 
got a p22
what were we going to do the last run  
you got to  got to  actually all we need to do is get 500 do  get all that stuff in the bag and well have everything there if we dont were not going to get the film done and we got to 
cp1 ill have it and then the other three and the third one and we got it all in one pan  weve done 130 cp1  and then  all that
let me ask you a question what was the elevation at acquisition of the others 06 22 41 36 cml there you go
about 500 
oh no no no it was 3 minutes prior to 
ail right now do we have enough time to try tp2
gee whiz yes
thats a good ide
now if you go tp1 and get a tp2 and in the meantime they give us a ti t2 for   thats that one again
we have 4 minutes to go until  5 minutes or so to get back in attitude and get the camera off the 
not only that but im  were not happy with not knowing where they added the first time anyway theres only one reason 
it doesnt make any difference when we leave the earth you can only get to earth in so many seconds every 24 hours its just like we had a 4hour launch window for leaving earth  land · sea
well let me get down here and start working ouch 06 22 48 07  cmp where the hells my flight plan
it never fails  magazines  spacecraft 
the only pictures of the flight a1 wanted were the ones of earthrise out of the lm and i went and left the freaking thing on the lunar surface
the only way to avoid  you can  06 2249 09 cdr tell me how this happened· im sitting here talking to dick and the goddamned thing came open
oh i cant do that  in a goddamned hurry
do we have optimum lighting on these things
no i guess not
these sides popped clear off it
that freaking camera is forever   06 22 53 44 lmi goddamned liftoff with that 16 millimeter was a great shot
thats right son of a bitch
i dont 
what  attitudes are we in dick
were right  we ought to be right 
thats where we are
if i could get those two revs worth and go home 
we had tei  at p30 thats a tough one
hows the earth
there it is hello earth man theres not much earth out there ill tell you that
four more days and there wont be
were behind about 3 degrees now
do you need the flight plan dick
not right at the moment i will shortly though
okay
hello houston yankee clipper
okay houston youre breaking up
come on get a good signal lets go
nothing we can do if we cant  on what we got
hes looking right down the  parallel to it right now well have to wait until we get out a little bit
roger loud and clear listen jerry ive got something real important for you we were taking some targetofopportunity photographs with the same film pack that we had the 500millimeter film on and without going into details right now ill tell you later when we have the time  that magazine back popped off and were not sure we didnt wipe out that film magazine now what we suggest is is that we dump the landmark tracking seeing as we got good ones last time on descartes and fra mauro and you pump us up another ti t2 for both of them and lets get some more 500 millimeter this pass on another magazine okay
okay
must be  that way   i forgot
huh 
feeling any better pete
huh 06 23 01 49  feel any better
i dont think theres anything wrong other than i have a cold and i get so goddamned tired i thought maybe id crawl down there and go to sleep for an hour
oh yes yes you cant sleep too well all you got was 
go houston
hooray
okay let me tell you what happened we  a1 was very careful to watch all the time we were taking the 500millimeter pictures to make sure that the camera was in fact running and he was watching the side opposite the counter which has got the little redandwhite wheel
is that right 
and and and  i mean he was watching the red and white to see if it was taking a picture and we noticed that we  after we got done all the 500millimeter stuff that  we knew we had taken approximately 100 pictures but the counter only read 60 and we kicked that around for quite a while and we finally concluded that because a1 had been watching that there was something wrong with the counter and we really had taken all the pictures so we decided that wed use up the rest of that film on targets of opportunity and while a1 was taking the pictures out the window the side of the magazine just popped off right out of nowhere for no reason and it opened up about oneeighth of an inch and al tried to jam it back on and he had to actually open the lock and put it back on
i never made it on i had to tape it on
oh he never did make it on so he taped it on and we dont know whether its light struck or not and we dont know why lt popped open but were surely suspicious we also dont know if it was only partially on to begin with or that we really did lose film so i think its best that we take a fresh magazine which we have and well get those pictures again
okay we agree theyre hustling
you write them down for me ill get this last control point
 attitude anyway
i dont know where they are  ordinarily these are  
weve got plenty of time
lets see now what i need to do were going to copy that part weve got him doing such a  get the lighting out of the back 
which one is this here
descartes fra mauro
f8 145 to  it ought to already be there
yes
theres that little thing that comes off
you know that p30 pad i used for a model dick where did it go
 did you give it to me
yes one of those loose ones
oh 
yes thats right i was thinking about that because you get a onerevlater tei output
weve already used up one tei 45 partial  i think well all be better off 
i think i might have i think i might have bothered that one instead of the other one theyre both the same i dont know shit i dont remember it but i was handling the camera 
dick gordon only tracked our side once damn it got us there

very small but theres no doubt who it was you know
i understand now why all those particles were going out in front of me you know i said every time i looked out the aot to the front or the sides  all the time these little particles  whoosh  man they looked like they were going  
just ridiculous 07 04 14 25 cml yes some of them looked like they didnt even have a trajectory they just   away as far as i could see whenever we jet   07 04 14 32   that spot    07 04 14 33 cp   whenever we jettison the i and you talked about that thing coming out the back thats the deflector that water boiler well those little particles of water go zingggg and shoot out that way see thats what i was seeing i knew that was what it was but i couldnt understand why it would come around the front
nonpropulsive venting 07 04 14 51 p  half of them out the back 07 04 14 56 cml i tell you another thing i think is fascinating youre up here without any motor you see yourself going like hell  i cant get used to that you  day 8  page 387 can go backwards and sideways  even going like hell you are waiting for the engine sound or something

okay thats it my good friends
yes
 the moon
all right let me tell you where the  to  to 
no here it is  to one  
the high gain is pitch minus 71 we got it huh no yaw ll
who 
you did
no i didnt 07 04 32 b9 lmp where
yaw was 11 sps midcourse
i dont see any reason for that
i dont either
osed to  times and it did t 07 04 32 57 imp  that lucky
 to get the seats to come out
laughter three days to work im not going to worry about it   07 04 33 12 i24p  best things there are why dont we break out the tv camera
tv starts at 55 and its now 33
all right why dont we do that
ail right good
how come i got all the water all over my feet 07 04 33 42 iamp it probably came off the  
what the hell spilled those
ill tell you what it came off

heres a1 beans pencil its always floating by its a floater intercept it now theres a  
tv huh
here ill help you rig this thing hold this  07 04 34 ll i24p why dont i hand it to you
all right 07 04 34 lb lmp and ill plug it in here and you can hand it  handle it there
ail right thats a good idea
that  needs to be wiped off by dick gordon 
 hes got the lens cover off
okay
okay you ought to be able to lock up on the high gain
right now
not now but as soon as we get  acq
what was the acq time
the acq times 4042
 out in daylight  burned quite a ways in the darkness didnt we
yes
hand me a cable 07 0 35 30 lmp okay im going to hand you  no cable
no when i hand you that maybe you can give me one end of it
okay
now well place  switch is off which it is 07 04 36 08 iamp  thing comes out of the top laughter
theres no doubt in your mind when that sps engine 
 isnt she its a lot like 
 a lot like 
really smooth
is that right did you see it light up you  get pushed backwards 07 04 36 25 imp really smooth 07 04 b6 28 cdr i guess a 100psi engine is so 
so reliable
its so reliable that below the state of the art that they could just take them 
thats why they have 100  
 use them
  100psi engine i guess
yes
wonder  wonder  wonder what the chamber pressure is on something like the si 07 04 36 50 i24p about 350 i bet you 
hey a1 bean do we have enough film to take a color shot of the moon
christ we ought to 07 04 37 01 imp as were leaving it

 are somebodys yours
 may be a1 beans
 stand by together
yes here slip this out of  07 04 39 18  felt like more than a half a g didnt it
wouldnt you say
i dont know these engines condition you for it in gemini  no im serious in gemini there was nothing except the agena that gave you any thrust vector and you never used it that much anyhow we been in and out of the gfield pretty good when we came down after 8 days we got up to about twotenths of a g and i thought i was pulling four gs  no shit
yes
so as soon as  then as soon gordo said one g you calibrate yourself and youre okay from there on
is that right
yes
 it somewhere
okay
there they are
clears throat hello houston apollo 12 enroute home clears throat weve got a burn status report for you the burn was on time burn time 2 plus ll   time skip
i was saying it was 180
sorry sorry
are we in auto
yes youre in auto
 for the cap cos sake
yes thats what i mean
are these the right numbers
yes i had a  there
it was wandering around in deadband and thats so indicative of 
here it comes 
00 the  the ags  get that stuff god damn it i dont care what anybody  
try 92
its going to take the scientists  pure scien tists and fly them youd better
 you better  at 
all that shit curdles my  you know me ill tell you id probably  and you shove the program up your ass
oh wait a minute pete im sorry god durn weve got a maneuver now
yes give me  give me the maneuver
knocking
god damn itl
were maneuvering 
90 31 
hook her in over here
youre out there all alone too arent you
i dont  i dont think  i dont think you and i will ever find ourselves so far out  where we were miles from that freaking lm and all by our selves in those  suits
im still nervous because i felt i could  i really thought about it besides i couldnt get nervous when i had to get the job done better to get with it
wheres my mike time skip
 that freaking cable i stumbled over that bastard i dont know how many times 07 21 15 01  it was laying flat on the ground too it wasnt 
 the dirt off your foot
yes thats right you have had to to see that when we get on that boat in that mqf well just sit down there and really list all that shit 07 21 15 25  i dont think 
well you see it was just like  how the hell  you going to think about it they wanted shit and i  had to put the rock box and the  colton  camera and the  the  those plusy gear pins now who is going to keep remembering to walk around the sband antenna so you dont stumble over the cable every freaking time  
we could have  it was saying flat  practiced it  foot on the ground  dragged your feet a lot
yes i thought skipping was better than  than anything else for some reason although when we were really going long distances i ran the way you recommended
i tell you id recommend that pogo to anybody that son of a bitch was just like  either of those pogos hey you could take that one we got and put a  a sdrbearing on the zaxis but other than that it runs the same way and you could get something  which is normally impossible 
 that alsep  alsep  down  nearly came unlocked  it not only had a hole in it but  handle 
yes the whole freaking deal broke  those bags are ridiculous and that teflon is terrible out there it broke
so did i
 another thing i could give a freaking  at least you could bend over it ive already said it several times over the radio which is a good place to say it
yes ive noticed that
you were raising hell about it while i was laughing my ass off you were really raising hell about some stupid device what the hell was it
the scale
oh i remember that yes
i was just laughing my ass  really laughing my ass off 07 21 18 56   or something   day 8 page 405
god damn i knew i was  i  i   had moved away the freaking water in the damn scale the thing thats so stupid about it is that theres no way you can feel that scale unless youre an ape nobody thought about that nobody thought about  thats number one because the scale itself · was so light there was no spring tension on it at all which is what happened it wouldnt zero out you see
you turn it all the way out and you still  
 heavier in onesixth g
yes
yes the spring was  the spring was heavier in onesixth g
and we  
 it up
we tore that son of a bitch apart and finally got it fixed god dmu
 the whole thing the   youre right that it was the spring weight
i say theres a lot of little things we did that they didnt think wed do
now first they said now if you tell us youre tired you dont have to weigh the water  all that shit  the whole freaking deal
oh shit 
 so i  off the 
yes you did
two or three 
yes
 somebody else 
i wished wed had a bb gun on that thing   07 21 20 41  no i wished we had a  
  we could shoot the shit out of any   07 21 20 44  pete if wed had to shoot  youdbe  hell out of  that was good  that thing was 
yes  
oh thats what i figured as a matter of fact i figured  i figured id break the son of a bitch open break that son of a bitch open and we were going to get that goddamn  out of there if it was the last freaking thing we did because i remember  but once you  you were the one who said it sometime along there you know if you dont get that rtg out thats the end of the alsep  we got long time to go  i said yes thats right
  
all the way up  i was all the way up 
 hotter  our 
i could be hotter
i was surprised to know it wasnt blowing
i never was aware of any temperature ever doing the rock boxes or anything 07 21 22 23  now 
yes that last rock box
the last rock box its a good thing i thought about that side brush down there or we would have never got that bastard closed
i mean 
yes
 bigger  we both had 
could you imagine what a lm  could you imagine what the lm would be like after 3 days of getting in and out of that thing twice a day
 reach over to the sides and get the  depress  just like that  get out real tight one time  cast off what we saw 
the only thing thats bothering me are all those engine you know jesus they were grinding to a halt 07 21 23 41  they sure were 
yes but you cant  you cant clean them com pletely probably you can wipe out what you can reach but you cant get down there in the   wasnt she something like  like i noticed the purge valve ail around  all around where they said   07 21 24 09 ip   
oh yes all right around the top 07 21 24 15 tp 
boy you could really smoke with that hammer up there did you see what you did to that 
beat the hell out of it and i cant understand now why  just drive it in  ground
i think  i think we must have been in different ground and i  i  i cant wait  
 never have gotten that  down  28 inches i had to  strain to pull the  down   
know whats going to happen
i ought to be a grat hmerer by now all bent out of shape
know whats going to happen
what
the freaking 28 inches of core tube is going to be all the same
thats right  you watch youll see it  but im not convinced we were at the right crater at all
i dont know where the bench crater was i really dont
it was that first one
 was the sun bothering you at all
not yet
go to free pete
go to free pete youre the free 07 21 26 00   about all last year  gives you a lot  got a lot of different things to do

 life  you know like  darn crater  i thought i saw that 
super dick super are you marking on the moon or is  
no  no the earth
god damn im still cold
how about that  how about this deal llke we  wonder if thatd put warm air in like we did with our suits getting around the secondary coolant loops  day 8 page 409
you have that cabin too cold laughter well consider it a malfunction and act accordingly
you looked already huh
oh god its cold
 primary glycol
turn it on pete
yes 
thatll make him mad
 cant understand why they couldnt cut down on it whenever 
i didnt quite understand that one either 07 21 29 33  never did use the 
oh man oh man  that first day i really was 
 i knew 
no cold
houston 12
dont thank too soon i dont  i dont 
oh we sure dont have  hey dick well never mind no we dont lets  lets get the high gain back i wonder what the  what angles were those
just a minute all right as soon as i get through with this maneuver ill tell you
those  guys ought to see that yes here
god it guess ill 
there you go  
  ive got to do that frigging series all over again
what
hold this 
houston 12
okay got a question for you
anybody got any suggestions down there on how we can warm up the cabin a little bit its getting a little cool in here can we go  do like we did on launch day or whatever it is and maybe run the secondary loop without any coolant on it or something time skip
okay you still with us yes tell him to press that and ill say that was three and i press on and ill do another trunnion bias you dont have to worry about it
now dickydicky
this freaking flight would have killed us 
control yourself control yourself
freak you

houston apollo 12
roger let me give you these angles on the gdc at this time okay roll 07225 pitch is 3524 yaw is 08155
maybe youll have to bypass
yes roger id like to get that other one later on before  leave this attitude
wait a minute  thats the glycol pump
no if they had a bypass valve or something on the  08 01 07 o1 cml what
on the glycol pump

got them turned  a1 has to  down to get them
 in gdc it will come back up i think  day 9 page 415
hey the antennas not on
doesnt seem to be 
yes but its not oscillating thats the thing because i said the signal strength drops off but the antenna is not oscillating
well the signal strength oscillates when the antenna is in the  but now whatshappened is the antenna is apparently driven off some amount and its just staying there
houston 12
it looks like what the antennas done now is driven to some position other than optimum and its just sitting there
its driven in the same angles you have it set here
yes youre dn right 
roger wide beam width get caught up  08 01 09 55 cml its down to 38 08 01 l0 ll  i got to let this darned zipper down time skip 08 01 39  cdr what did i do wrong the last time 08 01 39  cmp changed speeds on the tape recorder going to a high bit rate low bit rate youve got to change speeds for that turn it off change speeds and then back on again 08 01 40  cdr you got it

thats right
okay if its between 2 and 5 at doi plus 30 and rr confirms that pgns nogo do it nopdi plus 12 forget it youre going to have to copy these residuals down both of us do

okay let me see ive got a little chore to do here right
well planned pete
say again
i say that was well planned pete
yes just a couple of months with a lot of people lets see deploy the lec and the mesa  thats done im looking at my mobility eg shift i have the decided impression i dont want to move too rapidly but i can walk quite well that cra  the surveyor really is sitting on the side of a steep slope ill tell you that okay now ill work on my contingency sanple got to walk real careful al
okay
can you see me all right
not yet i need you  back of the window for c nfidentiaiiml
okay 04 19 2 40 lmp   check 019 24 41 cdr  move in a hurry
as you might suspect from some of the pictures neil brought back gang i have a  several small rocks sitting out in front of me that have a neat amount of dirt built up around them im not sure that my descent engine didnt blow them there but then again it may not have i have the contingency sample  
roger pete copy that is the dirt built up on the side closest to the lm
well let me  im going over to get my contin gency sample and ill get one of the rocks  in the sample and yes as a matter of fact it is built up on the side that  that the lm landed on let me get it well theres one scoop theres another with some more rocks in it wheel this dirts just like the onesixth g airplane al flies up in the air and you can just chase it around boy now ill tell you  you know this sun it  it really is  its just somebodys got a  a superbright spotlight heres another good looking rock whoops in the sample theres another rock i want to get in it
i think thats about enough dont you except theres one  one big rock thats too pretty to pass up no i  not be a hog it wont fit ill go over here and get this other one though
boy you sure lean forward pete
i lean forward i feel like im going to fall over in any direction
youre leaning about  
say houston one of the first things that i can see by golly is little glass beads i got a piece about a quarter of an inch in sight and im going to put it in the contingency sample bag if i can get it i got it am i really leaning over al
you sure are you  on earth youd fall over i believe
huh
on earth youd fall over leaning that far forward
but  it seems a little weird ill tell you its  dont think youre going to steam around here quite as fast as you thought you were
tell you your boots are digging in the soil quite a bit if you dont pick up your feet you really kick a  a load of dirt ahead of you your left foots got a big mound ahead of it right now that its just pushing along
uhoh do i hear a tone 04 19 28 21 i24p yes ive got an h20 a

go ahead
i didnt dig any crater at all al youve really got to watch your step down here
okay
look at all those good things in this mesa things that ive seen before didnt hardly stroke the gear at all and it looked like we were  looks like i landed just about vertical
just like neil and buzz said al you get on a little slope and you tend to keep on going
 fell over
would you believe it  the mesa is too low for once
al how does the feedwater look now
well its still got an a in there but im plenty cool i went back to minimum and im sitting here in minimum what do you think happened 0h 19 32 04 cc al we would like to watch it a little bit it could be instrumentation stand by

yes you really do begin to adapt you hop a little bit if you turn around and walk over to your right a little bit and look over that crater youre going to see our pal sitting there and thats one steep slope its on okay now what have you got all over your boot stop you picked up a piece of landing gear 
okay there you go

okay im going into  04 19 5 50 lm hey youve got to watch it in these cdows
yes you cant see what youre doing come over here where i am see that surveyor sitting there

beautiful pete
look at the descent engine it didnt even dig a hole okay
houston im need to process  
pete houston
go ahead houston
hey al
yes
i got to save this paper would you get  
pete will you give us status the  on the lm and also some comments on your boot penetration
okay my comments are exactly the same as neils in fact everytime i get down in one of these little craters i sink in a lot further id say our footsteps are sinking in 
what do you want to do with it
put it over by that ygear i think i cover that rock box with itlater remember last minute change and  pag1e36 tonfidenti
hey wait a minute you want 
oh  i think its pretty much the same as neil and buzz found dont you al
i do one thing ive noticed it seems to compact into a very shiny surface i guess the particles are very small and very cohesive so when you  every bootprint as you look at it it looks almost like getting a piece of rubber itself its so well defined and you cant see any grains in it or anything
al can you find  can you find the earth
wheres the earth
oh there it is i can see it hello there earth 04 19 54 31 p where is it
just look at the sband antenna and look up that way its right up there
ill have to back up a little
okay now  where did we all agree was the best place to deploy this sband  the ygear huh
yes a little bit further out
that ought to  heres a good spot hey i dont want to get too far away from the cable
whats the  whats the matter with right here
thats a good place
okay
point to earth
thats what it says confident
okay
im glad you didnt land back about 50 feet
thats what im saying buddy laughter 04 19 55 03  hey you can see some little shiny 
glass
right  glass in these rocks
yes i reported that
you can also see some pure glass if you look around you can jump up in the air 04 19 55 2 cdr hustle boy hustle we got a lot of work to do ive got to do my pans in 15  5 minutes here
okay im doing some useful work like getting that tv camera going
okay good idea
you really got to be careful when you go out of the light into the dark
yes okay
okay move position 20 feet and 10
hey i got a  this second thing wont come out hey give me a hand here 04 19 56 07  yes sir what can i do for you
this second sband thing wont deploy 04 19 56 11 lm2 well do you want me to pull or hold
on this
yes on this pull pull away from me
okay age138 confidentj
okay never mind forget it
you get it
no  i dont think its  let go let go
try a different 
i got it never mind
thats not right is it doesnt that thing have two sections to it
no never mind forget it lets go
hey houston does the inner mast  its just one piece huh 04 9 56 50 cc copy the question you want to know if the inner mast is one or two sections
yes it seems to me  im getting dumbdumb maybe it looks shorter than it used to look in practice for some reason i thought there was more than one section  
pete that inner mast should be two sections
  i think so you have to pull out this the top side  in the inside
move this tv over  cable over here by the front porch
okay do you know   04 19 57 2 lmp the tv is almost off
  you know it is significantly easier just to do anything here just like this arm motion is so simple because youre not fighting the rest of your weight like you are there in one g
ail set okay
laughter look at that that leg doesnt want to  go on down leg laughter icon fideni ii
okay lets get that tv out and show e rybody wait a minute lock inner mast lock cuter mast extend and lock brakes  weve done sgn remove thermal cover okay we want thermal cover
goodby
okay houston im going to move the tv camera now
roger al
hey its real nice moving around up here you dont seem to get tired you really hop like a bunny where oh where is earth there it is here is the tv and let me set this  pointing toward the sun thats bad point it here a minute dum de duradum dam dam dmn
theres that look at that go laughter 04 19 59 24 i hey red i was going to deploy this 20 feet and 10 but because of the sun being where it is were going to have to deploy it a little bit more toward the 2 oclock position i think that will be okay though that will give you a good shot right in here ill see if i can keep the sun from getting in the camera at all ill have to move it  hey am i  
al we have a pretty bright image on the tv could you either move or stop it down
okay im going to have to stop it down thats as far as it goes houston how does that look to you
no its still  still looks the same al why dont you try shifting the scene
okay im going  the problem is the lm is very reflective let me  i got two choices let me go over here further to the side and you check and see if it reflects too much and if it does ill have to go stick it in the shade and then maybe shine past the lm of course that makes it not be too good either but it may be the best we can do see how this looks to you houston pag1e40 confident day j
okay al and also you might t r the automatic light control to the outside
okay al watch 04 20 00 59  wait a sec let me go  
i got  
how does that look houston
still looks the same al
laughter man oh man did that thing deploy laughter
well ill tell you what let me do houston let me move it around here back so the back is to the sn and maybe thatll help maybe thats the way were going to have to do it
okay al go ahead
once we learn the trick here i think we can do it each time that may do it that may do it right there houston
al we havent seen any change at all why dont you go and take and put your glove in front of the lens but not over it to see whether we can get any change at all
what do you see now
still the same al weve got a very bright part  about 20 percent of the top and black on the bottom 04 20 02 13 lm well got any suggestions im pointing it in a nonbright area let me point it  
stand by al
i  got it pointed away from the sun here it may be ground problems i hope it is ail the con nections look good confidenti
hey al why dont you take a good close look at the lens and make sure its in the rigzt contgura tion 04 20 02 50  okay ive got it on at focus at infinity ive got the zoom at 30 or 40 or 50 ill put in 75 and i got the fstop at 22
roger al we copy
ive got it pointing exactly opposite of the sun here so 
al we see no change at all in the scene why dont you just give it a little tap it may be the color wheel is hung up
i put this antenna up 1 foot too close
hey houston it wont hurt if my plss antenna hits this sband antenna will it
stand by on that pete
pete thats no problem
okay
hey al
yes
come over here youre going to have to help me line up this antenna 04 20 04 51  ail right houston im going to leave the camera just pointed off in the distance if you get any ideas id be glad to work on it for you
roger al try and point it off where you dont get any reflectance into it and well be thinking about it here on the ground
okay the plug that runs right into the back of the tv its sort of a white plastic material and it looks like its cracked and mayje been melted a little bit it doesnt look ypical of that sort of connector pag e42  confident day

okay
another one 04 20 21 02 kmp wait 1
okay got you ob 20 21 18 lmp okay thats good
okay get back working while i go get my camera i got some pan shots and next the alsep and houston im down on min cooling
roger pete hows a1 doing 04 20 21 b8 cdr say again
is a1 doing all the work
no sir im headed out to do the pan photographs right now and with any luck at all well get back on the time line and complete what we need als taking shcts of the solar wind and itm hopping out here to the number 1 slot
boy you sure can move on this surface
roger
yes but watch it when  watch it when you hit a rock
okay go fll fll it is 1 2 3 now f8 4 5 6 7 
7
clipper you were broken up say again
who are you talking to
pete we have clipper both  and you both on the same air to ground clipper go ahead say again eonftdentia
roger clipper
1 2 3 4 5 6 
do you hear a little background noise pete kind of staticky and things
i keep hearing a whistle
thats what i hear okay
okay houston two of the pans are done
roger pete copy two pans al how was the lm inspection
im working on it right now
roger
taking a look at that surveyor al i should suspect we ought to be able to get there quite readily im going to head down there by the crater a little bit for this set of pans  whoops 
watch yourself its easy to slide
yes you can say that again i notice youve been over here havent you
yes 
i dont think this is going to show anything but ill give it a go
whats that
oh im trying to show the front gear here and how it went  how it planted itself but its not really  its not bright enough
give it a go though
uhoh
bad  to nfidenii j ay
i think my cameras 
this pad bounced
 your plus y bounced about pad diameter
thatd be an interesting picture there
al do you have any comments on the footpad inter action with the surface
yes i do actually we  petes pads went in a little bit further than did neils id say most of the pads are in about an inch and a half to two and it sort of looked like we were moving slightly forward and that pretty well killed off our leftright velocity when we touched down the righthand footpad seems to have bounced thatd be the plus y the righthandside one the others dont seem to have so it must have  maybe hit there first and rocked back and forth or something
roger al do you see anything on the surface from the dps
no i dont the surface under there  its kind of interesting  the surface under there is clean it doesnt have the loose dust particles that  as does the rest of the lunar surface about here it also has a number of small round dirt clods if you want that seem to be  off in a radial direction from underneath the skirt of the engine ill take a couple of pictures  good shots  just about 8 inches or so off the ground i think i can get a good one for you houston there we go
thank you al its a good description
say you can really move around out here houston that a mobile pogo ridge that weve got there and also that one in the centrifuge  man its just like this you can just run and bounce just like you can on that pogo its a real good training device iconfidenti
where are you al
im over here back  the back tee  i ready to  to start the alsep  when you are
okay i got the  and im coming around
ail right
okay houston i went back to intermediate cooling
roger we copy that
good idea say ive noticed when you get started moving down that way its sometimes hard to stop
yes hold on to this
ail right
were putting on our saddlebags now  
pete and al youre 1 plus 22 into the time line and youre running about 6 minutes behind nominal
were going to catch up right now  
were monitoring plss feedwater 2 as a determining parameter
okay houston well start catching up now weve kind of gotten over the initial checkout on how to walk and move around and maybe we got  we wont have any problems with this hardware like we did with the   04 20 31 08   here you go
  in the antenna
roger and were showing 2 plus 30 left in the eva
okay
okay pete your saddlebags on
all right lets go confidentiait
okay and were off to  the alsep 
no we ought to be able to move out with this thing
the lm exterior looks real good the lm exterior looks beautiful the whole way around real good shape  that doesnt look like it did the day we launched it
right
okay here we go pete 0hh up they go  one alsep there it is
there it is is right it is laying on the lunar surface better go to intermediate cooling get good and chilled down okay
hey its dusty isnt it youve got to go easy
you sure do 04 20 32 50 i4p here it comes
coming right up
hey thats about right
widen that out on the boom houston sure looks pretty
roger pete we copy
look at me pete its a good shot babe the lm and everythings reflected in your visor
lay her on the ground okay ill bring mine out
right out on the moon just like advertised
wait until i get this out of your way
okay
yankee clipper houston omni charlie 0mni charlie confidentiab
its going to look like  
say again
going to look like the back of the flightcrew training  in a minute
yes
okay that  there is coming closed uhoh ail right you can push that door

i dont know
hey al when i free this strap would you mind 
let me look pete i have one here let me get it out for you
thank you sir

okay thank you
yankee clipper houston high gain antenna pitch minus 13 yaw 225
hey houston do you hear this constant beeping in the background on the comm
thats affirmative
what is it
weve heard it now for about the past 45 minutes pag1e56 i confidential  5
thats right so have we what is it
intrepid weve tried to isolate it it appears as though its coming on the downlink where its coming from the lm
hey al
just a second
hey theres your lunar tools all set up for you fellow
okay
this alsefs doing okay
old chuck wetherred will be happy to know were throwing it up for him here thats all right
here you go now what do you need of these 04 20 39 08  i need anything youve got there you go  
good
  i need that tool
how about this you need that one
how about the  here let me put that on no no you put that in package 2 and ill pick that up later
its already in package 2
then one must be yours
okay okay i put that there oonfidential
excuse me pete ill move it over and plant it 04 20 39 6 cdr wait a minute
ail right
got to put this together right  wheres the arrow weve got to let down the cap while we wait
wait a minute here you go
okay
put this together 04 20 40 13 l35 houston were going to go ahead and put down the fuel cask right now and then ill take the fila ment out of it
roger al copy youre working with the fuel cask
wait wait wait wait wait
i knew it this is such a bad place to put it pete
huh
thats a bad place to put it oh 20 40 39 cdr yes 04 20 40 42 iap fuel cask comes down beautifully in position came down just right
oh i know what i have to do al and im standing here not doing it 158 ii confidentialg da5y
okay now you need to move the side on in
were moving right along houston were 
yankee clipper houston go to wide deadband
houston you can tog me for my first  on the moon 04 2041 35 cdr hey houston
something thats real interesting as we put out this alsep right  
pete go ahead
theres one thing thats pretty obvious as were setting out the components of the alsep here is i just hope that these thermal coatings dont have to stay as white as they are right now be cause theres just no way with all this dust theres just no possibility that  
you cannot get them a little bit dirty and  
little bit dirty isnt the word for it
i know it this  this  this  this  this is real  going to be a real problem i guess if thermally theyve got to maintain  everything that touches the ground picks it up this suit is about half dirty because the strap landed on it uhoh its a little dirty even on top of the fuel element there okay
wait just a minute now before you  get carried away ci nfidentia
al we copy your comments
 okay
i guess well just have to make allowances for things like that when we build them they sure are going to get dirty
okay im unlocking the cask dome right now it unlocks perfectly shaking it now and trying to get it off there you go
it came off beautifully put the tool and in the  dome aside
very nice
okay ill get out the cask removal tool
you can stand over there pete
okay ive got to  got to go back to min cooling im about to freeze to death
yes okay go ahead
yes oh
okay now start there you go
 in there
okay tighten up the locks 
hold it
 be chipped
there screw it all the way down that could make a guy mad you know it
yes
let me undo it a minute and try it a different way
yes
it can really get you mad houston a1 put the tool on screwed it all the way down and the fuel element would not come out of the can hes taking the tool off and hes working it again
roger pete we copy
you got any suggestions
 kind of surprised me there
come over and look
i tell you that worries me pete if i pull on it too hard theres a very delicate lock mechanism
better not push the pins in quite so far and wiggle it a little i just get the feeling that its hot and swelled in there or something doesnt want to come out
i can sure feel the heat though on my hands come out of there rascal
suppose its outgassed or something
say houston
 ahead
okay weve really got a problem i guess ive tried using different pins you know its got a threepin removal   04 20 h6 17 cdr dual onfideniaj
  so i tried using different pins in different holes that doesnt appear to haye any effect it operates  you know  everything operates just exactly like it does in the training mockups  and  up at ge the only problem is it just wont come out of the cask i am suspicious that its pulling in there or something and frictions hold ing it in but its such a delicate tool i really hate to  to pull on it too hard i believe what we can do pete  
hey ill be right with you
  go get that hmmer and bang on the side of it
no i got a better idea wheres the hammer
thats what i said
no no but i want to try and put the back end in under that lip there and pry her out let me go get the hammer be right back where did you put it
huh what hammers on the mesa
okay let me get the tool off its starting to warm up
okay
cant figure that out houston
hey now
look pete
huh
al when youre working on that try to make sure youve got the pins all the way in tighten up on it then you can try pushing down on it a little before you pull it out
okay dont  dont touch these these are  if these break off thats all she wrote confidentf it 5
yes i understand
and dont pound on anything thatll break
no no im not going to
okay well try it again
rotate and try it this way 04 20 48 16 lp prys in there just like you  going to do the job only it just doesnt do the job
oh man look at the dust fly
just a minute just  just a minute get those pins in here again
youre not getting those pins all the way in
theyre not in now because im lining them up just a damn minute now they are all the way in
theyre all the way in  not quite that bottom one down theres  now my recommendation would be pound on the cask 
yes
hey thats doing it give it a few more pounds got to be harder than that its going  its coming out
keep going
its coming out pound harder
keep going 
come on 
keep going baby that hammers a universal tool
you better believe it there you got it
got it got it houston confidenti i
laughter thats beautiful thats voo much
now i think ill put the  
well done troops
we got it babe it fits in the  
hey dont ever  dont ever come to the moon without a hammer
yankee clipper houston one minute to los
thats it pete
laughter
thats outstanding
laughter
make our move 
im ready  going
okay houston the fuel element is in the rtg i can feel it radiate heat already put your hand over here pete
thats amazing wait a minute  no
copied that al
no wait a minute al have you got it strapped around your boot let me look and see
okay
no youre all right
ail right
yes
boy this thermal coating doesnt mean a thing here 164 iconfidenta ay
yes that thing is really getting covered with dirt my gosh
i hope they made allowances for it
 do okay  
it doesnt look like its  let me look at that just a second
okay
its the right way
thats it
hey feel the heat off that machine thats amazing
1400 degrees
almost as hot as the sun
okay sure it is laughter
hey do me a favor
what do you need 
no go lower there you go you got it
okay okay let me go  scout  smoke over the area okay okay let me go  scout  smoke over the area okay
got everything you need
ail right theres no tv so i got the side  and the pickeruppers for the rocks
okay
okay lets go right off to that little mound over there how does that grab you
okay somethings wrong
whats the matter icon fidentjjljj
 the thing doesnt   okay okay pete were okay
pete we copy youve got the uht tongs and  pallet
were making our move houston 04 20 52 09  ahhh i can tell this is going to be work  out now take it easy
how long did you say our shadow was  the lms shadow 150 feet
no that isnt any 150 feet
stand by pete 0h 20 52 32 cdr take your time al im just going out  
thats what im saying whats the hurry we got it made
no im just going out to scout the area thats all
okay im going to set it down and rest
okay
go to intermittent cooling
 04 20 52 43  okay 04 20 52 53 l you know they ought to build this equipment for lunar operations some other color besides white
laughter
im going to go right up to the head crater i guess
well if youre going to do anything  
 let me move it move it some more got any directions you want me to go 4
well it looks to me like either the direction youre headed is good or the one a little bit more to the right youre going to  youre going to have to go far enough so we dont end up in one of the craters when we start to  deploy
okay
okay
but i want to go 10 degrees off our takeoff angle and i think im headed out about that way now
okay
you just stay back there and take your time ill go out here and scout the area
youre getting pretty far out
huh
getting pretty far out
im going to do a slow  
pete and al your lm shadow should be about 110 feet
okay im looking for  im dying to find out what this mound is over here anyhow al we got a very peculiar mound sticking up out of the ground houston that i want to go look at as a matter of fact i think ill go take a picture of it oh my 
look at how that lm is 
 is it
roger pete could you give us your position and distance with respect to the lm
wait 1
go ahead pete and do what youre doing petes about  id guess about 300 feet at 12 oclock tconfidenti hes in the bottom of a shallow crater vhat you probably see on your map its sort oa doublet okay
im headed to the righthand edge of the head crater
hey al heres a neat spot to put it out up here 04 20 55 15 l is it flat for a good piece
oh youd better believe it
okay well put that  its a good long ways away too it must be at least  what  500 feet from the lm
i dont know 04 20 55 26  600
its the worlds most peculiar  i got to photo graph this thing i cant imagine what it is a mound is sticking up and i cant imagine how it got there or what would make it i 04 20 55 44 lmp boy you can cover the ground on this lightweight  at onesixth g really move
i got to get them a stereo of this thing its really fantastic
hows our time line going houston
 sit here and really rest awhile
pete at 1 plus 48 into the eva youre looking good looks as though youre right on there if youve just about completed your traverse
we have houston yes yes now look al look over here were way out from the lm over here al
okay
see where im headed this great big flat area age168 jonfident day
thats a good  hey theres another one of those mounds over there
where hey youre right what do you suppose they are
i dont know houston  what they are theyre just sort of mounds look like  dont take this the wrong way it looks like a small volcano only its just about 4 feet high and its about  at the top its about 5 feet across and it then slopes from the top on down to the  level with the terrain and that  that diameter that circle  where it finally becomes level with the terrain is about 15 or 20 feet so it looks sort of like a small volcano theres a couple of them out here they look like they were formerly made out of mud or something
aflroger we copy is there any hole or central vent
i dont know im not  
i got to go over  well  well  
waii go look them over
   after we get the alsep out theres a couple of them here there was a  this is a  we couldnt ask for a better spot to put this alsep down 04 20 57 31 p no this is nice
 too
hey lot more rocks up here
listen theres a  we could play geologist for 2 days and never get any frther than we are right now seeing all different kinds of things
hey heres a different one
yes its really neat better than any  geology in houston laughter ctonfidential
im getting a quick pan of the area here to   down this alsep deployment  there you go ok 20 58 07 cdr okay man alive
tired
no im not so tired that handle you know when you carry this thing around in one g the alsep tends to hang down but you carry it around up here at onesixth g in particularly the rtg tends to rotate  and the whole pallet so in a few minutes youve got one up  kind of halfway up in the air and the other ones down by your left leg and you keep being afraid that this handles going to come undone it doesnt  your handle doesnt lock okay i have to almost  thats slick you know these neat little decals we got on here
yes
you cant hardly read them in the sunlight because they dont have enough contrast to them theyre so bright
okay lets move them
okay let me make sure now that were not going to run out into some holes
thats pretty good pete im going to move just a little bit further to the east  correction to the north so that i wont end up over in that hole to the side okay
ail right yes i think it would be a real good spot 04 20 59 49 i okay im  
awfully frustrating
now i think this is the spot pete right here f
you look and make sure now that were going to have a good place for everything age 70 onfident day
yes we will magnetometer can sit over there and the seismometer will sit on a good flat place although the trouble with the seismometer we dont have any good solid bedrock or anything to set it on all weve got is this  this dirt and i dont see any area around that has any rock
im afraid were just going to have to take what we can get on this seis  
roger al
you know this must be some thermal expansion or something im having a beck of a time getting this uht in this side it just flat wont go in there
well just pick it up with your hands i always handled the side with my hands
i cant bee bend down that far 04 21 00 52  okeydoke 
whered you go al
im right over here babe
oh youre miles away
yes i am i moved over here
oh son of a gun
i had to do it pete so that id have a good place for the side
okay theres a good spot looks good
al when you deploy that pse stool it would help if you tamp that ground down as well as you could before putting the stool down i i
im going to try to do that this  this ground is  is not  you know it doesnt get hard as you t move down a couple of inches  you can tamp it and thats what im plan to do but i dont know onfidentiat ii well just have to see what happens   im worried about it getting a thermal short myself
roger al 04 21 03 06 l boy ill tell you
man are you dirty
boy this sure  that alsep look at the alsep
i know
ridiculous
laughter 04 2103 18 lmp i remember how they took care of this white paint you had to have gloves to touch it

remember
yes laughter they got kind of a problem here
im going to have to do this myself ill have to do this backwards but its going to work right do me a favor pete

no before you do that come here a second would you please
yes but let me set it down
uhoh the top popped open

no not supposed to do that you can close it though before it gets any dirt in it you can just reach up there and close it
okay you better  you better do it for me  
 close it while im holding it  
okay
before we get any dirt on it
son of a gun why did that happen never saw it do it before
 we could still salvage that though
wait a minute the little  the little 
i see it i see it

thats   yes this wont  this wont hurt a thing yes wait a second
thats it you got it
but just dont touch that itll be okay
okay
didnt hurt a thing
let me just put this down here
okay
pete before you set the central station down for the final time would you also tamp that ground down it would help in keeping the dirt off of the thermally sensitive areas
oh i did it i did it laughter
you set it down
i set it down and it didnt fall over i cant believe it here i come what do you need al
use your tongs to hold this up a minute its a little hot and i dont want to touch it watch this
where are my tongs
right there in your  there you got them now if youll just hold it steady then i can do the rest there now thats good
thanks pete got it
okay ill go get the rest of the stuff over here where we at
okay ill work on getting these apart nfident l
okay take your time things coming out real well the name of the game is to get the alse here whee up to one crater and over another laughter
oh man
does that  does that look as good as it feels 04 21 07 53 i2mp it does hey ill tell you the way to do pete bend and rock from side to side as you run like that there you go
laughter
you really move better that way
here i come ready or not
houston im  im not kidding we are really getting dirty out here theres no way to handle all this equipment with all the dust on it every time you move something the dust flies and in this low gravity it really takes off goes way up in the air and then comes down and lands on you
how far do you estimate were from the lm 600 feet 700 feet 04 21 08 34 i24p at least
i think youre right 600 700 feet
way to do it
here i come do do dedum
dumdum dedum coming after the antenna mast
okay
okay let me plug this thing in pete
i cant get down low enough to get it off
ill get it for you if you cant 176 onfidentij
okay wait a minute let me move that dust cover for you
hows that strike you
okay just leave this latch  
hey im making a joke 
strikes me pretty good ill be tamping the dirt around this central station
okay going to have to design things with little legs on them or something so you can put them down and they stand off the soil laughter
if we had that suit we could bend over in wed have the job done by now
hey can you push down on this side of that 04 21 t0 27 cdr yes my biggest sweat is trying to bend over wait a minute ready get set push that on or not
i dont think so
i dont think so
no let me  let me look at it a second here we  here we are
which way do you want this 0 21 10 40 lmp under there right there
i had to really push that other one look at all that dust
okay now 
wait a second wait a second let me get it with you
 that got it didnt it
that did it now ctonfidentl4
that did it
now we wont touch the shorting button okay weve connected the rtg to the central station houston and were ready to go to work deploying the experiments
i got the antenna mast
ail right
dedum dedum dm
pete did you experience any difficulty with the dust cover on the side
it opened houston and we closed it again and we got no dirt on it fortunately
roger pete well done
okay let me tamp the dirt down underneath the central station hey easy does it  whoops laughter thats me
what happened
oh i started to walk away with the central station attached to the uht via the little gizzy okay
the rtgs down and cooking
okay im tamping the dirt here
okay
have i got it tamped pretty good look over where im tamping how am i doing pag1e78 iconfidenti da5y
looks good need a little bit more this way i think the problem with tamping pete it looks like every time you tamp as your foot comes up  you know it  
yes in tamping  
it redusts  it redusts the area
yes okay here we go al now take your u  u uht there  
move that
  and keep the side cable cleared
sounds good
ail right
a little bit
here she comes over she goes get it right down  no there you go hows that 04 21 13 08 lmi thats good
okay
ready to go to work
go have at it
okay well i got to  lets see ive got to get that solar wind huh
dont know when im going to do the 
i better 
houston how we doing on the time line
do you read me al onfidentta
sure do
hello houston how we doing on the me line
they may be talking to yankee clipper
al did you have a reading on the shorting amps
wait a minute ill get it hold the phone do you read me houston
sure do go ahead
okay i was asking you how we were doing on the time line
cant see that needle anywhere can you al
let me see it let me help you doesnt it show any amps
place is covered with dust
i know
pete and al at 2 hours and 7 minutes into the i eva youre about 5 minutes behind
okay
pull  hold me a little bit
wait a minute going back to min cooling what do you need
hold  hold me to look
oh okay 
i dont even see a needle in there pag1e80 tconfidentt i
i dont either thats whats bothering me its not reading zero and i dont see a needle
i dont even see a needle in there houston
yes okay lets quit screwing with it get on the time line
i dont know where it went
houston did you get our last comment
negative pete go ahead
we cant see a needle in the shorting amps any where its not at zero its not in sight
roger we copy go ahead
were not done for the mag  for the  seismom eters houston and ive sort of dug a little crater so that the  essentially the stool  the hole in the center of the stool has  is de  is de  has more clearance between it and the ground hopefully this will keep the side from  the ground at all going to try anyway
roger s al thats good go ahead
 the seismometer well see  well see how it works it looks like it might work i tamped it also in the  in the small crater there
okay ive got the solar wind deployed here okay just a minute
boy you really have to be careful of these cables dont you 04 21 18 40  hey it looks good looks good
okay after the solar wind i get an  check and im down to mincooling anyhow and it says lsm off load two boyd bolts wait a minute let me by whoops
okay now onfidentia 
say we have to be careful dont move sideways or backwards you just dont know whats there youve always got to move forwards
yes pete could you shove the central station this way a little bit
pete we copy an emu check
shove it
just move  just put your thing in the  in the holder and just move it over this way a little bit
im not sure i can do that but ill give it a try
watch it there you go
hows that for onefooted  ladeeda
pretty good
you make me knock my solar wind over im going to be mad at you
okay youre just  here let me give you a hand
make sure you  you hold it there
hey dont  dont touch that ive got a  one boyd bolt off it
arent you going to 
huh
want me to help you move it that way
no its got one boyd bolt out of that magnetometer
okay okay go ahead
what were doing it making a mess youd be better off  let me  listen can you  you  leave  leave it sit let me hold that you  you put that stool back here closer
okeydokey
am i over all the cables
okay
huh
no youre okay you got it
yes let me have it ail right
yes take your clip off
okay 04 21 20 33 i4p all right now you move your stool back
 a second
okay  your emu break
i am
i try to stay away from  thats a nice job on that solar wind
thank you youve got to be careful you dont kick dirt on them once we get them setting down i guess the way you could do it is have  have it in some sort of package  a package out on the dirt
what are you doing anyhow
well i had to get this  oh im sorry
here you go move it up right here where my foot prints are 04 21 21 21 i24p okay tconfidenii
there that a boy that a boy now dont  doing good there now kind of tamp it right around in there that a boy
 go off the central peak now lets see what happens if we set it right 
thats good
that looks like itd be okay doesnt it
yes
just a second let me do a couple of things do this  take  a little bit out of there
pull it over a little bit more and level it up
this doesnt  yes this doesnt need to he level okay thats got kind of a deeper hole there in the center
yes youre in good shape that doesnt have to level huh
no because the  the other one levels  this stool
okay push it down a little bit
okay thats a good idea
 it
looking good looking good
just give me the tongs and ill put them away
okay
get with it and ill start opening boyd bolts 04 21 22 50 imp thats going to do okay pete i 04 21 22 53 cdr thank you
yes onfidenti ii
ail right
 id whistle while i work i cant do it whistle oh yes i can
okay that seismometers right in position now heres hoping heres hoping nothing happens to it
looks real good al
yes it does it looks like its going to clear houston looks like digging that little hole might work setting up there nice now and it looks like maybe its not going to  down in the hole maybe  maybe we did it well have to see
roger al we concur it sounds like a good plan
whoops
isnt that something look at that
what just have to put a little dirt on it i guess
when i put out the skirt of this foil it doesnt want to lie down i guess because its been folded so long i guess i can just probably just put it out it acts almost like its got an electrostatic charge on it thats resisting the lunar surface im sure that isnt it
hey stop 1 second watch out dont  dont come across  dont  i know thats what i want you to do is come take it
okay
that cable isnt even unreeling see its per fect take it out there and set it that a boy
its right behind there you may   j i
there you go cidnfidentiaj
just trip it you might want to trip iz  trim it off that thing pete
trip it off what
its on that post
oh ail right i see what youre talking about
that shadows going to be just right looking okay
oh fiddledediddle come on
okay everything is going great but that whistle is driving me nuts bothering you
a little bit
okay oh darn it i cant  cant help but get dirt on this darn thing no matter how careful i am
i dont think theres a way pete i dont think theres a way but you got  if you got where you could  you put it out in a package and then your last step was  like the side over there it just deploys off the thermal wrapping your dirt protector and you end up with a nice clean experiment sitting there
how we doing on the time line houston
stand by pete
whooo laughter 02 21 27 10 iqp what happened
oh its just the way things pop off down here in onesixth g okay wont be long and ill get to my favorite task pointing the antenna
pete we show youre about 8 to 10 minutes behind but its no sweat youve got  you got lots of oxygen and feedwater well give you an update on the time remaining when you finish deploying the alsep pag1e86 onfident day 04 21 27 41 cdrlmp okay 04 21 27 42 l good looks like its going real good houston this seismometer im having a little trouble making the skirt lie down but other than that it looks good it doesnt want to just lay flat like it does on earth at one g it sort of wants to flip up again i guess its just because its got this memory in it from being folded so long and the forces to make it lie down arent too good
roger al you can make a twoman task out of that and put a little dirt around the outside edge to hold it down if you like
okay well i noticed that if i just  
you wont have any trouble getting any dirt on it will you
let me push this down thatll do it
okay pete let me level it up i think its pretty near level its lined up exactly east if i give it a couple of pushes
i got this feeling theres a couple of boyd bolts that arent undone here for some reason
thing looks level as can be to me
looks good
roger al copy you have the bubble centered
ill tell you an interesting thing about this bubble houston no its okay its okay
i am not happy here al im afraid something  one these boyd bolts is not undone and i dont understand why 04 21 29 55 l why one of them didnt do or what
well i dont know i havent the foggiest idea i thought all of them did nfential
looked like youre well ahead of the time
hey take your stick and kick a little dirt up on it right there
huh
take your stick and just put a little dirt on the edge just on the edge though not much uhoh i got some bad news
thats okay i wont do that anymore ats okay that skirtll stay down enough
okay thats  thats complete let me take a couple of pictures of it okay houston the passive seismic is down the alignment is exactly 90 degrees and im going to take a couple pictures of it here hey al
yes sir
i dont know whats the matter but something is
here it is
okay would you look and see if the lens on my camera looks clean wait a minute 04 21 31 11  there you got it made
no i dont either i dont know whats the matter
want me to hold down this partwhile you get that other bolt 
push  push  push that center down all right looks good
oops got it
very good
thats beautiful
hey its alive laughter cjnfidenttal
it sure wants to come up doesnt it whoo
that did it
thats beautiful
that did it
houston central stations up
roger copy central station up and 90 degrees on the pse gnomon
hey al
yes sir
never mind ill get you in a minute
dont ever move backwards laughter
hey were going to have to do a lot of  what did you do fall over
no
no
no but i just  i didnt come close even  its just that  i think something you want to follow as a rule  
but dont kick dirt on this  
im doing my best
 and the central station is not level
not too bad
get a good shot of it here pete
okay
okay ill take out the  the magnetometer onfidenti
central station went up so nice
al those are my last two boyd bolts
okay
im down in a little crater now houston and sure enough right in the bottom of the craters there is a lot more  a lot softer dust than up on the rim not much but its noticeable i dont think the sides are slippery at all i dont think its going to bother us going over to get our surveyor  about that distance pete
roger al we copy you on your way out with the lsm 04 21 34 36  thats right got it right in hand im out at the end of the line and im deploying the legs right now
roger
one antenna mast in place houston going back for the  my favorite thing
are you through with  you got all these other packing   
roger pete copy antenna mast in place and good luck
whatd you  
look at that pete
what
hey one of the fun things here houston is all these styrofoam packing blocks that come off  to  that are put on there to protect it during man  shipment or launch  when you take them off and throw them they really sail these things stay airborne up for 10 seconds maybe
got any more thoughts on our tv camera houston confidenial
pete pete
what
watch this
laughter
laughter try that on  hey i just threw something it hasnt hit the ground yet it must have gone up 300 feet boing
laughter stop playing and get to work laughter come on maybe theyll extend us until 412 hours i feel like i could stay out here all day
i know it  right there okay
pete weve been thinking on that camera and when you get back well have a test for you to run on it it looks as though part of its come back and were going to try and see what we can salvage
ok  okay
what do you think happened to it houston
al were not sure on that why dont you wait until you get back  wait until you get back at the lm and well work it out a bit and see if we can determine it
ail right
hey al
yes sir
gee thats nice gee thats weird laughter 04 21 37 11 ip laughter those arms on earth they just flop down in position here they dont even want to stay there they go
that thing hit the ground its still bouncing cionfidential
thats slick thats really slick boy i hope  i hope  
hello yankee clipper houston
you hope you hope
oh i was just thinking about something pete no way to keep these things clean im really worried about this white coating
lucky for me that the antenna head is almost level
i can see that this dot doesnt  doesnt seem hard to see
ill see what i can do with it there it is here it is i think right there right in the center center
yankee clipper houston
hello houston clipper here
dick the eva  eva is going pretty well theyre 212 hours into it and theyve got the alsep a good way deployed apparently both of them look as though they just crawled out of a coal bin other than that seems pretty much nominal
very good thank you 04 21 39 40 ip okay houston the magnetometers deployed its level and its pointed exactly east and the little black dot is right in the middle 
same  
roger al copy 04 21 39 57  same  main concern here theres just a lot of dust on top of the box and the electronics there just hope it doesnt bother it too much
roger al yankee clipper we have a map update for rev 19 pag1e92 cidnfidenti  day
rev 19 los 1184840 1191330 1193433
okay pete let me take a couple of pictures of this  04 21 40 56 cdr what are you mumbling about over there
well i just  i just dont  i dont like all that dirt on it dont know what we can do though theres no way to work around them the radiators got a little dirt on it and theres no way to dust it off and there is no way  ail you can do is tap it a little bit and hope some of it falls off and thats about it dont want to tap it too hard thats the best i can do
okay 04 2i 42 16 i2p okay okay ive deployed the side now pete
okay
its my last item
not my last one
okay
does the antenna look like its pointed at earth wait
it looks close
thats it
okay
do the side right now
got her
okay 04 21 43 32 imp okay i hope i dont tug on the station here as i come out pete
if that happens  jonfidenri
it all looks pretty level by the way your station does
yes
were nearing the end ill bet 04 21 44 21 imp im done
hows that 
now its just  laughter  they must have doubled the cable length on this ones
that does it 04 21 44 51 mp okay
youre at the end youre at the end
okay let me set it down and work on it right here
that does it old buddy
okay
okay now what do i want to do
 do like that does it
have you got the tongs
what
have you got the tongs were they with that box  or do i have them
youve probably got them on you
i do i cant see  no they werent with that box 04 21 45 50 imp we used them  theyre proboly by your central station
hey i got them on me confidentia j
okay
okay houston the antenna is up its aligned to 1644 and 525
we copy that pete you got the nominal align ment
that came out
side screen came out very nice okay
popped right out looks good
boy are you dirty im just as dirty dont much want to stay down okay that first shape i cant believe it
laughter theyve got to be kidding yes boy anytime you put anything springloaded on the moon youre in trouble laughter this screen has got sort of  you know  a spring to it
laughter
doesnt want to lie down much up here in this gravity
okay houston how long we been out
pete youve been out 2 plus 40 and the pacing one right now is al youre running around 20 minutes behind and when you can wed like an u check and if youd give us your 02 readings
okay my 02 reading is 50 percent and have you got anything for us havent heard too much from you
negative on that youre perking along real well and were following your progress it looks as though youre getting the job done
okay look  how you doing al
im doing good iconfidenti
okay
that little thing just doesnt want to z 
houston let me ask you a question can i push in the shorting amp thing
thats affirmative pete we understand youre not able to get a reading so go ahead and close it  
ail right it might  
and well stand by for a zero reading
  okay it might be fullscale high
hey youd better tell them i still havent put the side down
that doesnt make any difference does it
i dont know
its all connected its all connected does it make any difference houston
stand by
youre a bigarea litterbug you know that
i know it
pete wed like you to go ahead and get the full deployment down first before you depress the shorting amps
okay boy youre dirty all the way to you knees can i give you any help
sure could
all right here i come
and pete and al a comment on picture taking if you would try to document some of the dirt which youve  which has gotten over  all over the equipment if you would try to get closeups pag1e96 5 which will show the dirt we might have on thermally sensitive areas and also when you get done if you would take one or two extra pictures showing the alsep with the mounds that you described previously in the background thatll give us a good geometric reference
okay i did a pan 
hold it  hold that pete
i did a pan out here at the 
okay just a second now let me hold this end and you stretch that end out
okay i got it
go to the right thats it get the  get the coils out of it
which ways this thing head
its got to head away from  central station  away from everything probably ought to point right over there
okay 04 21 50 49 hmp but now i think if you kind of twirled it a couple times it would end up uncoiling that twist in the line there
thats right let me try it that way again
looks like it might be working thats good thats doing good okay let me take and set this thing down and its supposed to point to the earth this way thatll be good
got your ground wires wrapped around the leg
yes i know got it looks like its going to be okay
yankee clipper houston onfident
yankee clipper if youll give po0 and ccept well ship you up a state vector a target load and a refsmmat
okay hold on hold on dont tip over
roger
now wait a minute wait a minute
okay 04 21 51 h8 cdr i got it steadied
okay
there thats all right
just hold it there and twist it
watch it watch it watch it
okay im trying to
no your foots hung in it that a boy
that did it okay let me sneak it back on again okay
now what do you want
i want to put that lid back on there it would probably be best if we just left it off
i think it would be best if you left it alone
okay now if you hold it there while i  
 i got it i got it anchored
  because this is going to want to turn it over
yes i know
yankee clipper houston were coming up with a load age198 iconfidentirajj 
yes step on it
okay thats what i think i can do no
theyve got to be kidding about that cable ive been  they knew that thing was going to do that 04 21 52 51  there maybe thats better
come on this things making us run behind
i know it but i dont see any way to quickly  laught er
ail right now just a minute your foot thats better
okay make it turn  lets try it a couple more times i think if i hold it this way and use this tool i can probably set it  
hey its just like zero g everything floats up that babys going to nose dive into the dirt every time sure as im standing here that cables cleverly designed to make it do that
lets put it like this down like that 0 21 53 33 cdr dont fall over 04 21 53 35 imp okay theres no way
uhuh just  that a boy
that thing goes right in the dirt each time  
i know i know its going to do that its very frustrating turn it around and point it the other way see if itll  see if itll point out that way
ail right that might be good too okay
do  i knew that dingaling cable was going to make us spend hours trying to do that
laughter doesnt that make you mad i onfjdenti
yes i know  especially when you know its going to happen ok 21 54 12 lmp look why cant i set it like this you just let go of the side and come over and step on that thing
hey if this side falls over then im really going to he mad i got that thing firmly planted
just a minute wait wait hold  hold it hold her a minute okay get this just arranged thats it now step on it
i cant here  theres no way let go of the  let go of the string in your hand that a boy now bend 
its just  
 thats it push it in
ah we made it i hope lets push it real hard in there
okay
i think weve got it licked
that a boy easy does it
oh you  that thing just jumps right up
laughter
pete im just afraid that one  weve had it on this one
weve had it on that one all right
hey here it is here look i dont think it makes any difference if it  if it lays on its side as long as it points its aperture in the right place
yes 04 21 55 15  lets move it around here and just let it lay on its side yes it doesnt know  it doesnt know the difference lets just kind of lay it around lets turn it  now thatll be  thatll work that ll work
that work right there
al we concur with that go ahead
okay it looks like the only way this  this cable has just got too much spring for the  for the  the weight of the package and theres just no way okay pete let her go now let me level it no way
thats a shame what time is it anyhow let me get over here and get a big picture of this
pete youre 2 plus 48 into the eva
okay level this pete thats leveling good leveling real good
that american flag sure looks pretty back here next to the lm doesnt it the sband  looks like a model
yes i think thats going to do it for the side that was a tough one 
back off i got the picture
 you got a crosssun
no let me get  im just getting one from a distance here 
al copy you have the side deployed
yes everythings deployed im going to go get the shorting plug now houston
okay standing by

hey heres a rock theyll be glad to see in houston
good
its an interesting one it looks like a solid glass chunk  
oh yes
  shiny black material ive never seen anything like it before
lunar orbit plane change l spsgn 36733 minus 073 plus 051 119471254 minus o0115 plus 03496 minus all balls roll pitch and yaw all zeros 00625 plus 00573 03497 018 03371 05 0026 187

okay how long you going to let us stay out
pete youll be extended 30 minutes so youre out for a total of 4 hours
all right how much do we have
and it looks as though youre  okay youve got about 1 hour left and it looks as though were going to have to close off pretty much with the nominal plan and stand by we have some words on the traverse back
okay were standing over at the head crater
why dont we start picking up some rocks pete while we wait yes
yes yes yes
want to get a picture of that
sure do
let me get it set up
right
 and f8 okay there you go okay grab her up pete
pete and al two things wed like you to do on the traverse on the way back one is to get samples and some documentation of those mounds and secondly if you can get over to the 1000foot crater which is northwest of the alsep and get samples and documentation of that sample from there
1000foot crater
suppose thats where we are is that one  that one over there
you dont mean the head crater do you lets get some of this mound al
okay
its an interesting thing theres a little vent hole
negative well  if youre at head crater now well give you  well give you a radar vector stand by
 this way youre  youve already got pictures of the  this pete
yes at 15 feet im just taking it close up over here
okay take that at about  
go get the  look at this black rock here
okay wait let me get close  wait  wait uhoh that  that ruins it

pete houston the crater which we speak of is  pete the crater which we speak of is about 300 feet northwest of head crater
the head  oh  i see it yes you mean the great big one over here okay yes we can go over there
thats affirmative
we can go over these but thats the  
wait wait wait a minute
huh 04 22 10 08  try a piece of that
and pete and al well be  talking with yankee clipper giving him a maneuver pad for about the next 5 minutes 04 22 t0 16 cdr very good
let me see if i can chip some of that off pete with this get my tool here i know  you could work 6 or 7 hours here never bother you a bit  a bit 
right okay
im going to knock a piece of that off
mming you know ive got the feeling that when that crater was made it just threw out a big blob of dirt this is where it landed
yes
aint any that big pag2e08 iconfident day
hey youd almost  i wouldnt be surprised to find this is that microbreccia you havent got any  
hey let me get a picture let me get a picture of that one
okay thatll be a goodie
pete and al houston
go
go ahead
were trying to get a maneuver pad up to clipper hes having a hard time copying it with you talk ing in the background could you  could we have some silence for about  
okay
  for about 5 minutes while we get that p up okay well be right back with you
pete and al were back with you
okay
rogerroger were almost over to the 1000foot crater
roger
got  got about another 200 feet to go you can see these linear patterns quite frequently on the surface houston they are  seem to generally run from the north to the south and theyre just little lines theyre off in the dirt sometimes you see a large area  were in an area right now it looks like it had a fresh impact not too long ago
let me take a picture of this one pete this  
hey i got some neat  neat ones right here iconfidenti
okay looks like a secondary impact crater that occurred  recently
yes some of them do dont they
they do this one looks like fresh  doesnt have that old look like all the rest of these  
come on lets go
theres some of that  in the bottom of there
roger pete and al we copy that we show youre 3 hours and 7 minutes into it  into the eva and wed like you back to the lm to start the closeout in l0 minutes thats ad 3 plus 17
okay
holy christmas were going to have to smoke there houston
well were there now
yes were almost to the crater
thats affirmative
okay well  were not getting very many rocks by going this far but if thats what you want thats what you want run baby laughter
hey lets  when we start picking up lets try and get a larger sample  
hey look at  this looks like a brilliant spank lng fresh impact crater look at that little fellow huh
sure does doesnt he
yes lets get some rocks right here heres some here get some pictures first get some pictures of that crater and ill get some over there ill get this one right here age tonfident s

just a minute
okay now let me go over here and ill get one in stereo of this baby
okay
let me just leap over here a ways
houston were looking down into this big crater now and it looks rather old   
hey theres some bedrock on the bottom i think · here looks like big boulders
theres some big boulders that are resting inside the rim none on the rim like we see on a large crater thats further to the west by another 1000 feet but you dont see any outcroppings of rocks either that  you know  that we could look down and say well from the top of the rim down to about 20 feet or something then we come to the  the underlying rock but there is this rock thats very large an arms spread around were going to try to collect some of the samples
hey im going to get the  
we can get them here  
roger al we suggest that you hustle we show youre 3 hours  3 hours and 11 minutes and wed like you back there around 17  6 more minutes tconfidenti

look at that part number on the side of the tool
 that a few times kzonfidental4
say houston while hers putting the tool on its a very interesting thing there is a angular rock thats literally 6 inches from the engine exhaust skirt its just sitting on the  on the lunar surface and i really find it hard to believe that the engine exhaust couldnt blow that rock away its only about 312 inches by 312 inches and its not stuck in the ground its just sitting there loosely about 6 inches from the engine bell and of course the ground is blasted clean all the way around it and yet the engine exhaust blast didnt blow that rock away

pete were watching you down here in the seismic data  looks as though youre really thundering right by it

roger and were able to copy your rest and now that youre moving again
okay ail right houston the status is  oops im going to get dust in it the cover is off and its pointed up at the sky at about a 60degree angle

roger
theres the one on the sunny side 5 12 03 44 cdr man have z got the grapefruit rock of all grape fruit rocks its got to come home in the space craft itll never fit in the rock box okay houston ill tell you what im going to do im going to wind up at the right place at head crater and while im waiting for al ill roll a boulder for you okay houston im now looking at   0 12 04 09  sounds good pete 0 12 0k 18 cdr   that crater is   05 12 0 20 cc 0kam houston can you give us a mark when you roll over   35  0421 2dr yes i sure will that crater is by golly a rather steep crater  a lot steeper than it looks from out the lm its  confidential a
houston
yes go
im looking at the contrast chart in the sun and i can see all the different shades and ive taken a photo of it now look at the one in the shadow in the shadow i can see  well depends on how close i am if im within about 3 feet of it or  feet of it i can see all six shades ill take a picture here then ill back up
let me ask you a question houston how big a rock
pete houston i presume  whatevers a con venient size for you well check that out though
okay the other rocks that i was talking to you about are pretty well buried and theyre pretty large i dont think i could get one of them going
houston
roger we copy grapefruitsize or any size is fine 05 1205 47 cdr okay al are you standing still
ill stand still go ahead
okay im standing still houston on my mark theyre rolling 
mark
its starting down  hit hit hit hit now its just rolling roi1 roll roll still rolling roll roll roll  
roger pete weve got some jiggles that i can see here well get a reading on it for you
still rolling  still rolling very slowly still rolling and its stopped 
mark onfidentiai 6
stop
okay houston i looked  im looking at the con trast chart in the shadow and as i mentioned at 3 feet i can see all six if i back up maybe to 10 feet as long as i stand here a moment and adapt nv eyes i can see all six also now the thing that seems to have the biggest effect on it is how low the sun is the sun is high now and so i dont have to squint my eyes particularly looking in that direction yesterday looking into the same crater even though it wouldnt be any darker in there because the sun was there i could  i would never be able to adapt right now i can see all six marks and ive taken the photographs going to go out and do solar wind now 
i cant see a lot of difference in visibility 
roger al 05 12 07 26 l the only major difference ive noticed is the fact that when youre out here on these  this area if you look crosssun the moon appears one color if you look downsun its another if you look upsun its another but looking into shadows or anything else like that its pretty much the same as on earth
copy that al 05 12 07 58  okay ill take some pictures here of the solar wind for you 05 12 08 13 p it doesnt look as pronounced wrapped around the pole now that i get out here houston it  looks pretty much like yesterday just sort of i guess it was sort of an optical illusion from inside the spacecraft i took a couple of pictures of it but i dont think theres anything unusual going on there
roger al and pete if its convenient and you can find another rock there and give her a heave experiments sure would like to see another one confidenti ab
okay i was setting up my rock hole and all that  good things for the polarizing light and  say i was looking at a rock that has small crystals in it one of them is shining very very bright green like gingeralebottle green
okay al are you on your way
thats affirm im now making sure that everything is in the tool box  handtool carrier here
okay
im mounting them pretty firmly hey houston as i was working around the handtool carrier a moment ago the canvas bag came loose it took me about 2 minutes to put it back together again it came off the metal sides and it looks like those clips that hold it on are going to be com pletely inadequate and i expect that were going to have some trouble with it all day today we ought to think about fixing it before next time
roger al we copy that do you think once you put a little weight in it shell hold better
i dont know they dont  the  they dont seem to have a lot of friction on the sides there and the bag just floats around it it needs to be more firmly attached some way
okay
roger
al
yes sir
where are you
im just leaving the lm
okay
boy this handtool carrier is  is light and nice compared to carrying it around on earth i think rag2e80 confidential da6y its going to be  we might be able to just slip it right down inside the surveyor crater with us piece of cake okay i see you over there im on the way oh dont tell me you dingaling camera man
i can see anything  everything from finegrain basalt as i come running across the area here to  coarse  a few coarsegrain ones i see some  sort of light reddishgray colored rock that i would call  i dont know really what i would call it it looks almost like a granite but of course it probably isnt but it has the same sort of texture the individual components  constituents so to speak are crystals but it still has that same appearance theyll have a chance to examine one closer
roger al we copy that and pete can we give you any help with that camera
i got it going  just fine
roger
im taking the polarized pictures right now  but al when you get up to me if youll just stop upsun at 15 feet and take that shot of what im shooting at 11 15 two pictures one before one after 05 12 12 32 lr okay let me take something out of this crater hole pete its sort of unusual its got a lot of those little droplets on it those blips but  but the  the fragments in this crater looks different from  the others take a couple of quick pictures then ill be right with you
okay its all working out just fine
get me a stereopair of this good well use the tongs here and ill pick it up
its right exactly  this is a very small crater houston probably about 3 feet in diameter and looks like it was made at  not very fastmoving or energetic or heavy projectile yet right in confidential the middle of the hole is some of these glass covered rock fragments and on some of the other rocks that seemed to be rested in the hole im putting them all in a  sample bag 1 here i mean  some of the others dont have any coating on them at all im picking them up with the tongs but i cant tell how strong they are but they dont seem  they dont seem to hold together too well they seem kind of weak there you go now ill head on over where pete is
roger al we copy that if youre going to document that try to get some of the material around the glass as well as the glass itself
okay i want to  ill just get this as a bonus and i want to get over here to start working with pete as a team here just didnt want to have to try to remember where that was
roger
youre going to get a big surprise when you look into this head crater al its a beck of a lot deeper than it looks
okay
heres a nice white small crater  a white rim on it about a 5foot diameter one
ive been concentrating houston as i came walk ing over here to head crater to see if there were any possible changes in either texture slope color anything you could think of or anything that i could think of that would say to me that i was walking on a different surface than i was when i started and i cant  havent seen a thing yet it all looks the same  it all looks like its covered with this  black rock
slow up dont  dont  dont kick dust in the middle of my polarized picture area here
okay ill stop right here rage cqnfidential bay6
okay put the tool carrier down and get  get your upsun pictures you see where my footsteps are that rock thats half buried and the two rocks that ive turned over in my footsteps
yes
okay its 15 feet fll two shots  now youre not going to get the before unfortunately 05 12 15 4 lmp okay how about right  better have my shadow here or over there
no thats the pile right there see where my  see where i turned over the two rocks alongside the great big rock where my foot tracks are 05 12 15 56 l on yes way down there at the end
no right here ill walk over to it 05 12 16 02 p thats a good idea
right straight in front of me this rock pile right here 05 12 16 07  oh okay want me to shoot it from right here
yes and you arent 15 feet back up youre  feet 05 12 16 11 l ail right i sure will fifteen feet  okay it ought to be about fll
okay got those two got a couple of pictures there houston let me tell you what my camera reading is now and then we can try to keep up with it from time to time next time ill come over here by pete and well  
yes houston ive shot three  six  nine  12 15  15 pictures
copy 15 pete 05 12 17 oh cdr okay and on my mark im going to send a slightly smaller rock into the crater are you ready get set  confidentiab
mark
roger were watching
i didnt quite kick it hard enough wait 1 and ill do it again
and houston that sample bag that i put the fragments in that i memtioned earlier that i found in the bottom of that small crater
mark
thats sample bag 1d
copy your mark al or pete and 1d on that sample bag
you know its a funny thing houston in one sixth g these  even though slopes are steep and everything these rocks just dont want to go anywhere
okay pete i need you to  
roger pete we havent been able to pick it up on the pse here
okay that was too small a rock
  take the filter off the front of my camera would you
okay let me set this down
and you might want to take the  tools in a second
okay heres your camera filters off
okay thats it for the filter goodness that thing goes
okay okay ive got a rock over here
okay onfid tiii 6
at are we supposed to get here
we probably ought to come over here to the other side it looks the best and do a little trench and compare some of the soil profiles
okay they wanted it  look itve got an area right over here that looks like a good area to work in okay
these little white spatterlike craters it looks like theyre very fresh impact like that little one right there
yes thats a good idea
let me go over here theres three in a row and lets work this area a little bit which is the corner of head crater they wanted us to work
okay 05 12 19 11 l and we can work right here and up to the top of it 05 12 19 il cdr what  what corner is this 05 12 19 16 lm were in the northwest corner
okay 05 12 19 20 ia right as i indicated on the map
okay
okay now z dont want to get any dirt in this thing its pretty interesting
okay
a little secondary impact crater huh
okay you want me to step  down from here 05 12 19 32 12 no ill  ill get the crosssun
okay ill set this   confiden  t  day 6 page 285
well youve got to also got to be careful with this tool carrier houston did you want to put the gnomon in pete
oh yes let me have my tool
okay 05 12 19 6 cdr wait 1
heres your  grabber
grabber   at it
roger al we copy that comment and on the northwest rim were looking for two partial pans 05 21 t9 58 cdr okay thats  
ail right
well get them  in a little  
okay wait let me get my pictures pete
okay
let me get over here and get the gnomon and  a sample of this rock right here this rock is very  typical of all the fragments around here
okay
hey thats interesting look where you kicked got some lighter material there
boy sure did didnt i
yes thats interesting thats the first time weve seen that
in fact you know what it looks like here it looks like it may be this darker material  well i dont know  
im going to photograph that too let me get   cidnfidentia 6 05 12 20 2 cdr okay 05 12 20 h3 lvp   let me get this houston kind of interesting here pete walked across one edge of the rim here were about  oh 50 feet inside the  the upper rim and he happened to scrape an area there with his foot its a much lightercolored soil  
like cement
yes let me take 
get your picture
i got it
roer al
here let me get my bag pete you got to be careful with that handtool carrier itll fall over
right
its light and   05 12 21 2 cdr saple bag number 13 okay 05 12 21 27 llp oh
okay al let me photograph this thing and lets trench this whole area
okay
i dropped the gnomon in right here over my foot steps and the light soil versus the dark and we can trench there   05 12 21 23 l okam i just put it into 3d in just a second
3d al
okay
lets see five feet f8 1250th okay iconfidentia 
okay and let me get a picture of what youre doing
get the stereopair on i think
okay youre going to trench right there huh
yes let me get my shovel
okay
okay thats going to make an interesting shot what can i give you pete
i need the shovel
ail right ill hold the tool carrier while you grab at it got her
yes let me have the handle 05 12 22 38 p need the handle
wait a minute
can i get it
no
okay move over here where i can bag it better for you
okay
very interesting things about this side of the mountain  i mean this side of the crater  is that these boulders arent uniformly distributed around they all seem to be over here on the western side if you look over th eastern side or the north or south you can see some but theres quite a bit more over here on the west for some reason   
here you go a1  quit baloneying and help me 05 12 23 22 ep okay ra e jonfidential 6
roger al we copy that
okay 05 2 23 29 cdr look at that c5 12 23 30 l stick it right in there  
in that white soil with the brown huh
yes
there you go now let me trench it 05 12 23 37 lep okay
we get some photos of that
okay look you can see where you dug in that theres still some under you why dont you give me another scoop right in there 05 12 23 h cdr okay a good idea 05 12 23 h6 l theres not much in here okay ere pete digs up  sure enough right underneath the surface you find some much lighter gray  boy i dont exactly know why at this point and you can look around now and see several places where weve walked that the same things occurred we never have seen this at all  boy thats going to make a good picture pete never seen this at all on the area we were before hey that looks nice theres really quite a contrast there between the  
roger al we copy that you think it could be the sun angle 05 12 2l 25 l listen no not at all this is definitely a changeto light gray as you go down and the deeper pete goes  hes down about 4 inches now  it still remains this light gray its  this soil must be of a different makeup than that we were on outside the crater because we have to   iconfidential
say this is different than around the spacecraft because weve kicked up all kinds of stuff around the spacecraft and its all the same color  
top and bottom this is quite a bit different
but this soil looks like it 
i tell you what we should do here pete
what
why dont you dig deep  
deep
yes dig as deep as you can then get me a sample right out of the bottom because this will be something new ill put it in sample bag number 5d
kind of hard to get down in there  
al we copy 5d and would you give your location relative to the center of head crater specifi cally are you just on the west side of it where we have the triple crater 05 12 25 22 l we arent were on the northwest corner of it  
right where you told us to go houston
give me another shovelful there pete
roger you should be very close to that triple crater
triple crater well theres one crater right here  
theres a couple of craters right over the rim here were sort of  petes down now about  
thats not a good one al let me get another one   tfr4dnfidentiaili 6 c5 12 25 47 l   down about 6 inches and  looks just light gray down there now in the bag youll fnd theres some darker gray material that fell in off the side c5 12 25 59 cdi there you go
hey i want to  
lets throw this little rock in that i dug up from down deep 05 12 26 04 l is that a rock
yes sir
okay
get another sample bag 05 12 26 09 l ail right 05 12 26 0 cdr thats a good one because i dont want   05 12 26 i1 lmp well wait a minute let me get a picture of it first 05 12 26 il cdr i dug it u out of a hole its hard to keep this soil in the bag stereopair okay in bag d 05 12 26 30 l theres of course a little of the top soil mixed in because the sides collapsed angle of repose is about 85 degrees but  
the minute you bump the side it falls in 05 12 26 40 lmi   its not cohesive at all even though it  it seems to remain nearly vertical i guess its the low gravity hey thats a nice rock pete just handed me a rock from the bottom of the hole and its covered with gram i cant see  auything in it other than just the gray dirt covering soil covering let me get a final shot pete
okay onfiden 
okay thats good
okay as you move off pete every once in a while i can see some white but most of the time  hey you kicked over a rock that had a white bottom  quite a bit different than the top right behind you you might  you might want to take a picture of that its quite a bit dif ferent than those others
houston youre going to have to budget our time now how long do you want us to spend it  in head crater
because it looks like we could just spend all our time here if we wanted to  
thats whats bothering me we could do that any place right here on the moon
pete we show that youre 58 minutes into the eva and wed like to get you over to bench crater and leaving there something on the order of 1 plus 12 we can slip that a bit so we sug gest you finish up where you are  what youre doing there at head and move on
okay al wheres the map
got the map right here pete let you take a look at this
by the way this is the smartest idea we came up with houston this map just works great out here
okay let me take a picture of this rock im going  
this isnt going to show much
let me  let me use your shovel
ail right now im trying to find the triple craters theyre referring to 05 12 28 1 lmp kick it around  be right over   p ge nn ru  c5 12 28 5 cc pete that triple crater is just south of your present position and why dont you just go ahead and move on
okay i got you
okay now theres a good picture pete let me get that one d5 12 29 16 cdr okay now let me see which side is which 5 12 29 18 lmp teli weve got it turn over one of the rocks on the rim the bottom part of the rock is gray about a half of itl this rock happens to be about a 6ichdiameter rock ill give you stereo of it and the top is the same color as the  
wait a minute you got it in your shadow 05 12 29 35 lp i do take another one pete maybe you want it 05 12 29 h3 cdr even these rocks out in here  even the ones that are almost completely covered with the soil if i look at them i can see glints of crystals or something 05 12 29 51 lm2 yes every one of them
ail right let me have that 05 12 29 54 livp theres your tube 05 12 29 55 cd ail right were going to head for bench crater qf 35 12 29 o li okay now did we  we didnt get a pan view did we 05 12 30 c1 cdr oand im going to get it when i get to the triple craters which is right over here 05 12 30 05 l sounds good 05 12 30 o cdr they think theyre right over here i cant see them ive got to look over the hill 05 12 30 0 l ail right on fidenia tl
here they are ho ho ho
hey things are quite a bit lighter gray up here on the top of the hill
yes
the  were approaching  
oh look  look  at these craters al
boy
now houston do you want head crater  from triple craters is that what you want or do you want the triple craters
pete we suggest you just move on to bench  and a comment on that double core tube if you find a spot that looks soft go ahead and sink the double core tube
well do it at bench its really a shame houston  
roger
  we could  we could work out here for 8 or 9 hours the work is no strain at all
i took three quick pictures of triple craters houston
were not going to get to that other one  bench is it but that looks like a real interesting area in  on the far corner of bench al see all those big rocks some of them look as if they could be bedrock out of somewhere
im kind of wondering were passing up these here  and they got to be bedrock from somewhere we need to get a pretty largesized one here be fore we leave this area pete 05 12 31 5 cdr ill tell you what well do is ill stop right here and take a pan nfidentia 6 cj 12 31 49 lp 0kay jj 12 31 50 cdr hows that grab you 05 2 31 53 l because these rocks obviously came out of the crater because theyre scattered more uniformly around it theres a burch of them on the rim and theres not many far away we probably ought to grab a big one of them 05 12 32 0k cdr  4 05 12 32 05 l were moving  straight south now c5 12 32 15 i2 theres an interesting rock lets  hey thats all right lets get it 05 12 32 27 p let me reai your camera and you can read mine if you would help them out a bit down there 05 12 32 32 c lust a minute okay your camera right now is on 36 how about mine 05 12 32 39 lr thats 6 also c5 12 32 41 cdr okay move c5 12 32 42 lip did you copy that houston every crater you come    12 32 50 cc roger we got it al 05 12 32 51 l   every crater you come to and look in you see the glass beads move out of your way pete
okay now back to rocktaking settings 5 feet f 1250th okay ail right al where do you want to grab the sample here 05 12 33 18 l right here id like to grab that rock right there because s got kind of a sharp edge on it and all the rest of them are  i dont know its got kind of a  an oblique edge on it and you dont see many like that arouzld here 05 12 23 30 czr ich one you mean confidentia
this one right here this gray one it looks a little bit different than the rest
this one
no right there a little bit further  that one right there ill just grab it and put it in the box if we can pick t up
this one the big one
the big one
ho ho ho wait until i get the pictures
okay if we can do that we can just put it in the bag i think thats kind of a different  looking rock this rock is different houston  just in the way its shaped and its partly rounded and got some oblique angles on it maybe under all that dirt is something a little bit different
okay i got it
roger al we copy that
sorry
thats all right all right picking it up dont sweat
okay
that a boy we know you got the rock thats what counts 05 12 34 2 lmp okay
okay put it in the bag 05 12 34 28 i2p the thing that was giving it that unusual shape was the dirt that was adhering to it laughter nats okay well take it back with us
good rock  onfidentiat fige 290 day 6 io sa 6 ip and this is probably typical of the rocks around this crater houston so it will be a good sample for us 05 ii 3 51 l id say in the area were moving along now as we head south  is what do you say pete theres about 5 percent rocks c5 7  cc  something like th yes they go anywhere from 212 3 feet all the way down to small fragments 05  35 0a p thats right theres even one by you there thats 3 feet thats   look at the fillets around that rock j5 12 25 10 cdr look thats deep fillets    c5 12 35 1 lmp thats a beauty wait a minute id better stop and get that hold the tongs
okay lets do lets   jp o 35 15 h in fact maybe we san take it on two or three sides have to watch  the trouble is  there you go thats a  thats a good rock hey look at the pits in it too thats obviously been struck a lot by  meteoroids this is going to be a good rock houston its about 3 feet in diam eter about 2 feet thick  
got to back around it 05 12 25 33    wellrounded got a  lot of surface pits in it i can see the glitter  05 12 35 ho cdi i ot to hack off to 15 feet on this one 65 12 35 22 i2i okay
get a good stereosair 0 12 c 4 12c okay 55p sj 27 cdr eont want tc fall down in the crater behind me here 1 a minute cionfidential r day 6 page 297
dont back up  
roger al we copy that are you able to find any chips from that rock in the near vicinity
this is not unlike all the other rocks around here houston all the rocks are just about 
al did you get some off the far side  of that
yes lets get that thats a good idea ail the rocks weve been looking at houston in this area seem to be the same they seem to have a  the rock has got dirt built up on all sides of it all directions
sure does looks about equal too doesnt it
it looks about equal thats right very interest ing i dont know what the means of transport but its  its just built up around it
heres something here go ahead i want to look here for a second 05 12 36 34 l if you look real closely at the rock the surface of it is coarse pitted and theres some pits that are maybe even up to threeeighths of an inch in diameter on it however most of them are small it doesnt look like a basalt although the grains are too small for me to see anything  identify any specific one some of the pits have glass in it which is not too surprising and many of them dont thats about all we can say about that rock houston and thats typical of the  of the ones in this area
roger al could you give us a sample bag number and then press on 05 12 37 t8 lmp okay well we didnt take a sample there the couple that we did take a sample of previously are the same types so the last couple of samples have been of the same type rocks that were dis cussing  12 37 130 cdr okay houston im coming up on bench crater right now i loped off and left al and ill get you a pan in bench crater this looks like a very in teresting crater its different oh and i see some really different rocks  a big one hey that looks like bedrock gee what a craer wow oh boy hey al look at  come on over here 05 12 38 01 2 im corning 15 12 35 03 cdr ougiit to get some of this let me get some cans in there 0 12 35 10 cc sounds interesting al and pete sounds as though youre getting down to bedrock is that affirm 25 l 28 13 cdr yes they got to be bedrock and this one in the bottom is  as a matter of fact   c 12 38 19  oy theres some big fragments around here 251f 38 20 cdr   get the pictures it looks to me like stuff is melted in the bottom of it i  cant swear that but ill get you some pictures starting right now f8  b  i  fix okay let me go ever on the other  little bit here get you a good p 05 12 38 53  yes this rock looks pretty much the same from a distance houston c5 12 39 jo r yes theres   25 12 39 01 cdr soil
  we kicked out of this crater 05 12 39 03 p im just sorry you guys   05 12 39 oh cdr beautiful c 12 39 05 p   arent all here
at a fantastic sight al look in the bottom of that crater c5 12 39 10 4p ney look as that onf4 en1
do you think that stuff melted or what whats that look like to you
well it looks to me  those rocks look  what it looks to me like is weve got one of those central  little bitty central peaks you know  little rebound there like the  
yes but dont hey look melted on the top dont they look like theyve been  they were molten theyre not  theyre not completely jagged
no theyre not its hard to tell i noticed when i was looking at that rock back there up real close that it had been hit by meteoroids so much i guess it had given it a rounded appear ance something like those in the hole except theres a couple over there like you say that dont look that way we ought to grab one of these pieces of  
  me i want to cover the ground
okay im going to beat your 
you can baloney about it all day long in the lrl the name of the game is to get the business done
okay
one potato   potatoes theres another one
ail right
look at that baby that rock looks a little dif ferent 05 12 40 19  okay i dont think  dont think its going to fit lets put it in one of these bags itll fit in there pete
okay
its going to go in sample bag  4 i think its   confidential 6 iii 40 77 cfr come here you pesky booger c4 it might fit in there 0 12 40 23 i2 ch it wont fit in there pete that box is too big 3 12 46 dr lets just put it in here and we got a nice eicture of it so we can tell where its from   05 12 40 49 l4 thats a super rock i  b 50 cdr   why dont you pick up two or three others  little ones and put them in 64 here from that sme area here all this  all this stuff is from head crater   c 12 40 55 cc copy sample 64
  from   rock get some here that we took the picture of 05 12 2i 06 i2di yes wait a minute ci 12 41 07 cdr okay 0 12 1 10 i2 yes  dont think i got that in the picture 0j 12 41 12 cdr okay hay not have 05 22 4i 14 eip ney you notice that underneath this soil on the rim too its the light gray 05 12 1 9 cer look see that stuff over  lets go over to that corner and tfy to get a  break off a piece of that big rock hub 5 12 41 z i thats a good idea 512 41 25 cdr looks like bedrock to me 05 12 l1 27 i2f les dc that okay im putting 6 in there houston there are a couple of small rocks that we jusv picked up from the area weve been dis cussing it doesnt  i dont think they appeared in the photo but that wont make any difference its ou tspical of the other rocks around here gonfidentta
holy christmas whats this look at this al were kicking up the same sort of light gray
apparently on the rims here you get that light gray out in the  
no no look at this stuff 05 12 41 59  hey thats interesting
what do you suppose that is 05 12 42 02  hey we cant  heres something interesting houston hey it looks like a surface  what we got is what looks like kind of a semiburied rock hey theres a small piece of it over there to the left see it pete well be able to catch it and put it in the bag
yes
see that over there
yes
what it looks like is a  a buried rock not unlike the others around here except it appears to have some sort of coating on it thats very iridescent a lot of crystals shining in it  
ill tell you whats happened is it  it  its been laying in the ground and its been hit by another fragment
think so
yes look at the glass beads too theyre all over the place
i know 05 12 42 b8 cdr okay you want to  you want to catch that  
yes  
  piece over there and ill put it   confidenti 6
yes let me get the  let me get the  the sample of it
okay 05 12 42 44  ail right
sample in sample bag   the numbers
copy 7 and would you go ahead and give us some picture numbers also
okay well give you some in just a minute petes picking up a small piece of this rock maybe you could get a piece thats fractured right off the middle
thats what i wanted to do 05 12 43 06  okay let me get out of your way so you can see it let me hand you the scoop  there it is right there okay
its got an interesting coating on it its dif ferent from what weve seen maybe this is more newly exposed  struck 
is that all you want to put in that bag
listen hand me the scoop  
okay
  let me get some of those glass beads and stuff there  
ail right let me get you the scoop
okay how long have we been going houston
got it pete 1 plus 15
no more than that
pete we show youre 1 plus 14 into the eva and wed like you to move on from this crater at about 1 plus 27 if you could then go on down and take a look at the bedrock on the bench nfidenti
hey i  id better not put that in there thats what we wanted to show was the   05 12 44 01 dr okay
let me get you another sample bag
i hate to try and get down to the bottom of this fellow its awful steep
yes i dont think we want to do that
in fact i couldnt get down in there
lets forget that  
okay then hold off on that dont go ahead
but  but  but im going to get you 
negative on the request
  were trying to get you some of the bedrock it looks like its up in the lip here ail of it looks the same  on the edge houston
im working on it im working on it
its 8d
ridiculous pete
what happened to 1 2 3 4 5
laughter catch you another one okay what were putting in here now houston is some soil thats right next to the rock that we previously described in fact petes got a nice fragment of that rock thats going to end up in this bag too oh catch that one
oh  ooo
thats a beauty that thing is barely  a weak  it fractures right off  
laughter  confiden  6
youve got to get some control there babe youre overpowering it this onesixth g up here houston you lift something up in your scoop and when you stop the scoop it just keeps going up in the air
ill tong it laughter if i cant do it the other way
looked good though okay put that in the bag there you go
we need to put more samples per  in the bag 05 12 45 28  and theyre saying they cant hardly use those little ones
they wont fit in it any bigger 05 12 45 33  here ill get it
okay
thank you okay
okay lets go over here and get some of this good rock like bedrock to me
okay
looks a lot like the fragments weve been seeing laying all over the place but this stuff obvi ously  ill bet you we have a total of about 3 pounds of rocks right now
okay im with you
okay were going to have to grab some bigger  better ones
got to dip down in the side of the crater there see how it is going up and down  
yes  it would be  down  
boy this is interesting here i want to get this area right here and see if i cant sample it   onfidenti
good move
  if i dont fall down in the crater go thats a boy well this is different look at this al this is different well get some of this
okay
al houston over
go ahead houston
al wed like you to go to intermediate flow for a minute and a half well give you a call
okay whats the problem
were looking at a slightly lower than nominal feedwater pressure
okay been cooling real fine look at the glass all over those rocks
yes i need to 
i want to bring this back look at it
okay
here let me put this  put that in there
if you fall its going to fall
there you go
hold it
huh
let me get up here okay
watch it  it  youre going to 
okay now youre going to  im going to get a bunch of these 306 q4xtfiden 6
lets do lets get a bunch of them and then theyll  have any rocks to bring back
doing the best i can 05 12 48 o1  there you go theres a good one put that thing in here
oh
except im closing the bag but well make it work
i had to take that big piece right there  of it got spattered glass or something all over it 05 12 48 27  lets take it why dont we take a big piece of it and  sample bag  whats wrong with these sample bags whether theyre the  the round ones or the square ones or the flat ones theyre all the same size what you need are sample bags  little ones for these and some big ones for the bigger rocks okay 9b is the sample we just picked up and described houston
okay put this right in here pete
no wait a minute heres a better one
okay now we are working on sample bag  10b
10b wait for me
roger copy 10b and on your way out would you get that partial pan with a 75foot base line
well sure do that houston  
i already got the pan 05 12 49 18 imp well pete says hes already got it
got a stereo partial pan okay
roger
okay thats a good rock and that fills that one up qidnfiden
okay pete whats your next pleasure
i dont know what do you think houston
youre looking in good shape you can press on along the traverse over to sharp crater
okay
why dont you take your  oh you already got a snapshot of this didnt you pete
wait wait  sharp crater thats funny i cant locate it
here let me  let me  show you the map again
pete from your present position thats about 400 feet southwest
nice one 400 feet south  
  al its got to be over that hill right there
about right there
right here
okay lets try it
400 feet southwest
all right now we want to get the core tube and that gas sample and a bunch of good things right houston
thats affirmative pete all those good things at sharp crater
got to find it first
oh man i got to just  
al you can go ahead and put that diverter valve to your choice your feedwater pressures holding even looks as though its working well its slightly lower than nominal
okay houston
sharp crater where are you 05 12 51 13  got it pinpointed pete
no i cant find it
well were going in about the right direction
theres one right over here to  kind of more to your right trouble is im looking down zero phase you know and thats  there it is thats got to be it right there 05 12 51 32 limp hey i see it
boy theres big fragments out here
you can say that again
have you got the shovel
i sure do
good boy no thats not it either 05 12 51 50  why dont we stop here and look at the chart a little bit more closely
man does that iailook small back there ill tell you what id better get a tie anyhow look at the chart
okay
okay
okay
roger are you going to give us a backside sur vey at that point pete
yes ill make it a full pan so darn far out i might as well nftdientt
okay a full pan over when you get to sharp we show you are i plus 23 into the eva and were looking to leave sharp crater around i lus 51 so you got lots of time
we got to find sharp crater first
pete i kind of agree with you where is it
i dont know we should be right here i got a  how big is sharp crater
looks pretty small it looks to me to be about 30 meters
okay i got it its right here in front of me
okay
yes thats it
okay load box  
this has got to be sharp crater right here lets  well drive that double core tube in there
ail right
yes this has a nice white rim  a white rim on it in fact the rim of this looks pretty much like the area we kicked over on the previous craters im not sure this is sharp crater but its  lets use it anyway because its the only one out here
i know i can see  nothing out here darnedest thing ive ever saw
were estimating a diameter of sharp crater pete for about 40 feet 05 12 54 06  40 feet huh
al this may be it
this is it  its got to be it its got a nice raised rim on it pflrlrrklti aj
yes look at that
its raised up about  what do you say 2 feet this is the same color as all that subsurface material
its awful soft in here watch it
okay
holy christmas look at the bottom of that
say you know something houston
hey houston this crater looks like  
go ahead pete
  blast effect coming out of it looks like its got blast effects radial all around this has got to he fairly fresh to the  look at that al isnt that neat i  we might get some pictures of that
okay
i dont know what to set it on  74 i guess were not that far away
boy the  the rim is soft here isnt it
sure is
quite a bit softer than the otherswe  
but look at the radial spray pattern look at that i guess im supposed to drive the what  double core tube here or something
yes set that baby up look at that  skip
we got to dig a trench gas sample were out  
al wed like to get the trench site sample there and you can hold off on that double core tube until you get over to halo crater  0 nfid j
okay good were supposed to look wet for copernican rays here too
houston theres no way to tell the difference  from that that was there when  i mean right on the surface before the crater was formed theres no  theres no differentiation at all
lets see which sample do you want now
thats the  deep trench  
al were looking for the trench site sample that includes your environmental sample of trench and the gas analyses you can put in there too
okay well do the whole smash here for you
you want it right in the crater rim
thats what it says
okay i get it thats good
okay let me get out  
thats affirmative that would be perhaps the easiest and best place to do it and you can get that one core tube down in the bottom of the trench
yes yes yes
okay pete before you do that help  youre going to have to llft this up so that i can take the sample out
wait 1 okay ill be right with you
okay
you going to do it right there
yes lift it up and ill reach in there and grab the  put the  this will be the one for the soil here age onfidentha 6
hey one thing ive noticed houston carrying the  the tools and  but although your gloves  you dont feel any of the temperature here turns out nice and bright but its nice and cool in here except when youre carrying something metal like the handtool carrier or the shovel or something then your hand starts to get warm
could you  could you get out of the 
yes
could you just slide a little bit
okay let me slide right over here thats a new one
oh wait a minute ive got to do it over here
hey houston did you take a picture before al
pete go ahead
no
oh no  noth  nothing houston were okay
ill take one right now pete
good spot right there i believe
okay go ahead pete
dig in that stuff
wow
you could drive three core tubes down there
you sure could its soft
yes down about 8 inches
yes petes digging in the  digging a nice clean trench
wait wait wait wait let me get the trench pictures onfid t l
okay
and im in the wrong setting as usual  
okay al could we have some numbers along with those pictures
okay well have to give them to you houston weve been delinquent there fine gray very fine soll here
okay al okay im ready to  take  take  take a lo0k at my  whats the number 05 12 58 44 i okay youre on number 105
ow pa 3e14 cojtfnti 6
thats okay well ill trade cameras with you because youve been  okay
okay
ail right now what do you want to  want to do fill that with dirt and  and rocks
we sure do
huh
fill the big container with dirt
okay
be careful now  
pete we copy youre on 105
wait a minute wait the tools didnt go in
thats okay
that stuff is really funny now i cant see the trench and i know you cant
thats  that a boy yes lets get organized okay
yes
and when you get it in there try to tap it maybe it will come out  
you got to come  got to come this way 05 12 59 3h cdr okay
see whats happening is my arm is being turned by the cables there
there
maybe you could grab the handles closer to the thingamajig there   j nfiden 05 12 59 h7 cdr yes
  when you lift it up okay we need some more there you go wait a minute
there thats the game
wait a minute
thats the game
yes lost half of it that way
well you still need some more  there one more scoop ought to do it though ah thats soft laughter
watch yourself youre getting close to the crater
laughter 05 13 00 15 i24p you get about 10 percent in there  
 now
want to do more or is that good
okay laughter
one more and youll make it
laughter 05 13 00 32  that soil  ill just have to  there isnt anything holding it together it takes me back in my childhood when i just  you know you wanted to fling things in every direction laughter 
okay thats it bags full now let me put the lid on
im sorry but i laughter dropped this  for the core tube
okay can i help you with that wait wait wait wait age tconft 6
yes why dont you ill hold this and you get the lid
right here 05 13 00 59 iac okay
let go i got it okay you put the lid on
ail right heres the lid
boy
right on the top houston this dirt came from about 8 inches down wait a minute  
copied eight inches down and whats the sample bag number on that
this is the deep trench sample in the  doesnt fit right there  ail right  okay  okay on this now lower it
isnt that ridiculous 05 13 01 h4 laip done this a million times
im just jamming on it its not sliding
i just made  i know now you hold it nice and tight
ill tell you whats the matter that thing  youre getting  getting friction wait wait hold her tight
here ill get it
here you go
you got it
no oil suppose youre getting some vacuum welding huh 05 13 02 15 i24p no thats okay c nfidenti
thats it put her down tight
a little bit more
go ahead thats a boy
will you snap the top on
okay
thats a good top in that one hold on dont let go good
okay now you need a core tube in the bottom of that trench is that right houston okay the tubes here  
thats affirmative and al when you get a chance can we get your photo numbers
thats right  50 and this is core tube num ber 2
core tube 2 and ill need the  there you go ought to be a good place pete relatively fresh stuff here
yes youd better believe it very good okay
this kind of  you could almost drive it with out a hammer but if youll hand it to me ill get  
just a second i want to take a couple more shots of this before we leave 05 13 03 21lmp there okay
theyre all in ill get the pictures
all right
its driving in real easy houston
go on just drive her all the way i cant lean down too far now
roger pag3e18 jonfide 6 05 13 03 38  and were driving it all the way in pretty easy
that a boy wait 1 stop thats it
okay just a second lets put this up let me take a picture of it pete  make sure we got it documented
lets do
theres the stereopictures
okay
ail right this dirts gotten on my camera and i cant see the settings anymore im going to have to do something about that
okay you ready to put the top on this core tube
youd better believe it
okay here we come i hope that soil stays in there
see if it did
probably did because it stayed in your scoop so well
youd better believe it its full
okay
come over here with it
ail right there you go better
good sample
yes it is a good sample
there you go
ah got the cap on the can
that a boy
okay just a minute hunch got it
careful  
okay
  put the scoop back on all right and ill stow it
okay houston what else do you want here just a little environmental sample
okay we show you should have gotten in the trench site sample the core tube samples from the end  from the bottom and also the gas analysis sample
okay we need some little rock fragments from here pete youll have to hold up the bag so i can reach it
okay just a second
roger thats surface rock fragments
yes were going  going to get it hold the phone
better find it first do you know where the · went
 just a little 
ill move it around and see if you see it
yes yes stick your hand straight down towards your knee that a boy you ought to have it
got it i almost got it
some little rocks in here  
okay just little rocks  now push it 1 5 13 06 21 cc roger copy you got some rocks and the gas analysis and would also confirm that youve gotten the environmental sample
pete have you got the   05 lb 06 26 cdr we got the environmental sample we got the trench and core tube and im trying to find a little rock little rock there  theres a lot  
theres a neat one there it is right there
hoho just right for that little can
give me a few
thing has shrunk
heres a couple of nice ones right here pete
where
see them
al your plss feedwater is back up to nominal and all looks good
okay thank you very much houston see those bright shiny ones there
yes yes yes yes
wait let me get a shot of them just move  just a second pete
okay
okay got a picture of them
careful these  there how about those right  right there there right  there see them shine
the little ones
no no move over this way this way up  youire near about  right there
no hey thats a neat  oh thats glass look at that
right next to it
yes here one at a time be a good sample for them
and that piece right next to it there
okay
houston how far are we from the lm
laughter
stand by
 tricky wish we had 
laughter
hey we need some more pete give me a bigger rock theres not enough in there to do any  
laughter hey come on im getting tired of picking up those little things
theres nothing in there
i cant  where is my stupid tool there it is
get a big one theres one right there
get a big what here this one
yes
i dont think that will fit
lets try it
no that wont  
no  
theres a good one
pete and ai we show you 1200 feet from the lm
okay come on al were wasting time
there you go
pete as soon as you finish up there you can head on back toward the east towards halo crater no need to go any further west
got it pete
yes wait let go a minute 05 1308 50 cdr im with you houston
hey good show pete good turning
there you go the front of my lens is clean  relatively speaking nothing else is
okay want me to put that up
yes
okay we got it
okay give me one gnomon and my shovel 05 13 09 20 p heres your shovel
head for halo crater
okay pete well give you a radar vector on this one
thats good
if youll go over  just directly east of bench crater and you can continue on east until youre just about directly opposite the lm and then a couple of more steps ought to take you right to halo crater enti litr
sounds like a pretty good vector nat also says that were running right into the sun does that agree with you
thats affirmative you will be running right into the sun and directly at your 9 oclock posi tion youll see the lm a couple of more steps and youll be right there
ive got the lm in sight to my 10 oclock you know what i feel like al
what
did you ever see those pictures of giraffes running in slow motion
thats what i feel like
  thats exactly what i feel like laughter
say would you giraffes give us some comment on your boot penetration as you move across there what youre doing now and what you had back there at sharp crater 05 310 30 lmp oh its much firmer here we dont sink in anywheres near as much now im crossing some of my own tracks
yes
the toes sink in a bit pete as you push off you land flatfooted so your heels dont sink in but as you push off with your toes they sink in down about 3 inches your heels are only sunk in  perhaps an eighth of an inch also right as you kick off on your toe  
roger thank you al
  every time he lands he sends a  little par ticles spraying out ahead of him and beside him and everywhere else and they go out to distances maybe  maybe 2 feet to 3 feet around him
okay were back at bench crater now have we gone too close towards the lm
going on the south side of bench crater houston
okay now if youll just go directly to the east of the center of bench crater and then con tinue directly east right into the sun and then at 9 oclock youll see the lm and a couple of more steps and youll be there
okay
ive got the decided feeling im going to sleep tonight
pete the crater youre looking for halo crater is just about the same size as sharp crater and should resemble it
i think z have it in sight but im not sure theres a couple of them here ill tell you what im going to do houston im going to take an emu break how you doing al
okay
pete the dimension on halo crater is about 20 feet so that would make it half of what you saw at sharp
okay now halo i wonder if im standing  you suppose this is it al
well it doesnt have any halo around it
yes i know but you never can tell from here
you can look at the map when you get here
tell you one thing id go for is a good drink of ice water
quit thinking that let me look in the map pete
okay
i cant imagine them seeing this one from   omfident l
pete and al can we have an emu check
you sure could
and one way to locate it also is that it should be right on the rim of surveyor crater and you ought to see surveyor off directly to the north east
okay i  i  i know where we are an emu check mine reads about 55 percent 02 houston
mine reads 55 02 also houston just beautiful  
copy fiftyfive both
round glass ball they got to have al quarter of an inch
and the sample bag
coming coming
look at that
okay just a second first time ive worked up a heart rate i think
okay
this is sample bag lld
i didnt take a picture i just wanted to  
okay watch that crater behind you dont step back
wait a minute
this is glass beads 05 13 14 50 kmp i know i was thinking of this we got a total now of about 5 pounds of rocks
okay
id hate to  id hate to have us get back to the lm and then have to fill it up around here again
ah were going to the surveyor crater
okay 05 13 15 oh cdr  get to the bottom of that baby
why dont you take a rest here
yes 05 13 15 08 lmp funny do  do your hands get hot holding that shovel
my hands just get hot period i guess   dont know whether it is the shovel or what
you know as long as it  like now mine are cool but the minute i start carrying this tool carrier they start warming up wouldnt think the thing would be that hot
yes yes  i  ill tell you what  lets see were crosssun right look over here at me and smile
okay have a picture youre right there by a crater
theres the lm right in the background great there you go
ail right lets  lets ease off at a nice  
okay
  at a slower pace just like youre going now i think this is halo crater right up here in front of us
hey ed you might tell fred haise he ought to quit working on running and start working on holding things in his hands  
there he is
my legs dont get a bit tired but your hands get tired carrying these tools particularly the handtool carrier
roger al sure will
yes you wouldnt  
im sure hes listening
yes i think thats  thats funny it  you wouldnt think it that way
tell jim lovell to practice digging laughter
boy look at  look at all the texturing  look here pete now we are crossing across something thats got a completely different texture than what we have been on
youre right
look at all  looky here we got all sorts of  
this is halo  lets take son pictures here 05 13 6 57 lmp this  weve run across a sort of a textural contact were suddenly on a  on an area thats quite  not so smooth its got dimples and wrinkles in it you want me to take some pictures or what pete
yes why dont you come up here  
okay
  and well take a couple of good dirt bag samples of this stuff 05 13 17 14 i24p okay
ill get the   age
its interesting you know i think this looks like that material that we talked about the first day in front of the lm maybe it runs past the lm down into this area but its sure different than where weve been it  like its more  the material is more cohesive and forms clumps in stead of being so nice and smooth  around behind you
i was waiting for the gnomon to damp out but  
okay right here good shot here pete
i wanted to get n foot  footprints in it too so they could see that
okay
uhoh
you know i think ill take some a little further away back up a little and shoot a 15foot one if its okay
yes im going to dig
ail right ill be back to collect in just a second let me get this 15 footer
its halo crater it has slightly big  yes
hey im shooting about four here okay quite interesting that this  
just get some sample bags and well  
okay pete
  scoop this stuff
okay
let me  boy it sure is fine its kind of like over at the other  at sharp crater
yes looks the same except on the surface it just seems  
except it looks almost finer
yes
wait a minute and ill get you another bag  
its funny though if you saw this on earth youd think it was a  a real soft dirt that had just been rained on recently
not hard rain but just a sprinkle so that the droplets  
there you go
now thats a good sample bag full
thats 12d houston the sample bag number  
is halo crater a shallow crater houston
copy 12d
with a couple or three dimple craters in the south side of it
stand by pete
we can collect a rock while we wait pete
well i  well look i think this is halo crater right here  
all right lets ease over there
  and lets go get some rocks from it and everything were seeing it right we  we  were  weve actually got the soil sample from part of it
okay
but this isnt 20 feet in diameter is it right on the rim of the surveyor crater houston pag3e3o jon tde ay6
thats affirmative and from your comments on the three dimples we show that youre there
okay wnatdo you want in it
its a 20footdiameter crater
about 20
wed like to get the pan and a double core tube
i cant believe were at the right place
i  im not sure that were at the right place either let me look at the top of this hill here this is surveyor crater let me look at the chart
theres a nice rock right there
heres surveyor
let me look at the map not even hardly a crater worth looking at where we are
okay  crater
okay pete its your call there youre the local experts if you see a better location for that double core tube go ahead
yes were just trying to find the right  right crater houston
hey pete i think its that area right over there 
where
thats the  halo is this first one right here the little one and then all those others are next over according to the chart
okay
so we can just go over there and  
which ones halo this one right here
this  no its right  see where im pointing 05 3 21 29 cdr no
as i see it its that one right over there
okay lets go
okay
and i have the double core tube
all right
and you want what houston a partial pan
thats affirmative
i guess were trying to get these  
wed like a full pan at that point pete
and also al if you could give us some sort of an estimate of how hard it is to get the core tube in that is whats the force you have to use how many pounds and how much force
sure will
hey look at this little neato crater right here its a good place to sample
oh look at all the glass in the bottom of that baby got a lot of that though
huh
got a lot of glass
out there
yes
i think thats halo right there p g3e32 aconfide da6y
which one
the one youre looking at right over  its that one  that one right there
too big
too big huh
lets take this one right here
ail right thats good  glass out of the bottom of this baby dont we
okay
pete and al could we have a readout on the cameras at this point
sure could just a second yes see mine probably pete
youd better take all these pictures im running out
well id better change cameras because  
sixty  60 for al
youve got  110 you still got plenty to go
hey i  you know whats happened
no
this thing hasnt been taking every picture
take a picture and lets see
i  i just caught it i  i mean its been doing it  intermittently
okay now get out and make the double core tube here
pete we copy 60 and 110 on the film
thats affirm
here look at the chart a minute pete while  
yes okay be careful stay over here
pete and al wed like you to go ahead and get the pans taken on the lmps camera you can either have al do the pans or switch cameras your choice
okay rogerroger 
okay pete youll have to unscrew  pull the pin and unscrew that if you can
okay
good luck on unscrewing it hey wait hold it just a second
ill get it 334 nfideij jiilqiiw da6y
okay hey good show
okay
double core tube drive it give it a go
im going to hand you the hmer im not sure that double core tube screws on as far as it should try it again
pete and l houston be sure you give us the number of the lower core toe please
okay the lower core tube is number 3 i think yes
three
three and the upper ones 1 okay
ready to pound it 05 13 25 12  where are you going to drive it
where would you recommend 05 13 25 15 itp well lets go over to this crater right here
okay
where its soft around those little  craters 05 13 25 27  about right here
yes
want to take a picture
yes
i can shove it in a little  i hope this is a good soft place it seems to be oh i hit something solid there well i shoved it in  i used all my weight houston and shoved it in about 11 inches now ill just pound on it awhile and see what we can do its going in okay yes its going on down
keep augering
no weve got a good spot i dont thk  really think this is the right place some of those things arent so obvious
got awful solid didnt it
oh its going let me wiggle it a bit its got one core tube completely in now have to hit it harder
hey houston this hmmer  when you hit on the side of it like you have to do to  it within this suit it knocks little chips of metal off the side of the hammer i dont think thats too good 05 1326 48 cc roger al is it damaging the hammer or the core tube
im afraid some of the fragments will damage the suit its not damaging itself you know its  its just breaking the  hey im better left handed than right there goes another fragment do you see it pete
yes im watching
you even hit it with the front end and some of them pop off theyre flying all over the place
okay hes up to the bottom of the handgrip por tion of the upper tube hes really driving that baby
look at that ham look at that  look at that laughter looks like its got a coating over the hmmer pete and im knocking the coating instead of being a steel or aluminum hmmer its  
yes
  some sort of coated arrangement beating the heck out of it isnt it
thats affirmative al there is a coating on that hammer and thats probably what youre pa e336 tconfidetnt 6 knocking off and also we want to be sure to get the site there documented
well document it for you
coming up
we almost got it
0oh almost
hit something solid there didnt you
no its just getting down there pete
hey that baby is in the ground
weve got a double now the question is can we pull it out
laughter
 solid 
let me take  let me get the downsun shot i hope thats a good spot
i do too
ought to get some of these rocks nearby here
come on lets see  250 11 ail right
you give them that low pan or something so they can see where this came from so they  
you  you do it i dont have that much film
okay why dont i just trade you cameras thats probably the smart way
ail right 05 13 28 h6 lmp hey would you lift mine off when youre through
sure will
i cant pull those things right they tend to vacuum weld a little bit or something i think
now you hold that one  05 13 28 59 i24p hey thats about to come apart
be darned if it isnt ill fix it hold the handle there back   come apart
whoa
it did come apart it did come apart
son of a gun
well that kind of bombed out i tell you what the only thing we can  did it  
it broke
sure did break
well  the nut that holds the handle of the camera on broke off and so the handles free but thats okay well just carry it around
let me ask you a question is mine tight
roger al we got you we  we understand that the nut broke but you  the camera is still usable right 05 13 29 44 i24p yes and your nuts loose too pete stay  stay there let me tighten it up for you they work loose in onesixth g yet we  we knew that we should have  watched it more carefully
finished
can you help do that yourself
yes
because its hard for me to do
yes t con  6
let me go put the hammer up and this camera some where and  there goes the bracket but thats okay still got the camera
but youre going to have to help me get this camera off i cant get it off
okay theres no need to get it off now
okay ill leave it on no i want to give it to you
and youre going to use this one
al you got to take the surveyor pictures so why dont i give you the camera
okay thats good enough
but its still got 50 pictures or so now watch it make sure it takes a picture each time it turns
okay
and just  why dont you  the camera  ill tell you what  well here ill hold it and you take this one off
okay you got that camera take this one off help me take it off now ill tighten the nut and im going to tip it down a little bit
wait a minute ill hold that down 05 13 31 11 lm there you go tip it  push  push your rcu down a little bit more
im trying to
a bit more its almost off pete push down some more
i cant
there you go okay now i can tighten this thing yes im tightening so itll get tight okay i got enough there thatll be enough drop it right there onfide ttm
ail right ill drop that one in here 05 13 31 5 lmp well why dont you    
 carry it
thats what id do carry it or something

okay houston what else would you like here
okay pete youre 2 hours and 7 minutes into the eva and we show you leaving halo at around 215 and now thats for a 4hour eva weve extended you 30 minutes for a total eva of 4 hours wed like before you go on to have a good emu check and sit down and regroup and figure out a plan of attack on the surveyor one thing we would like to make sure is that you remain away from directly below the surveyor as you move up to it that is move up to it on one side or the other either north or south
okay we concurred with that we were talking about it last night were going to approach it from the side
roger
thats it pete pans complete probably ought to get rocks  one of these rocks here just throw it in the bag  
yes i think we ought to clionfl
how about  you want to get this one
 for a sample bag
lets  lets sample a couple of these laying right over here
good idea that a boy
oh wow my ears just came back down
just a second i shouldnt have done that
okay here take one quick picture so we can save some film
ail right here it goes i 05 13 38 34 lmp where it came from
okay just a second 05 13 38 5 lmp those little holders for this  for these sample bags are ridiculous you know in this light gravity up here if you put anything in the holder and move it flips it right out of it come out of there sample bag there you go funny how this one  go in there go in  that a boy give me some of that dirt around there too pete drop it right in this is going in sample bag 13d houston looks pretty good pete
roger al
al lets move up on the rim of the surveyor crater and start getting some rocks gnomon  and well figure out  there you go
al could we have some sample bag numbers while youre working along there
sure could i thought i  didnt i call out 13d houston i guess i didnt call it out loud enough i think it was 13d then let me  ill check the next one and if you  the next time we stop ill tell you the next one for sure and then youll know what it is  onftdentia
roger thank you al
al look at these rocks they look a little bit different lets grab some
yes sir
look at that glass in the bottom of that one they look like granites dont they
they do they look just like granite heres a beauty over  heres a beauty
where
right here that is a nice rock
huh
right around here lets get this one for sure right there
okay
wont fit in the bag but its sure different it seems to have some  
got a big glass splotch on it
yes thats a good one thats a real good rock get some pictures  
wait wait wait wait okay its in
thats a beauty that gnomon doesnt really damp as fast as it should you know pete i think it does great in one g but onesixth g it wont  doesnt seem to damp right let me get the cross suns too oops got to get over where you are
okay
we will just put that in thats a beautiful rock
okay you going to scoop it up you know you need some tongs that will get bigger samples than weve got dnftdenit
watch that
you know seeing that i just thought 
hey thats beautiful its got a lot of  hold it 
dont drop it
nearly dropped it tough to hold it
okay now i want some of these granites over here  or what looks like granite
okay lets try that
doesnt that lm look neat sitting on the other side of that crater
laughter yes it does we ought to get a shot of that
yes get a shot of home
okay let me see how many pictures have i got now pete
143 05 13 42 53 i24p 143 okay 
youre getting close to the end  we ought to  
okay thats 14d houston is the next sample bag so the last one was 13d let me take a picture quick here
ahuhow
roger intrepid we copy that
al why dont you step across over here 05 13 43 17  all right
step across over there photograph that rock right there  wait until i drop the gnomon in   age346 i onfidentit i 6
okay
  and do it in such a manner as to get this crater that it came out of
thats a good idea let me see if i can ill have to back  let me get a 15foot shot
yes thats justwhat  was just thinking
15foot
pete could we have your present position
roger were  if you were looking at the surveyor crater and west with 12 oclock were at the 9 oclock position on the surveyor crater
okay pete
roger copy that copy youre right on the rim and wed like to get a good j check and a rest here before you proceed
thats a good idea houston  
okay houston thats a good idea what  what were going to do is im getting this  
wait  wait 1  wait pete ive got an idea
what
this rock  might be good for 13 let me reach back here and grab this strap
okay now
go okay let me roll a little bit over
that a boy back up now if they had a strap like that they could just hold the other guy while he leaned over and picked up a rock
hey thats a  teonfident
it works pretty good it sure saves time look at the sheer face on that rock something whistled by it or something
its fractured a bit its got some  pretty inter esting fracture marks on it it also has got some  what looks like abrasion marks on it maybe thats just hardpacked dirt boy theres a lot of flashing crystals in that rock  crystal faces its a good rock
listen ill tell you what i recommend we do while were taking  
okay let me get a  
  an emu break
okay let me take the  the picture of that where the rock was right there
okay what i recommend we do is change film packs 05 13 45 13  ail right thats a good idea well do that next age onfidentl t 6
okay why dont i  okay ill get this camera out 
stay right there just a second
shoot a  shoot a good  shoot a pan and get the surveyor  use up that film
hey thats good i didnt  that ought to be good ah its a bad place to shoot but ill try it though
al what i think we can do is walk down here about 300 feet and walk straight down that slope to it
i do too it doesnt look so bad from here does it pete
no
okay want to change the cameras now
pete will that direction of your travel be to the northeast direction
no what we do is go directly east and then walk directly short of north you know curving right around and down to it it doesnt look bad  its  ill tell you getting  
roger copy youre going directly east and then youll be curving around going up north towards the surveyor
yes you get a  kind of an optical illusion depending on where youre standing
trade me one trade me magazines
okay wait a minute
careful when you undo it
ill tell you what youd better put that one in 05 13 46 52 imp no we want the dark nft denti
okay
i wanted to put it back on here pete
ail right ill try
i dont think it makes any difference we just put it in here youre right
ail right
just put it right in there with the rocks
yes yes thank you 05 13 47 10  let me  let me hold the camera see  wait a minute okay go boy these cameras got dirty didnt they that wont be any trouble
pete a reminder on that film pack cycle one frame before you start
roger we cycled one before we took it off too i think were in good shape houston
good thing weve practiced this a few times i tell you what why dont you let me hold it for you okay
just a second here ill show you what you need to do pull this out of the way the rock is whats driving me buggy wait wait hold the camera hold it there
okay
thats  thats it
hold the camera
okay got it
thats it you got it
we got it n fident j day 6
good show hot dog
wait a minute wait a minute okay keep the trigger pulled trigger pulled let her go now try it again try it again thats it babe no strain okay let me put it on
that lens is good and clean too
okay hope we didnt get anything on the reseau lens inside i bet we got some dust on it where am i okay
huh
great got her on there pete
there you go okay lets wander over here
yes i think a strap on you or something like that so  each of you so if you want to lean over and pick up a rock the other guy just holds the strap you lean over and pick up the rock and go some bigger sample bags hey pete why dont i  ill bring it back
what do you want
i was going to say as long as youre  
good thought al
were moving on houston
a few minutes ago pete wanted to pick up a rock so i held onto a  that strap of the surveyor bag and he leaned right over and picked it up and i helped him get back up its not that youre heavy or anything its the fact that you dont  you have such poor balance
look at that glass  
pete and al houston before you go much further could you stop and have a little break there before you proceed on down the slope c nfidentt
sure can
yes were just going to move to the area where we could stop and case the joint al grab a shot of that headed glass there and well hag it
okay
thats better than the hope diamond
set her up
better take that
there you are in here
okay
okay i got it pete
got her
yes got a lot of those weve  got too many of them
oh you did get a lot of these
yes why dont you get that pick it up  
get the rock with it look
okay get some rocks with it thats a good id  hey heres some rocks right here theres good rocks you know we keep collecting a lot of the same type of rocks because there just doesnt seem to be any other kinds around i havent seen any microbreccia the whole day ive looked around for it ail i have seen is some basalt ive seen nothing that looked vesicular at all except on the surface
i havent either
you know thats real strange its  its not at all like nells rocks close as it comes is that gabbro   ionfident 6
roger we copy those comments pete and al we show youre 2 plus 23 into the eva and based on a 4hour eva youd be leaving the surveyor at 2 plus 50 but dont rush wed like to make sure you get a good rest before you go into it
okay
why dont you give me a rock or two pete and ill stick in there got any spares there you go good rock good rock
get a load of this crazy juggling act
treasure okay that will hit we just made a sample of  glass bead and some local rock on the south edge of the surveyor crater houston and theyre going into bag 14d
im remembering back to all of our training
14d
im trying to remember who the guy was that kept saying whatever you do dont get dust on the gnomon it 05 13 52 33 cdrimp laughter
okay were going to jog on here for a little bit houston and get a little bit closer to the surveyor and look her over 05 13 52 53 imp yes hey thats coming in from the south looks like a good way pete
ill tell you what im going to do al im just going to lope right around here
thats what i mean if you stay at this level youll end up at surveyor
youre right
follow the contour lines
no problem at all houston  the scoop and you couldnt see that before its kind of   cii i ttji 
pete and al could you give us a comment on how far youre sinking in
not sinking in very far at all this is fairly firm stuff and im down in the crater about the same distance down that surveyor is im just going around it radially wouldnt you say so al
yes i would say that  i think houston is just concerned about us getting down in this crater we been thinking about it too houston
okay dont worry about it houston because its  really its no strain im 200 feet away from it  
thats right
  it isnt exactly like we thought it was going to be last night when we were talking about it
roger sounds good
yes it is i dont think therell be any sweat about it
al ill tell you what lets do lets go right over here and well park all our gear take our selves a little rest go over your photo plan and then well have at it 05 13 54 18  okay lets go right over here
ill tell you what why dont you get a photograph of it right now
thats a good place okay will do i can do it right here
im trying to see which way it landed
okay pete and al when you are looking at it there would you also try to determine whether there is any effect from the dust during the descent that is could you determine whether pa e 6 there is more dust on either the west or the east side of any of the bays and the north or the south side of the camera
okay we sure will i actually flew around it however i probably passed closer to it than i am parked to it right now no thats not really true ill tell you the way that dust was going it probably went right over top of it
yes thats right any dust you hit on the edge would never go down in this crater
yes what happened to your volume al
i dont know how does  sounds good to me
youre just a little bit down in the mud
okay im not talking loud enough
we read you both loud and clear
okay no problem
im going to mosey up here just a little pete without any tools which makes it pretty easy
look ill tell you what lets leave the whole  tell you what lets take the tool carrier with us  
yes
  i think we can go right up the other rim and around to  
sure
  and  
  right on out  
  that big blocky baby there and  
  hey maybe we can get that bedrock   fide
   right over there at that  that  
huh
  neat crater where all that rock is just  
  
  back of the lm
  
you know i could have landed the lm in the bottom of that crater it would have scared me to death but 
okay okay pete why dont  would you carry the handtool carrier down there
whoop
and let me take some pictures up here around it
okay
now look you can see which way it came in see the way these gearpads dug in over there  
yes
  dug up dirt theyre still setting there
yes
this is going to make a good shot were not supposed to take pictures with that mag well have to do it though 05 13 56 43 i24p beautiful beautiful sight you know this ones brown and i dont remember ours being brown there at the cape kind of a light tan or maybe that  maybe thats the way its changed color what color was this one houston white when  when it started out
stand by on that  05 13 57 03 cdr yes it looks a light tan now t onftdenti 6
hey this crater isnt as steep as we thought pete
no id better be careful im going to get dust on her yes 05 13 57 19 p ill stop here and thisll be my last picture
al the equipment bays were white on the side and the scoop itself was a light blue
well its kind of a  wells well get down there and get closer inspection what was the general color of all the structure for example all the struts and the like tell you what it looks like  
thats all white the equipment bays and the pri mary structure was all painted with a white paint
really turned tan or something well have to look at it more closely
yes thats what happened it just changed color huh
it sure has something has cooked that paint brown cant imagine what you know its funny on the slopes here its just a little bit softer but theres no tendency to slip down or anything like that
i kno
i dont think its any deeper a little softer maybe maybe a little deeper why dont i move this down here just a little bit closer pete
okay 05 13 58 26  then well take the rest down here where we can see it better
okay lets just make sume we dont get any dirt down there on it 05 13 58 30 p okay well walk real slow ftdent
hey you can see  look at there where tt dug those scoops you can still see the  
boy thats going to make some beautiful pictures on the way thats weathered since  
doesnt look like the pictures we saw of this a long time ago
thats going to be good
oh that is interesting what in the hell
look at how its kind of made them into  once again it looks like something has rained on it theyve taken on a little  
wonder if that was from us 05 13 58 58 imp oh no i dont think so as you notice theres a general trend of lines along here from the north  that would be the northeast or the southwest  see those little lines running along through the crater here
yes
ill take a picture of that boy this thing is dusty  8 just do this
yes this has those lineal patterns here houston right down inside the crater and theyre not  theyre not laying at all in the same direction  i mean its not from us  not from the lm
no

well done troops says when you move out from here right  well first of all we show youre 3 hours into the eva and youre about 10 minutes behind nominal traverse we had figured out for a 4hour eva however your plss consumables are holding out real well so we suggest you go on with the nominal traverse we may want you to cut down to perhaps just one sample at blocky crater
okay thats what i wanted to do is go to blocky crater if you agree   05  29 8 lm hey hey look  look at this pete 05  29 9 cdr what gonfidenti
we thought this thing had changed color but i think its just dust look we rubbed into that battery and its getting shiny again let me get a shot on it

i think thats what  maybe this things just col lecting all this red dust
well theyll know when they get that tv camera back 
okay pete and al before you leave there also would you get some of those geosamples which weve discussed as well as some of the loose soil from that area
will do well do it right now
okay
lets do it
heres this rock right here let me give the surveyor tool a heave
okay
we dont need it for anything do we
houston we dont need this surveyor tool anymore do we

that tvs  okay al have i got my scoop on
do you
youve got your full measure of rock right here okay let me go get the sample bags
hey thats a good one jconfidentfal 6 c5 14 31 02 cdr i dont think the tv could see that one though i figure it was too close how about this one 05 14 31 09 l  down with you 05 131 13 cdr okay ail right now trying to remember where that  they got a  one

wait wait let me get this in the bag too 05 lh 31 52 pp sorry didnt know you had it pete
okay no its light brown wherever you look at it upsun downsun or crosssun 05 14 32 03 lmip but strangely enough that light brown rubs off thats the funny part 05 ih 32 04 cdr yes ih 32 06 lb thats funny because the dirt here is not brown
look is that the rock right there you know these rocks as they showed in the surveyor pictures all have this soil builduo around them 05 14 32 23 p yes theyre still there  all the fillets around them n fidentt
roger pete

pete and al we have comment on what you just said about brushing up against the battery case
yes
would you make sure that anything which you picked up against that battery case you clean off your emu
yes were thinking about that  
there wasnt any signs of k0h anywhere  
yes weve looked and  
the battery case was tight nice and tight and brown
right heres the one the square one pete

roger
okay thats about enough rocks pal 05 il 33 53 l i think it is that is for here let me get it okay you got it good show 05 il 34 05 cdr okay lets head for blocky crater 05 il 34 07 lmp okay and go to the  
als do you have a sample ba number on that last one 05 14 34 13 i 
all those rocks are too big for sample bags   05 il 34 17 l  they are big rocks houston theyre all at least 6 inches in diameter and i think these are some of the ones you wanted its kind of hard to tell without having a photograph on hand or something thats standing there and studying it for a lot longer than i think we care to do it just which rocks are which
roger 05 il 34 43 cdr its pretty easy to move along on this slope its just a little bit deeper and it a little bit softer 05 14 34 49 i2 im going to take a break here pete for just a few seconds
ail right im right with you cant get up your pace when youre running on the side of a slope
no
you dont have a chance to go from side to side lke on level ground look at that huge boulder out there at  boy i wish we could go over there 05 14 35 08 l where
look at that boulder nfidentiaj   day 6 page 381
where
straight ahead see it there alan
no where
over the top of the hill
dont see where you are looking
right on the other side of the  about 200 yards that way see that big boulder sitting up there the biggest one weve seen since weve been here
i dont see which one youre referring to  that one right there 05 1435 38 cdr yes
yes oh these down in here are bigger than that look at that right here look at that right there on your left look
let me turn around and look
gigantic right there theres a big one
what
come further left thats a pretty good sized one
ive got it lets get up out of the crater where we can get up on the level ground okay
hey pete
huh
this  there it was kind of hung up on the gnomon let me get the gnomon and pick it up its not usually on there  no gnomon
there you go okay lets document up a sample here and i think you ought to photo that whole blocky crater right there that things spectacular cignfidentia 0ay6 05 14 36 51 i2p it is at is it
bed  thats got to be bedrock there babe yes lets get some samples of that 05 14 36 58 l got to be
hey houston  is the dimple crater right behind the lm is that  its a big blocky impact crater 05 14 37 19 l that mav be cool enough back in min cooling
its fnnm i dont have any  i kind of thought it would be tough down in the crater losing your balance but it doesnt seem to be its just harder walking thats all 0 14 37 40 cc pete and al could we have emu check 05 i4 37 45 cdr sure could were right at the top of the rim we can get a good place to rest z am reading 36 der cent oxygen
were okay c5 1 37 5 cdr were going to sample  ill tell you what were going to do houston were going to get an emu check here were going to dick up one sample out of this blocky crater give you a partial pan of it because its a pretty fantastically interesting crater with a lot of bedrock big chunky rocks blon up out of it   05 i4 38 09 i2 very anular very shar 05  38 1 cdr   and get a sample of the double craters on the side of the surveyor crater and then my recom mendation is weve got so much gear and so many rocks that we head for the lm and start packing it all u
roger we concur thats a good idea al could you give us your percent 05 lh 38 30 i22 i sure could looks like about 36 percent
copy 36 on both and how are you doing on that film con fidentiaj  day 6 page 383
my camera is completely dustcovered houston i just hope that the lens is open   121 hows the lens  
your lens is in good shape now why dont you stand right here and get a partial pan while youre resting on this crater either side
hey wait a minute look at this
what
i cant  forget it i thought i saw something 05 1 39 08 cdr im beginning to think that these rocks that look red to us if wed just crack them open wed find theyre plain old basalt rock on the inside we just dont ever have any cracked we ought to pound one of those things with a hammer in a minute
okay you want me to do a pan of this little part or the whole crater pete
no get the whole crater get about four shots across it and then move over and get another four
okeydoke 74
funny i can notice that tv camera on my back it moves my cg further in
does it feel okay back there
oh it feels okay sure the way to carry gear it sure beats that thing thats a pain now wait a minute where are you shooting al i want you to shoot down in that crater right there
sorry thats what i  okay read you
shoot way down into it get a stereo of that thing with those big blocks down there
0keydoke its kind of dark but i think we can get something good okay move over here this is probably the most spectacular crater weve onfident j 6 come to i think it must have just  the original craters took it down to bedrock and then i guess more recently then this one came in here and really banged it out these blocks are a lot more sharp cornered than any weve seen anywhere else i guess this must be the most recent one weve been around
no i got the idea that the bedrocks not too deep and that this was a big crater but its very very very very old and then this thing came along and hit it  
thats right
  and broke into the side of the bedrock thats been sticking out into this   
yes and then threw it all out again
i think  lets get a sample of that rock
yes lets do i think its going to be the sae  
and then lets get out of here 05 14 41 04 l okay want to get a docu  we document and a couple of the big pieces hows that
yes thats a good idea lets see at looks like all the same right here 05 1 41 14 l yes let me get a shot at it pete crosssun 05 il 41 17 cdr okay get a stereopair right here we dont need the gnomon ill put the   05 4 41 20 l by the way when i shot that crater down there i had my distance set on 30 feet i thought that would be right but thats the only one we havent shot on the numbers 05 il 41 32 cdr get further back bean 05 il 41 36 ip okay let me get some rocks okay this is going to be sample bag number  number 15d houston cjdnfidential  day 6 page 385
15d al
okay pete you ought to put two or three rocks in here just generally and ill photograph them and we can see what you took couple of more those are good okay you know most of the rocks weve seen today is exactly like this going to pound one of these with a hammer in a minute
hey theres some of that lightcolored undersoil
youre right okay you want me to get another sample bag
no i want to start moving out 05 1 42 31 lmp okay go
ail right
ill just pick up this one big rock here pete and stick it in the bag
okay
good thats a good rock
okay houston now im going to go pack up the doced samples box and ill understand youre going to allow me 20 pounds of other rocks is that right
pete ive got a pretty good load here so im just going to trail along behind  
pete what wed like to do is to get an estimate from you of how much you think youve got in the first src in terms of volume or weight
well in comparison to the zerog airplane lets see the maximum load is 80 total pounds right im going to guess that the mass that i sent up was about a 60pounder just the box
roger pete from what you said in the first eva and basic calculations on apollo 11 data we come up with about 5h pounds confidential 6 05 1 43 46 cdr very good i think that were fairly close 05 ih 43 55 i2p i just bet you everything we got here is really black basalt ail been colored just like that surveyor hey that bag is bouncing a little bit too much back there pete 05 1  0 cdr huh 05 lh 4 06 lmp surveyor bag is bouncing 05 14 4 07 cdr well thats okay its not hurting anything 05 14 4 34 cdr al youve got to get that closeup stereocamera going 05 1 44 37 2vd okay

okay what do you want me to do with that
pete houston
yes put that up in the  
okay wed like to give you a little weight summary for the rock boxes if  we estimate you probably got about the same in rock box 2 as you did in rock box 1 no problem there the surveyor parts and tv camera will show a nominal 25 pounds in 15 what you could put in your bag that goes on the floor is about 15 pounds worth of rocks
thats it houston
and in the lefthand side stowage bag you can put about 25 pounds of rock so i guess those are the two you are working for now fifteen pounds worth of rocks in the bag on the floor and 25 pounds on the lefthand side stowage bag
we  we dont have that many rocks houston ill tell you what weve got weve got  src 2 is full and closed its  gosh i hope i got it all in there let me see solar wind core tubes environ mental gas sample documented samples all made it in and the box is full and i closed it and ive got about  whats 1 inch on my scale  ive got about 1 inch worth of rocks in another hag and thats it thats all the rocks weve got a bunch
roger stand by for that number pete pete that 1inch displacement is about 10 to 15 pounds no problem pack it up
okay thats good okay now let me ask you another question i can get some more rocks why dont i do that while a1 is taking stereophotos well see if i can get myself  
okay im going to  i dont have a camera to go along with this so ill just tell houston when im taking a picture and then theyll know so fonfidentiaj da6y they can keep up with it okay houston on this stereocamera im taking a picture now about 10 feet from the lm between the plus y and minus z strut and i am hoping to show the effects of the engine exhaust on the lunar surface im going to  that was number 800 theres one at 801 its moving around here  im going to take another one the little counter doesnt seem to be working everything is working okay but the little counter and i am taking the fourth picture right up next to the engine here okay another one close to the engine about 2 feet from the engine okay houston the little counter on top of the experiments not working so ill just tell you what i take next and the light and every thing seems to be working so z assume its probably taking pictures im going to go look for a crater that is undisturbed and take a icture down inside it heres one of the

okay and ive run cdh here and it looks like minus 9 and minus 8 roughly shows me 59 seconds early at tpi okay and were not going to make the  that doesnt look like we need to make the outofplane so we are down in the noise level on outofplane dicks showing 04 foot per second and i havent looked at it yet but i will in a minute
roger intrepid houston can you give us a high bit rate please

negative we dont believe so apollo 11 we think that this is possibly due to some tli dispersions and its probably satisfactory so go ahead and accept this it fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it and this is an equivalent size error over

hello apollo 11 houston your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good 1986 130y 3400 just slightly off than those in the flight plan over
okay well try that 00 06 58 28 mp charlie state those three angles one more time id like to confirm them before i maneuver
roger roll and pitch are slightly off than whats in the flight plan 1t roll is now 1986 pitch is 1307 over
roger roll 1986 pitch 1307 and yaw 34000
thats affirmative
houston apollo 11 i think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point im having to maneuver quite a bit and thats in progress now so stand by for some marks
roger we copy it all
hello apollo 11 houston weve run the angles given in the flight plan for the p23 goss net 1 tape 55 attitude through the machines down here and they come up the same thing every time we think everythings going correctly mike and were wondering if the nonsyetrical horizon might by giving a problem over
yes id say  it could be charlie stand by here well get another mark for you
okay 00 07 i0 30 cmp houston apollo 11 noun 49 for you
roger copy
stand by
hello apollo 11 houston we recommend you accept the noun 49 continue through your sequence of sightings and then well analyze the data afterwards over
okay
houston apollo 1t star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant could the trunnion angle 47  something be a little high
stand by
hello apollo 11 houston wed like you to press on to star 44 over 00 07 21 26 cml yes roger ail right how many marks have you recorded on star 40
stand by mike
okay
11 houston we copied two good marks over
okay
houston apollo 11
go ahead over
roger fortyfour is just not bright enough for this theres a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant and the star is lost some where in there and i cannot see it goss net 1 tape 56
roger stand by well come up with another star over 00 07 33 21 c4p yes id appreciate that
hello apollo 11 houston wed like you to go on to star 45 over
okay
and mike we think these large deltars noun 49 youre getting is really meaningful since its been way before tli since we had a state vector update and we think its normal over
okay could betcharlie some of the early markings i might not have had precisely the substellar point i think as time goes by theyve been cning more accurate but old enif here is just flat invisible
roger
and houston apollo ll understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well is that affirmative
im believe thats right stand by one over
okay
that is negative stand by one
okay because theres quite a difference be tween the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants but with inaccurate state vector im inclined not to believe the program
stand by
houston apollo 11 lmp is back on the line
roger copy 00 07 35 40  read you fiveby
roger same buzz and 11 the angles for you are 1978 for roll 1285 pitch 3400 yaw goss net 1 tape 57
okay just as a matter of comparison p23 for this star would like to go to 23566 15431 and 31365 over
roger we copy 11 we understand that the program can give you almost an infinite com bination of angles in p23 and its not too un reasonable if youll stand by well look at these that we see on the dsky over o0 07 3e 31 cmp okay then in the meantime ill just go ahead and maneuver to yours 1978 1285 and 3400
roger
houston apollo 11
go ahead over
okay charlie if the attitude you gave me on star number 45  the reticle is off id say a good 30 degrees in roll and the star is not in sight over
roger stand by
i think somethings wrong with those attitudes apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 61
hello apollo 11 houston i wondered if you have auto optics selected over o0 07 45 21 cml thats affirmative
roger looks like to us we need a proceed mike to get the sextant pointed at the star over
okay stand by
11 houston those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground over
okay im going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try
okay i have this star loud and clear now charlie so i might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count
roger stand by
it still looks like im far from the substellar point however im off quite a hit in roll
roger wed like you to mark right where it is now mike and wed like two sets of marks on this over
okay fine but the reticle is not parallel to the horizon id have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that
apollo 11 houston our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to he parallel over
well then were not at the substellar point if were not
roger
houston you copy that noun 49
roger we see it 11 stand by
apollo 11 houston we would like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter over
okay goss net 1 tape 62
do you need me to wait in the noun 49 display for shy length of time
negative
okay
okay charlie ill be glad to give you as many of these as you like
roger wed like six marks on star 45 mike and then well probably go back to star 2 again stand by well have further word on that
okay
they seem to be getting smaller charlie are you sure you wouldnt like some more
stand by mike
its no trouble
roger stand by out
apollo 11 houston wed like you to do two more on star 45 over
okay
okay charlie theres your two more marks where do you want to go from here
stand by
hello apollo 11 houston wed like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows roll 1952 pitch 1239 yaw 3400 mike thatll give you a trunnion angle of about 314 over
okay i understand star number 2 and roll 1952 pitch 1239 and yaw 3400 over
thats affirmative
okay
okay charlie im there and ive got a trun nion angle of 305 degrees again misaligned considerably in roll and i do believe thats important to getting good marks
stand by goss net 1 tape 63
see if my reticles not parallel then im not marking normal to the horizon and im not marking at the substellar point im marking off somewhere else
stand by one over
okay
apollo 11 houston the groundcomputed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what youre getting on the dsky there mike the horizon looks cocked off to you  you look like youre off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to to prevent lm reflection from fouling up your optics we feel like a you should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is over
okay
ill bet you a cup of coffee on it
copy
verb  noun 49 for you charlie
roger stand by
apollo 11 houston wed like to accept this one and give us two more and that will be enough over
okay
apollo 11 houston we see your termination on p23 thank you very much mike well have a were trying to work up a story here for you well be with you momentarily on an explanation of what s happening 0ver
okay charlie it just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else youre not at the substellar point youre off laterally and therefore youre measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should
seems so to me our procedures people are working on this and well be back with you momentarily over
thank you sir goss netl tape 64
hello apollo 11 houston wed like you to go p00 in accept well have a ptc refsmmat for you momentarily over

roger and lets see that is spiea menkent and what else
roger stars  codes are stars 26 30 and 24 over

roger
hello apollo 11 houston do you read over
hello apollo 11 houston if you read this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our comm in fact weve lost all data with you and unread able on the voice we recommend you do the p52 option 1 preferred 
 not a very good attitude at all for comm and as soon as we finish our alignment well maneuver it to a different attitude over
roger 11 we copy recommend you go to this p52 option 1 preferred and then go to ptc attitude over then well get some comm when you get there to ptc attitude itll he pitch 90 yaw 0 on the high gain over apollo 11 airt0gr0d voice transcription oss net 1 tape 71

negative we didnt ive got that in work im starting on p52
roger
houston apollo 11
go ahead 11 over
roger copy our torquing angles were about to torque them
roger stand by
roger the reason for delay chartie is that  difficult to find two stars that are not occulted by the lm and also are not in the midst of a manmade star field up here with dumps
roger we copy
hello apollo 11 houston you can torque the noun 93 over
okay 00 09 40 34 cml okay houston that completes the p52 we verified the third star with antares and auto optics are pointing at it pretty closely how do our platform drift angles look so far charlie

roger thank you
hello apollo ll houston while ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the auto drive on the high gain wed like you to position the antenna at pitch 30 yaw 270 go to reacq and that will give us narrow beamwidth over

roger weve started charging battery a and voltage started off a lot higher than i expected it was just a little bit shy of 40 it looks like its dropping down some now the battery charge holder seemed to me yesterday when we were doing this on battery c it started out initially and it went lower the battery charge holder over
roger stand by a second and ill get some reading on that
on charging battery a now its at about 393 and oh about 15 amps looks like its grad ually increasing in the

apollo 11 this is houston over
roger go head houston
roger mike weve got some comments on per formance of p23 for today if youtve got a minute to talk
hes all ears
yes go ahead
okay for today wed like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures and also one afterwards our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular readout in the sextant the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure ments equal to within 0003 degrees and of course move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today im  sure youre a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are but to ensure that youre getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon the sextant mline which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the rline should be parallel to the earth horizon at the substellar point and then the actual super imposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant above below or on the mline we recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after auto maneuver if you feel that the amount of time between the auto maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive or that you dont like that auto maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark of course you can use a verb 94  verb 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the auto maneuvers over
roger stand by one were going to stop ptc and then well talk about this p23
okay
ouston apollo 11 goj net 1 tape 162
go ahead 11 o1 00 02 13 cm okay were stopping ptc now and maneuvering to our p52 and optics cal attitude in regard to that p23 what i was trying to tell you yes terday was about that the mline is not any where parallel to the horizon at the roll pitch and yaw which you gave me to go to for the sub stellar point and i was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary
roger ll i guess in keeping the cups of coffee score why you get that one
well  okay  well this morning lets just see how close it comes to being parallel to the mline before we started marking for the first time it appeared that the computation of  of those three angles was somewhat off and that  was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the mline parallel in some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required and you all said that it wasnt needed so i was marking in some cases with the mline not parallel i thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data but as far as i know weve got to have the mline parallel to the horizon
roger 11 we dont have that capability we do require that the mline be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark we feel that possibly the  the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yes terday may have needed to be updated a little and if youll standby a second well give you an evaluation of what we feel youll get today by the auto maneuver
okay
houston apollo 11 over
go ahead 11
roger im getting ready to do an 02 fuel cell purge do you have any particulars on this and i assume you want these one at a thne or can i triple up over goznet 1 tape 163
wed like them one at a time and stand by i dont think we have any sequence you can do them in any order you want o100 l 23 cmp okay
and were watching you on  down here
houston apollo 11 you want to look at these noun 93s before i proceed on
yes please stand by a second
okay
11 this is houston on our tm here were only seeing values in two registers can you read us out the contents of register 3 please
register 3 minus three balls 24
roger minus three balls 24 and you can go ahead and proceed
okay proceeding at this time
11 houston after youve completed p52 wed like to uplinkyou a new state vector so we can start out clean on this p23 over
okay
houston are you observing the higher 02 flow on fuel cell 3
houston apollo 11 itts triggered the master alarm three times now there goes number 4 it goes up to about 14 then oscillates back down to about 11 over
roger we saw them 13 now on tm stand by a second
and were in po0 now for a state vector
roger give us accept please
roger done
11 houston on your 02 flow fuel cell 3 apparently it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge but the flow rate is acceptable over goss net i tape 164
roger it seems to be flowing a little bit more and actually putting out more current than the other two also over
roger we copy
ll this is houston weve completed the uplink the computer is yours you can go back to block
okay thank you
go ahead 11
houston 11 i dont believe we were calling you right then
roger out
houston apollo 11
apollo ll this is houston go ahead
roger im in a good attitude here to do  i have in the sextant this last p52 star star 37 is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas or do you want to go over to star 40
star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration and we havent noticed a verb 66 yet after our state vector uplink over
okay
when you move into p23 we recommend that you use the cmccomputed angles for your auto maneu ver and see how that works out if it doesnt bring you up with the mline parallel to the horizon to the substellar point we will see if we can get you some groundcomuted angles i guess the big thing here is to make sure that the mline is parallel o substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement over
yes i believe 0t 00 25 08 cc roger over
houston apollo tl marking on this star i get a noun 87 twice in a row of five balls so thats sufficient for a count
thats certainly very sufficient goss net 1 tape 165 lage72 1o0 29 40 cmp okay now i want to go to poo and i am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point okay
okay we recommend that for the first star if we gave you a new state vector wed like to try the cmccomputed angles for your auto maneuver
okay
and have you hit proceed on this display to enter the zero
not yet
okay
11 houston over tke past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure of co2 have you in fact changed the co2 canis ter yet this morning we dont need to do it right now wed just like to confirm it on our instrumentation  is in good shape over
no we havent changed any canisters this morn ing
okay then you can plan on accomplishing that after p23 is over and youve got the leb clear
ail right o1 o0 31 57 cp houston apollo 11 were in process of maneu vering to p23 in desired attitude it likes roll 837 pitch 6133 and yaw 33987 over o 00 32 13 cc roger we copy and that is for star 017
star 01 right near the horizon code 110
roger
houston apollo 11 on this star the auto maneuver works just fine i am right at the substellar point everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight it is just not visible
roger is this for star 017
thats correct goss net 1 tape 166
you are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision are you
well of course the earth is pretty bright and the black sky instead of being black has sort of a rosy glow to it the star unless it is a very bright one is probably lost somewhere in that glow but it is just not visible i maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon however even when i get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background it still is not visible
roger we copy standby a minute please
11 this is houston can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters
yes i will be glad to shaft 3312 and trunnion 3585
roger thank you o1 o0 45 35 cml its really a fantastic sight through that sex tant a minute ago during that auto maneuver the reticle swept across the mediterranean you could see all of north africa absolutely clear all of portugal spain southern france all of italy absolutely clear just a beautiful sight
roger we all envy you the view up there 01 0345 59 p but still no star il047 19 cc 11 this is houston over
roger go ahead bruce
on our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star however it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the i so that while you will be getting the earths horizon the star  is obscured by the lm we recommend an auto maneu ver to the attitudes penandinked into the flight plan roll 1772 pitch 2982 and yaw 3300 over 0net  tape 167 iav74

thats right i  i havent entered  i gave the  i gave it back to the computer for a second i put the mode switch from manual back to cmc while i fooled with the dsky and the computer drove the star off out of sight so the delay here has been in going back to manual and finding the star again which ive finally done and  just a second here ill go to enter and get a 51 and mark on it as i say for some reason the computer drove the star off out of sight

yes we see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down too
do you find that the monocular is any good to you buzz
yes it oud be nicr if it had other order of magnitude of power on it of course it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit and you might want to have some sort of a bracket i hate to use that word though
got an anticyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of brazil and some  well the diameter of it must be over 2000 miles across o1 03 19 i5 cc how does the weather look up in the southern part of the western hemisphere or up in the united states area 01 03 19 26 ivd well you all are just beginning to cone over the limb now i can see parts of central america and it looks to be fairly clear there te islands in the caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds looks like there is a system up to the  well off of greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest the east coast of the us is just coming into view now and it doesnt look too bad that i can see right now we my have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon over

houston apollo 11
go ahead 11 gofnjet 1 tape 186 o1 03 21 56 lp ive got a comment about the point on the earth where the suns rays reflect back up toward us in general the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and its bright and darker blue except for that region thats about oneeighth of an earths radius in diameter and in this circular area the blue of the water turns a grayish color and im sure thats where the suns rays are being reflected back on up toward us over
roger buzz we noticed the same thing its very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball you get this bright spot in the blue of the water and that turns it to sort of a grayish color
yes is there a nay term for that 01 03 23 0 cc laughing a lot of gray pint
il houston
go shead houston
mike are you satisfied with p23 now 01 03 25 23 cm yes im happy with the last updates we got you know in terms of what t did to oar state vector still not altogether happy with the various pro cedures if we could pick stars withir the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you cculd allow p23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that sub stellar point and then have that star visible that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it
how about the   01 03 26 1 lmp  correction on that last 
how about the horizon now is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy 01 03 26 2h cmp yes were far enough out now that the  i think the horizon definition variation is lost in the north
hey jim
go ahead buzz goss net l tape 187
looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when its in front of your eye and then you kind of float up next to it so that youre not touching it at all it has a very slow drift and you get a better  steadier view that way
sounds good
how does it feel to be airborne again buzz
well ill tell you ive been having a ball floating around inside here back and forth up to one place and back to another its lie being out side except more comfortable o1 ob 28 4 cc its a lot bigger than our last vehicle ot 03 28 c6 cm3  kept me busy im 
say again about buzz 
yes it sure is nice in here
i said its a lot bigger than the last ehiele that buzz and i were ia o1 03 28 1 cml oh yes its been nice ive been very busy so far im looking forward to taking the after noon off ive been cooking and sweeping and almost sewing and you know the usual little housekeeping things
it was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the nav station o1 03 28 4 cdr everything is right next to everything n this vehicle
not if youre in the 
jim its been a little warm in the machine through out yesterday and last night during the ptc it cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up and weve seen suit temperatures of about  the high 40s and cabin temperatures in the low 60s but this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side
i understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up but youre still a little bit warm do you have any moisture condensation or anthing like that on the wall goss net 1 tape 188
no we havent been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft it seems to be fine 01 03 29 0 lmp one of the hydrogen filters  the one that weve got on the hot water  seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it its flow rate is quite small right near the end of one out and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere
yes that hydrogen thing its  im not sure but i think its a backpressure problem if the thing sees any baekpressure at all like when the bag is attached well the flow rate will slowly de crease to where its almost zero and you wait and you wait and you wait for that last ouce you think you have its and you remove the bag and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there that appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted
understand
in general i think they do quite a good job especially on the guns in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles 01 03 31 f4 cc have the water temperatures been good are you getting hot water
yes it seems reasonably warm
we made three cups of coffee today the last one  you know when all the plumbing was warmed up the hydrogen gun and everything was warmest of the three i dont know who had that one neil did you have that one how was your coffee you didnt drink it till later 5id you anyway its pretty good its not piping hot but it sure beats stonecold coffee 01 03 31 9 cmp jim weve been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now how does the thruster firing activity look are you ready to go on with this ptc

roger put the waste management overboard drain valve to the dump position
right thats the one down on panel 251 also and well watch your 02 flow on telemetry down here
okay houston that configuration is set up
11 this is houston say again please goss net 1 tape 1810
you do have the 02 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished
okay understand you have opened the drain valve at this time
thats  its in du
roger were not getting telemetry data from you ribt due to low signal strength there it comes back i expect itll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in 02 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain over

roger were copying that
11 houston
go ahead
roger on that 20 flcwtransducer town here on telemetry our values are agreeing piety well with what you read out onboard and the eecomms have been noticing this cycle but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than waat we would expect were still working on the prcolem and well let you have a fore complete diagnosis on it in a little while
okkv it  tight fix then
we ru a tight ship
roger is that music i hear in the background

go ahead houston
roger ll weve been watching your activity on the dsky there and by selecting another major program with a verb 37 enter and all that we show you collapsing the deadband in ptc and having driven the cmc rate from 03 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second although of course with all the auto rcs coils shut off youre not firing any thrusters 0ver goss net 1 tape 193
okay what do you recommend
well you can just continue in your present con figuration in ptc however if you go to turn any thrusters on the cmc would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than con tinning with the ptc over
roger i understand
okay
and houston were just looking at you out our window here looks like theres a circulation of clouds that just moved east of houston over the gulf and florida area did that have any rain ir it this morning
roger our report from outside says that its raining out here sndlooks like youve got a pretty good eye for the weather there

apollo 11 this is houston aver
go ahead houston
11 this is houston as a result of our venting through the waste management drain weve con cluded that your 02 flow rate sensor is in fact malfunctioning i mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dbmp that even though it was moving probably indicating a higher flow rate it didnt seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough and based on that and the flow that were getting right now weve concluded that the transducer is malfmie tioning wed like to continue the 02 flow for about another hour shutting it off at about 3 hours get to get the 02 concentration in thj vehicles up vo  in the vehicles up bo where it will be acceptable for i checkout over
okay does it look to you like it just has a bias on it 01 05 59 15 cc roger 11 it does seem to be a bias looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating eecomm seems to thjmk though that for high flow rate purposes it wll still give you a relative indication during the mission over 0 06 00 lo cdr okay we understand thank you

roger i copy he didnt mention that stand by ill check again
hello ll houston the goldstone tv said that when you get a sharp vertical line on jhe picture when the horizontal banding goes across it does appear to bend it slightly the same s apollo 10 they said looks okay to them over 01 07 03 7 lmp okay understand its not our monitor it must be the transmitter or the system

roger we just had a really big thuderstozrm here about a hour age couple of storms around the area  over
yes i see one fairly large and isolated one there are couple of more off to the left but this one looks fairly good size it could very well be the one that just passed over you
roger 0i 07 25 34 lmp yes and it looks like the cape has been having a little bit of rain too 01 07 25 7 cc roger the one we had here came in from the west and is moving east  or nearly so as far as i could tell

roger
hello apollo 11 houston we got a tv attitude for you and also an update to your cmc erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist if you could break that out too over 01 08 25 6 lmp roger im not sure i caught all of that go ahead with what you have
roger 1t if youll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the csm we got an update to some of the erasable loads on page f220 over
okay be getting that out and you can give us the attitude for tv
roger 11 your tv attitude will be roll 261 pitch 090 yaw 000 high gain angle pitch plus 28 yaw 271 that puts the lefthand window pointed at the earth we recommend exit lng ptc with your updated procedure i the checklist over ot 08 26 29 lmp roger we copy roll 21  61 pitch 090 yaw 000 high gain pitch plus 28 yaw 271 and well like this with the deltav that we have in the book over o1 08 26 6 cc thats affiretive o1 08 27 l cmp chrlie apollo ll i have a couple oiquestions on stopping the ptc it seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be  were essentially of course at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch so its just a question of stopping at 260 roll roughly and  how about for a procedure going manual attitude three to rate command and then seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed ill turn on the panel 8 rcs thrusters at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in and if i do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll we should stop right there is tlaat suffi cient goss nei1 tape 213

roger mike wed like to see you go o accel coreand on the manual attitude switches then to turn on the auto rcs select switches and then go rate command that mill prevelt us from firing jets uncoupled over 01 08 33 36 cml okay fine and i would guess go rate command and roll first and then followed by pizch and yaw o1 08 33 5 cc okay that sounds good if  and when you get to the roll attitude desired just go rate command at that time and itll stop us right on
yes i agree charlie that sounds right
roger
hello apollo ll houston with some more words on exiting ptc over goss net 1 tape 214 01 08 39 18 cm go ahead charlie
roger mike when you were playing with the p37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down the dap assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at at that time since then weve drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to yo of going accel command turning on all of the ajto rcs select switches and then rate command it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and aw atti tude that it had when the deadband colapsed we can prevent that by  just immediately prior to going to rate command on the 5tanua1attitude switches if you cycle the spacecraft control switch to scs then back to cmc over 01 08 40 13 cm sounds like a winner 0i 08 40 14 cc okay 01 08 40 33 cm im not going to let these lm guys plsy with my dsky annore
you sound like youd better protect it it looks like just about anything that you do with that dsky is going to collapse that deadband back down ol 03 40 49 cm understand 01 08 43 14 cm charlie we just stabed to 261 degrees roll and it looks like whoever figured it clt did a good job its right there dabsmack in the middle of window number 1

california looks nice the san joaquin valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it you cant tell that its green it looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue
how does the mojave ook is it clear 01 08 50 26  yes as usual
roger the  around  01 08 50 29 lm it looks like theres some clouds just to the west of the sierras northeast ofbakesfield a little bit and crossing over into tile mojave from bakersfield looks clear and then as you get on further to the southeast of there theres a few clouds 01 08 50 z8 cc roger 11 can you pick out edwards in the sextant over

11 houston could you pick out anything around edwards a dry lake or anything over
negative charlie i just  i dont have that resolution but to give you some idea i can  on the lower texas coast i can see  knowing what im looking for i can see padre island i can just barely make out the fact that theres a thin spit of land and then theres a little dark zone which is the laguna madre between it and the mainland goss net l tape 216

okay thank you charlie
and also president nixon has reported  or declared a day of participation on monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface many state and city governments and businesses through out the country are also giving their employees the day off so it looks like ycure going to have a pretty large audience for the eva

hello apollo 11 houston we got the network all configured for the tv you can start any time you want over
okay 11 we have a picture we see the earth right in the center of the screen over
roger houston apollo 11 calling in from about 130 000 miles out and well zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can over o1 10 00 d6 cc roger
1 houston the definition is pretty good on our monitor here the color is not too  at least on this set could you describe what youre look ing at over
roger youre seeing earth as we see it out our lefthand window just a little moe than a half earth were looking at the eastern pacific ocean and the north half of the top half of the screen we can see north america alasxa united states canada mexico and central america south america becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow we can see the oceans with a definite blue cast see white bands of major cloud formations across the earth and can see coastlines pick out the wstern us san joaquin valley the sierra mountaia range the peninsula of baja california and we can see some cloud formations over southeastera us theres one definite mild storm southwest of alaska looks like about 500 to 1000 miles and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the  or a long ways off of the equator probably 45 degrees or mcre south latitude can pick out the browns in the land forms pretty well greens do not shot up very well some greens showing along the north eastern  northwestern coast of the united states and northwestern coast of canada
roger ll its a pretty good picture on clarity here were having  can you tell us  it appears to us that there are two distinct clou formations goss net 1 tape 223 trending eastwest one approximately about along the equator and one around 30 or so south latitude could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmsses over
yes they cross just south of the lower part of mexico probably through central amerfca that is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone the ether band which stands about 30 south correet appears to join the equator at the far left cr just beyond the horizon on the left edge of earth or at least it looks like its going to join it we dont have an explanation for that banding
roger nell thank you it also appears that just to the left of the terminator uy in the northern hemisphere theres a cloudbamd trend ing  a gap in the cloud trending nothwes southeast it appears to us that that comes in about over the northrnunited states or perhaps the central united states is that aleut correct over
i can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about but right now i cant get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shore line
roger
you guys are doing a good job its a real steady picture here wer  clarity is exellent the color its  the clouds are  the whites are distinct the rest if it looks like to me anyway on the monitor im observing is a fairly greenish blue is the way id describe it over
it appears that the   o1 i0 06 ll cdr well we cant observe much green fror the space craft
roger on this monitor the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a browl
well its true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50 000 miles out however the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast goss net l tape 224 although it is true that theyre tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer rge o1 10 07 ob cc roger 11 weve been  ive just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center over o1 l0 07 l cdr okay world hold on to your hat im going to turn you upsidedown 01 l0 07 j0 cc ll thats a pretty good roll there

roger
weve  ll weve lost our picture here now
okay apollo 11 houston weve got the picture back now goss net 1 tape 225

roger 11 wed like to perform a wastewater dump at your convenience some time in the near future here no particular time scheduled down air at the time for midcourse correction 3 which is about 53 55 were deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it for your information the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eighttenths of a foot per second that is 08 feet per second canceling this if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4 this would then give you a burn for midcourse cor rection 4 of 20 feet per second at 53 hours we have an imu realign p52 were requesting that you do this while in ptc and we plan to continue ptc throughout the day over

roger 11 the magnitudes of the midcourse corrections were just for your information but midcourse 4 was down around 20 feet per second again for your information on sp chamber pressure it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry and your value of 89 on board corresponds to 94 over
apollo 11 houston radio check on a new powm amplifier in our transmitter over
roger read you loud and clear how me over
roger loud and clear did you copy my notes on sps chamber pressure
negative
okay just for your information again it ap pears that your readout of 87 psi corresponds to our corrected tm readout of 92  thats 92 psi and 89 on board is really 94 psi over
roger i got that you were reading about 5 psi low
roger and are you ready for the consumables update
ready to copy
okay consumables update for get of 46 plus 00 minus 55 percent minus 65 percent minus 25 percent minus 75 percent minus 50 percent minus 2 pounds hydrogen plus t pound oxygen and that minus 55 percent on the rcs total corresponds to minus 66 pounds over

roger we copy 02 00 32 35 i24p houston apollo 11 weve got the continent of africa  facing toward us right now and of course everythings getting smaller and smaller as time goes on the mediterranean is completely clear the sun looks like its about to set around madagascar the equatorial belt of africa stands out quite clearly were seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of africa and of course the sahara northern coast of africa theres a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between afghanistan and pakistan its just about to go into the sunset now it is casting quite a large shadow its isolated there dont seem to be any other clouds  the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations over
roger 11 we copy your word description on that i understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between afghanistan and pakistan any estimate on how long that shadow would be over
it looks like its a shadow coming around to  back that way  
were getting a lot of background noise now also if you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in ptc i think things will get better
okay itvs coming around to the number 1 window well get you 
roger were hearing you
11 this is houston the noise on the comm seems to have quieted down now i guess that weve rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the earth out of view in your window over 0o0 37 17 lmp okay it looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the smleas the width of thlerim gulf goss ne 1 tape 315
okay we copy the width of the persian gulf and i guess that all i can give you firsthand is a a single isolated data point and that is that it was clear here in houston this mrning thats a pretty localized observation as a result of your wastewater dump it looks like the ptc mode has been disturbed somewhat were showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw which is sig nificantly greater about twice as much  a little more than twie as much as the deviation you had prior to the wastewater dap were watching it down here though and well let you know if we think any corrective action is required over
okay maybe we ought to  next time split that in half and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that
yes we could do that we were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on ic would be of the wastewater dump we dont re call ever having performed a wastewater dnp during ptc on previous missions over
well now we know

apollo il this is houston we lost you down in the noise on the comm link here about the time you were describing the singlecell cloud formation over afghanistanpakistan area through the sextant over
roger it came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development it must have gone up to over 50 000 feet though the eastern mediterranean is phenomenally clear you can see all the lakes the dead sea stood out quite well over
roger what appears to be the limit of reso lution through that sextant from your current position over 02 00 46 39 i24p well i cant see it right now its out side the field of view 0200 46 43 cc roger
and i dont know ow youd really describe the limit of resolution i will think about that a little
okay i guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack
well you can see the nile river going almost up to itssource the lake is obscured by clouds but you can trace it all the way on up
roger
i guess that is dom though isnt it
apollo 11 houston
go ahead houston
roger we have been working under the assump tion that it would take about an hour for the interference from a wastewater dump to dissi pate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort if you have a spare minute or two could you comment on the observation condition now over goss net 1 tape 322
yes stand by one bruce
okay
my guess would be the telescopes probably pretty useless but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions
okay mike i guess that weve still got  what you are saying is that weve still got a lot of water droplets visible but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant then
right i think so buzz is looking through it now just a second
okay 02 00 56 36  houston apollo 11 it looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any align ment theres actually very few  verticals
roger buzz how about the telescope is it useful now 02 00 57 02  well its not quite as useful it never sepm to be depending on the position of the sun its got that band that seems to go across the center i dont think its because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effective ness over
roger what  is this band something thats deposited on the outside of the optics over 02 00 57 31 i24p no i see the reflection fromthe sun
roger
the sun bounces off the lm structure with the lm attached that telescope is just about use less those star charts that mpad provided us i think would be most useful if we had to use the  if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope we could use those as a guide for what were looking at and say well that bright blob over there has got to be that star because thats the position were in but so far weve not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the imusing the telescope goss net t tape 323

  how do your read over
roger were reading you loud and clear
roger youre coming back a little scratchy itlooks like our 02 flow transducers gotten a good bit worse i just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling and it just barely registered  barely crept up above 02 over 02 o1 41 5 cc roger
ll this is houston at the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking we were on lowbitrate data and consequently not receiving the 02 flow parameter we expect that what youre seeing is probably nominal that is its probably what we would expect from a transducer thats malfunctioning probably in this fashion and its just going to keep on getting worse like that nothing to worry about well monitor things on the ground here over
okay it does look like its gradually degrad ing to about zilch

thats affirmative weve got it
okay i am going to go ahead and thrust then triangle difference is 001 but its sort of difficult at threetenths rate im required to use medium speed unresolved and its difficult to hold the star centered long enough to get a decent mark on it

roger are you having allydifficulties with gas in the food bags like tile10 crew reported
well thats intermittently affirmative bruce we have these two hydrogen filters which work fine as long as you dont hook them up to a food bag but the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the  the filters to start losing their efficiency a couple of times ive been tempted to go through that dry out procedure but we found that simply by leav ing the filters alone for a couple of hours their efficiency seems to be restored
roger we copy
their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the in dividual characteristics of the food bags were putting through them some of the food bags are so crimped near the entryway that theres no way we can work them loose to prevent back pres sure

hello houston go ahead
roger 11 as youve probably noticed your coning angle in ptc mode is increased substan tially as a result of the waste water dump the fuel cell purge and a natural coupling so it looks like we are going to have to terminate ptc here in a little while and wed like lo get your feeling as to whether youre still an ticipating trying to send back tv signals from inside the lm and if so well try tc provide an attitude that you can hold thatll give us high gain antenna lock on the earth during the tv and lm activation period over

houston apollo 11 do you read
houston apollo 11 how do you read on the high gain
11 how do you read me over 02 06 51 55 c read you loud and clear charlie we just switched to high gain and we stopped ptc at roll 263 pitch 90 yaw 0 how do you read
roger mike youre fiveby now on the high gain were right between the 0mni antennas and pretty horrible comm on the omnis we ot you fiveby on the high gain and we copy the ptc stoppage over
okay fine 02 06 52 35 cmtv houston were going to open the direct 0 valve and start pumping up the cabin
roger copy 02 06 53 0 cc apollo 11 houston were going to hnd over to goldstone for upink in about 2 milutes we might have a momentary dropout of conf4 over tss net 1 tape 356
alrighty can you hear our master alarm in the background thats 02 flow high coming through this amplifier op 06 5 7 cc roffcr copy
that photoelectric cell is a good device its worked very well
11 houston say again over
i say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device its working very well and its a nice pleasing tone
roger copy thank you 02 06 54 08 cml makes you almost glad to get master alarms
houston apollo 11 as a matter of curiosity our 02 flow meter is pegged fullscale high
roger 11 we copy that here over
okay 02 0y55 26 cmp boy that transducers working somewhat
roger
11 houston wed like to try to attempt to correlate your 02 flow in transducer with the flow valve that youve got open how far  how far open would you say you have the repress 02 0ver correction the direct 02 
stand by charlie
okay charlie its not open very far its hard to give you a good reading without shuntin it again but the arrow is at about the one oelock position now i reduce the flow and ill let it stabilize here right now our onboard readnt is about 04 and thats with the arrow in thc 02 valve at the two oclock position would you rather have comparisons of 02 flow readings or would you rather have valve position cmparisons
roger stand by
eecom4s say theyd 1lke to look at valve positions over goss net 1 tape 357
okay well were holding steady now at 03 pound per hour and our cabin pressure is about 54 and ill close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required
roger
its about 30 degrees of travel charlie from the closed position which is with the arrow pointing at about three to threethirty four oclock
roger
our flow is stabilized now at 06
roger we copy were reading the same
okay
yes open it back to the one oclock position
roger
is that enough different positions or you want more charlie
mike thats good  good enough were satisfied now over 0 06 58 42 cmp okay apollo 11 airt0groundvoice transcription goss net 1 tape 361
houston apollo 11 weve terminated direct 02 our cabin pressure is 57 and as a matter of curiosity when we turn the direct 02 valve off we get a master alarm just like they did ia the spacecraft testing
roger
11 houston we have a little update for you when you go into the lm wed like you to stow and bring back to the command module the following items over 02 07 02 35 cml ready to copy
roger wed like you to pick up the  out of the flight data file the surface checklist the mission rules nogo card the dps aps rcs limit cue card over
apollo 11 houston the reason we wanted you to bring those three items back well have some updates for you for those three over
roger we figured you would
apollo 11 houston were getting the tv at goldstone were not quite configured here at houston for the transmission well be up in a couple of minutes over
roger this is just for free lis isnt what we had in mind
roger
apollo 11 houston its a pretty good show here it looks like you most got the probe out
yes its loose now
can you see that
roger nell its really good
not much light up in that area but apparently the tv sets able to pick it up
there are some bright spots shining on the probe apparently sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out over goss net 1 tape 362
i think those are the tunnel lights
oh okay youre right
okay its loose now coming down
roger
looks like its a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber
you bet this is the only way 
you have to take it easy
its pretty massive but it goes where you direct it
11 houston thats a beautiful picture now weve got were looking at a 12second delay to us you are just bringing it down by the optics now
mike must have done a smooth job in that docking there isnt a dent or a mark on the probe
roger
were really getting a great picture here 11 over
11 houston with a 12foot cable we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the lm over
roger
we can see the probe now correction the drogue
roger
okay drogue removals coming next
roger as we suspected
11 houston now its a good view of the storage area under the couch
11 houston looks like youre pretty crowded in there with that drogue over goss net 1 tape 363
oh its not really bad
this tv cable is getting in the way
we see lots of arms
the only problem charlie is these tv stage hands dont know where they stand    02 07 25 27 cc well you got to really have a union card there we cant really complain too much i guess
apollo 11 houston do you have a little w j dot in the bottom of your monitor  tv monitor over 02 07 26 b9 lmp roger we do
roger i guess part of the cameras been burnt out down there these are really beautiful pic tures now buzz over real clear
okay we might have got just a little bit of sun in there is it just one small white dot
thats affirmative
we went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle charlie and its 205 degrees
roger copy 205 on the roll cal
and thats a plus
roger plus
11 houston the tunnel looks pretty clear to us somebody going up there now over
its mike checking his connectors up there now
roger
11 houston the lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time over
i think thats mostly the camera it  its subdued to say the least
roger its pretty  its gathering pretty well to us we see everything quite clearly up in there
well the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday everything up in there looks just fine goss ne5 1 tape 364
that sounds fine to us over
11 houston we can even read the decals up there on the lm hatch
well let me zoom it up and see how much you can read
okay
we can see the lm umbilical connection quite well there buzz we see you zooming in on one of the decals now its to reset unlatch handle latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes thats about all we can make out
hey you get an aplus
thank you very much sir at least i passed my eye test
im standing 6 feet from it charlie and you can read it better than i can theres some thing wrong with the system
roger
thats a real good view of the lm hatch handle there 11 0ver
roger
looks like well be ready to go into the lm early if thats okay with you all down there
roger its fine with us nell go ahead any time you wish over
11 houston the white spot you see on your monitor our tv people say it is a burn spot but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours over
roger thank you
okay the dump valve is actuated
roger copy 11 we see that very clearly is that you buzz with your hand on it
yes
roger goss net 1 tape 365
11 houston were really amazed at the quality of the picture pin the tunnel its really superb over 02 07 36 18  it is considering the amount of light up in there
roger were about to open our hatch now
roger
roger theres that same guy that when you open up the door why hes waiting there for you and he turns the lights on
how about that just like the refrigerator
buzz the view in through your  by your right  left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover the velcro on it and thats about all we can make out right now

we had a view buzz of the utility light cord 
now let me show you a view looking the other way

i think now i see the utility light still in the stowage bag hey thats a great shot right there we see you in there guess thats nell and mike better be anyway
we see you waving
ll houston thats really a beautiful shot i 02 07 41 46 cc 11 houston we didnt quite decipher that signal that just came from the cmp

stand by roger buzz that looks ood to um thank you much
it is the white index is it not that youre interested in comparing whether its in the red or green
stand by thats affirmative buzz it looks good thats a good reading for us over
okay
we had a shot moment  a moment ago oc the sut disconnect valve 02 07 42 58  ill open up the windows and see what the light ing conditions going to be like

hows the sun coming in hows the sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see

well lets  im turned around why i took the shade off my side first
roger we copy the light level for the tv is really excellent over
yes the lighting in the 124is very nice now just like completely daylight and everything is visible a good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier
roger we got a good view now neil of the deda and also buzzs aca
hey im pointing it at the front hatch now everything seems to be in place down there
roger we got the dump valves in view over
roger
11 houston we see you removing the isa now folding it up putting it up on the aot the instrument panels are coming into view behind
yes i think itd probably be best since weve done sps burn to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the plss on the recharge station would you care to comment on that one we could do either just as easily
stand by well have an answer for you momentarily
11 houston thats really a super shot of the main display goss nt 1 tape 368
the vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around its very clean

were going to go ahead and take all the moon data on back into the command module charlie
roger
apollo 11 houston buzz it appears that youre intending to put on the sun filter and view the sun through the aot over
yes unfortunately it looks like its down a little bit more towards  than i can be able to see in the aot
roger 02 07 52 15 lmi we ot a beautiful view of the sde of tlccom mand module out of the aot looknf n th ft rear detent
roger 02 07 52 24 i24p i can see the hatch and all the  all the eva handrails first time weve seen the silvery outside of the command module goss net 1 tape 369
i can read the letter on the hatch cover its a boost cover release and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening  place where the tool b goes
roger great shot now back down into the 
and left on the  
go ahead buzz over 02 07 1307 lmp say again
i was just saying we got a reat silotlookin back into the command module
okay and the left detent i can see the ao  or the rendezvous radar and i move to the for ward detent and thats about all ive got im looking eyeball to eyeball
roger
charlie is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open
stand by 02 07 54 17  we dont have  we dont have any circulation in here and it might get a little on the warm side
roger
well  well put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going
sounds like a good idea over
apollo 11 houston as far as the window shades go in this lm theres nothing except for crew comfort i dont think weve got any systems problem be sure to put them back up when you egress over
that we will do
charlie ill give you a view out of the over head window back looking at the command module righthand rendezvous window goss nt1 tape 3610
roger
well we see it now thanks a lot buzz thats a good view through the overhead
one washer on 
one washers on by the overhead
roger
there we go we got it now
there wasnt very much debris in the commsnd module or the lm we found very few loose par ticles of bolts nuts and screws and lint and things very few in each spacecraft they were very clean
roger sounds good
11 houston we have a good view out off the i rendezvous  correction the overhead window off i the lm we dont see anybody starin hack at us though over
charlie can you see mikes two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window
11 houston stand by we havent picked him up yet
you are looking through a lot of layers of glass
11 houston we had a  
 on my monitor
we had a slight glimpse of mike in the rendezvous window at that time its pretty murky lookn into there though 02 07 59 48 lm okay tierehe is ive ot him iw olhim on the monitor now
okay we see him staring back at us now hello in there
apollo 11 houston our recommendation for the isa is to stow it back over the instrument panel over
roger will do goss li tape3611
11 houston we can make out the markings on the panel we read system a ascent fuel ascent oxidizer quad 1 quad 4 the  its really unbelievable the definition were getting down here off that little camera over
we can even see the barber pole of the talkbacks
we can read the markings on the irstruments for the glycol pressure quantity pcc2 you can even read the scale on the eight ball over
11 houston we see the crossfeed barber pole and we have the velcro patches back up to the rcs systems now we can see the markings on the meters green and red bands in limits
we see you raised the cover on the abort stage we dont recommend that
yes were going to tape that one over o8 cc i 02 03 35 roger 02 08 03 36  were going to tape that one over
we concur
the restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down
roger we havent quite got that before the 50 000 000 tv audience yet
11 houston thats a good view of the eight ball we see  you can even read the off fla there
you can see the signal strength meter for the radar read the numbers on it
houston did you want us to test the cameras in the lm and  i was wondering about that i saw it in the flight plan but im just wondering if you want to do that on csm power or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the csm and test them there over
stand by buzz
as an alternative to that why we could wait loi day and do it then when we transfer over to lm power goss net 1 tape 3612
roger stand by well have an aaswer
11 houston on that tv our commentary  the monitor i was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter it was probably  you thought i was crazy but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it 11 houston  
we understood that carlie
okay on the lm cameras wed like you to do it on loi day with the lm power over
okay thats what well do
houston were showing you something that came out of the commanders checklist stowage packet its got a 16millimeter camera in it and its got this little cylinder and i guess  i dont understand what it is maybe you can tell us
roger stand by we cant figure it out either
its got an arrow on the back and it says turn but im afraid to turn it
11 your friendly geologist says its the camera cank crank excuse me for the 16sequence camera if it jams over
ail very well thank you
theres that word again the ancillary stowage container
roger
the shades couldnt quite hack it there tzz over
houston 11 are you still getting high bit rate off the omnis at this distance
stand by mike
apollo 11 houston about 50 percent of the time were getting high bit rate off the omnis when youre in ptc over
okay thank you
youre welcome goss net 1 tape 3613
apollo 11 houston neil at this attitude you look like youre about 12 feet long
it seems like i always find myself upsidedown in whatever im doing around here
apollo 11 houston could you give us a few com ments on your crew comfort with the csm hoses moving the air around over
well its picking up a little bit on circulation in here
what do you estimate the temperature is buzz over
oh id say maybe 73 75
roger
its hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas but comfort level is about the  about the same as the command module
you probably  
it was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in but it seems to be improving
houston copies out
11 houston
you may be able to see some

  some particles jumping around on your screen thats just dust particles that are being illumi nated by sun shafting in the window
roger theyre very clear now over and thats a good view of neils  correction of buzzs ci cuit breaker panel there 02 08 15 50 lmi i can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from the position on the righthand window
roger
11 houston our view of the panel 11 is  gets brighter then darker are you changing the fstop at all over gossnet t tape3614
no whats happening is we get pretty close to the window now and then and it drives the automatic light control into the stop i think
i think thats right
yes i had the switch on outside while i was going through the overhead window that may be whats contributing to some of it
roger
11 houston we seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now we see them quite clearly in the screen now over
yes im choking on one every so often
11 houston your show is going out to the us now were about to get the satellite up itll be transmitted to some other countries after that over
roger im checking out this window bracket where ill be puttinm it for the eva pictures of neil going down the ladder
roger
apollo 11 houston we keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture its really difficult to describe its  its just perfect over
and 11 it doesnt look llke youre having too much trouble with that bracket up there buzz 02 08 18 41 i24p ill tell you those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight 02 08 1850 cc roger
11 houston buzz how does the alignment look there
it looks pretty good as well as i can tell without the gear extended i cant get a real definitive answer but you couldnt fix it any place to see much more out of the window without handholding it for the whole time
roger looks like to us its going to work real well goss ne1 tape 3615
give it enough room to  yes i think so
buzz we see you putting your window guard in place there and back upto the isa now

roger neil its really a super picture weve got the aca your aca the picture of the throttle the 90degree bracket we see your handles and now over to the bracket
thats about the position well be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder and itll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the eva
houston copies out thats a rea mood view of that camera
our monitor is a little bit wavy so its hard for us to tell when were  when weve got a steady picture for you
11 we have no complaints at all we dont see that waviness on our picture its just really great over
do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you
thats affirmative
okay they dont in our monitor and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera which probably arent required sometimes goss net 1 tape 3616
buzz we have no complaints at ali its a magnificent picture
what was that buzz youre chasing now
that was  that was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera there
roger nell we got it it appears to us that neils about to check the velcro mat there
okay buzz we see the card up now
okay for those of you that dont know this is where we log most of our data for each of the lm maneuvers and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard and its on this timeline that we have all our pro cedures but we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g so we make use of the velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures
roger
and were ready to copy doi pad
roger well have the fidos work that one up for you momentarily
ll houston that was a good shot of panel 2 now we got panel 3 in view with the temp monitor switch the stabilization  station and control panel we see now with the mode control switches now over to the rendezvous radar real good
11 thats real good camera work
thatll be the most unusual position a cameramans ever had hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upsidedown
roger well youre doing a super job we got a good view of the cross pointer tlare had a good view of the tape meter goss net 1 tape 3617
were giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin i think you can see the  one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center and on each side we have the two helmet visors ill remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like

well cage them both
roger
like old home week charlie to get back in the lm again
roger i can imagine
the traverse from the bottom of the lm to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16 20 feet its not a disorienting one at all but its most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel
roger must be some experience is collins going to go in and look around
were willing to let him go but he hasnt come up with the price of the ticket yet
roger id advise him to keep his hands off the switches
if i can get him to keep his hands off my dsky itd be a fair swap
roger goss net 1 tape 372 02 08 3 18 cml thats why ive been eating so much today 1 havent had anything to do he wont let me touch it any more
roger
11 houston if thats not the earth were in trouble
thats the earth and we have a very good view of it today there are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you but its a beautiful sight
we have some horizontal banding in our tv monitor are we transmitting that to you or do you have a clear picture
neil we have a very clear picture the only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen which is  our tv guys say is an  apparently a burned out spot in the camera but it should come back over
roger we have that in our monitor also
11 houston we do have three lines across our tv i thought it was just a transmission problem but everybodys telling me now that its prob ably  its on the downlink over

hello apollo 11 houston we have some updates and some things wed like to talk to you about if you arent in the middle of your meal if it convenient anytime for you were ready with some updates over
what  what are the updates going to apply to
roger we have a couple of changes on the  mission rules nogo for your nogo card neil one slight change on the apsdps fuel and temp pressure card and we have a change tc the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check which is to be formed at  performd at 71 hours tomorrow and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place over
okay is any of those in the flight plan the secondary radiator for example
thats affirmative the secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20 that procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 29 l29 wed like to change that procedure over 02 10 3 08 cdr okay stand by
charlie on the secondary leak check just read it verbatim like you want and ill copy directly into the flight plan and not fool around with the checklist
roger thats fine if youre ready to copy stand by
ready to copy on the leak check
roger its monitor secondary accumulator quantity step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve normal for 30 seconds then bypass if no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity  are you with me
yes im with you
okay if no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity secondary glycol to radiator valve to normal next step secondary coolant loop pump goss net 1 tape 383 ac1 or ac2 after 3 minutes verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig also verify secondary evap out temp has changed next step secondary coolant loop pump off secondary glycol to radiator valve bypass that ends the procedure over
okay i read back monitor secondary accumulator quantity secondary glycol radiator valve norml for 30 seconds then to bypass if no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity secondary glycol to radiator valve to normal secondary coolant loop pump ac1 or 2 after 3 minutes wif glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 5 psion verify secondary evaporator outlet tem has chnged secondary coolant loop pump off secondary glycol radiator valve to bypass and whats the reason or the change charlie
roger stan is concerned that our present proced  as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator and it  they want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator over
okay they have any abnormal indications in that system so far
negative this is the procedure that they came up with its just a check mike everythings looking great to us over
okay fine
charlie well get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes okay
roger neil no hurry over
11 houston were wondering whos on horn
say again houston
we just had a little music there 02 11 11 21 cml well keep you entertained
roger that was good you can keep it coming down 11
okay goss net 1 tape 384
because its a special occasion today houston this is the third anniversary of gemini 10
roger happy anniversary
thank you sir
houston apollo 11 ready to copy your update
roger stand by
okay buzz the first item is that we have indica tions that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position if youll check we chink that the intermediatescale landing site oblique is stowed in the csm lunar landmark book we think that the largescale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the 4 lunar surface map book over
i think i heard you charlie but im not sure that i understand
roger according to our stowage list the  the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag in  but in the backup set of data the intermediatescale oblique is in the csm lunar landmark book and the largescale oblique is in the back of the lm lunar surface map book and thats the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are over
okay weve got three obliques the last one is one i asked for recently its just a blowup of the second one the first one is one thats got dotted lines on it indicating horizon view and 50degree lpd and all three of those are in the transfer book over
roger fine we were wrong in our  in our backup set we had those out of place looks like the onboad datas good we just wanted to let you check on that one we have an update on the apsdps fuel card that you place on the panel its a typo error if youll break out that little card weve got the  correct that typo error over
stand by
okay i got it  goss i1 1 tape 385
roger buzz under the dps column on the pressure side you go down to the fourth item says pres sure greater than 150 ptca should be greater than 65 percent over
okay thats greater than 18 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65
thats affirmative out
and we have three items on the mission rules nogo card if youre ready to copy those over
okay ive got the mission rules nogo
roger buzz first entrys on the eps under ac bus a the line extends all the way to high gate actually the line should read  at doi it would be nogo ac bus a after that the nogo would be both buses so if you will just pencil in both buses from pdi through high gate itll be correct for that llne over
okay ive got that ac bus a for doi and both buses nogo for pdi on
thats affirmative up until high gate you can stop at the line in front of the column 5 minutes to iow gate now the next line is under the gc pgns pitch and roll gdas you can scratch that line completely over 02 11 25 56 irp roger got it
okay buzz last entry is down under rcs nadits a typo error under the three  in the line three axis attitude control if you proceed to the right at pdi plus 05 youll see one axis the line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown thats incorrect the line should stop under 5 min utes to low gate over
okay were stopping that at 5 minutes to low gate
thats affirmative that completes that card the rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58hour platform  look at the platform we are really good shape your gyros have almost no drift in them since  plotted update we were looking at x of a minus 224  goss net 1 tape 386 5 of point plus 087 z of minus 011 since the apdate which was based on the 52hour p52 i oelieve we gave you an x drift of plus 079 yaw of plus 106 z of plus 002  i can see the difference between the 52hour and the 57hour alignments were  did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check so were real satisfied with the way the gyros are looking the pipas are looking great also we are in real good shape with those too over
this is apollo 1t radio check
roger reading you fiveby how me over
okay loud and clear you cut out when you were talking about the platform  something about 52 hours and after that we never heard you again
roger guess we were changing antennas stand by thats affirmative 11 we were swapping antennas on you down here basically the word is that we have a real good platform very small drift on the gyros and very small drift in the pipas over
roger thank you and i would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the rcs  what that change of pitch may mean
copy a few words of clarification on the rcs oh roger the update there neil you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate
yes thats right im not quite sure what that  means beyond 5 minutes
stand by ill make sure i got my story straight with control stand by
okay
11 houston on the rcs what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate we would recommend an abort this would require a  a loss of  of two distinct jets which is not very probable but that is what we are recommending after low gate we would continue on we would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing over goss net 1 tape 387
roger i think i 
roger
charlie did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book
apollo 11 say again you were cut out over
roger did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book over
negative at this time we do not have an updates for the lunar surface book we wanted you to have it just in case over
roger you were cut out that time
roger at the present time we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book we are thinking about some and kicking them around but theyre very minor changes over
11 houston did you copy that transmission
apollo 11 houston we swapped antennas on you again i say again that we do not have any lunar surface update  book updates at this time were considering a few minor ones but were still kicking them around the mocr over

i didnt understand that say again
roger were looking at a  sort of a funny looking ptc weve already drifted out to 70 de grees in pitch and were wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off over goss net 1 tape 392
iegative charlie we dont know of anything
roger 02 1 51 13 cmp unless its got something to do with that entry from the position that we want to be in i dont know

thats negative mike if youll look at the plot which well save for you and let you see it postflight it started off immediately on the first rev and just spiraled out to about  oh 20 to  20 degrees in pitch and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees but we didnt want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point we thought it might diverge and so we called you and started over again over goss net 1 tape 395 02 12 5 39 cmp okay no complaints i was just curious as to what had happened apollo 11 airt0ground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 401 rest period  no communications apollo 11 artoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 411 rest period  no communications apollo 11 aiftoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 421 rest period  no communications apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 431 rest period  no communications apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 441 rest period  no communications apollo 11 ailstoground voice transcription goss net 1 hbate 451

roger 75 75 and 65 and i got a few words for you here on the sps engine performance over 02 23 24 14 iap okay were ready to listen
okay 11 it turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests the onboard pc reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what youve actually got in the chamber and what youre reading out on the gage we expect singlebank operation to be 90  that is 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi in dualbank operation the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual and we recommend that you stick to an loi termination cue of 80 psi on the gage that is no change to the mission rules over

roger 11 were reading you loud and clear now we were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago over
roger what sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona weve got the sun right behind the edge of the moon now
roger
its quite an erie sight there is a very marked threedimensional aspect of having the uns corona coming from behind the moon the way it is
roger 02 23 34 31 i24p and it looks as though  i guess whats giving it that threedimensional effect is the earthshine i can see tycho fairly clearly  at least if im right sideup i believe its tycho in moonshine  i mean in earthshine and of course i can see the sky is lit all the way around the moon even on the limb of it where theres no earthshine or sunshine
apollo 11 this is houston over
go ahead
roger if youd like to take some pictures we recommend using magazine uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film interior lights off electric hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens and youre going to have to handhold us i guess were recommending an fstop of 28 and wed like to get a sequence of time exposures over 02 23 36 24 imp okay you want magazine uniform instead of magazine tango  over
roger were not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here this is on a nottointerfere basis of course over 02 23 36 43 imp okay
and on the exposures were looking for an eighth of a second a half a second and if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures 2 seconds 4 seconds and 8 sec onds over 02 23 37 11  roger we copy kgoslgt l tape 465

okay stand by one on those switches well get them in a minute
roger and how far out can you see the corona extending over i
 bit like zodiacal light it keeps going out farther and farther well talk about it a little more later
roger out
 weve got quite a few pictures  02 23 4h 06 cc apollo ll this is houston i think we have comm again we heard you calling over
apollo 11 this is houston were you calling over 02 23 44 48  houston apollo 11 understand you want the heaters off for hydrogen tank i and oxygen tank 1 is that affirmat ire 
thats negative mike hydrogen tank number 2 heaters off and oxygen tank number i heaters off
okay
roger out
i have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters off i have oxygen tank number i heaters off
roger out
houston apollo 11 the earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it gossnet 1 tape 466
oh very good
and houston id suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location the bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius
roger understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic and the bright light extends out approximately oneeighth to onequarter lunar radius over
thats two lunar  two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part right a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out and thats perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the south pole
roger
houston its been a real change for us now we are able to see stars again and recognize con stellations for the first time on the trip its  the sky is full of stars just like the nightside of earth but all the way here we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular but not recognize any star patterns
i guess it has turned into night up there really hasnt it
really has

apollo 11 this is houston how do you read over
okay we went to high gain looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there
roger we missed an 0mni switch there over
all right on the secondary loop check when we went to flow on the secondary radiators the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first l0 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds oss net l tape 267
apollo tl this is houston we believe that is normal system operation the radiators are ex pected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid over
okay we will go ahestwith the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity right
roger press on apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 471
and houston the secondary radiator flow check is complete andsatisfactory

roger 03 04 38 lb cc and jim is smiling
apollo 11 this is houston over 03 04 41 b5 cdr go ahead 03 04 41 b7 cc ll houston during your sps burn as played back on tape down here weve observed the nitrogen tank bravo pressure in the sps system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated its holding steady right now well continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up over
roger thank you
right and it has held steady  
currently going over maskelyne mas 
okay
and boothill duke island sidewinder looking at maskelyne w thatls the yaw round checkpoint and just coming into the terminator at the terminator its ashen and gray as you get further away from the terminator it gets to be s   tape 495 a lighter gray and as you get closer to the sub solar point you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground according to the last apollo 11 observation anyway
roger 11 were recording your comments for posterity
laughter okay
did somebody in the background  do they accuse us of being compromisers huh
and landing site is well into the dark here i dont think were going to be able to see any thing of the landing site this early
apollo 11 this is houston when you have a free minute could you give us your onboard readout of n2 tank bravo please and wed like to make sure you understand that ever since you stopped thrusting with the sps the temperature in this tank has remained steady over make that the pressure has remained steady
roger we understand tank pressure has stayed steady thank you
roger were showing the n2 tank pressure and the tank bravo to he 1960 something like that and alfa is oh about 2250 over i
roger we show 2249 in alfa and 1946 down here
all right 03 04 53 19 cml houston apollo 11 how about coming up with some roll pitch and yaw angles in which to stop this socalled orb rate that im doing
roger standby
well have them for you in a minute ii
okay and time to stop also please
yes indeed
apollo 11 this is houston over iei1 tl4o
go ahead houston
roger we show you in the flight plan staying in orbital rate until about 79 hours 10 minutes do you have some particular attitude or reason for wanting to go inertial over aiollo 11 airiyjghound voicetinsciiption goss net 1 tape 501
no thats fine i just wanted to confirm that until 79 10 then well breeze around here in orbit
roger and weve got an observation you can make if you have some time up there theres been some lunar transient eents reported in the vi cinity of aristarchus over
roger we just went into spacecraft darkness until then why we couldnt see a thing down below us but now with earthshine tne visibility is pretty fair looking back behind me now i can see the corona from where the sun has just set and well get out the map and see what we can find around aristarchus 03 04 57 54 cdy were coming upon aristarchus right now  
  okay aristarchus is at angle echo 9 on your ato chart its about 394 miles nortd of track however at your present altitude which is about 167 nautical miles it ought to be over  that is within view of your horizon 23 degrees north 47 west take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there over
both looking
roger out 03 05 03 o1 p houston 11 it might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing o 45 west 03 05 03 9 cc say again please 11
you might give us a time of crossing of 45 west and then well know when to start searching for aristarchus
roger youll be crossing 45 west at 77 04 l0 or bout 40 seconds from now over thirty seconds from now
okay
apollo 11 when we lose the sband wed like to get 0mni charlie from you and update my last that 77 04 was the time when aristarchus should goss net 1 tape 502 become visible over your horizon 77 12 is point of closest approach south of it over 03 05 05 14 lm okay that sounds better because we just went by copernicus a little bit ago
roger we show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now
righto
houston when a star sets up here theres no doubt about it one instant its there and the next instant its just completely gone
· roger we copy
apollo 11 this is houston we request you use omni charlie at this time over 03 05 09 29 lmt okay going to omni carlie
roger out
houston apollo 11
apollo ll this is houston go ahead
roger seems to me since we know orbits so precisely and know where the stars are so pre cisely and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon 
roger
hey houston im looking north up toward aristarchu now and i cant really tell at that distance whether i am really looking at aristarchus but theres an area that is considerably more iltuininated than the surrounding area it just has  seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it a crater can be seen and the rea around the crater is quite bright
roger 11 we copy
houston apollo 11 looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine im not sure whether it was worked dotsnet 1 tape 503 out to be about zero phase to  well at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others and that one  if we are lining up with the earth cor rectly does seem to put it about at zero phase that area is definitely lighter than anything else that i could see out this window i am not sure that i am really identifying any phos phorescence but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood
11 this is houston can you discern any differ ence in color of the illumination and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater over 03 05 15 34 cmt roger thats an inner wall of the crater 03 05 15 43 tjv no there doesnt appear to be any color involved in it bruce
roger you said inner wall would that be the inner edge of the northern surface 03 05 16 o0 cm i guess it would be he inner edge of the west northwest part the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the earth
11 houston have you used the monocllaron this over 03 05 16 28 lm stand by one
roger like you to know this quest for science has caused me to lose my ememory program its in here somewhere but i cant find it 0 05 18 08 cc 11 this is houston were  were hering only a partial comm say again please
i think 
houston we will give it a try if we have the opportunity on next  when we are not in the middle of lunch and trying to find the monocular
roger copied you that time expect in the next rev you will probably be getting ready for loi2
so lets wind this up and since weve got some other things to talk to you about in a few minutes over goss net 1 tape 504 03 05 19 19  okay
apollo 11 this is houston over
go ahead houston
11 this is houston were targeting  planning to make the loi2 burn now using bank a only well have the pdand everything for you next time around just trying to economi e a little on bank b bank b is holding thoug
roger understand
apollo 11 this is houston over
go ahead
11 houston in order to improve the communi cations a little bit here wed like to try to get you on the highgain antenna were recom mending a ditch angle of o yaw 355  i say again 355 the track switch to manual and wide beam wi dth over
okay you ready to switch to high gain now
thats affirmative
11 houston do you read
roger we read you it seems to be rather mar ginal on the high gain
roger we concur 03 05 33 42 lr houston apollo 1t could you give us a time of crossing the prime meridian 150 west over
roger stand by about a half a second here okay your time of crossing the 150 west merid ian will be 77 50 05 over 03 05 34 10 if2 thank you sossnetl tape505
11 this is houston we have about 6 minutes remaining until los and in order that we may configure our ground lines wed like to know if youre still planning to have the tv up with the beginning of the next pass over 03 05 34 48 cdb roger houston well try to have it ready
this is houston we are inquiring if it is your plan to over 03 05 35 00 cdf it never was our plan to but its in the flight plan so i guess well do it
houston roger out
11 houston 03 05 35 53 cmt roger go ahead
for use in connection with the prime mridian crossing you have an orbital period now of 2 hours 8 minutes and 37 seconds over
thank you
roger out
apollo 11 this is houston a little over 2 min utes to los all your systems parameters and orbit are looking good from the ground we have aos on the other side at 78 23 31 over
roger 78 23 21
roger that was 31 on the end 03 05 38 50 cml okay 03 06 03  begin lunar rev 2
apollo 11 this is houston over goss net l tape 506
this is apollo ll are you picking up our sig nals okay 03 06 24 lb cc apollo ll this is houston affirmative we are reading you loud and clear on voice and we have a good clear tv picture a little bright crater in the  
  no no no  
  the bottom of the picture i guess thats the spot on the tube 03 06 24 b0 lmt im sorry about that one
and if you give us po0 and accept we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you
okay
houston apollo 11 one of the larger craters on the back side  i noticed a small dark speck on the outer wall and i put the monocular on it i was able to see  oh an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter it was really a fresh looking darkcolored pit and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these  es pecially the one that caught my attention quite remarkable over
roger do you have a location on that one 03 06 26 34 lm no not a precise one ive got several pictures of it though
roger we copy
were getting a beautiful picture in down there now 11 the colors coming in quite clearly and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space and without getting into the question of grays and browns it looks at least on our monitor sort of a brownishgray
thats a good reasonable way of describing it it appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows it makes a difference which one youre looking out of for example the camera goss net 1 tape 507 right now is looking out the number 5 window and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle over
roger 03 06 27 53 lm and if you rear back 95 or 100 degrees 
 still holding  okay
say again 117
id say were about 95 degrees east coming up on smyths sea
roger and for your information we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now
okay 03 06 28 92 cmp houston apollo 11 could you observe a differ ence in the n2 pressures before loi it seems to me as though the cwo were not equal on the  b tank was a little ow on pressure over
im flying it in sps minimum impulse houston and its rather difficult to keep it on a constant data the lm wants to wander up and down im not sure if its in response to masconns or what but i can get it completely stabilized in data and let it alone and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate
this is houston roger
houston well be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window and well try and pick up some of the landmarks that well be looking at as we approach the powered descent over
11 this is houston roger and were through with the uplinks the computer is yours you can go to block and well have the information on nitrogen for you shortly over
roger copy
okay houston several minutes ago i was exactly steady on data and since then i have been moving goss net 1 tape 508 toward the lm pointed straight down toward the radius vector and thats been despite a number of down minimumpitch impulses
roger
were over smyths sea right now
roger i i apollotlairtoground voice trajiscription goss net l tape 511 03 06 30 56 cml were about 88 degrees east i would estimate
we show you about south of the  southwest of the crater jansky right now 03 06 31 28  smyth sea doesnt look much like a sea it  the area which is devoid of craters of which theres not very much is sort of a hilly looking area its not like the maria at all
roger we copy that about the sea and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater neper the large crater on the left and jansky on the right
we think youre close but no cigar
ll this is houston would you care tccomment on some of these craters as we go by
roger were approaching the approach path to ignition this is equivalent to 13 milutes before ignition and were at about 83 degrees i guess  83 degrees east that correspond to location yore holding there presently
roger were showing your present position as about 7t  76 degreem east looking back towards the east 3 06 34 i6 cmp hey you should be looking back at smyth sea now l
roger
okay  ob 06 3 25 cmp houston what youre seeing in the middle of th screen now is the crater schubert and gilbert u is in the center right now and this comes up at about a little over 12minutes before power decent instead of me looking  instead of looking back at it wed be looking straight down at it in descent 03 0634 50 cc roger 03 06 3k 55 cc and we show you at an altitude now of about ll0 miles and of course youll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent f    gozs net 1 tape 512
okay houston look at register 3 on the dsky data this data is increasing toward my desired of 315 and ill let the hand controller alone here and ill bet you it reverses itself
roger 11 were watching the dsky now and its still coming in beautifully on the tv 03 06 35 59 lap okay theres  on the right side of the screen at the present time theres a triple crater with  with a small crater between the first and second and the one at the bottom of the screen is schubert y zoom in it does have a central peak in schubert y actually several of them and you can observe those plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen 03 06 336 c roger were seeing the central pea quite clearly now 03 06 b6 53 i5 okay were zooming in now on a crater called schubert n schubert n very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat
look at data on the dsky its stabilized and is holding steady now
roger 03 06 3v 20 i4p looking out the window i can see a number of small craters on the bottom of schubert n 03 06 37 32 cm were coming up on the foaming sea where ill be doing some p22 marking on a crater oi my choice name of crater camp
okay wetll be watching for neper 03 06 37 49 clp and notice register 3 has reversed itself and its heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing
roger mike we confirm that youve changed the direction of your pitch rate
generally speaking   03 06 38 30 lm the crater  
  the tendency seems to be to pull the lm down toward the center of the moon there as in a gravity gradient experiment goss net 1 tape 513
roger 11 we copy  
it may have something to do with masscons or it may  
roger we copy  03 06 38 47 lmt  03 06 38 48 cm it may have something to do with masscons or it may just be the peculiarity of the dsky display
okay weve observed the behavior of your dsky and i think weve got the data here to work on it let us grind around a little while on it and well report back to you probably in a rev or two
okay well in the meantime im going to pitch down toward 315
roger 03 06 39 25  three craters  three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track the righthand is the largest crater that you see dubiago p q3 06 39 49 cc roger we concur on the identification of that crater
and we show you coming up on landmark alfa 1 here shortly 03 06 40 11 hmp roger mkes having his first look a alfa 1 at the present time
yea its a very bright crater its not a large one but an extremely bright one it looks like a very recent and i would guess impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my correction  the foaming sea easy to see coming up on it now crater camp is one of the smaller ones out on the  on the floor of the foming sea
here we show you over the sea of fertility now and we ought to have langrenus down south of track a few degrees about 9 degrees south of track gossnet l tape514 03 06 41 48 iap now the crater thats in the center of the screen now is webb wed be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent it has a relatively flat bottom to the crater and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in tilebottom of it on the western wall the wall thats now nearest the  the camera near the bottom of the screen we can see a dimple crater just on the outside and then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left you can see a series of depressions its this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why theyre in the particular pattern that theyre in ill zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it
roger were observing the dimple crater now the central peak we can see on the orbiter photos doesnt seem to stand out very well here
well theyre not central peaks theyre depres sions in the center
roger 05 06 4 08 cm and youll notice on the pitch thruster activity ive still  ive put in a dozen mininum impulses in pttchdown and im still far from correcting back to 315 03 06 43 20 lmf were moving the camera over to the rght window now o give you langrenus its  its several central peaks and 
roger we got langrenus in our screen now
okay ll this is houston were getting a beautiful picture of langrenus now with its rther conspicuous central peak
the sea of fertility doesnt look very fertile to me i dont know who named it
well it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after langrenus langrenus was a cartographer to the king of spain and made one of the  one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the moon
roger thats very interesting   goss net l tape 515
 at least it sounds better for our purposes than the sea of crises
amen to that
okay it looks like youre coming inside now on the camera
well i cant get behind to see the monitor ill bring the focus in but were going to be looking down past one of the lm quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that well be seeing coming in now i guess theres maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent 03 06 45 37 lm all right that should put the i structure about in focus and im going to move it out to infin ity and then expand the field of view
crater secchi is out my window now window num ber 2
hello apollo ll this is houston we show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53 about 7 min utes from now and weve also got the loi2 and tei5 pads ready for you after the tv whenever you want to terminate over
roger
and were getting a good view of the track lead ing into the landing site now and 
okay and it looks like we got secchi k went by about l0 seconds ago coming up on apollo ridge 
and in the righthand portion of our screen right now we can see messier alfa and bravo with the lightcolored rays streaming off in oedirection 03 06 48 00 lm i dont know if you can make out but in the sea of fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible old old cra ters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen goss net 1 tape 516
roger i think we can make them out the color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor
right the  at these low sun angles theres no trace of brown its now returned to a very gray appearance and like the 8 crew says it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this sun angle which is completely lacking in 
roger 03 06 49 06 i okay this is very close to ignition point for power descent just passing mount marilyn that  that triangularshaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater secchi theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain
roger were getting a good view of mount marilyn and the secchi theta 0b 06 49 45 lmp and now were looking at what we call boot hill occurs 20 seconds into the descent 03 06 50 08 lm the bright sharprimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen censorinus t now passing the  the 1minute point in power descent
roger and for your information your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface 03 06 50 39 lm dont you think
im unable to determine altitude at al1 looking out the window i couldnt tell whetler we were down at 60 or up at 170
i bet you could tell if you were down at 50 000 feet
i wouldnt be surprised 03 06 51 11 lm were passing some steep ridges here the edge of some old craters that were photographed by apollo 10 and those  the crew of apollo l0 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50 000 feet goss net 1 tape 517
roger we can observe theyre also steep even from this altitude you got quite a shadow being cast by the sun at these low angles
the entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the sun was quite high above us the crater in the  bright crater in the center cf the screen  well the smaller one is censorinus
roger and we show you iow over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time
hows the brightness of the picture youre receiving you think we ought to open fstop some as we approach the terminator
yes the brightness is still doing qite well you can go ahead and open it up a sto or two the atomatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully 03 06 52 58 i2 theres a good picture of boot hill
roger were
three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent
roger were seeing boot hill now 03 06 53 10 i24 the next crater coming into the bottom thats duke island right there and to the left the crater  the largest of the craters nar the center of the picture right now is makelyne w this is a position check during desce at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds and its otu down range position check and crossrange rosition check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar past this point we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area
roger i imagine youll get a  youll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon 03 06 54 14 lmm sinuous rille is the one that was referred to in apollo 10 as sidewinder
thats a good name too sidewinder and diamondback it looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed goss net l tape 518
and were approaching the terminator now see the  
roger
contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated while the dark sides and the shadow will become com pletely black
11 this is houston the pictures getting a little grainy now you might go ahead and open up the fstop 03 06 55 9 lmp landing point is just barely in the darkness that one crater the upper part of which you see lower part completely in darkness the small welldefined crater is moltke which is about abeam of the landing sight
roger we can just see it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now
and we can make out just barely some features on the surface maybe from earthshine
are you wide open on the fstop at this time
yes we are
yes and it looks like were just abcut to get the sun coming into the lens so well have to move the camera away
roger 03 06 56 t4 cml we cant see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the imis very bright and is causing our pupils to contract its a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it i think youll agree that some of these craters that youre seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator
yes its a very beautiful and a rugged sight that weve got on the screen now
and i think youve got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle it looks goss net 1 tape 519 like that lm just wants to head down towards the surface is all
roger t have a comment here that says thats what the lm was built for
i believe 03 06 57 45 cm and as the moon sinks slowly in the west apollo ll bids good day to you
roger we sort of thought it was the sun setting in the east
well it depends on your point of view

houston on your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain  mountainous terrain is that an impressior like a lava flow coming in around ayrominence nell or is it more lcoks like its sloping up at that point over
it inttrue everywhere but theres certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mre in other words from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow goss net 1 tape 523

apollo ll houston over
houston apollo ll
ll houston roger reading you fine and it looks like the automatic reacq went very well just as soon as you came around the limb we have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep over
go ahead over
okay ll first of all on our lm systems checks everything went fine i would like to remind you though tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the mcw there should be no problem however you did note that the aps aux tank pressure was only reding lll psi which is normal at this point but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant over
roger understand that thank you 03  32 20 cc roser and next item the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the p22 on the lst rev believe we understand that now as you reported that your pitch was in accel command and your yaw and roll were in rate command you were firing your pitch thrusters this will couple tes into your yaw and roll axes and the  you were at that time holding only half a degree dead ba3 and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes over
yes that may be true its very peculiar coupling in hat it waits longer than you would think and its lection is greater than you would think we were getting yaw rates of around fourtenths of a degree per second for example 03 12 b3 23 cc roger mike we did play the data back and thats the way it looked upon analysis of the chart record ings back here over
okay fine goss net l tape 546
theyve also looked at the results of your landmark tracking the marks all apparently were very good and weve got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations which i wont read up to you but i did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well i also have your consumable budgets particularly your rcs propellant quantities theyre deltas from nominal if you should want them your worst quad is quad charlie which is 9 percent low ill not read up the others unless you want them over
okay how about the 02 fuel cell purge you want that now
ill have to stand by just a moment
okay and then the other one is were still charging battery a ob 12 b5 28 cc 11 houston we would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the moon and you go ahead and  should terminate your battery charge at this time over 03 12 35 43 i24p okay understand i knew we had another 02 and h2 purge coming up in the morning i wasnt sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not ill wait until the next side and then do it
thats fine buzz 03 12 35 54 i24p terminate battery charging now
thats right and one other systems item here  in orer to balance your cryo tanks would you get your 02 tank i and your h2 tank 2 heaters off over ob 12 36 16 cmp okay i have 02 tank heater 1 off and h2 tank heater 2 off ob 12 b6 25 cc thats right mike and we believe you have your quad bravo and quad charlie turned off in your dap at this time and a 5degree deadband wed prefer a lodegree deadband for your sleep period overnight here over ob 12 36 43 24p okay 03 12 b6 47 cc one other item relative to a malfunction procedure its unlikely that youll have to worry about this goss net l tape 547 tomorrow but in your malfunction list under docking on page fll9 there is a malfunction procedure for a high or flow rate at the top of  under tunnel at the top of page ll9 we would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high 02 flow rate and instead check back with houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation over
understand and note has been made in my checklist
ll houston roger that just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack and i guess you will have a presleep check for us before you go to bed 03 12 38 06  roger were in the midst of cycling the 0 and h2 fans now

roger lats all we want we want to stay in narrow and were a little puzzled out why we lost you here a few minutes ago do you have any ideas 03 12 53 48 lm2 no we sure dont cough  sure dont were showing  were showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270 that ought to be good and clear
we concur there we still dont have any good ideas on why we were lost then

apollo 11 houston over
go ahead houston
11 houston were going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacqulre on the sband and what we want to do ito secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds then we will turn it back on and see if the space craft equipment will automatically reacquire so if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition over 03 13 10 04 lfp okay we understand
ll houston we also would appreciae  if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire over
roger well do that
ll houston it looks like were locked back up again with no delay how does it look on board over
roger the signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero and the pitch and yaw in about 3 sec conds moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw right now theyre sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw so they didnt move very far about 30 degrees apiece and then they picked right back on up again over
roger some of the luckiest people in the background there we copied your pitch and yaw angles
11 houston could you give us the location of your  pitch and yaw location of your posi tion indicators over goss net l tape 553
roger theyre in the same position as the antenna right now plus 15 degrees pitch and  no now wait a minute i got them  got it at about 275 instead of 265
okay thank you
ll houston wed like to try the same procedure once more well leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes over 03 13 16 35 ip okay
ll houston were locked back up aain can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved
roger it was essentially identical as before the pitch went to 45 40 to 45 sldthe yaw went to about  to about 255 245 to 255 and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw over
11 houston roger your angles are 45 and 255 do i understand that as soon as the car rier dropped it went to these angle  or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire over
no as soon as the carrier dropped off why it drifted over into those angles anti stayed there then when it came back up again why it hunted around for a while but it didnt get any further off gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow over
ll houston understand and on ancther sub ject request you zero your optics for the night over

one of the craters i was talking about is lo columbia cated exactly at mike 67
roger we found that one
the other one is located at 7  the other one columbia is located at 72 twothirds of the way from mike to nan
roger we believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south over
roger understand i was looking where auto columbia optics was tracking on the average and under stand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west actually a tiny bit out side the circle huh
more to the north and a little more to the east the feature that i was describing to you the small bright crater on the rim of the large fairly old crater would be about mike 08 and 82 over 04 10 44 40 cfep well just give iaeyour best estimate as to coluiia his location and his coordinate system and ill plot it on my map and go from there

columbia this is houston estimated lm posi tion is latitude plus 0799 longitude over 2 plus 11730 on your chart we would place it  stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude
yes the latitude and longitude over 2 799 columbia and 11730 are the ones that i been using in p22 but what im interested in is  is grid coordinates on that map were using

beautiful 04 14 24 30 ll well i had that one inside my mouth that time
it sounded a little wet 04 14 25 09 l in general time spent in the shadow doesnt seem to have any  thermal effects  inside the suit ttere is a difference of course in the  radiation and the helmet so i think theres a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the sun

as i look around the area the contrast in general is  comes about completely by virtue of the shadow  down sun  very lightcolored gray light gray color a halo around my own sha dow around the shadow of my helmet then as i look off across  the contrast becomes strongest in that the surromlding color is still fairly light as you look down into the sun  a larger amount of  shadowed area is looking toward us the general color of the  surrounding  the contrast is not as great surveying all the dusty area that weve kicked up  considerably darker in texture now ive kicked up one ld i ima gine that this is  surveyor the same is true when i survey across on  along the area that were walking in general  to the fact that there are footprints there general terrain where ive been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast color 04 ih 31 29 2p the panorama ill be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus

the plusz strut
roger 04 14 31 48 i24p and right in this area there are two craters the one thats right in front of me now as i lok off in about the eleven oclock position from te spacecraft about 30 to 35 feet  theres several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across  sizes

go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object
easy  easy 03 76 but i  right on the columbia southwest end of a crater i think they would know it if they were in such a location it looks like their lm would be pitched up quite a degree its on the southwest wall of a smallish crater

roger it looks like youre about a hlf hour slow on it were working on consumables over
ail right
neil and buzz this is houston to clarify my last your consumables are in good shaoe at this time the 30minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline over
roger i understand that
i dont note any abnormalities in the m the pods seem to be in good shape the prmary and secondary struts are in good shape itennas are all in place theres no evidence of problem underneath the lm due to engine exhaust or drain age of any kind
roger out
its very surprising the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads id say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated youd measure maybe 3 inches wouldnt you say nell  three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases gossnet l tape 7118
at the most yes that ystrut there is probably even less than that
nice paint job
i get a picture of the plusy strut taken from near the descent stage and i think well be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are seem to be quite minimal
theres one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage shows a quite darkening of the surface color a rather minimal amount of radiating or etch ing away or erosion of the surface 0n descent both of us remarked that we could see s large amount of very fine dust particles moving out it was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown but as i recall i was znable to confirm that
this is too big an angle neil
yes i think you are right
were back at the minusz strut now  very little force of impact that we actually had
and nell if youll take the camera ill get to work on the seq bay
okay
columbia columbia this is houston 1 notice that

ill probably stay on the high ground there and  
watch it the edge of that crater is  drops  
yes it drops off there doesnt it
get a couple of closeups on these qute rounded large boulders
about 40 feet out  id say out at the end of that next  
its going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here 04 14 58 55 cd the top of that next little ridge there wouldnt that be a pretty good place
all right should i put the lr cubed right about here
all right
im going to have to get on the other side of this rock here
i would go right around that crater to the left there isnt that a level spot there 04 14 59 25 l  i think this right here is just as level
these boulders look like basalt and they have probably 2percent white minerals in them the white crystals and the thing that i reported as the vesicular before im not  i dont be lieve i believe that any more i think that small craters  they look llke little impact craters where shot  bb shot has hit the surface
houston i have the seismic experiment flipped over now and im aligning it but im having a little bit of difficulty getting the bb in the center it wants to move around and around on the outside   three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases goss net 1 tape 7121

roger out
tranquility this is houston we also have a set of about l0 questions relating to observations you made things you may have seen during the eva you can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option how do you feel over
i guess we can take them up now manq
okay and your friendly green team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly maroon team and ill put owen on with the questions
tranquility  
okay thank you bruce go ahead goss ne 1 cape 744
tranquility houston first question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the  of the lm as compared to the nominal preflight plan over
we got 13 degrees left on the ball and i think tranq thats probably about right looking at the shadow and so on we prob  probably about 13 de grees left of the shadow
roger thats 13 degrees left of the shadow and next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the eva and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval over
im not sure i understand that question but we tranq got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types
roger neil one of the implications here is the depth from which the blk sample was collected did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface over
we got some down from as much as 3 inches in the tranq area where i was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample there really wasnt appreci able difference and i didnt run into any hard bed later on or at some other times aad other areas why id get down just a short distance an inch or two and couldnt go any further
roger be zieve we understand down as deep as 3 inches did not hit any hard bed and no significant changes in composition to that depth next question the  the second src was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second src over
we got two core tubes and solar wind anl about tranq half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which i picked up hurriedly from around the area i tried to get as many representative trpes as i could  nii i iapt745 ll·t427
roger neil next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the dps engine burning area were wondering if the rays emanating from the  beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface over
the ones that i saw back in the aft end of the tranq spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker of course viewed from the aft end why they did have the sun shining directly on them it seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction but in that particular area this feature didnt extend more than about 2 maybe 3 feet from the skirt of the engine over
roger understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker i understand buzz that these were  this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward is that correct 04 18 3849 lmp no i wouldnt say it was necessarily material tranq that had been uncovered i think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow to gether in some way i dont know now in other areas before we started trampling around out front why we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away now it was different back in the  right under the skirt itself it seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion and i think a couple of pictures on film will show this bltthat didnt extend out very far over
roger tranquility and this baked appearance that you described at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate next subject did  
i believe so tq
roger next subject did either of the solar panels on the pse touch the surface of the moon during deployment over i0t nii1 llp 71t  page 42j 04 18 40 19 lmp i think that two corners did touch since when it tranq was deployed both of them didnt come out at the same time it unfolded a little unevenly and of course the terrain that it was on was a little bit  not quite as level as it was  as i would like to have it and i think that two corners did touch to about i inch  no threequarters to a half an inch deep and maybe along the bottom it might have been maybe 3 inches leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners and i think these are on the western ones over
roger understand the description there and the next subject on the two core tubes which you collected how did the driving fozce re quired to collect these tubes eompare was there any difference over
not significantly i could get down to about tranq the first 2 inches without much of a problem and then as i would pound it in about as hard as i could do it and the second one took two hands on the hanner and i was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod and it just wouldnt go much more than  i think the total depth might haye been about 8 oz 9 inches but even there it didnt  for some reason it didnt seem to want to stand up straight in other words id keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldnt  just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over if that makes any sense at all it didnt really to me over
roger buzz i think ive got the picture you indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical that theyd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far is that correct
yes thats about it it wasnt a rapid change tranq in resistive force and also i noticed when i took the bit off that the material was quite well packed a good bit darker and it  the way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist over goj iigf 1 tape 747 04 18 4b 23 cc roger understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube next question we did copy your comments prior to the eva of your general description of the area we wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area over 0h 18 44 01 lmp yes lets  well  well postpone our answer tranq to that one until tomorrow okay
yes indeed thatll be fine just a couple more here and i think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts over
well i could do it like this owen about all tranq the struts are about equally stroked and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 12 feet huh
roger understand neil next topic as  just after landing you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plusz axis from the lm are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset  as sunset approaches in your local ity  are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray over
no i dont believe so i think that its  tranq its about as level as any other areas that we chose
roger i 
theres nothing large anyway thats going to tranq get in the way
roger copy thats also the way it appeared from the television  think and now the final question you commented neil that on your approach to the landing spot you had passed over a football fieldsized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size can you estimate the distance to this footballsized crater from yotupresent position over gossnetl tape748 i  h6 25 cdr  thmfh wd b 1o cmgh s thfl when w iliant gol ulidt wt ould  il rim bruk ibcr bul i couthtlt bul  dtmt illid thsul wtt ilole llfli ltltk mic beyond it that is a half mile west of it
roger so you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater over 0h 18 46 56 cdr thats correct tranq 
okay well that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight and unless you have something else thatll he all for  from us for the evening over
okay thank you
tranquility base houston weve now collected all the ranging data that we can use and you can go back to caution and warning enable over
roger will do trq

hey real fine while youre 
i dont know yet hows it goinf with you c0luia
real fine here columbia request poo and accept well shove the state vector in for you right away
okay its coming up now columbia were going to keep you a little busy here as soon as we get the state vector in wed like you to go ahead and do a p52 option 3 on this night pass and then when you come on around the other side there well give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130 05 o1 oo 29 c okay columbia 05 o o0 34 cc and for your information were also going to have tranquility base do a p52 when you come around the other time and i have the p22 infor mation if youre ready to copy
go ahead columbia
okay track landmark 130 prime using p22 and for information this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder ti is 122 plus 16 plus 05  whoops okay stand by

copy ti 122 16 05 t2 122 21 11 6 miles columbia north noun 89 is plus 01243 plus 11844 minus 00146
columbia affirmative and at the ti time put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to operate 05 01 07 05 cml all right columbia 05 0 07 06 cc and this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent over
okay youve updated your information as to the columbia lms position and this is your best estimate of where the i24is is that correct
columbia thats negative this 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked  john youngs crater  that you tracked prior to descent and we want that  
fine okay youve given up looking for that columbia  go nit i tape 783
affirmative we want this for one last fix on your plane 50l gl oi cml all right fim undmtmd thank you columbia
and when the lm does his p22 on your transponder well then thatll be our last shot at the lms position
roger understand do you care whether my trans columbia ponder is on before tl
roger itll be on warmup prior to that time and you can go to operate anywhere around that time
yes i gather its on its 24minute warmup now columbia
roger
and houston the computer is yours you can go to block anytime 05 o1 08 59 cml roger block going p52 option 3 columbia
roger and well see you coming around the other side about 1 minute to go and all your systems are looking good
thanks ron columbia 05 01 32  begin lunar rev 24  w 05 01 40 36 cc tranquility base tranquility base houston l i over 05 01 40 h5 cdr good morning houston tranquility base over tranq
roger loud and clear and how is the resting standing up there did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can
roger neil has rigged himself a really good tranq hammock with a waste tether and hes been lying on the ascent engine cover and i curled up on the floor over
roger copy buzz got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here and in general what were going to want you to do is p22 track ing the command module for one last hack on your position there and this will be  in other words p57 p22 and then to press on with the checklist and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist the main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which were getting during descent
okay we had the rendezvous radar in slew during tranq descent though
tranquility base houston i missed that say again
roger i say again we had the rendezvous radar  tranq switch in the slew position not the lgc position
roger we copy that but theres a greater duty cycle on  theres a good 15percent duty cycle on the ascent program there so just go ahead and leave it off and i have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist and i can go ahead and start giving them to you 05 o 42 59 cdr ail right go ahead ive got it out tranq 
okay before we start here request po0 and data and well give you some vectors
now youve got po0 and data ta q 0 01 43 25 cc okay and on surface50 will be the first change there
okay and i understand you want us to do a p57 tranq option 3 and then a p22 is that the general idea over
thats affirmative so on surface50 there down at the bottom of the page just after pro after two recycles stick in a time of122 plus 15 do p22 as per pgns20 of gn dictionary over xsfnet  tape rsfi pate43
lloger understand thats 2215 do 122as cr tranq pgns20 gn dictionary
roger okay lets skip on over to surface59
okay tranq
okay this is going to be for one last vent on the dps tank there so at the top of the page just after eps inverter 1 close add  okay after eps inverter 1 close add prop descent helium regvent close and then after stabili zationcontrol aeld close add prop displays engine 0verridelogic close over
roger copy these are two circuit breakers tranq right
tranquility base affirmative those are just the circuit breakers at that time
tranquility base houston did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers
roger i have those two tranq 
okay lets go over to surface60 and then down the middle of the page after launch guid ance system recommendation from msfn then i add the switches there
roger go ahead then tranq 
okay after launch guidance system recommendation from msfn add descent propulsion fuel vent open add descent propulsion oxidizer vent open add verify talkbaek gray over 05 01 h8 22 cdr roger de3cent propellant fuel vent open de eagle scent propellant oxidizer vent open verify talkback gray
roger you got that one so thatll be the last vent and it will continue venting skip over to surface61 down there at tig minus 17
roger im there go ahead tanq  li tl  tap v 50i ip i cc oit al j minl i th lvl cii i ac i a idzvou taj cloe wait 30 seconds delete pons iiezvous radar close and then add updata link switch to voice backup over
roger i have that well leave those two cir tranq cuit breakers open and have the updata link to voice backup and well make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card
roger and then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page  note  this is at the bottom of page 61  note do not use tape meter in pgns ie do not place mode select switch to pgns over
okay well put it in ags tranq
roger fair enough thats some more of that computer load business
okay thats all the changes we have for the checklist here ive got some  just some gen eral notes ill read to you on p22 and just for some information over
okay then it looks to me like we ought to get eagle hopping on this p57
roger we agree wholeheartedly and while youre starting on that ill read  just read these notes on p22 call p22 possible program alarm 56 range greater than 400 nautical miles and then use the p22 as described on pgns20 take option 1 in noun 06 and use the noupdate mode the rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 de grees elevation above the horizon if 503 alarm occurs designate fail key a proceed and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the csm and place the range altitude monitor switch in altitudealtitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops and press on

houston you copying noun 93 tranq
tranquility affirmative go
roger were going to a torque tranq
houston roger
tranquility base houston columbia will be overhead at 122 plus 22 plus 51 his los will be 29 35 over
roger traq
houston wed like to check this on the tape meter tranq against the ags well go back to altitude  altitude rates as soon as the rate starts to build up over
tranquility houston roger
on second thought since that will peg the range tranq rate i guess maybe wed better not do that and oxjel 1 tape 792 for this range that the ags are showing now 425 miles with a signal strength of 22 it looks like we ought to proceed on this over
roger stand by one tranquility affirmative proceed
are you getting the information on the downlink tranq  now
tranquility affirmative and were saving it weve got 4 so far and its looking good
okay what do you people think about calling up tranq a verb83
tranquility houston stand by on that now were getting the data now were checking on the verb 83
and we expect that we may lose lock when it tranq passes overhead because of the max rate that the radar has
tranquility houston negative on verb 83
understand tranq
we just lost lock tranq 
tranquility houston go
theyve just lost lock ron columbia 
roger we had about 20 some points before you did that and for your information the reason the ags is a little different there  the reason the ags is a little different is because the kfactor is a little bit wrong
has he already gone over okay okay has tranq he already gone overhead or do you want us to try and get in lock on again
houston columbia you got noun 49 five good columbia marks goss net 1 tape 793
tranquility affirmative try to lock on again and youll lose m at about 29 minutes and 35 seconds
okay do you have a real quick procedure how to tranq do that
columbia houston say again about your noun 49
i say i got five good marks you got noun 49 columbia when you get everything you need off the down link let me know
columbia houston stand by one
ron did you say on the 526 alarm to proceed or tranq do a verb 32

and columbia houston same for you you can terminate p22
i have im running fast tranq
roger
im staying in p22 here a second just to record tranq the noun 89 and then over verb 34

roger
this is columbia go ahead and id like to columbia know about this p52 coming up is that the one i just completed or do you want a pair of them back to back
columbia houston you do not need to do another p52 unless you want to break and also columbia when you get a chance request batt c and the pyro readouts over 05 02 31 08 cml batt c says 37 volts even pyro a 37 pyro b 37 columb ia

roger we have four out of eight circuit tranq breaker talkbacks indicating red we still have the circuit breakers out as of right now i believe at this moment we have just entered verb 77 on tape 3052 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire is it normal to have these four red flags over

and houston tranquility base is going to give tranq you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night we are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary  circular secondary craters most of which have rims irrespective of their  raised rims irrespective of their size thatsnot universally true there are  there are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim the ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt id say the thing that would be most like it on earth is powdered graphite immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes sizes textures rounded and angular many with varying consistencies as i said ive seen plain  what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt others with no crystals some with small white phenocrysts maybe one to less than 5 percent and the bould  we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that now some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface some are partially exposed and some are just barely exposed and in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop weve run into boulders below the surface  it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass 05 ob 12 55 cc tranquility houston roger very fine description 05 ob lb 05 cdr i suspect this boulder field may have some of its tranq origin with this large sharpedged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent now yesterday i said that was about the size of a football field and i have to admit it was a little  little hard to measure coming in but i thought that it might just fit in the astro dome as we came by it and the rocks in the vicinity of the  of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim beyond that there is some diminishing and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks over goss net 1 tape 7911

roger houston the only trouble is that the sun tranq is in number 5 the closed one and it appears to also b close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone and it completely obscures detent 6 im  unable to use that at all

thats fine ive still got to get a p30 pad from you
roger we want to talk to you about that mike we can  for your druthers we can do it either way we can either let you do it in the jettison in p30  correction p47 or we can send you a p30 target load up and then you  let oucall p41 whichever you want to do over
yes i see ron was going to give me  p30 pad and the flight plan says p47 out of hetwo i prefer to go to p30 p41 route
roger beautiful eve got the load if youll give us po0 and accept well send you a load up stand by
columbia houston wed like you to terminate direct 02 flow and stand by on your po0 and accept well have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time over
roger
columbia houston over
go ahead
roger mike it looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load it would require a new attitude and we cant de that due to the lm already closed out and it would fight us all the way around and wed lose co with it were thinking separating in p47 in about l0 minutes were looking at trajectories and well be right with you momentarily over
okay its no big thing with me either way

roger dodger we got eagle looking good its holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison 05 10 ll 19 imp i believe that i can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel in the thermal protective covering i dont think it has any thing to do with the structure
roger
hello columbia houston well have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30 so we can separate from eagle over

apollo 11 tlouston computers yours over
roger charlie we switched our omnid  delta and i lost that last transmission would you say again please the thing im wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus x thrusters and the pad indicates plus x do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4
roger apollo ll the way we gave it to you in the attitude were in itll be just like the sep burn that you had yesterday youll see  noun 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus x until you read 4 over
understand
apollo ll houston we see you in p41 now it might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you dont make tig its pretty insensitive you can just let p41 bring you up to tig and when you get to zero you can burn on that over
okay
okay burn complete residuals plus three balls 40 plus four balls 7 plus four balls 2 deltav counter 1021 over

hey charlie boy looking good here that was a beautiful burn they dont come any finer
roger goss net 1 tape 872
apollo 11 houston i wondered if youve com pared your state vector accuracy with thc one in the  lights owr
yes sir and it looked very nice verb 83 was plus 00070 and minus 00008
roger
11 houston i was looking at your bank bravo nitrogen tank it didnt leak a bit  correc tion  didnt leak a bit this time over
roger looked good here
chamber pressure was hanging in there around 100 the latter partof the burn it started oscillat ing a little bit and got down a little bit below 100
roger
96 or so

your command module film seems to be working out pretty well charlie the amount we carried looks like we carried just about what we needed o 15 50 45 cc wonderful
we have one 16millimeter roll on the asa1000 color interior film we were thinking of shooting that during the entry out window number 4 on a bracket and you might get the camera guide sometime in the next couple of days and give us all the good settings for that goss net 1 tape 873
roger
hello apollo 11 houston i wondered if during the tei burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the pugs over 05 15 55 06 ih5 yes we did based on your very excellent briefing i was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time so we started out with it in increase i saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind so i was still expecting it to move up and then i went down to full decrease and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent over
roger thank you very much buzz 05 15 55 41 iaip twotenths of a percent im sorry
roger thank you
apollo ll houston you can go to ptc attitude and torque at your  and do the p52 and torque at your convenience over

apollo ll houston weve taken your onboard vector and propagated it forward and its looking real good we only got about 24 minutes of tracking now really too early to tel3 on the radar over
roger understand
hello apollo 11 houston mike did you not e any transients at ignition on tei over 05 16 28 21 cml yes the transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns charlie i just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module but there was considerable roll activity which damp ened down after the first 20 seconds 1 would guess of the burn but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity i dont believe it was abnormal and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line and after the goss net 1 tape 882 first couple of  oh after the first 20 seconds or so the gimbals were quiet and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet before that there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates total attitude hung in there pretty well
roger thank you much we were looking at the playback and we saw some things that  right at start up well be back with you later on that
okay
apollo ll houston have you finished taking pictures over

roger with respect to the dow jones industrials since closing on tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 105 pm houston time this afternoon why the effect has been a net drop that is minus 6 points on the industrial average so far today since opening the dow jones indus trial average has gone down by ll05 after rising ll2 shortly after opening todays performance on the utilities is a drop of 163 and railroads a drop of 158 over
every flight has to have some disadvantages i guess
roger there is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 112point rise right after opening
well dont blame the llpoint drop on us any way
roger
apollo ll this is houston if you have a minute or so free i wonder if we could get mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking we copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth almost imperceptible and were a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction over
roger i docked in cmc auto and as i said i wasnt really sure of the moment of contact i kept crosschecking the docking probe indicators i got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches  not capture latches but the three  latches had made and we were soft locll net   qpc 962 ittg 27 docked and at that tjne thc uit uat iou looked very stable so i went to cmofree flanccd back out the window and it still looked stable and i fired primary 2 bottle and at that time a gyration began between the two vehicles due im not sure to what perhaps the lm thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior and i hadnt noticed it but anyway during the retract of the probe there were yaw  my yaw excursions of i would guess around 15 degrees and i had to ece hack on take the free switch and throw it back to auto and try to damp them out and i guess neil was doing the same in the i ill let him tell you about his side of it and i though that we were not going to get a successful retract and hard dock however in about  oh i guess 6 or 8 seconds i did hear  could see the situation damping out and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired and later on when i got into the tunnel all 12 of them had properly engaged
roger
and on the lm side we were in ags min deadband att hold and at contact i thrusted plusx and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing so we opened up the deadband to max and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retrac tion it went to off after

roger if neil has a free minute weve got a question or two regarding the co2 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrep ancies noted yesterday over
go ahead
roger ll was water noted in both suits or only in yours nell
i think only in my suit
okay can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit either by mission time or relation to any particular event
i think it was after insertion sometime bruce i dont remember exactly when i  it was when we were irtorbit and had our  after we took our helmets off
roger did you call it to us when you first noticed it or was it sometime after when you called it
id guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after i noticed it that i mentioned it to you
roger was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic co2 partial pressure readings or was that a separate problem over goss net 1 tape 964
well the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the pc02 gage
roger and what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary c02 canister that is did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary c027 over
i believe we went to secondary c02 first
secondary hydroxide  lithium hydroxide
roger we copy and was there any change in your suit loop  
no
go ahead
i should mention bruce that when i went to water secondary  water separator to secondary there i didnt notice any change but about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes the water stopped coming out so maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out but the secondary water separator was operating properly
roger did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion that is in particular theyre interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to egress at any time whle you were on the secondary canister over
no i dont believe we did that at all bruce
okay ll thank you that sums up our ques tions for now and well crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with
okay are you satisfied that the c02 ircuit breaker was in on jettison over
say again please goss net 1 tape 965
roger on lm jettison are you satisfied that the c02 circuit breaker was in over
yes it was in
roger could you confirm that i thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not over
roger ll it was in and confirmed in and the readings after jettison stayed about o1 to 02
apollo ll this is houston we have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the lmps ekg when he has a little free time wed like him to cheek into it again over 06 05 24 41  roger i looked at all three of the upper chest center ones and they appear to be fairly tight ill push them back in again over
roger on the tm here we noticed some fluctua tions that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them but the erratic problem seems to be persisting 06 05 4 27  houston apollo 11 over 06 05 4 40 cc ll this is houston over 06 05 44 45 ip roger i wonder if youve noticed any change in the biomed returns youre getting over
negative buzz it still looks kind of bad apparently when you move around its cting in and out have you checked the little electri cal connector where it goes into the signal con ditioner over
yes theyre all about as tight as can be i tell you what ill take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any differ ence

roger it didnt like it that time when i got down to the entry 27303 enter it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of 1 degree per second over ive stopped it now and we are going to have to go back and do it over again id like to try to find out the reason it did that
roger you might as well start setting up for it and we will be working the problem here
okay do you have us on high bit rate here now
thats affirmative
okay good ill maneuver back to ptc initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think
roger gossnet l tape973
houston apollo 11 i think the reason is in having 1620 on the dsky during the subsequent entries or at least thats one possibility
roger well check it out
apollo 11 this is houston while youre wait lng for the csm to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface over
go ahead
go ahead houston
roger for 64 thousand dollars were still trying to work out the location of your landing site tranquility base we think it is located on lam2 chart at juliet 05 and 78 do you still have those charts on board over
yes stand by one theyre packed
roger you may not have to unpack it the position which i just gave you is slightly west of west crater i guess its about twotenths of a kilometer west of it and we were wondering if neil or buzz had observed any additional land marks during descent lunar stay or ascent which would confirm or disprove this one thing that were wondering about is that if you were at this position you would have seen the cats paw during ascent just up to the north of your track over
we were looking for the cats paw too thinking we were probably downrange beyond the big v but i think that its likely that that might have been west crater that we went across in landing but  stand by
were hoping bruce that our 16mm film was working at that point in descent and well be able to confirm our touchdown position we thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site and we did see a number of small craters and crater rows and things like that which we may be able to pick out after the fact but we havent been able to yet goss net 1 tape 9711
roger and the next question from our plnel is for buzz we recall that he reported seeing a laser upon aos of the earth the first time after  the first rev after ascent and were wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the earth over 06 07 37 25  it was mostly white perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it and it seemed to be  as i recall it the terminator of the earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from  down towards the terminator of the earth  from the opposite horizon thats a third to a quarter earth radii over
roger and that puts it in the light side over 06 07 38 18  roger yes it was in the light side the earth was about  a twothirds lit earth with the terminator down toward the horizon and now coming from the opposite limb of the earth the sunlight limb coming down about onequarter to onethird of a radius in from the limb generally pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center over
roger buzz we copy 06 07 39 02 it5 and i got pictures of that im sure thstwill show up
and i saw that too it was a very bright spot of light and i confirm buzzs observation of its position
okay ll very good now with respect to the documented sample container on television it appeared to us as though the ssnsoles for that container were in fact being given  being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks them selves and we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken over goss net l tape 975 06 0t 39 56 cdr yes you remember i initially starte d on the cut side of the lm that the tv camera ws on ilici 1 took il lljnibt oi llaibjq o rokzl oll th surface and ucveral that weru jusl liulliiiic  about 20  15 to 20 feet north of the tq and then i recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine so i crossed over to the southern side of the ir and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on and several beyond that and tried to take as many different types  of rock types as i could see by eye  as i could in the short time we had available there were a number of other samples that i had seen earlier in our stroll around the ir that i had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sam ple but i didnt get those and ill be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session
roger did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims over
well aside from the one big one that we went over i guess there were none in our area i took a stroll back after putting up the easep and while buzz was starting to unpack the docu mented samples  took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet illdiam eter and 15 or 20 feet deep and took solaepic tures of it it had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface but there was no  we apparently at 15 feet or so had not gotten below the regolith we were essentially showing no bedrock at least in the walls of the crater at that depth over
roger we copy 06 07 h2 50 cc okay thank you nell that about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now 06 o 43 o0 cdr okay

ll we concur that having verb 16 noue 20 up on the dsky may well have had some effect on your ptc initiation it looks llke this would give  let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual cdu angles what wed like you to do is do a cdu zero which is verb 40 noun 20 enter and then start the ptc procedure again at step 2 with loading verb 6 noun 22 desired attitude in the auto maneuver and all that over
okay the only thing i dont understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did what rate should it have taken off at under that theory
stand by a minute mike
ll cmp this is houston over
go ahead houston
mike over here on page 97 of your checklist where were setting up ptc theres been a note penciled in after wait 20 minutes for rate to damp do not monitor verb 16 noun 20 it turns out that the significance of that is that if you are monitoring 16 noun 20 then when you get down here in step 7 the second time you do a verb 24 youve got to reload the noun 01 to make it verb 24 noun 01 enter before you load the three registers over
roger that i was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done
roger were still working on ccputillg the rate for you

its all very quiet were just sitting here letting the thruster firing damp down when they get good enough let us know and well start this ptc goss net 1 tape 983 06 08 t806 cc roger 06 08 48 29 cml nice to sit here and watch the earth gtting larger and larger and the moon smaller and smaller
roger we11 give you a call when your rates have damped down sufficiently and wee unable at the present time to predict what rate you should have seen at your last attempt oinitiate ptc we saw about 212 degrees per scond 0ver
yes i believe that 06 08 9 21 cmp buzz thinks we should have a ptc progr m built in the computer he could very well be rght apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 991

go atlead 11
roger i was just checking the radios and how is the thruster activity coming
11 houston the radios are still in good shape and we are still waiting for your rates to decay weve got 003 degrees per second n pitch now
okay were  were in no rush this is a very pleasant attitude as a matter of fact the sim is down in the leb so its not shining thronh the windows and heating the place up w ot the earth steady out window 1 we haye thc mton steadily out window 3 and of course we are locked up on the high gain so as long as the thermal people are happy were happy
roger we copy
apollo 11 this is houston over
go ahead houston  06 09 33 35 cc okay 11 we are about ready to start pic i would like to give you some highgainantenna angles though wed like to operate in the reacq mode and do you plan on spinning um in the positive or negative direction 0v
we can do it either way i had planned the positive
okay for positive the highgainantenna setting should be pitch plus 30 yaw 270 and in reacq over
understand reacq pitch plus 30 yaw 270 thank you
roger and if you would when youre making your dsky entries to set up for ptc go a little slower and well try to follow each entry from down here over

negative its not the last time we broke lock we went to auto and i left it there sorry
roger wed like to have you to put it in reacq and monitor in about 2 minutes well be coming up on the high gain would you monitor the reacq if it doesnt take acquire manually over
okay say again the angles youd like
well  well try to switch it ourselves stand by on the angles
buzz its pitch plus 30 yaw 270 over
roger ive got them
thank you
hello apollo 11 houston would you dlease terminate battery charge now over 06 10 46 19 i3p roger terminating battery charge
roger
hello apollo 11 houston any special attitude youd like us to look at for the tv over
i dont guess we have a requirement there charlie
roger we have an attitude that we can get the earth out of a window or the moon were trying to look at  find one that we can get both if thats what youd like over apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 1001
a 50degree roll attitude will probably give us that joe
roger
thats a good one because it puts the earth out window 1 and the moon out window 3 and puts the sun down in the leb so the lighting in here remains relatively constant
roger well well just stop on the 50 roll then and well give you the word when to do that over
okay
apollo 11 houston well hae highgin cover age about 155 30 at that time you can ttr on the tv if you desire and continue iolrr i around until you get 50 degrees roll owr
okay
apollo 11 houston we were going to live you the ail star game tonight but it was rained out over
11 houston were on the high gain yu can warm up the sm now if you like over
apollo 11 houston we see you coming up on 50 roll how does that attitude look over

it is huh well im really looking at the bad  at a bad screen here stand by one hey youre right
its not bad enough not finding the r ght landing spot

its not bad enough not finding the rght lard ing spot when you havent even got thc right planet 
ill never live that one down
were making it get smaller and smaller here to make sure that it really is the one wre leaving
ail right thats enough you guys
11 that was a good picture there
okay thats enough of the moon
okay thats enough of the moon charlie were getting set up now for some inside pictures
roger
we know theres a lot of scientists from a num her of countries standing by to see the lunar samples and we thought youd be interested to see them as they really are here these two boxes are the sample return container they  theyre vacuumpacked containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface seaed and then brought inside the lm and put inside these fiberglass bags zippered and reseaed around the outside and placed in these recetacles in the side of the command module thes are the two boxes and as soon as we get onto the ship gos nhf 1 tlp 1004 im sure these boxes will immediately be tans ferred and delivery started to the lunar ieceiv ing laboratory these boxes include the samples of the various types of rock the groundmass of the soil the sand and silt and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface
roger neil thank you much for that description weve got a pretty dark picture down here could you check your fstop wed like to have it  see if you can open it up a little bit over
okay our monitor showed that to be very bright
roger
 were down around between wiz aound fll which we thought would be plenty light wel  well lighten it up some more
well wed appreciate it its pretty dark on all our monitors here
okay fine
its looking a lot better now nell 06 1t 42 49 cc theres buzz
11 houston we have an excellent picture now over
okay how do you read me charlie
fiveby now buzz over
okay the more mundane affairs now that weve left the moon id like to trace through them a little bit for you  developments that have taken place in the food department im sure youve already  type of a drink container a little later mike will show you hew the wats gun operates with its new filter to tke out the hydrogen essentially this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with wter and the drink then dissolves in the water and this end of the  outfeeding likewise we have other foods that are more solid nature you can  three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases goss nf 1 tape 1004 probably see this shrimp cocktail meal  this afternoon while the two of us had salmon salad  another early development was the use of bitesize food 
11 houston buzz youre breaking up badly will you check your vox over 06 11 44 47 i24p roger how am i coming through now charlie
roger youre very clear when you come through its just that your vox is not keying at every word over 06 11 44 57  okay these bitesized objects were design  to remove the problem of having so may cl tm floating around in the cabin so tcy desig a particular size that would be able to g  the mouth all at once i think since mit oy our experience weve discovered that we co progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have olearth as a matter of fact on this flight weve car ried along pieces of bread and along witi the bread we have a ham spread and ill show you i hope how easy it is to spread some ham while im in zero g
i think weve discovered that it is quite easy to  youre all very familiar with
apollo 11 houston we notice your roll rate increasing will you please see if ylcan bring that down to about 04 or well be losing high gain shortly over
you can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that weve all learned in school id like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope if i spin this can we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin and has a spin axis in this direction if we give it a particular torque and ill do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once its spinning by the equations we can predict that s i put this torque on it it will in fact rotate this direction lets see how well this woks out  three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases omj nii 1 tlpe lo0 pae 5117
see that as i apply the torque this way its rotated this way
too close i think
11 houston its a pretty good demonstration
houston this next is a little demonsration for the kids at home all kids everywhere for that matter i was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon but im afraid i filled the spoon too full and if im lotcare ful im going to spill water right ozerthe sides can you see the water sloppin around on the top of the spoon kids
thats affirmative 11 06 11 49 12 cml okay well as i said i was going t show you but im afraid i filled it too fu 1 and its going to spill over the sides ill ellyc what ill just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again okay
okay
and you can see up here we dont kno where over is one up is as good as anothe that really is water though ill show you 06 11 50 04 cml thats really not the way we drink we really have a rater gun which ill show you
heres the water gun this cylindrical thiig on the end of it is a filter with several mem branes one allows water to pass but not any gas the other allows gas to pass but not any water so by routing the gaseous vter which comes from our tank through this filler were enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it filtered water and of course all we do to  to get it started is just pull the trigger
its sort of messy i havent been a this very long its sort of the same system tllatthe spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights only i think this is even more fun well be seeing you kids goss net 1 tape 1006
thank you from all us kids in the world here in the mocr who cant tell the earth from the moon

okay thank you 06 2 22 24 cc and buzz were still not getting any data from your ekg it looks like the only way that were going to be able to get any is if at your convenience you would take your  chsnge out your ekg leads which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin and theres a spare one in the medical box over 4 12 2 55 l roger how many did you want me to change
just the center one ill get the right nomen clature from the doc stand by its called the sternal ekg which are the three center ones and its got  they lead into a  into the bluestringed lead ones over b of tap2 apollo 11 airt0ground voice transcription goss nlq1 tq011 ibe 5u

roger thats a good suggestion neil we concur over
okay charlie were transmitting and lets see if you get any ekg signal on the cdr at this point
roger tand by cs 12 26 42 cc ll ostonwe get some data but its got the sne problem thaiwe had through buzzs signal conditioner so apparently the lead is broke and wed like you to change it out if you c ul over tm 06 12 26 56 p okay

thats an old favorite of mine about  its an album made about 20 years ago called music out of the moon
roger it sounded a little scratchy to us nell either that or your tape was a little slow
its supposed to sound that way
thats one of those  
  it sounds a little scratchy to us too but the czar likes it

roger sure are everythings doing fine all the gals are having a little party tonight as far as i know
oh good glad to hear it
apollo ll houston i was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this ear lier ptc that we attempted and when you keyed into verb 24 and did the two enters it took off on you i think we got a story on that if youd like to listen to why it had such a high rate mike over
yes im all ears
okay i think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97 and we could walk you through it and that way i could probably get the story straight over
okay i got it
okay ke what happened is you know you were sitting there monitoring verb 16 noun 20 and at step 7 you went into verb 24 noun 01 and keyed in the address and then information information and on the final enter of that 35400 enter right after that it  that then put you back into the 16 noun 20 then when you did the verb 24 enter you were really entering the information in the actual cdu and when you got the two entries in in register i and 2 it was an  at was an instan taneous change in the actual cdu and the cm dap looked at that and saw  saw what at thought it goss net 1 tape 1024 had my  my gosh i got a 600degreepersecond rate and it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out and the rate filters that its looking at  it  well the rate its looking at is filtered so it doesnt really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up and then it starts reading the rate filters and it says well i really didnt have 600 degrees so then it turns it off and tries to slow it down but until that happens and it is some time lag and thats why the rate was building up the jets were on and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600  suspected 600degreepersecond rate over
okay i got you

man
hey charlie are you saying that for a short period of time he actually loaded noun 20 with some value other than was being read by the cdu 06 14 23 b4 cc i think i got that buzz thats affirmative but when he did that second verb 24 you were  the noun was 20 so when he did the b175 and then a 002 enter wha he actually did there was load the first two actual cdu locations and the com puter looked at it  the dap looked at it as an instantanegusch  inthe aptualcdu stand by on your comments were switching antennas
roger
  were very scratchy 06 14 24 08 lnp okay 06 14 24 4b cc 11 houston we got you back now on the high gain did you copy all that buzz over
yes i think so i  i thought maybe that noun 20 was one of those that you could never load from the dsky and that still maybe maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time and then when the counters read the  the gimbal angles why they changed it back to what they actually are but in the meantime the dap saw this different number is that right goss net 1 tape 1025
well our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those acdus the actual cdus but well  were checking on that over
okay
11 houston buzz the word from the back room is that you can actually load the noun 20 but you should not
yes i got that thn you
youre welcome

11 houston they all look very good the lowest temperature was 40 degrees and were taking a look at your cabin temperatires now
we agree on the cm rcs no heaters are goin 2 to be required by a country mile
we think thats correct
we dont like those heaters anyway wor off the direct coils
roger
peculiar thing owen on the platform align ment is that when i really take my tme ana do a very slow careful precise job of marking im getting about the same star angle differ ence as when im doing it in dtc and have bo do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking star angle differences seem insens l tire it almost made me believe theres a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant
roger 11 perhaps the 3 degrees per secoii just isnt that much of a bother over
well hes really trying to explain qhy he cant get all zeros
i think buzz is probably right as a matter of fact one time i made a mark which i thougt was a little bit in error but i thoaght wi heck ill go ahead and see how it orks oat anyway and i got five zeros that time and when i have thought everything was ecactly precisely on i have consistently ben getting 001 goss net 1 tape 1126
roger apparently it pays to hurry
i usually do
the visibility through the telescope has been very poor its i would say even worse than the simulator is right now it requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient so its really a tremen dous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of vjew
understand mike
1t houston checking your temperat wes it does look like the spacecraft may havre cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the 1 st 24 hours and that sounds to be consiste  with your report on the com st leve ther  over
okay
is that a lmoff phenomenon
11 houston it looks like well have to think a little more about that as to whether its a ioff or some effect of being out of lunar orbit we dont know so well have to puzzle before we can give a better answer
okay
well if the systems guys have anything they want chased down well be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have ou
roger well think about that and see if there arent some other tests to be useihllly performed here
okay

apollo 11 this is houston over
go ahead houston apollo 11
11 this is houston with reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt colr 7 side the spacecraft last night we rtotej earlier that we did indeed ea drop of ab 3 degrees over the previous night jooking back it appears the crew of apollo lo repor a similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases were wondering i you could give us any indication of the relativ amounts of free or condensed water il the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity over
roger that might be a little bit difficult to do well take a look at the tunnel now it does seem as though between the ilrt we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel of course the lm hadnt been vented when we did translunar
roger we were more curious about the rela tive amount of moisture between say last night and the night before both of which would have the lm missing
theres more moisture in the tunnel lowthan there has been at any previous time sub jectively we have been unable to determine any change in  any buildup in humid ty there appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft for exampla the windows are not fogging or  and var ous other cool spots around the spacecraft  al1 of them appear to be compltely dry tape 2 goss net 1 tae qi3

roger this trip of ours to the moon may have looked to you simple or easy id like to assure you that has ot been the case the saturn v rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery every piece of which worked flawlessly this computer up above my head has a 38 000word vocabulary each word of which has been very carefkllly chosen to be of the utmost value to us the crew this switch which i have in my hand now has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone this one single switch design in addtion to that there are myrisds of circuit brekers levers rods and other associated conrols the sps engine our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module must have performed flaw lessly or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit the parachutes up above my heaa must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plurnet into the goss net 1 tape 1143 ocean we have always ha3 confidence that all this equipment will work and work propery and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight ail this is possible only through the blood sweat and tears of a number of people first the american workmen who put these pieces of machinery to gether in the factory second the painstaking work done by the various test tem during the assembly and retest after assembly and finally the people at the manned spacecraft center both in management in mission planning in flight control and last but not least in crew training this operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine ail you see is the three of us but beneath the surface are thousands uadthou sands of others and to all those i would like to say thank you very much
11 this is houston were getting a oodpicture of buzz now but no voice modulation and would you open up the fstop on the tv camer try 22 please
that appears to be a lot better now yere still not receiving buzzs audio
good evening id like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission apollo 11 as weve been dis cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft weve come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown nells statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon this is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind i believe sum up these feelings very nicely we accepted the challenge of going to the moon the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission i beieve is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance today i feel were flly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace in retrospect we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously goss net 1 ape 1124 chose for our spacecraft columbia and eagle weve been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight depicting the us eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth from the planet earth to the moon that symbol being the olive branch it was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon personally in reflecting on the events of the past several days a verse from psalms comes to mind to me when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him
the responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort next with the american people who have thrugh their will indicated their desire next o four administrations and their congresses folimplementing that will and then to the agelcy and industry teams that built our spacecraft the saturn the columbia the eagle and the 1 ttle emu the space suit and backpack that waour small spacecraft out on the lunar surfacer we would like to give a special thanks to althose americans who built the spacecraft who aid the construction design the tests and put their  their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts to those people tonight we give a special thazk you and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight god bless you good night from apollo 11
11 this is houston were getting a oom view out the window now

roger at 180 hours 50 minutes get we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge
okay
and on the entry photography if you sre going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film we recommend the following exposure settings fll at 1250 six frames per second focus on 7 feet for the fireball f20 160 of a second six frames per second focus on qo feet when the chutes open if you are using a magazine part of which has already been used for intrior shots we recommend fl6 at 1500 of a second six frames per second focus on 7 feet for the fireball f28 160 of a second six frames per second focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open and we would iketo know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance over

hello apollo 11 houston over
roger houston apollo 11 did you get the word on the entry checklist
roger mike we sure did were ready to talk about it if you are over
i think the quickest thing is to go through page by page the first part of the entry checklist where it h a map starting on the page with compartment l2 and l3 ire you with me
roger with you
okay l2 is as sho l3 is as show there is about half the food remaining in l3
roger goss net 1 tape 1172
where it says  where it says and note the
pga is located in the lshaped bag with the other two pgas the lm shield was jettisoned with the  correction the cmps helmet shield was jettisoned with the i34and his hemet and gloves instead of being in the sleep restraint are in the hatch bags
okay lets see now your pga is in the lshaped bag with the other two pgas and your helmet and gloves are in the lshaped tag instead of the sleep restraint
the helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag the great big bag thats underneath the lesthand couch that you put the hatch in
roger i thought i  thats what i cotied okay go ahead
okay the next page is identical except a nit picking point out ri we got the entr check list other than that it is identical and the third page has got some changes 07 1337 49 cc go ahead 07 13 37 50 65p in a1  are you with me im over there in compartment al now
go ahead mike over
in compartment al the 16millimeter maazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5 tissue dispensers there is only on of them left and compartment u3 the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4 and the pga bag  add the cmps pga plus add two lgs and compartment a8 delete two lcgs add one ppk making a total of four and add 10 pounds of i24miscellaneous equipment we told you five the other day we think ten is probabr closer over
copy
and thats all the chnges on that page ready for the next page
roger go ahead mike goss er l allt
on your next page n compartment b1 we esti mate about 15 percent of that food is remaining in b2 we took ppk out of there and put trash in it in b3 the t6millimeter cable the 18 millimeter lens and the rightangle mirror are on window number 4 and that there brings you all uptodate
roger how about the levvas mike here did you put those over
theyre in the hatch bag
roger stand by our only concern 1  is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag ats pretty big bulk between you and a8 anwed like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint if you will stand by ill verify that over
okay
11 houston our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag  correction hatch bag would be to remoe that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch the reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g and it is s pretty difficult job getting it lashed down with the gear in the sleep resvraint its a pretty standard lashdown procedure and you could also use tile beta cord that you have on hoard you concur over
yes well look at it charlie and let you know
roger and i got a couple of other thi2gs mike we need to terminate battery b charge ay this time and also the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattred thunderstorms we dont want to tangle wth one of those so we are going to move the  your aim point uprange ccrrection it will be downrange to target for 1500nauticali ile entry so we can guarantee uplift control the aew coordinates are 13 degrees 19 minul es north 169 10 minutes west he weather in that area is super we got 2000 scattered 8000 cattered sith l0 miles visibility and 6foot se and the hornet is sitting n great position to get lo that targeted posit on over goss net 1 tape 1174

okay ie got a 23
also your dl and max and mii im sure are 22 400 and 18 000 ever
yes thats right
okay if youll dig sut your entry ehcklist there on page e61 ill update your pdtro times there for the various altitudes over
okay go ahead
okay on page e61 flourrrt is 07 20 your 50k is 08 16 40k is 8 30 your 24k is 09 02 and your 10k is 09 51 0wer
okay rrt 07 20 50 000 08 16 thats  07 20 is  is the time of steam pressure peg rom rrt and 40 000 08 30 24 000 09 02 10 000 09 51
11 houstojl you stated out right and then the numbers you read back were correct but i didnt get your comment in between there
i assume that  all i wanted to know is that first time 07 20 thats the time of steam tressure peg right
thats affirmative
okay
houston apollo 11 on im ready to copy your message about the contant drag level gonft  tape 1234
okay mike of course this is in the event the gn and the ems quits and you have to fly the constant g and what were trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles weve run this procedure in the simulator staid it works fine basically ill go through it  just go through it and then if you have any questions come back but its the same lift vector up until max g and then lift vector down and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero okay this procedure is essentially the same so far and then hold g dot zero until you pass the retro elapsed time of v circular and then after you pass this retro elapsed tjueof v circular roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you coma to the retro elapsed time of drogues over
okay it sounds straightforward enough under stand constant g backup backup procedure lift vector up until max g and then lift vector down then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero maintain g dot equals zero until subcir cular then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time over
okay thats mighty fine mike thats correct end cf tape apollo 11 airtoground voice transcription goss net 1 tape 12h1
