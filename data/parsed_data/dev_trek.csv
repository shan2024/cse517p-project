dialogue
"you're forgetting it was seska who rewrote the scenario. for all we know, she's programmed captain janeway to betray us."
i suppose you have a better idea?
"the safest course of action is to avoid participation of any kind. eventually, the real captain will discover our predicament and shut down the programme from the outside."
let's move!
hold it right there!
back off!
or what? you'll shoot us? go right ahead.
whatever you say.
poor kathryn. i guess nobody told her the phaser rifles from storage locker three have been malfunctioning.
"you're an incredible woman, seska."
"you see who's in charge now, don't you? so if i were you, i'd get moving again. the programme's not over."
we have no intention of participating in this exercise.
"you don't want to end up like your captain, do you?"
"you programmed all this. the malfunctioning phaser, the version of chakotay who's attracted to you. none of it's real."
you hear that? he thinks this is a game. show him he's wrong.
i've been waiting a long time for this.
"next time, you'll believe me when i tell you the safety protocols are off. now, you've got five seconds to start running again, or you'll end up with more than a flesh wound."
so much for not playing along with seska's programme.
are you able to continue?
"i'll keep up. the question is, where are we going?"
i have an idea.
what's the point? this isn't the real sickbay.
"i may be able to use some of this holographic equipment to treat your wound. besides, it's as good a place as any to hide from seska."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"no emergency, doc. i'm fine."
nonsense. you have second-degree phaser burns. please have a seat on biobed one.
"that's all right, doc. i'm telling you, i feel fine."
you require treatment. twenty cc's nitric acid. a little proverbial salt in the wound.
you're looking well.
go!
i'm not going to leave you!
it was a pleasure treating you. don't hesitate to call again.
"are you all right, mister paris?"
"oh, just great. maybe we can go to the mess hall now and let the holographic neelix burn my arm with a frying pan."
"your feeble attempt at wit notwithstanding, it does appear that seska has reprogrammed the holographic crew to torture us. i suggest we avoid meeting any more of them."
seska to tuvok. i know you can hear me.
"oh, terrific."
"i just wanted to remind you that wherever you go, i'll find you."
i say we try the jefferies tubes.
i concur.
"captain, you're not going to believe this, but seska caused these cascade failures."
seska? how?
"what she lacked in loyalty she made up for in ingenuity. according to the back-up computer logs, she got into tuvok's scenario on stardate 48671 about a month before she left the ship. she programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time tuvok reopened the narrative parameters file, which he didn't do until today."
can we get them out?
"seska laid booby-trapped subroutines everywhere. if we try to open the holodeck doors, the power grid is rigged to explode."
and the transporters are still offline.
you said the narrative parameters file is open now?
seska's revised programme is playing out as we speak.
"if seska can rewrite tuvok, maybe i can rewrite seska."
"so, tuvok, anything in the dictates of poetics about how to escape from a ship full of insane holograms?"
"your attempts at humour are hardly constructive, mister paris."
the controls are jammed. i cannot close the hatch.
tuvok!
where do you suppose this came from?
that is an intriguing question.
"do you think seska's toying with us? taking us to the brink of death again, then letting us live so she can keep torturing us?"
"i prefer a more optimistic interpretation. it is possible our shipmates outside the holodeck have learned of our predicament and have found a way to help us by making additions to the programme, such as that plasma extinguisher."
"if you want to look on the bright side, i'm certainly not going to argue with you."
"if they do know what's going on, why just hand us a plasma extinguisher? why not shut down the holo-grid, or change the scenario?"
i would imagine seska has made it very difficult for anyone to implement more than minor changes.
take a look at this.
you were right.
we must follow their instructions.
"hello, boys."
what do you say we go for a little walk?
where did they come from?
seska's programme is adding new algorithms to counteract the changes we're making.
i need more access to the narrative subroutines.
i can't get in.
"you'd better find a way, otherwise tom and tuvok aren't going to make it out of there alive. it looks like chakotay's taking them to the holographic cargo bay."
torres to kim. how are you coming
with those transporters?
seska's programme has completely disabled the relay access ports.
it's going to take a while to get tom and tuvok out of there.
i guess that means i keep writing.
"as you can see, the last of your comrades have been captured. in case anybody had any doubts, it should be obvious by now that this is no longer a starfleet vessel."
"bring paris and tuvok over here. you and you, bring your weapons."
what are you doing?
what do you think i'm doing? i'm going to execute them right here.
i need access to the character algorithms now!
i'm on it.
fire on my order.
belay that.
what are you doing? we planned this.
i'm not sure it's necessary to kill them.
"if i'm not mistaken, the chakotay hologram is undergoing some sort of character change."
do you think they're trying to help us again?
these two rodents betrayed us. they deserve to die.
"don't listen to her, commander. you've taken the ship. there is no need to add murder to your list of offences."
quiet!
lower your weapons.
it's working.
"now, if i can just keep modifying the chakotay hologram."
"you're not going to lose your nerve, are you?"
we have what we want. there's no reason to kill them.
prepare to fire on my order!
seska! i'm in command of this operation.
not anymore.
"i don't believe it. the programme is reconfiguring the subprocessors to counter every change we make. no matter what we do, it rewrites itself so that tom and tuvok will die."
i'm not out of ideas yet.
"now, is there anyone else who wants to challenge my authority? isn't their loyalty inspiring? set your phasers to kill."
don't listen to her.
fire on my order.
what the hell was that?
"don't move, seska."
bridge to seska. we're under attack by the rukani.
the rukani?
"the people the captain and i were visiting while you were busy taking over the ship. when we realised there was a mutiny in progress, we called them for a little assistance."
"harry, have you got transporters yet?"
"still working on it, captain."
you're not getting this ship back.
that is a rather bold statement for someone in your position.
"computer, initiate sixty seconds self-destruct sequence, authorisation zeta one."
this ship will self-destruct in sixty seconds.
"computer, belay that order, authorisation tuvok four seven seven four."
unable to comply. voiceprint not recognised.
"if you don't hand over that phaser rifle, everyone on this ship is going to be dead in"
self-destruct in forty five seconds.
"i don't know how she rigged it, captain, but when she ordered the self-destruct it initiated an overload in the holodeck power relays. the whole grid is going to blow."
self-destruct in thirty seconds.
"hand over the weapon, or the ship is going to be destroyed."
"i have set this phaser to kill. if you do not deactivate the self-destruct sequence, i will fire."
"i'm surprised at you, tuvok. that's not very logical. if i'm dead, who'll turn off the self-destruct?"
"fifteen seconds to self-destruct. thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine"
"computer, terminate self-destruct sequence, authorisation zeta one."
self-destruct sequence has been terminated.
now call off your rukani friends.
do what she says.
tuvok
"that's an order, mister paris."
"paris to the rukani vessel. thank you for your assistance, but everything's under control now."
"it is, isn't it? i guess if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself."
not bad.
seska's not the only one who knows how to cause a phaser malfunction.
the holographic simulation has ended.
it's over.
"kim to engineering. i think i can give you transporters now, captain."
"that's all right, harry. no rush."
here's to stories with happy endings.
"i must say, captain. causing the alien ship to come to our aid was a very effective plot development."
who says deus ex machina is an outdated literary device?
i'm just glad you didn't come down with a case of writer's block.
"so, you two are going to have to come up with a new idea for your next literary collaboration."
what about doing a western?
or a detective story?
"i don't care what kind of story it is, as long as i'm not the bad guy this time."
"i've got a great idea for a holonovel about a daring trader who becomes a cook on a starship. eventually, he rises"
"mister neelix, if mister paris and i do create another work of holo-fiction, i assure you we will choose a subject much less close to home."
"the cardinal is a thief. i delivered two portraits of his mindless nephew more than three months ago, to be depicted in the heroic mode of an hercules or an achilles, so specified our contract. i complied, making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than nature ever intended. an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles! and what have i, the divine leonardo da vinci received in payment?"
the cardinal's eternal gratitude?
"essatto! in other words, signorina, less than nothing."
all the more reason why you should accept my proposal.
"money is beside the point, signorina. catarina, is it?"
"yes. i'm only asking for a corner, one bench, a place to work on my own projects, paintings, sculptures. just being here in your company is inspiring to me."
"flattery, catarina, is also beside the point. besides, i prefer my solitude. scusi."
meraviglioso.
what will you call it?
the arm of hephaestos.
the god of the forge.
every blacksmith who has ever swung a hammer will thank me for this creation.
someone once said all invention is but an extension of the body of man.
"do not think that just because i have enjoyed your visit today, that i am prepared to turn my workshop into a traveller's inn."
che cazzo.
"here, let me help you."
you will get your hands covered with goose grease.
it's good for the skin.
let us see if we can find his big brother. hopefully he will be stronger.
this looks like a flying machine.
"i though that because my imagination took flight so easily, my body could do the same. i was wrong."
it's this flapping approach. you designed your machine to mimic the way a bat or a sparrow flies.
"yes, yes. so?"
"so what if you based it on the hawk, instead?"
the hawk. a creature that glides through the air.
essatto.
"we will design a new machine, and you, catarina, will help me fly it."
i'll need someplace to work.
a corner? one workbench?
that will be fine.
ten scudi per week and you provide your own materials.
"seven. and i might need to borrow a few things, on occasion."
then we have an agreement.
chakotay to janeway.
go ahead.
"captain, we need you in engineering. there's something here you should see."
"on my way. computer, end programme."
what have you got?
some bad news. the long range probe we sent out two months ago has stopped transmitting.
"at first i thought it was a problem with the communications grid, then i cleared up the last few seconds of telemetry. take a look at this."
"this could be it, captain. borg space."
"we don't know exactly how many vessels are out there. but their space appears to be vast. it includes thousands of solar systems, all borg. we are no doubt entering the heart of their territory. there's no going around it, but there may be a way through it."
"before the probe was disabled, it picked up a narrow corridor of space devoid of borg activity. we've nicknamed it the northwest passage."
"unfortunately, the passage is filled with intense gravimetric distortions. probably caused by a string of quantum singularities."
better to ride the rapids than face the hive.
exactly. we're going to set a course for that corridor. and go into full tactical alert. where do we stand with weapons?
"i have reprogrammed the phaser banks to a rotating modulation, but i suspect a borg vessel will adapt quickly."
we can use every edge. ensign?
i've already configured the long range sensors to scan for transwarp signatures. an early warning system.
"good work. doctor, how are you coming on the medical front?"
"i've analysed every square millimetre of the borg corpse we recovered three months ago. i'm closer to understanding how their assimilation technology works, and i might be able to create some sort of medical defence."
"redouble your efforts. this is your top priority. neelix, i doubt we can resupply the ship any time soon."
"no problem, sir. i'm working on a plan to extend our food and replicator rations."
"we have to act fast. the borg have captured one of our probes. they know we're out here. we'll do everything in our power to avoid a direct confrontation. but if and when we do engage the borg, i'm confident that we'll be ready. i have faith in each and every one of you. let's do it."
"ensign, on the double."
coming through. open!
i want to cut down on the time it takes to seal off the decks.
in case we take on some uninvited guests?
exactly. and i want to increase the magnitude of the forcefields.
"these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process. once inside the skin, they release a series of nanoprobes into the bloodstream."
maybe we can develop some kind of protective shielding against them.
unlikely. the tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy or energy field. which means our battle must be waged inside the body itself.
they take over the blood cell functions like a virus.
"which suggests to me that we should try to enhance the immune system. create an assimilation antibody, as it were. i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes, but we might be able to slow them down. let's try a submicron dissection on the probes we've collected so far, see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism."
"kes, is something wrong? kes?"
i saw borg.
you've had a telepathic experience?
"there were bodies. dozens of them, dead."
how's kes?
"unsettled. and uncertain. over the past two hours, she has experienced several telepathic visions about the death of borg and the destruction of voyager."
some sort of premonitions?
possibly.
"we can't just ignore her intuition, but i see no reason to alter our plan. tuvok, i want you to keep an eye on her."
"captain, long range sensors are picking up transwarp signatures. five point eight light years distant, closing from behind."
red alert.
evasive manoeuvres.
what's happening?
we've dropped out of warp.
bridge to engineering what's going on down there?
"i'm not sure, captain. some kind of subspace turbulence is preventing us from creating a stable warp field."
turbulence is increasing.
"i'm reading two borg vessels. make that three. four. no, five. fifteen borg vessels. distance two point one light years and closing."
shields to maximum. stand by all weapons.
they're in visual range.
on screen.
my god.
captain.
i'm picking up a polaron beam. we're being scanned.
think good thoughts.
the last cube has rejoined the others.
did we sustain any damage?
no. shields held. warp engines are coming back online. all primary systems are stable.
"stand down red alert. harry. maintain a long range sensor lock on that borg armada. they seemed to be in quite a hurry, didn't they? i'd like to know what they're up to."
"yes, ma'am."
"i'll take this near-miss as a good omen. resume our course, mister paris."
"if we needed any more evidence that we've entered borg space, i think we just got it."
i'll be in my ready room.
yes. come in.
"we've just completed the latest sensor sweep. so far, so good. the northwest passage is still clear of borg activity."
i'd like to see a tactical update.
"according to my calculations, neither of us has eaten since last night. join me for dinner?"
"no thanks, i'm not hungry. and i've got a lot of work to do."
i see.
"i've been looking through the personal log entries of all the starfleet captains who encountered the borg. i've gone over every engagement, from the moment q flung the enterprise into the path of that first cube to the massacre at wolf 359. every battle, every skirmish. anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the collective."
and?
"in the words of jean-luc picard. 'in their collective state, the borg are utterly without mercy, driven by one will alone: the will to conquer. they are beyond redemption, beyond reason.' and then there's captain amasov of the endeavour. 'it is my opinion that the borg are as close to pure evil as any race we've ever encountered.' what's so funny?"
nothing.
"you're smiling. obviously, i've said something amusing."
you sounded just like amasov.
what?
"just now, while you were reading his log. you were using his inflections."
i did not.
"yes, you were. and before that, you were doing a pretty good picard."
was i?
it's nothing to be ashamed about. echoing the greats. ensign hickman in astrophysics does a passable janeway.
"if we manage to survive the next few days, i'm going to have a little chat with ensign hickman. imitating the captain, huh? surely that violates some kind of starfleet protocol. this day was inevitable. we all knew it. and we've all tried to prepare ourselves for the challenge ahead. but at what point is the risk too great? at what point do we come about and retreat to friendly territory? could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant? i keep looking to all these captains, my comrades in arms. but the truth is, i'm alone."
"if that moment comes. we'll face it together. and we'll make the right decision. you're not alone, kathryn."
"three years ago, i didn't even know your name. today i can't imagine a day without you."
captain janeway to the bridge.
gentlemen.
something strange is going on.
the power signatures of those borg vessels have terminated.
all of them?
"they're dead in the water, about five point two light years from here."
cause?
unknown.
mister paris.
captain.
set a course for their position. warp two.
we're approaching the ships.
slow to impulse. on screen.
lifesigns?
"a few, but they're erratic."
"captain, i'm detecting two residual weapons signatures in the debris. one is borg, the other is of unknown origin."
who could do this to the borg?
someone more powerful than the borg? it's hard to imagine.
but they did it. fifteen cubes! we might've just found our ticket through borg space. an ally.
let's not jump to conclusions. scan the vicinity for other vessels.
there are none.
hold on. i'm picking up some sort of bio-readings. they're coming from the outer hull of one of the borg ships.
"let's see it. magnify, mister kim."
"it's definitely organic, but our sensors can't penetrate its surface."
send a standard greeting.
no response.
this could be a space-dwelling organism or a biological weapon.
i'd like to know what kind of weapon could destroy the borg. can we beam it away from the ship?
i can't get a lock on it.
tractor beam?
no effect.
"whatever that thing is, it's impervious to our technology."
"tuvok, are you reading an atmosphere in the cube?"
affirmative.
"commander chakotay, i want you to take an away team inside. try to get a short range scan of the biomass."
"there are still borg lifesigns, but they're unstable."
we'll keep an open comlink and an active transporter lock. we'll pull you out of there at the first sign of trouble.
"tuvok, harry, you're with me."
this way.
"lower your phasers. if we don't appear threatening, they should ignore us."
looks like they're a little preoccupied.
the alien bio-readings are getting stronger. we're close.
commander.
curious.
that's not the word i had in mind.
those bodies are reminiscent of one of the premonitions kes described.
didn't kes say we were all going to die?
let's keep moving.
it looks like the bio-mass dissolved right through the borg hull.
this borg is attempting to assimilate it.
doesn't look like he's having much luck.
"there's a chamber beyond this opening. forty meters wide, high concentrations of antimatter particles. it looks like a warp propulsion system of some kind."
it's a ship?
"starfleet has encountered species that use organic-based vessels. the breen, for example."
there doesn't seem to be anybody on board. chakotay to voyager.
"go ahead, commander."
"captain, we've found an entrance to the biomass. we think it may be a ship of some kind. permission to go inside."
granted.
"harry, that's a borg distribution node. see if you can download their tactical database. it might contain a record of what happened here."
"aye, sir."
tuvok.
they seem to be organic conduits. they're carrying electrodynamic fluid.
maybe an energy source.
"maybe. this looks like a binary matrix, but it's laced with neuropeptides. could be their version of a computer core."
this damage was caused by a borg disrupter beam. the wall appears to be regenerating itself. commander!
kes?
harry's in danger.
what are you
get them out of there.
sickbay to janeway.
commander!
there's someone in here with us and it's not the borg. i can't localise it but it's within twenty metres.
perhaps the pilot has returned.
voyager to away team.
go ahead.
stand by for transport. we're getting you out of there.
good idea.
energise.
i can't get a lock on them.
what's the problem?
it looks like bioelectric interference from whatever's coming toward them.
it's within seven metres. let's get out of here!
narrow the confinement beam.
no effect. i'm going to try a skeletal lock.
what?
"i think i can get a clean lock on the minerals in their bone tissue. i just came up with it, but i think it might work."
the lifeform's five metres away and closing.
from where?
i've got them.
"a skeletal lock, huh? we'll have to add that one to the transporter manual."
"captain, the bioship is powering up, like it's charging some kind of weapon."
"mister paris, get us out of here. maximum warp."
the alien ship is not pursuing.
kes?
"i could hear its thoughts. the pilot of the bioship was trying to communicate with me. they're a telepathic species. i've been aware of them for some time now. the premonitions. captain, it's not the borg that we should be worried about, it's them."
what did it say to you?
"it said, the weak will perish."
the infection is spreading. what began with a few stray cells contaminating the chest wound is now infusing every system in his body.
it looks like he's being transformed in some way.
"not exactly. the alien cells are consuming his body from the inside out. in essence, mister kim is being eaten alive."
"he's still conscious, doctor."
"i tried giving him a sedative, but it was rejected immediately. in fact, every treatment i've tried has been neutralised within seconds. these are alien cells. each one contains more than a hundred times the dna of a human cell. it's the most densely coded life form i've ever seen. even i would need years to decipher it."
"they have an extraordinary immune response. anything that penetrates the cell membrane, chemical, biological, technological, it's all instantly destroyed. that's why the borg can't assimilate them."
"resistance in this case is far from futile. nevertheless, i believe borg technology holds the key to saving mister kim."
how so?
"i hope to unleash an army of modified borg nanoprobes into his bloodstream, designed to target and eradicate the infection. as you know, i've been analysing the nanoprobes. they're efficient little assimilators, one can't help but admire the workmanship. but they're no match for the alien cells. so i successfully dissected a nanoprobe and managed to access its re-coding mechanism. i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells. that way, the probe can do its work without being detected. observe. the alien cells are completely oblivious to probe until it's too late. unfortunately, i've only created a few prototypes. i'll need several days to modify enough nanoprobes to cure ensign kim."
does harry have several days?
i wish i knew.
"fight it, harry. that's an order."
we've analysed the borg's tactical database. they refer to these new aliens as species 8472.
"over the past five months, the borg have been attacked by them on at least a dozen occasions. each time, the borg were defeated swiftly."
the collective has very little information about the species.
is anything known about where they come from?
i'm afraid so.
get the captain.
the northwest passage.
it's clear of borg activity for a very good reason.
i'm picking up one hundred and thirty three bioships. more are appearing.
from where?
they seem to be coming from a quantum singularity.
i'm localising the gravimetric distortions.
on screen.
"kes, anything?"
yes. i can hear them. they're in a place where they're alone. nothing else lives there.
some kind of parallel universe?
"i don't know. i feel malevolence, a cold hatred. the weak will perish. it's an invasion. they intend on destroying everything."
"tom, reverse course, maximum warp. take us five light years out and hold position."
"aye, captain."
maintain red alert. commander.
that moment we spoke about? it's here. any thoughts?
just one. flying into that corridor would mean certain death.
"agreed. the northwest passage is no longer an option. so now the choice is between facing the borg in their space, or finding ourselves a nice planet here in the delta quadrant and giving up on ever getting home."
"we'd be turning around, but we wouldn't be giving up. we may find another way home."
"i'm not ready to walk onto that bridge and tell the crew we're quitting. i can't do it, chakotay. not yet. there must be an alternative."
"kathryn, you haven't slept in two days. try getting some rest, and clearing your head. we're safe for the moment. we can tell the crew tomorrow, if we have to."
see you in the morning.
maestro? leonardo?
catarina. buona sera.
am i disturbing you?
what do you see?
a wall with candlelight reflecting on it. why? what do you see?
"a flock of starlings, the leaves of an oak, a horse's tail, a thief with a noose around his neck. and a wall with the candlelight reflecting on it. there are times, catarina, when i find myself transfixed by a shadow on the wall, or the splashing of water against a stone. i stare at it, the hours pass, the world around me drops away, replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination. a way to focus the mind. sit, and tell me why you have come."
"there's a path before me. the only way home. and on either side, mortal enemies bent on destroying each other. if i attempt to pass through them i'll be destroyed as well. but if i turn around, that would end all hope of ever getting home. and no matter how much i try to focus my mind, i can't see an alternative."
"when one's imagination cannot provide an answer, one must seek a greater imagination. there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer. i must deliver a bronzetto to the monks at santa croce. come with me, catarina, hey? we will awake the abbot, visit the chapel, and appeal to god."
somehow i don't think that's going to work for me. but there is an alternative i haven't considered. what if i made an appeal to the devil?
an alliance with the borg?
"more like an exchange. we offer them a way to defeat their new enemy and in return we get safe passage through their space. in developing a treatment for harry, the doctor has found a way to attack the aliens at a microscopic level."
"it's still in the experimental stages, captain. i've only made a few prototypes."
"nevertheless, if we teach the borg how to modify their own nanoprobes, they'd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the aliens."
"in theory, yes."
"b'elanna, it's clear from the borg database that they know practically nothing about species 8472."
"that's right. the borg gain knowledge through assimilation. what they can't assimilate, they can't understand."
"but we don't assimilate. we investigate. and in this case, that's given us an edge. we've discovered something they need."
but the borg aren't exactly known for their diplomacy. how can we expect them to cooperate with us?
"normally, the answer would be no. but if what i've learned from the aliens is true, the borg are losing this conflict."
"in one regard, the borg are no different than we are. they're trying to survive. i don't believe they're going to refuse an offer that will help them do that."
what makes you think the borg won't attempt to take the information by assimilating voyager and its crew.
"that won't get them anywhere. doctor, you're the only one on board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications. i want you to transfer all of that research into your holomatrix."
certainly.
"you're my guarantee. if the borg threaten us in any way, we'll simply erase your programme. but it won't come to that, doctor. it's in the collective's own interest to cooperate. voyager is only one ship. our safe passage is a small price to pay for what we're offering in exchange. b'elanna, assist the doctor with his transfer."
"aye, captain."
"mister paris, locate the nearest borg vessel and lay in a course. they shouldn't be difficult to find."
"yes, ma'am."
dismissed.
you were awfully quiet.
"i didn't want the others to hear this, but i think what you're proposing is too great a risk."
how so?
"there's a story i heard as a child, a parable, and i never forgot it. a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river, wondering how to get to the other side. suddenly he saw a fox. he asked the fox to take him on his back across the river. the fox said no. if i do that you'll sting me, and i'll drown. the scorpion assured him. if i did that, we'd both drown. so the fox thought about it and finally agreed. so the scorpion climbed up on his back, and the fox began to swim. but halfway across the river, the scorpion stung him. as the poison filled his veins, the fox turned to the scorpion and said why did you do that? now you'll drown too. i couldn't help it, said the scorpion. it's my nature."
"i understand the risk, and i'm not proposing that we try to change the nature of the beast, but this is a unique situation. to our knowledge, the borg have never been so threatened. they're vulnerable. i think we can take advantage of that."
"even if we do somehow negotiate an exchange, how long will they keep up their end of the bargain? it could take months to cross borg territory. we'd be facing thousands of systems, millions of vessels."
"but only one collective, and we've got them over a barrel. we don't need to give them a single bit of information, not until we're safe. we just need the courage to see this through to the end."
there are other kinds of courage. like the courage to accept that there are some situations beyond your control. not every problem has an immediate solution.
you're suggesting we turn around.
"yes. we should get out of harm's way. let them fight it out. in the meantime, there's still plenty of delta quadrant left to explore. we may find another way home."
"or we may find something else. six months, a year down the road, after species 8472 gets through with the borg, we could find ourselves back in the line of fire, and we'll have missed the window of opportunity that exists right here, right now."
how much is our safety worth?
what do you mean?
we'd be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering billions. we'd be helping the borg assimilate yet another species just to get ourselves back home. it's wrong!
tell that to harry kim. he's barely alive thanks to that species. maybe helping to assimilate them isn't such a bad idea. we could be doing the delta quadrant a favour.
"i don't think you really believe that. i think you're struggling to justify your plan, because your desire to get this crew home is blinding you to other options. i know you, kathryn. sometimes you don't know when to step back."
"do you trust me, chakotay?"
that isn't the issue.
"oh, but it is. only yesterday you were saying that we'd face this together, that you'd be at my side."
i still have to tell you what i believe. i'm no good to you if i don't do that.
"i appreciate your insights, but the time for debate is over. i've made my decision. now, do i have your support?"
you're the captain. i'm the first officer. i'll follow your orders. that doesn't change my belief that we're making a fatal mistake.
"then i guess i'm alone, after all. dismissed."
"there are three planets in this system. inhabitants, all borg. a vessel is approaching."
all stop. shields up.
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
they've locked onto us with a tractor beam.
"borg vessel, this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. i have tactical information about species 8472. i want to negotiate."
negotiation is irrelevant. you will be assimilated.
"borg vessel. what you're receiving is a sample of the knowledge we possess. if you don't disengage your tractor beam immediately, i will have that data destroyed. you have ten seconds to comply. we know you're in danger of being defeated. you can't afford to risk losing this information. disengage your tractor"
state your demands.
"i want safe passage through your space. once my ship is beyond borg territory, i'll give you our research."
unacceptable. our space is vast. your passage would require too much time. we need the technology now.
"if i give it to you now, you'll assimilate us."
species 8472 must be stopped. our survival is your survival. give us the technology.
no. safe passage first or no deal.
state your proposal.
"let's work together, combine our resources. even if we do give you the technology now, you're still going to need time to develop it. by working together, we can create a weapon more quickly. if you escort us through your space we can perfect the weapon as we"
where did that ship come from?
a quantum singularity has appeared twenty thousand kilometres away. the bioship is heading directly toward the planet.
the borg shields are weakening. we might be able to break free of the tractor beam.
can you get a lock on the captain?
not yet.
"commander, there are nine more bioships coming out of the singularity."
what's going on?
report.
the borg shields are offline. i've got a lock on captain janeway.
get her out of there and break us free of the cube. stand by all weapons.
i'm trying to energise. the borg are scattering the beam.
compensate.
no effect.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
commander. cut the transporter beam.
captain?
"do it. i've reached an agreement with the collective. we're going to help them design a weapon against species 8472. in exchange, they've granted us safe passage through their space."
the cube is altering course. they're heading toward the alpha quadrant.
"that's part of the plan. we'll work on the weapon en route. once we're across their territory, we'll give them the nanoprobes. they appear to be holding up their end of the bargain. i suggest we do the same."
how do you propose we begin this collaboration?
"i'm going to work here, on the cube. they have technology that'll make the job go faster. i want to take advantage of it."
it's not necessary for you to stay there. we can set up a comlink with the borg and
it's part of the deal. i work here.
"all right. as long as we're cooperating, maybe the borg would be willing to disengage their tractor beam. we can match their course without a leash."
"i'll propose it. mister tuvok, transport to my coordinates."
understood.
"we're going to make this work, commander. janeway out."
you heard the captain.
"i replicated nearly ten million borg nanoprobes, each of them reprogrammed to my specifications, each capable of targeting the alien tissue."
assimilating it.
"just momentarily. the borg technology will denaturate within seconds, taking the alien tissue along with it. mister kim, i'm about to inject your carotid artery. you'll feel a tingling sensation. don't be alarmed."
"nice to see you again, ensign."
it's working.
prepare another dose of nanoprobes.
"yes, doctor."
good work. let me know when he's back on his feet.
"commander. i must tell you. i have my doubts about this alliance. you may have convinced the borg the nanoprobes can defeat their enemy, but a medical treatment is a long way from a weapon of war."
leave that to the captain. this situation is unpredictable so we're going to stay at full red alert. keep all information about the nanoprobes stored in your holo-matrix.
"don't worry. i'll delete myself at the first sign of trouble. well, maybe not the first sign."
we've just received word. tuvok beamed to the cube. he's joined the captain.
keep a transporter lock on both of them.
"i'll try, but the borg are already regenerating their shields."
try matching their shield frequencies.
it won't work. they'll be able to adapt too quickly.
"i don't want to hear what we can't do, lieutenant! just find a way to get our people out of there if we have to."
"aye, sir."
they've released their tractor beam.
match their course and speed.
"i never thought i'd hear myself say this, but, looks like the borg are cooperating."
kes? kes! kes! what's wrong?
they're watching us.
may i ask where we're being taken?
grid nine two of subjunction twelve. our very own workspace. it's near the centre of the cube.
these are my tricorder readings of the bioship we examined. i believe you will find them most revealing.
have you compared this to the doctor's analysis of the alien tissue?
yes. many of the cellular structures are identical.
the aliens and their ships are made of the same organic material.
apparently so.
you have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve. proceed.
"all right. we've analysed one of the alien vessels, and it appears to be constructed of organic material vulnerable to the modified nanoprobes. i suggest we begin thinking about a large scale delivery system. a way to infect their ships and destroy them at the microscopic"
we will begin.
what are you doing?
a neural transceiver is required for maximum communication. we will work as one mind.
no. that wasn't the agreement.
the neural link is temporary. you will not be damaged.
"i don't care. i prefer to communicate verbally, thank you."
your primitive communication is inefficient.
"on the contrary. we work better with our individuality intact. surely, we've proven that to you by now."
irrelevant. you must comply.
we must do nothing. tell your drone to remove the transceiver. what about choosing a representative? a single borg we can work with and talk to directly.
elaborate.
you've done it before. when you transformed jean-luc picard into locutus. we will not be assimilated. choose a representative or the deal's off.
i speak for the borg.
i'm captain janeway. this is lieutenant tuvok.
we are aware of your designations.
what's your designation?
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. but you may call me seven of nine. you are proposing a large-scale weapon. we concur."
i thought you might.
"we could encase the nanoprobes in some of our photon torpedoes. in essence, turn them into biomolecular warheads."
your torpedoes are inadequate. they lack the necessary range and dispursive force.
do you have a better idea?
we are borg.
i take that as a yes.
a multikinetic neutronic mine. five million isoton yield.
an explosion that size could affect an entire star system.
correct. the shock wave will disperse the nanoprobes over a radius of five light years.
that's somewhat larger than i had in mind. you're proposing a weapon of mass destruction.
we are.
"well, i'm not. you'd be endangering innocent worlds."
it would be efficient.
we'd need approximately fifty trillion nanoprobes to arm this mine. it would take the doctor several weeks to replicate that amount. you are losing this conflict. are you willing to risk further delay?
"right now your enemy believes it is invulnerable. if we create smaller weapons using our torpedoes and destroy a few of their bioships, it may deter them, convince them to give up this war."
"you are individuals. you are small, and you think in small terms. but the present situation requires that we consider your plan. voyager's weapons inventory. photon torpedo complement thirty two. class six warhead. explosive yield two hundred isotons."
how did you obtain this information?
we are borg.
naturally.
"commander, we have some disturbing news."
"at this point, i'm getting used to it."
"her telepathic visions are increasing, both in frequency and intensity."
"it feels different this time. it's almost like they're right here, in the room."
there is it again.
"i'm trying to block them out, but i can't."
"every time she has a vision specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyperstimulation. memory engrams, perceptual centres. i can't be sure but i think there's more going on here than just a simple hello."
enhance this grid. i want to take a closer look at the detonator.
we must analyse the bioship. your data.
"you're human, aren't you?"
this body was assimilated eighteen years ago. it ceased to be human at that time.
i'm curious. what was your name before you were
do not engage us in further irrelevant discourse. we are being hailed by your vessel.
"commander, what is it?"
it's kes. the doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory.
"if that's true, they may already know what we're planning."
i've ordered long range scans for bioships. nothing so far.
"we should alter course, try to throw them off."
agreed. our course and heading have been changed.
"match them, and keep me apprised of any changes in kes."
chakotay out.
we now require one of your photon torpedoes and the nanoprobes.
one step at a time. we're not safely across your territory yet.
we must construct and test a prototype now. the risk of attack has increased.
irrelevant. we have an agreement. you're asking me to give up my only guarantee that you won't assimilate us. i won't risk it.
"are you willing to risk a direct confrontation with us? if we transport five hundred drones onto your vessel, do you believe you could offer sufficient resistance?"
we'd die trying.
that won't be necessary. we must construct a launching system to accommodate this design.
"glad you could join us, mister kim."
harry. welcome back.
"thanks. reporting for duty, sir. the doctor gave me a clean bill of health. did i miss anything?"
"not too much. take your station, ensign."
you've still got a tendril up your nose.
commander. i'm picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft. it's a singularity.
we are under attack.
they're charging weapons.
shields. keep a lock on the away team.
direct hit to our secondary hull!
transporters are offline! shields and weapons are down.
voyager has taken heavy damage.
we cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed.
we're being targeted!
brace for impact!
the cube?
"destroyed, and it took the bioship with it."
tuvok to chakotay.
"go ahead, tuvok. where are you?"
i'm in cargo bay two
along with the captain and a number of borg.
we were beamed over just before impact. we require assistance.
"tuvok. tuvok? secure that deck. security team to cargo bay two. paris, you have the bridge."
lower your weapons.
"we are here with your captain's consent. it was necessary to sacrifice our vessel to protect yours. we have an alliance, do we not?"
for now they're contained. they've assimilated cargo bay two and they're drawing energy from the secondary power couplings.
but they've gone no further.
not yet. i've sealed off decks nine through thirteen and posted security details at every access point.
i suggest we increase security around sickbay as well.
already done. how far did you get on the weapon?
we're ready to construct a prototype.
"you're fit to return back to duty, lieutenant."
"and you, kes?"
"oh, i'm all right. the visions have stopped for now."
"the plasma burns to her thoracic region i can treat, and i've already stopped the internal bleeding. but her neural injuries are going to require some creative thinking."
"before we beamed out, an alien energy discharge struck very near the captain."
"well, it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways. i'll have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain functions. but i must tell you, unless i can repair the damage, she may never regain consciousness."
make sure those borg stay put. i want tactical updates every twenty minutes.
"aye, sir. shall i resume working with them?"
stand by for now.
the captain wishes to speak with you. please keep it brief.
the doctor explained my condition. you're in command.
i understand.
they'll push you. they'll threaten you. but they need you. they need this alliance. you have to make this work. i want you to make this work. get this crew home.
i must begin.
where is your captain? i must speak with her.
"in our medical bay, recovering. you'll be dealing with me now."
circumstances have changed.
i'd say so.
the loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement.
"i've been giving that some thought. i'm willing to let you stay on board. we'll continue to work with you on the weapon. once we're safely out of borg territory we'll give you the nanoprobes, shake hands and part company."
insufficient. our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then. the nearest borg vessel is forty light years away. you will reverse course and take us to it.
"even at maximum warp, that's a five day journey in the wrong direction. we're supposed to be heading out of borg space, not deeper into it."
there is no alternative.
"look, i'll honour the original agreement, but i'm not turning this ship around. it's too dangerous."
denying our request is also dangerous.
i'll think about it.
think quickly.
"a five day trip back into the heart of borg territory. it's too risky. with those drones and the nanoprobes on board, we might as well have a bull's-eye painted on our hull. we're a prime target for species 8472. we'd never survive another attack."
what is the alternative?
"i'm going to end this alliance here and now. we're going to drop the borg off on the next uninhabited planet, give them the nanoprobes and take our chances alone. they can wait for a borg ship to pick them up and finish the weapon. i'm in command now and i have to do what i think is best for this crew. tom, i want you to scan for the nearest uninhabited planet and set a course."
"aye, sir."
"i must caution you, commander. the borg may not go quietly."
we'll see. bring that female drone to the ready room. dismissed.
"once we've beamed you to the surface, we'll send down the nanoprobes and all our research."
unacceptable. we don't have time for
this isn't open for discussion. i'm not turning this ship around. you're getting what you wanted. i suggest we part ways amicably.
there is another option. we could assimilate your vessel.
"if a single drone steps one millimetre out of that cargo bay, i'll decompress the entire deck. you won't pose much of a threat floating in space."
"when your captain first approached us, we suspected that an agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain. you are erratic, conflicted, disorganised. every decision is debated, every action questioned. every individual entitled to their own small opinion. you lack harmony, cohesion, greatness. it will be your undoing."
escort our guest back to the cargo bay.
"well, i've made my decision. if it were only a matter of going against the orders of my superior officer. you're more than just my captain. you're my friend. i hope you'll understand."
"species 8472 has penetrated matrix zero one zero, grid nineteen. eight planets destroyed. three hundred twelve vessels disabled. four million, six hundred twenty one borg eliminated. we must seize control of the alpha quadrant vessel, and take it into the alien realm."
we understand.
class h moon. oxygen-argon atmosphere.
it'll do. take us out of warp and enter orbit.
"aye, sir."
"tuvok. stand by to transport the borg directly from the cargo bay. after they're on the surface, have security run a sweep of"
i'm reading power fluctuations in the deflector array.
cause?
it looks like the borg have accessed deflector control. they're trying to realign the emitters.
shut them out.
they've bypassed security protocols.
we're emitting a resonant graviton beam. it's creating another singularity.
reverse course.
we're fighting intense gravimetric distortion. i can't break free.
"bridge to cargo bay two. stop what you're doing, or i'll depressurise that deck and blow you out into space. this is your final warning. do it!"
decompression cycle complete.
i still don't have deflector control.
"commander, a single borg has survived."
we're being pulled in!
report.
we appear to have crossed an interdimensional rift.
"we've definitely left our galaxy. no stars, no planets."
let's see.
i'm re-calibrating sensors. the entire region is filled with some kind of organic fluid. this isn't space. it's matter.
commander chakotay. we have entered the domain of species 8472. report to the cargo bay.
"paris, repressurise cargo bay two. tuvok."
"our entry into fluidic space has created a compression wave. they know we're here. a fleet of bioships is already converging on our position. time to intercept, three hours, seventeen minutes."
you've been here before. how else could you know about fluidic space?
we must prepare this ship for the altercation. we will construct a complement of biomolecular warheads.
"why? why were you here? you started this war, didn't you? what's the matter, our galaxy wasn't big enough for you? you had to conquer new territory? but this race fought back. a species as malevolent as your own."
species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated. their technology is biogenically engineered. it is superior to that of all species we have previously encountered.
which is precisely what you wanted.
they are the apex of biological evolution. their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection.
so instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy.
there is only one course of action. destroy them first. my subspace link to the collective has been weakened by the interdimensional rift. we cannot signal for help. we are alone. we must construct a compliment of biomolecular warheads and modify your weapons to launch them.
i've got a better idea. why don't you open that rift again and take us back?
"if i did that, you will no longer cooperate."
doctor to chakotay.
go ahead.
report to sickbay at once.
on my way.
captain?
"ah. as you can see, i've repaired her neural damage. ensign kim, the captain, i'm two for two."
doctor. if you'll excuse us a moment.
hmm? eh? oh. gladly. computer deactivate emh programme.
"the doctor brought me up to speed, but he couldn't tell me what i really wanted to know. why?"
"the collective ordered me to reverse course, travel forty light years back the way we came. what would you have done?"
i probably would've reversed course. maintained the alliance as long as possible.
"in my mind, the alliance was already over."
you never trusted me. you never believed this would work. you were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders.
trust had nothing to with it. i made a tactical decision.
and so did i.
they have taking advantage of us from day one.
"we made concessions, so did they."
they lied. the borg started the war with species 8472. we've only got one borg left to worry about. we should try to disable her and get back to the delta quadrant. we might be able to duplicate the deflector protocols they used to open a singularity.
"no. i won't be caught tinkering with the deflector when those aliens attack. there's no other way out of this, chakotay. it's too late for opinions, it's too late for discussion. it's time to make the call, and i'm making it. we fight the aliens in full cooperation with the borg."
"i was linked to a collective once, remember? i had a neurotransceiver embedded in my spine. i know who we're dealing with. we've got to get rid of that last borg and take our chances alone."
"it won't work. this isn't working either. there are two wars going on. the one out there, and the one in here, and we're losing both of them."
it will be your undoing.
what?
"our conflicted nature. our individuality. seven of nine said that we lack the cohesion of a collective mind. that one day it would divide us and destroy us. and here we are, proving her point."
"i'll tell you when we lost control of this situation, when we made our mistake. it was the moment we turned away from each other. we don't have to stop being individuals to get through this, we just have to stop fighting each other."
captain janeway.
i've relieved mister chakotay of his duties and confined him to the brig. i'm back in command.
and you understand the situation.
"completely. tuvok, give her the nanoprobes. work with her. build as many warheads as you can and start modifying our weapons systems. i suggest we think about enhancing our defences, as well. if we're going to fight this battle, i intend to win it."
we are in agreement.
"good. this is the plan. we engage the enemy here, in their space. we show them what they're up against. if they have any sense of self-preservation, they'll back off, pull their ships out of the delta quadrant. that's provided the weapons are effective. if they aren't, it's been nice working with you. we've got to get this ship armed and ready in under two hours. we're going to war."
borg modifications are complete.
bring them online.
torpedo launch tubes active. hull armour engaged. shield enhancements stable.
"biomolecular weapons are ready. thirteen standard photon torpedoes. and one class ten, armed with a high yield warhead."
"all hands, this is the captain. ready your stations. seal all emergency bulkheads and prepare to engage the enemy. stand by for my orders."
four bioships have just entered sensor range.
battle stations.
i've got a visual.
on screen.
i can hear them. they want to talk through me. they say we've contaminated their realm.
tell them we had no choice. we were only trying to defend ourselves.
they say our galaxy is impure. its proximity is a threat to their genetic integrity.
"tell them we have a weapon. a devastating weapon that can destroy them at the cellular level. if they don't stop their attacks on the delta quadrant, we'll be forced to use it."
they said your galaxy will be purged.
shields and weapons are offline!
rerouting emergency power to the launchers.
they're coming around for another assault. i've lost thrusters.
biomolecular warheads are charged and ready.
fire.
direct hit on all four vessels. no effect.
they're charging weapons!
"the nanoprobes were successful, if not prompt. all four ships have been destroyed."
i think we've made our point. now open a singularity and get us out of here.
captain.
"kes, are you still in contact?"
yes.
"tell them if they continue their attack, we'll use the weapon again."
they're not responding.
evasive manoeuvres.
"aye, captain. they're in pursuit."
prepare to fire the high yield warhead. aft torpedo bay.
"ready, captain."
do it.
thirteen bioships have been destroyed. the others are in retreat.
i have regained full contact with the collective.
what are they saying?
all remaining bioships in the delta quadrant are returning to their realm. the borg have prevailed.
with a little help from us. now it's time you fulfilled your end of the agreement. tell the collective we expect safe passage from here on out. we'll give you a shuttlecraft. you can head for the nearest borg ship.
unacceptable. this alliance is terminated. your ship and its crew will adapt to service us.
resistance is futile.
"captain, she's tapping into helm control. she's trying to access our coordinates."
shut her out.
i can't.
bridge to chakotay. scorpion.
"seven of nine, stop what you're doing. you're human. a human individual. our minds are linked. we are one. i can hear your thoughts"
"his link is stable, but it won't be for long. you must hurry."
just a few more seconds.
i can see your memories.
you remember being human.
we are borg.
i see a young girl. a family.
irrelevant. your appeal to my humanity is pointless.
"almost there, chakotay. you've got to keep her distracted if we're going to make this work."
"listen to your human side. to yourself, the little girl. seven of nine. annika!"
he's losing the link!
initiating power surge now!
her connection to the collective is severed.
get her to sickbay. bridge to doctor. report.
"commander chakotay's going to be all right, although he may wake up with a bit of a headache."
"tom, plot a course out of borg space. maximum warp."
"yes, ma'am."
am i interrupting?
not at all. just finishing up my log.
the old-fashioned way.
i wanted to get as far away from bioimplants and fluidic space. and this feels more human somehow.
"i hate to spoil the mood, but you might want to look at this engineering report. it'll take at least two weeks to remove the borg technology from our systems. b'elanna did note that the power couplings on deck eight work better with the borg improvements."
leave them. how is our passenger?
the doctor says she's stabilising. her human cells are starting to regenerate.
i wonder what's left under all that borg technology. if she can ever become human again.
you plan to keep her on board.
we pulled the plug. we're responsible for what happens to her now.
she was assimilated at a very young age. the collective's all she knows. she might not want to stay.
i think she might. we have something the borg could never offer. friendship.
i want you to know that disobeying your orders was one of the most difficult things i've ever had to do.
"i understand. and i respect the decision you made, even though i disagree with it. what's important is that in the end we got through this, together. i don't ever want that to change."
agreed.
"good. well, i think it's time we get back to our bridge."
no argument there.
"the cardinal is a thief. i delivered two portraits of his mindless nephew more than three months ago, to be depicted in the heroic mode of an hercules or an achilles, so specified our contract. i complied, making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than nature ever intended. an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles! and what have i, the divine leonardo da vinci received in payment?"
the cardinal's eternal gratitude?
"essatto! in other words, signorina, less than nothing."
all the more reason why you should accept my proposal.
"money is beside the point, signorina. catarina, is it?"
"yes. i'm only asking for a corner, one bench, a place to work on my own projects, paintings, sculptures. just being here in your company is inspiring to me."
"flattery, catarina, is also beside the point. besides, i prefer my solitude. scusi."
meraviglioso.
what will you call it?
the arm of hephaestos.
the god of the forge.
every blacksmith who has ever swung a hammer will thank me for this creation.
someone once said all invention is but an extension of the body of man.
"do not think that just because i have enjoyed your visit today, that i am prepared to turn my workshop into a traveller's inn."
che cazzo.
"here, let me help you."
you will get your hands covered with goose grease.
it's good for the skin.
let us see if we can find his big brother. hopefully he will be stronger.
this looks like a flying machine.
"i though that because my imagination took flight so easily, my body could do the same. i was wrong."
it's this flapping approach. you designed your machine to mimic the way a bat or a sparrow flies.
"yes, yes. so?"
"so what if you based it on the hawk, instead?"
the hawk. a creature that glides through the air.
essatto.
"we will design a new machine, and you, catarina, will help me fly it."
i'll need someplace to work.
a corner? one workbench?
that will be fine.
ten scudi per week and you provide your own materials.
"seven. and i might need to borrow a few things, on occasion."
then we have an agreement.
chakotay to janeway.
go ahead.
"captain, we need you in engineering. there's something here you should see."
"on my way. computer, end programme."
what have you got?
some bad news. the long range probe we sent out two months ago has stopped transmitting.
"at first i thought it was a problem with the communications grid, then i cleared up the last few seconds of telemetry. take a look at this."
"this could be it, captain. borg space."
"we don't know exactly how many vessels are out there. but their space appears to be vast. it includes thousands of solar systems, all borg. we are no doubt entering the heart of their territory. there's no going around it, but there may be a way through it."
"before the probe was disabled, it picked up a narrow corridor of space devoid of borg activity. we've nicknamed it the northwest passage."
"unfortunately, the passage is filled with intense gravimetric distortions. probably caused by a string of quantum singularities."
better to ride the rapids than face the hive.
exactly. we're going to set a course for that corridor. and go into full tactical alert. where do we stand with weapons?
"i have reprogrammed the phaser banks to a rotating modulation, but i suspect a borg vessel will adapt quickly."
we can use every edge. ensign?
i've already configured the long range sensors to scan for transwarp signatures. an early warning system.
"good work. doctor, how are you coming on the medical front?"
"i've analysed every square millimetre of the borg corpse we recovered three months ago. i'm closer to understanding how their assimilation technology works, and i might be able to create some sort of medical defence."
"redouble your efforts. this is your top priority. neelix, i doubt we can resupply the ship any time soon."
"no problem, sir. i'm working on a plan to extend our food and replicator rations."
"we have to act fast. the borg have captured one of our probes. they know we're out here. we'll do everything in our power to avoid a direct confrontation. but if and when we do engage the borg, i'm confident that we'll be ready. i have faith in each and every one of you. let's do it."
"ensign, on the double."
coming through. open!
i want to cut down on the time it takes to seal off the decks.
in case we take on some uninvited guests?
exactly. and i want to increase the magnitude of the forcefields.
"these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process. once inside the skin, they release a series of nanoprobes into the bloodstream."
maybe we can develop some kind of protective shielding against them.
unlikely. the tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy or energy field. which means our battle must be waged inside the body itself.
they take over the blood cell functions like a virus.
"which suggests to me that we should try to enhance the immune system. create an assimilation antibody, as it were. i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes, but we might be able to slow them down. let's try a submicron dissection on the probes we've collected so far, see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism."
"kes, is something wrong? kes?"
i saw borg.
you've had a telepathic experience?
"there were bodies. dozens of them, dead."
how's kes?
"unsettled. and uncertain. over the past two hours, she has experienced several telepathic visions about the death of borg and the destruction of voyager."
some sort of premonitions?
possibly.
"we can't just ignore her intuition, but i see no reason to alter our plan. tuvok, i want you to keep an eye on her."
"captain, long range sensors are picking up transwarp signatures. five point eight light years distant, closing from behind."
red alert.
evasive manoeuvres.
what's happening?
we've dropped out of warp.
bridge to engineering what's going on down there?
"i'm not sure, captain. some kind of subspace turbulence is preventing us from creating a stable warp field."
turbulence is increasing.
"i'm reading two borg vessels. make that three. four. no, five. fifteen borg vessels. distance two point one light years and closing."
shields to maximum. stand by all weapons.
they're in visual range.
on screen.
my god.
captain.
i'm picking up a polaron beam. we're being scanned.
think good thoughts.
the last cube has rejoined the others.
did we sustain any damage?
no. shields held. warp engines are coming back online. all primary systems are stable.
"stand down red alert. harry. maintain a long range sensor lock on that borg armada. they seemed to be in quite a hurry, didn't they? i'd like to know what they're up to."
"yes, ma'am."
"i'll take this near-miss as a good omen. resume our course, mister paris."
"if we needed any more evidence that we've entered borg space, i think we just got it."
i'll be in my ready room.
yes. come in.
"we've just completed the latest sensor sweep. so far, so good. the northwest passage is still clear of borg activity."
i'd like to see a tactical update.
"according to my calculations, neither of us has eaten since last night. join me for dinner?"
"no thanks, i'm not hungry. and i've got a lot of work to do."
i see.
"i've been looking through the personal log entries of all the starfleet captains who encountered the borg. i've gone over every engagement, from the moment q flung the enterprise into the path of that first cube to the massacre at wolf 359. every battle, every skirmish. anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the collective."
and?
"in the words of jean-luc picard. 'in their collective state, the borg are utterly without mercy, driven by one will alone: the will to conquer. they are beyond redemption, beyond reason.' and then there's captain amasov of the endeavour. 'it is my opinion that the borg are as close to pure evil as any race we've ever encountered.' what's so funny?"
nothing.
"you're smiling. obviously, i've said something amusing."
you sounded just like amasov.
what?
"just now, while you were reading his log. you were using his inflections."
i did not.
"yes, you were. and before that, you were doing a pretty good picard."
was i?
it's nothing to be ashamed about. echoing the greats. ensign hickman in astrophysics does a passable janeway.
"if we manage to survive the next few days, i'm going to have a little chat with ensign hickman. imitating the captain, huh? surely that violates some kind of starfleet protocol. this day was inevitable. we all knew it. and we've all tried to prepare ourselves for the challenge ahead. but at what point is the risk too great? at what point do we come about and retreat to friendly territory? could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant? i keep looking to all these captains, my comrades in arms. but the truth is, i'm alone."
"if that moment comes. we'll face it together. and we'll make the right decision. you're not alone, kathryn."
"three years ago, i didn't even know your name. today i can't imagine a day without you."
captain janeway to the bridge.
gentlemen.
something strange is going on.
the power signatures of those borg vessels have terminated.
all of them?
"they're dead in the water, about five point two light years from here."
cause?
unknown.
mister paris.
captain.
set a course for their position. warp two.
we're approaching the ships.
slow to impulse. on screen.
lifesigns?
"a few, but they're erratic."
"captain, i'm detecting two residual weapons signatures in the debris. one is borg, the other is of unknown origin."
who could do this to the borg?
someone more powerful than the borg? it's hard to imagine.
but they did it. fifteen cubes! we might've just found our ticket through borg space. an ally.
let's not jump to conclusions. scan the vicinity for other vessels.
there are none.
hold on. i'm picking up some sort of bio-readings. they're coming from the outer hull of one of the borg ships.
"let's see it. magnify, mister kim."
"it's definitely organic, but our sensors can't penetrate its surface."
send a standard greeting.
no response.
this could be a space-dwelling organism or a biological weapon.
i'd like to know what kind of weapon could destroy the borg. can we beam it away from the ship?
i can't get a lock on it.
tractor beam?
no effect.
"whatever that thing is, it's impervious to our technology."
"tuvok, are you reading an atmosphere in the cube?"
affirmative.
"commander chakotay, i want you to take an away team inside. try to get a short range scan of the biomass."
"there are still borg lifesigns, but they're unstable."
we'll keep an open comlink and an active transporter lock. we'll pull you out of there at the first sign of trouble.
"tuvok, harry, you're with me."
this way.
"lower your phasers. if we don't appear threatening, they should ignore us."
looks like they're a little preoccupied.
the alien bio-readings are getting stronger. we're close.
commander.
curious.
that's not the word i had in mind.
those bodies are reminiscent of one of the premonitions kes described.
didn't kes say we were all going to die?
let's keep moving.
it looks like the bio-mass dissolved right through the borg hull.
this borg is attempting to assimilate it.
doesn't look like he's having much luck.
"there's a chamber beyond this opening. forty meters wide, high concentrations of antimatter particles. it looks like a warp propulsion system of some kind."
it's a ship?
"starfleet has encountered species that use organic-based vessels. the breen, for example."
there doesn't seem to be anybody on board. chakotay to voyager.
"go ahead, commander."
"captain, we've found an entrance to the biomass. we think it may be a ship of some kind. permission to go inside."
granted.
"harry, that's a borg distribution node. see if you can download their tactical database. it might contain a record of what happened here."
"aye, sir."
tuvok.
they seem to be organic conduits. they're carrying electrodynamic fluid.
maybe an energy source.
"maybe. this looks like a binary matrix, but it's laced with neuropeptides. could be their version of a computer core."
this damage was caused by a borg disrupter beam. the wall appears to be regenerating itself. commander!
kes?
harry's in danger.
what are you
get them out of there.
sickbay to janeway.
commander!
there's someone in here with us and it's not the borg. i can't localise it but it's within twenty metres.
perhaps the pilot has returned.
voyager to away team.
go ahead.
stand by for transport. we're getting you out of there.
good idea.
energise.
i can't get a lock on them.
what's the problem?
it looks like bioelectric interference from whatever's coming toward them.
it's within seven metres. let's get out of here!
narrow the confinement beam.
no effect. i'm going to try a skeletal lock.
what?
"i think i can get a clean lock on the minerals in their bone tissue. i just came up with it, but i think it might work."
the lifeform's five metres away and closing.
from where?
i've got them.
"a skeletal lock, huh? we'll have to add that one to the transporter manual."
"captain, the bioship is powering up, like it's charging some kind of weapon."
"mister paris, get us out of here. maximum warp."
the alien ship is not pursuing.
kes?
"i could hear its thoughts. the pilot of the bioship was trying to communicate with me. they're a telepathic species. i've been aware of them for some time now. the premonitions. captain, it's not the borg that we should be worried about, it's them."
what did it say to you?
"it said, the weak will perish."
the infection is spreading. what began with a few stray cells contaminating the chest wound is now infusing every system in his body.
it looks like he's being transformed in some way.
"not exactly. the alien cells are consuming his body from the inside out. in essence, mister kim is being eaten alive."
"he's still conscious, doctor."
"i tried giving him a sedative, but it was rejected immediately. in fact, every treatment i've tried has been neutralised within seconds. these are alien cells. each one contains more than a hundred times the dna of a human cell. it's the most densely coded life form i've ever seen. even i would need years to decipher it."
"they have an extraordinary immune response. anything that penetrates the cell membrane, chemical, biological, technological, it's all instantly destroyed. that's why the borg can't assimilate them."
"resistance in this case is far from futile. nevertheless, i believe borg technology holds the key to saving mister kim."
how so?
"i hope to unleash an army of modified borg nanoprobes into his bloodstream, designed to target and eradicate the infection. as you know, i've been analysing the nanoprobes. they're efficient little assimilators, one can't help but admire the workmanship. but they're no match for the alien cells. so i successfully dissected a nanoprobe and managed to access its re-coding mechanism. i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells. that way, the probe can do its work without being detected. observe. the alien cells are completely oblivious to probe until it's too late. unfortunately, i've only created a few prototypes. i'll need several days to modify enough nanoprobes to cure ensign kim."
does harry have several days?
i wish i knew.
"fight it, harry. that's an order."
we've analysed the borg's tactical database. they refer to these new aliens as species 8472.
"over the past five months, the borg have been attacked by them on at least a dozen occasions. each time, the borg were defeated swiftly."
the collective has very little information about the species.
is anything known about where they come from?
i'm afraid so.
get the captain.
the northwest passage.
it's clear of borg activity for a very good reason.
i'm picking up one hundred and thirty three bioships. more are appearing.
from where?
they seem to be coming from a quantum singularity.
i'm localising the gravimetric distortions.
on screen.
"kes, anything?"
yes. i can hear them. they're in a place where they're alone. nothing else lives there.
some kind of parallel universe?
"i don't know. i feel malevolence, a cold hatred. the weak will perish. it's an invasion. they intend on destroying everything."
"tom, reverse course, maximum warp. take us five light years out and hold position."
"aye, captain."
maintain red alert. commander.
that moment we spoke about? it's here. any thoughts?
just one. flying into that corridor would mean certain death.
"agreed. the northwest passage is no longer an option. so now the choice is between facing the borg in their space, or finding ourselves a nice planet here in the delta quadrant and giving up on ever getting home."
"we'd be turning around, but we wouldn't be giving up. we may find another way home."
"i'm not ready to walk onto that bridge and tell the crew we're quitting. i can't do it, chakotay. not yet. there must be an alternative."
"kathryn, you haven't slept in two days. try getting some rest, and clearing your head. we're safe for the moment. we can tell the crew tomorrow, if we have to."
see you in the morning.
maestro? leonardo?
catarina. buona sera.
am i disturbing you?
what do you see?
a wall with candlelight reflecting on it. why? what do you see?
"a flock of starlings, the leaves of an oak, a horse's tail, a thief with a noose around his neck. and a wall with the candlelight reflecting on it. there are times, catarina, when i find myself transfixed by a shadow on the wall, or the splashing of water against a stone. i stare at it, the hours pass, the world around me drops away, replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination. a way to focus the mind. sit, and tell me why you have come."
"there's a path before me. the only way home. and on either side, mortal enemies bent on destroying each other. if i attempt to pass through them i'll be destroyed as well. but if i turn around, that would end all hope of ever getting home. and no matter how much i try to focus my mind, i can't see an alternative."
"when one's imagination cannot provide an answer, one must seek a greater imagination. there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer. i must deliver a bronzetto to the monks at santa croce. come with me, catarina, hey? we will awake the abbot, visit the chapel, and appeal to god."
somehow i don't think that's going to work for me. but there is an alternative i haven't considered. what if i made an appeal to the devil?
an alliance with the borg?
"more like an exchange. we offer them a way to defeat their new enemy and in return we get safe passage through their space. in developing a treatment for harry, the doctor has found a way to attack the aliens at a microscopic level."
"it's still in the experimental stages, captain. i've only made a few prototypes."
"nevertheless, if we teach the borg how to modify their own nanoprobes, they'd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the aliens."
"in theory, yes."
"b'elanna, it's clear from the borg database that they know practically nothing about species 8472."
"that's right. the borg gain knowledge through assimilation. what they can't assimilate, they can't understand."
"but we don't assimilate. we investigate. and in this case, that's given us an edge. we've discovered something they need."
but the borg aren't exactly known for their diplomacy. how can we expect them to cooperate with us?
"normally, the answer would be no. but if what i've learned from the aliens is true, the borg are losing this conflict."
"in one regard, the borg are no different than we are. they're trying to survive. i don't believe they're going to refuse an offer that will help them do that."
what makes you think the borg won't attempt to take the information by assimilating voyager and its crew.
"that won't get them anywhere. doctor, you're the only one on board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications. i want you to transfer all of that research into your holomatrix."
certainly.
"you're my guarantee. if the borg threaten us in any way, we'll simply erase your programme. but it won't come to that, doctor. it's in the collective's own interest to cooperate. voyager is only one ship. our safe passage is a small price to pay for what we're offering in exchange. b'elanna, assist the doctor with his transfer."
"aye, captain."
"mister paris, locate the nearest borg vessel and lay in a course. they shouldn't be difficult to find."
"yes, ma'am."
dismissed.
you were awfully quiet.
"i didn't want the others to hear this, but i think what you're proposing is too great a risk."
how so?
"there's a story i heard as a child, a parable, and i never forgot it. a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river, wondering how to get to the other side. suddenly he saw a fox. he asked the fox to take him on his back across the river. the fox said no. if i do that you'll sting me, and i'll drown. the scorpion assured him. if i did that, we'd both drown. so the fox thought about it and finally agreed. so the scorpion climbed up on his back, and the fox began to swim. but halfway across the river, the scorpion stung him. as the poison filled his veins, the fox turned to the scorpion and said why did you do that? now you'll drown too. i couldn't help it, said the scorpion. it's my nature."
"i understand the risk, and i'm not proposing that we try to change the nature of the beast, but this is a unique situation. to our knowledge, the borg have never been so threatened. they're vulnerable. i think we can take advantage of that."
"even if we do somehow negotiate an exchange, how long will they keep up their end of the bargain? it could take months to cross borg territory. we'd be facing thousands of systems, millions of vessels."
"but only one collective, and we've got them over a barrel. we don't need to give them a single bit of information, not until we're safe. we just need the courage to see this through to the end."
there are other kinds of courage. like the courage to accept that there are some situations beyond your control. not every problem has an immediate solution.
you're suggesting we turn around.
"yes. we should get out of harm's way. let them fight it out. in the meantime, there's still plenty of delta quadrant left to explore. we may find another way home."
"or we may find something else. six months, a year down the road, after species 8472 gets through with the borg, we could find ourselves back in the line of fire, and we'll have missed the window of opportunity that exists right here, right now."
how much is our safety worth?
what do you mean?
we'd be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering billions. we'd be helping the borg assimilate yet another species just to get ourselves back home. it's wrong!
tell that to harry kim. he's barely alive thanks to that species. maybe helping to assimilate them isn't such a bad idea. we could be doing the delta quadrant a favour.
"i don't think you really believe that. i think you're struggling to justify your plan, because your desire to get this crew home is blinding you to other options. i know you, kathryn. sometimes you don't know when to step back."
"do you trust me, chakotay?"
that isn't the issue.
"oh, but it is. only yesterday you were saying that we'd face this together, that you'd be at my side."
i still have to tell you what i believe. i'm no good to you if i don't do that.
"i appreciate your insights, but the time for debate is over. i've made my decision. now, do i have your support?"
you're the captain. i'm the first officer. i'll follow your orders. that doesn't change my belief that we're making a fatal mistake.
"then i guess i'm alone, after all. dismissed."
"there are three planets in this system. inhabitants, all borg. a vessel is approaching."
all stop. shields up.
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
they've locked onto us with a tractor beam.
"borg vessel, this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. i have tactical information about species 8472. i want to negotiate."
negotiation is irrelevant. you will be assimilated.
"borg vessel. what you're receiving is a sample of the knowledge we possess. if you don't disengage your tractor beam immediately, i will have that data destroyed. you have ten seconds to comply. we know you're in danger of being defeated. you can't afford to risk losing this information. disengage your tractor"
state your demands.
"i want safe passage through your space. once my ship is beyond borg territory, i'll give you our research."
unacceptable. our space is vast. your passage would require too much time. we need the technology now.
"if i give it to you now, you'll assimilate us."
species 8472 must be stopped. our survival is your survival. give us the technology.
no. safe passage first or no deal.
state your proposal.
"let's work together, combine our resources. even if we do give you the technology now, you're still going to need time to develop it. by working together, we can create a weapon more quickly. if you escort us through your space we can perfect the weapon as we"
where did that ship come from?
a quantum singularity has appeared twenty thousand kilometres away. the bioship is heading directly toward the planet.
the borg shields are weakening. we might be able to break free of the tractor beam.
can you get a lock on the captain?
not yet.
"commander, there are nine more bioships coming out of the singularity."
what's going on?
report.
the borg shields are offline. i've got a lock on captain janeway.
get her out of there and break us free of the cube. stand by all weapons.
i'm trying to energise. the borg are scattering the beam.
compensate.
no effect.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
commander. cut the transporter beam.
captain?
"do it. i've reached an agreement with the collective. we're going to help them design a weapon against species 8472. in exchange, they've granted us safe passage through their space."
the cube is altering course. they're heading toward the alpha quadrant.
"that's part of the plan. we'll work on the weapon en route. once we're across their territory, we'll give them the nanoprobes. they appear to be holding up their end of the bargain. i suggest we do the same."
how do you propose we begin this collaboration?
"i'm going to work here, on the cube. they have technology that'll make the job go faster. i want to take advantage of it."
it's not necessary for you to stay there. we can set up a comlink with the borg and
it's part of the deal. i work here.
"all right. as long as we're cooperating, maybe the borg would be willing to disengage their tractor beam. we can match their course without a leash."
"i'll propose it. mister tuvok, transport to my coordinates."
understood.
"we're going to make this work, commander. janeway out."
you heard the captain.
"i replicated nearly ten million borg nanoprobes, each of them reprogrammed to my specifications, each capable of targeting the alien tissue."
assimilating it.
"just momentarily. the borg technology will denaturate within seconds, taking the alien tissue along with it. mister kim, i'm about to inject your carotid artery. you'll feel a tingling sensation. don't be alarmed."
"nice to see you again, ensign."
it's working.
prepare another dose of nanoprobes.
"yes, doctor."
good work. let me know when he's back on his feet.
"commander. i must tell you. i have my doubts about this alliance. you may have convinced the borg the nanoprobes can defeat their enemy, but a medical treatment is a long way from a weapon of war."
leave that to the captain. this situation is unpredictable so we're going to stay at full red alert. keep all information about the nanoprobes stored in your holo-matrix.
"don't worry. i'll delete myself at the first sign of trouble. well, maybe not the first sign."
we've just received word. tuvok beamed to the cube. he's joined the captain.
keep a transporter lock on both of them.
"i'll try, but the borg are already regenerating their shields."
try matching their shield frequencies.
it won't work. they'll be able to adapt too quickly.
"i don't want to hear what we can't do, lieutenant! just find a way to get our people out of there if we have to."
"aye, sir."
they've released their tractor beam.
match their course and speed.
"i never thought i'd hear myself say this, but, looks like the borg are cooperating."
kes? kes! kes! what's wrong?
they're watching us.
may i ask where we're being taken?
grid nine two of subjunction twelve. our very own workspace. it's near the centre of the cube.
these are my tricorder readings of the bioship we examined. i believe you will find them most revealing.
have you compared this to the doctor's analysis of the alien tissue?
yes. many of the cellular structures are identical.
the aliens and their ships are made of the same organic material.
apparently so.
you have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve. proceed.
"all right. we've analysed one of the alien vessels, and it appears to be constructed of organic material vulnerable to the modified nanoprobes. i suggest we begin thinking about a large scale delivery system. a way to infect their ships and destroy them at the microscopic"
we will begin.
what are you doing?
a neural transceiver is required for maximum communication. we will work as one mind.
no. that wasn't the agreement.
the neural link is temporary. you will not be damaged.
"i don't care. i prefer to communicate verbally, thank you."
your primitive communication is inefficient.
"on the contrary. we work better with our individuality intact. surely, we've proven that to you by now."
irrelevant. you must comply.
we must do nothing. tell your drone to remove the transceiver. what about choosing a representative? a single borg we can work with and talk to directly.
elaborate.
you've done it before. when you transformed jean-luc picard into locutus. we will not be assimilated. choose a representative or the deal's off.
i speak for the borg.
i'm captain janeway. this is lieutenant tuvok.
we are aware of your designations.
what's your designation?
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. but you may call me seven of nine. you are proposing a large-scale weapon. we concur."
i thought you might.
"we could encase the nanoprobes in some of our photon torpedoes. in essence, turn them into biomolecular warheads."
your torpedoes are inadequate. they lack the necessary range and dispursive force.
do you have a better idea?
we are borg.
i take that as a yes.
a multikinetic neutronic mine. five million isoton yield.
an explosion that size could affect an entire star system.
correct. the shock wave will disperse the nanoprobes over a radius of five light years.
that's somewhat larger than i had in mind. you're proposing a weapon of mass destruction.
we are.
"well, i'm not. you'd be endangering innocent worlds."
it would be efficient.
we'd need approximately fifty trillion nanoprobes to arm this mine. it would take the doctor several weeks to replicate that amount. you are losing this conflict. are you willing to risk further delay?
"right now your enemy believes it is invulnerable. if we create smaller weapons using our torpedoes and destroy a few of their bioships, it may deter them, convince them to give up this war."
"you are individuals. you are small, and you think in small terms. but the present situation requires that we consider your plan. voyager's weapons inventory. photon torpedo complement thirty two. class six warhead. explosive yield two hundred isotons."
how did you obtain this information?
we are borg.
naturally.
"commander, we have some disturbing news."
"at this point, i'm getting used to it."
"her telepathic visions are increasing, both in frequency and intensity."
"it feels different this time. it's almost like they're right here, in the room."
there is it again.
"i'm trying to block them out, but i can't."
"every time she has a vision specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyperstimulation. memory engrams, perceptual centres. i can't be sure but i think there's more going on here than just a simple hello."
enhance this grid. i want to take a closer look at the detonator.
we must analyse the bioship. your data.
"you're human, aren't you?"
this body was assimilated eighteen years ago. it ceased to be human at that time.
i'm curious. what was your name before you were
do not engage us in further irrelevant discourse. we are being hailed by your vessel.
"commander, what is it?"
it's kes. the doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory.
"if that's true, they may already know what we're planning."
i've ordered long range scans for bioships. nothing so far.
"we should alter course, try to throw them off."
agreed. our course and heading have been changed.
"match them, and keep me apprised of any changes in kes."
chakotay out.
we now require one of your photon torpedoes and the nanoprobes.
one step at a time. we're not safely across your territory yet.
we must construct and test a prototype now. the risk of attack has increased.
irrelevant. we have an agreement. you're asking me to give up my only guarantee that you won't assimilate us. i won't risk it.
"are you willing to risk a direct confrontation with us? if we transport five hundred drones onto your vessel, do you believe you could offer sufficient resistance?"
we'd die trying.
that won't be necessary. we must construct a launching system to accommodate this design.
"glad you could join us, mister kim."
harry. welcome back.
"thanks. reporting for duty, sir. the doctor gave me a clean bill of health. did i miss anything?"
"not too much. take your station, ensign."
you've still got a tendril up your nose.
commander. i'm picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft. it's a singularity.
we are under attack.
they're charging weapons.
shields. keep a lock on the away team.
direct hit to our secondary hull!
transporters are offline! shields and weapons are down.
voyager has taken heavy damage.
we cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed.
we're being targeted!
brace for impact!
the cube?
"destroyed, and it took the bioship with it."
tuvok to chakotay.
"go ahead, tuvok. where are you?"
i'm in cargo bay two
along with the captain and a number of borg.
we were beamed over just before impact. we require assistance.
"tuvok. tuvok? secure that deck. security team to cargo bay two. paris, you have the bridge."
lower your weapons.
"we are here with your captain's consent. it was necessary to sacrifice our vessel to protect yours. we have an alliance, do we not?"
for now they're contained. they've assimilated cargo bay two and they're drawing energy from the secondary power couplings.
but they've gone no further.
not yet. i've sealed off decks nine through thirteen and posted security details at every access point.
i suggest we increase security around sickbay as well.
already done. how far did you get on the weapon?
we're ready to construct a prototype.
"you're fit to return back to duty, lieutenant."
"and you, kes?"
"oh, i'm all right. the visions have stopped for now."
"the plasma burns to her thoracic region i can treat, and i've already stopped the internal bleeding. but her neural injuries are going to require some creative thinking."
"before we beamed out, an alien energy discharge struck very near the captain."
"well, it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways. i'll have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain functions. but i must tell you, unless i can repair the damage, she may never regain consciousness."
make sure those borg stay put. i want tactical updates every twenty minutes.
"aye, sir. shall i resume working with them?"
stand by for now.
the captain wishes to speak with you. please keep it brief.
the doctor explained my condition. you're in command.
i understand.
they'll push you. they'll threaten you. but they need you. they need this alliance. you have to make this work. i want you to make this work. get this crew home.
i must begin.
where is your captain? i must speak with her.
"in our medical bay, recovering. you'll be dealing with me now."
circumstances have changed.
i'd say so.
the loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement.
"i've been giving that some thought. i'm willing to let you stay on board. we'll continue to work with you on the weapon. once we're safely out of borg territory we'll give you the nanoprobes, shake hands and part company."
insufficient. our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then. the nearest borg vessel is forty light years away. you will reverse course and take us to it.
"even at maximum warp, that's a five day journey in the wrong direction. we're supposed to be heading out of borg space, not deeper into it."
there is no alternative.
"look, i'll honour the original agreement, but i'm not turning this ship around. it's too dangerous."
denying our request is also dangerous.
i'll think about it.
think quickly.
"a five day trip back into the heart of borg territory. it's too risky. with those drones and the nanoprobes on board, we might as well have a bull's-eye painted on our hull. we're a prime target for species 8472. we'd never survive another attack."
what is the alternative?
"i'm going to end this alliance here and now. we're going to drop the borg off on the next uninhabited planet, give them the nanoprobes and take our chances alone. they can wait for a borg ship to pick them up and finish the weapon. i'm in command now and i have to do what i think is best for this crew. tom, i want you to scan for the nearest uninhabited planet and set a course."
"aye, sir."
"i must caution you, commander. the borg may not go quietly."
we'll see. bring that female drone to the ready room. dismissed.
"once we've beamed you to the surface, we'll send down the nanoprobes and all our research."
unacceptable. we don't have time for
this isn't open for discussion. i'm not turning this ship around. you're getting what you wanted. i suggest we part ways amicably.
there is another option. we could assimilate your vessel.
"if a single drone steps one millimetre out of that cargo bay, i'll decompress the entire deck. you won't pose much of a threat floating in space."
"when your captain first approached us, we suspected that an agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain. you are erratic, conflicted, disorganised. every decision is debated, every action questioned. every individual entitled to their own small opinion. you lack harmony, cohesion, greatness. it will be your undoing."
escort our guest back to the cargo bay.
"well, i've made my decision. if it were only a matter of going against the orders of my superior officer. you're more than just my captain. you're my friend. i hope you'll understand."
"species 8472 has penetrated matrix zero one zero, grid nineteen. eight planets destroyed. three hundred twelve vessels disabled. four million, six hundred twenty one borg eliminated. we must seize control of the alpha quadrant vessel, and take it into the alien realm."
we understand.
class h moon. oxygen-argon atmosphere.
it'll do. take us out of warp and enter orbit.
"aye, sir."
"tuvok. stand by to transport the borg directly from the cargo bay. after they're on the surface, have security run a sweep of"
i'm reading power fluctuations in the deflector array.
cause?
it looks like the borg have accessed deflector control. they're trying to realign the emitters.
shut them out.
they've bypassed security protocols.
we're emitting a resonant graviton beam. it's creating another singularity.
reverse course.
we're fighting intense gravimetric distortion. i can't break free.
"bridge to cargo bay two. stop what you're doing, or i'll depressurise that deck and blow you out into space. this is your final warning. do it!"
decompression cycle complete.
i still don't have deflector control.
"commander, a single borg has survived."
we're being pulled in!
report.
we appear to have crossed an interdimensional rift.
"we've definitely left our galaxy. no stars, no planets."
let's see.
i'm re-calibrating sensors. the entire region is filled with some kind of organic fluid. this isn't space. it's matter.
commander chakotay. we have entered the domain of species 8472. report to the cargo bay.
"paris, repressurise cargo bay two. tuvok."
"our entry into fluidic space has created a compression wave. they know we're here. a fleet of bioships is already converging on our position. time to intercept, three hours, seventeen minutes."
you've been here before. how else could you know about fluidic space?
we must prepare this ship for the altercation. we will construct a complement of biomolecular warheads.
"why? why were you here? you started this war, didn't you? what's the matter, our galaxy wasn't big enough for you? you had to conquer new territory? but this race fought back. a species as malevolent as your own."
species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated. their technology is biogenically engineered. it is superior to that of all species we have previously encountered.
which is precisely what you wanted.
they are the apex of biological evolution. their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection.
so instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy.
there is only one course of action. destroy them first. my subspace link to the collective has been weakened by the interdimensional rift. we cannot signal for help. we are alone. we must construct a compliment of biomolecular warheads and modify your weapons to launch them.
i've got a better idea. why don't you open that rift again and take us back?
"if i did that, you will no longer cooperate."
doctor to chakotay.
go ahead.
report to sickbay at once.
on my way.
captain?
"ah. as you can see, i've repaired her neural damage. ensign kim, the captain, i'm two for two."
doctor. if you'll excuse us a moment.
hmm? eh? oh. gladly. computer deactivate emh programme.
"the doctor brought me up to speed, but he couldn't tell me what i really wanted to know. why?"
"the collective ordered me to reverse course, travel forty light years back the way we came. what would you have done?"
i probably would've reversed course. maintained the alliance as long as possible.
"in my mind, the alliance was already over."
you never trusted me. you never believed this would work. you were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders.
trust had nothing to with it. i made a tactical decision.
and so did i.
they have taking advantage of us from day one.
"we made concessions, so did they."
they lied. the borg started the war with species 8472. we've only got one borg left to worry about. we should try to disable her and get back to the delta quadrant. we might be able to duplicate the deflector protocols they used to open a singularity.
"no. i won't be caught tinkering with the deflector when those aliens attack. there's no other way out of this, chakotay. it's too late for opinions, it's too late for discussion. it's time to make the call, and i'm making it. we fight the aliens in full cooperation with the borg."
"i was linked to a collective once, remember? i had a neurotransceiver embedded in my spine. i know who we're dealing with. we've got to get rid of that last borg and take our chances alone."
"it won't work. this isn't working either. there are two wars going on. the one out there, and the one in here, and we're losing both of them."
it will be your undoing.
what?
"our conflicted nature. our individuality. seven of nine said that we lack the cohesion of a collective mind. that one day it would divide us and destroy us. and here we are, proving her point."
"i'll tell you when we lost control of this situation, when we made our mistake. it was the moment we turned away from each other. we don't have to stop being individuals to get through this, we just have to stop fighting each other."
captain janeway.
i've relieved mister chakotay of his duties and confined him to the brig. i'm back in command.
and you understand the situation.
"completely. tuvok, give her the nanoprobes. work with her. build as many warheads as you can and start modifying our weapons systems. i suggest we think about enhancing our defences, as well. if we're going to fight this battle, i intend to win it."
we are in agreement.
"good. this is the plan. we engage the enemy here, in their space. we show them what they're up against. if they have any sense of self-preservation, they'll back off, pull their ships out of the delta quadrant. that's provided the weapons are effective. if they aren't, it's been nice working with you. we've got to get this ship armed and ready in under two hours. we're going to war."
borg modifications are complete.
bring them online.
torpedo launch tubes active. hull armour engaged. shield enhancements stable.
"biomolecular weapons are ready. thirteen standard photon torpedoes. and one class ten, armed with a high yield warhead."
"all hands, this is the captain. ready your stations. seal all emergency bulkheads and prepare to engage the enemy. stand by for my orders."
four bioships have just entered sensor range.
battle stations.
i've got a visual.
on screen.
i can hear them. they want to talk through me. they say we've contaminated their realm.
tell them we had no choice. we were only trying to defend ourselves.
they say our galaxy is impure. its proximity is a threat to their genetic integrity.
"tell them we have a weapon. a devastating weapon that can destroy them at the cellular level. if they don't stop their attacks on the delta quadrant, we'll be forced to use it."
they said your galaxy will be purged.
shields and weapons are offline!
rerouting emergency power to the launchers.
they're coming around for another assault. i've lost thrusters.
biomolecular warheads are charged and ready.
fire.
direct hit on all four vessels. no effect.
they're charging weapons!
"the nanoprobes were successful, if not prompt. all four ships have been destroyed."
i think we've made our point. now open a singularity and get us out of here.
captain.
"kes, are you still in contact?"
yes.
"tell them if they continue their attack, we'll use the weapon again."
they're not responding.
evasive manoeuvres.
"aye, captain. they're in pursuit."
prepare to fire the high yield warhead. aft torpedo bay.
"ready, captain."
do it.
thirteen bioships have been destroyed. the others are in retreat.
i have regained full contact with the collective.
what are they saying?
all remaining bioships in the delta quadrant are returning to their realm. the borg have prevailed.
with a little help from us. now it's time you fulfilled your end of the agreement. tell the collective we expect safe passage from here on out. we'll give you a shuttlecraft. you can head for the nearest borg ship.
unacceptable. this alliance is terminated. your ship and its crew will adapt to service us.
resistance is futile.
"captain, she's tapping into helm control. she's trying to access our coordinates."
shut her out.
i can't.
bridge to chakotay. scorpion.
"seven of nine, stop what you're doing. you're human. a human individual. our minds are linked. we are one. i can hear your thoughts"
"his link is stable, but it won't be for long. you must hurry."
just a few more seconds.
i can see your memories.
you remember being human.
we are borg.
i see a young girl. a family.
irrelevant. your appeal to my humanity is pointless.
"almost there, chakotay. you've got to keep her distracted if we're going to make this work."
"listen to your human side. to yourself, the little girl. seven of nine. annika!"
he's losing the link!
initiating power surge now!
her connection to the collective is severed.
get her to sickbay. bridge to doctor. report.
"commander chakotay's going to be all right, although he may wake up with a bit of a headache."
"tom, plot a course out of borg space. maximum warp."
"yes, ma'am."
am i interrupting?
not at all. just finishing up my log.
the old-fashioned way.
i wanted to get as far away from bioimplants and fluidic space. and this feels more human somehow.
"i hate to spoil the mood, but you might want to look at this engineering report. it'll take at least two weeks to remove the borg technology from our systems. b'elanna did note that the power couplings on deck eight work better with the borg improvements."
leave them. how is our passenger?
the doctor says she's stabilising. her human cells are starting to regenerate.
i wonder what's left under all that borg technology. if she can ever become human again.
you plan to keep her on board.
we pulled the plug. we're responsible for what happens to her now.
she was assimilated at a very young age. the collective's all she knows. she might not want to stay.
i think she might. we have something the borg could never offer. friendship.
i want you to know that disobeying your orders was one of the most difficult things i've ever had to do.
"i understand. and i respect the decision you made, even though i disagree with it. what's important is that in the end we got through this, together. i don't ever want that to change."
agreed.
"good. well, i think it's time we get back to our bridge."
no argument there.
"so, how's the newest addition to our family?"
"at the moment she's stable, but the prognosis isn't clear. her human physiology has begun to reassert itself. respiratory system, neurological functions, immune response. but those systems are swarming with borg implants. there's a battle being waged inside her body, between the biological and the technological, and i'm not sure which is going to win."
"well, it's time we brought her up to date. wake her."
"captain janeway, what have you? the others. i can't hear the others. the voices are gone."
we had to neutralise the neurotransceiver in your upper spinal column. your link to the collective has been severed.
you will return this drone to the borg.
i'm afraid i can't do that
you will return this drone to the borg!
"if i were to turn this ship around and head back into borg territory i'd be putting my crew at risk. i'm not prepared to do that. try to understand. you have to stay on board voyager. but i'm offering you freedom from the collective, and i assure you we will do everything we can to help the transition"
you will supply us with a subspace transmitter and leave us on the nearest planet. the borg will come for us.
it's too late for that. your human cells are starting to regenerate. you won't survive without medical care.
we need nothing from you. we are borg. we are - ah!
this implant is being rejected by the tissue underneath. it's going to have to be removed.
you will suppress the human immune system.
"i'm sorry, but the process has gone too far. we've got to get you to sickbay."
no! we are borg! we are borg!
"this armour plating is anchored to the skull with over three million microconnectors. there's no time to cut through them. i'm going to have to remove the outer layer of the skull itself. lieutenant, will you please leave the surgical bay."
this borg is a security risk.
she is heavily sedated. i assure you she's not going anywhere.
"thank you. kes, i want you to anaesthetise her cranial nerves. twenty milligrams anetrazine."
"yes, doctor."
kes?
i don't know what happened. i looked at the hypospray and it just came to me.
have you been experimenting with your psychokinetic abilities?
"no, not for months, but i have been feeling a little strange lately. lots of energy, sleeping less."
i can see why. your serotonin levels are sixty two percent above normal. it's the telepathic centres of your brain. they're in a state of hyperstimulation like they were a few days ago when you were in contact with species 8472.
are they attempting to communicate with you again?
no. this time it's different. i don't feel their presence at all.
perhaps she's experiencing an after-effect of some kind.
"a reasonable diagnosis, for a security officer. i'll run a full microsynaptic analysis, but it will have to wait. we should get back to our borg."
come in.
"ship's status report. we've got two teams on the hull, stripping off the borg armour. they're working around the clock but it's still slow going."
what about the warp drive?
torres is having problems cleaning out the plasma relays. it's disrupting the antimatter reaction. until she's got it fixed we're stuck at impulse. she's requesting all personnel with a level three engineering rating or higher to lend a hand.
granted. tactical update?
"long range sensors are picking up residual transwarp signatures, borg vessels. they passed by probably three days ago."
so we're not out of the woods yet.
having half our propulsion system overrun by borg implants doesn't make repairs any easier.
seven of nine could help with that.
"that might be true if she were willing, but she's not in the most cooperative mood."
that could change. i just have to reach her somehow.
annika hansen.
our borg?
"it took some digging through the federation database, but i managed to find a single entry in the records of deep space four. her parents were unconventional. they fancied themselves explorers, but wanted nothing to do with starfleet or the federation. their names were last recorded at a remote outpost in the omega sector. they refused to file a flight plan. apparently, they aimed their small ship toward the delta quadrant and were never heard from again."
"for all we know, annika and her parents were the first humans the borg ever assimilated."
"from what she's told me, that was almost twenty years ago."
"so she was raised by the borg. it's the only life she ever really knew. if you were thinking of bringing her into the fold, that might not be possible."
what's the alternative? toss her back to the wolves?
sickbay to captain janeway.
"what is it, doctor?"
"could you come down here, captain. we're having some problems."
i'll be right there.
it's like peeling an onion.
"store it in a bio-stasis chamber. it may still be active. if you think there's a risk, mister tuvok, you can throw one of your little forcefields around the chamber."
"a prudent security measure, for a doctor."
report.
"i'm afraid we have a decision to make. a difficult one. her human immune system has reasserted itself with a vengeance. body armour, borg organelles, biosynthetic glands, they're all being rejected. her life is in danger. i have little recourse but to remove the borg technology."
which is the last thing seven of nine would want.
"hence the difficult decision. if a patient told me not to treat them, even if the situation were life-threatening, i would be ethically obligated to honour that request."
"this is no ordinary patient. she may have been raised by borg, raised to think like a borg, but she's with us now. and underneath all that technology she is a human being, whether she's ready to accept that or not. and until she is ready, someone has to make the decisions for her. proceed with the surgery."
"aye, captain."
kes? let's begin with the microtubular network embedded in the oesophageal tract.
what's happening?
"i'm not sure. she's going into neural shock. i can't localise the source. kes, try to stabilise her motor cortex. use a neurosequencer. kes, i said to stabilise her cortex or we're going to lose her."
wait. i can see it.
what?
"i think the problem is in her colliculli. yes, i can see it. a borg implant. it's pressing against her trochlear nerve."
can you tell me how we might remove it without severing the nerve?
i think i can do more than tell you.
"the implant is deteriorating. her nervous system is stabilising. nice work, kes. unconventional but effective."
"they say the eye is the window to the soul. in this case it's a little bit more. i've fabricated this artificial organ to replace her eyepiece, but i've had to retain some of the borg circuitry along the optic nerve. as a result, she'll have increased acuity in one eye. note how perfectly i've matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye."
"excellent work, doctor. i admire your attention to detail. when can i speak with her?"
"she's out of immediate danger, and i don't plan to resume the extraction process until tomorrow. i can wake her now, if you'd like."
"i would. how are you, kes?"
"i feel exhilarated, captain. i've never been so focused in my life, and my telepathic abilities are stronger than they've ever been."
"your performance today was astonishing. however, your psychokinetic powers are still undisciplined, and as a result, unpredictable."
i feel like i'm in control.
"nevertheless, you must proceed with caution. and with my assistance."
what are you suggesting?
a series of guided meditations to help her explore the depth of these new abilities.
kes?
i'm ready.
"well then, if you'll excuse us, we should begin immediately."
"ready when you are, captain."
don't be alarmed. you're in sickbay. you're going to be fine.
what have you done to me!
"your body was rejecting the borg technology. you were dying. i'm sorry, but we had no choice. those are dermoplastic grafts. they'll help the regeneration process."
unacceptable.
you should have let us die.
i couldn't do that.
this drone cannot survive outside the collective.
"i beg to differ. now that the borg implants are being excised, your human systems are free to thrive. and thriving they are. as a matter of fact, i"
"i want to help you, but i need to understand what you're going through."
do not engage us in superficial attempts at sympathy.
it's obvious that you're in pain. that you're frightened. that you feel isolated. alone.
you are an individual. you are small. you cannot understand what it is to be borg.
"no, but i can imagine. you were part of a vast consciousness, billions of minds working together. a harmony of purpose and thought. no indecision, no doubts. the security and strength of a unified will. and you've lost that."
"this drone is small now. alone. one voice, one mind. the silence is unacceptable. we need the others!"
"i can't give you back to the borg, but you're not alone. you're part of a human community now. a human collective. we may be individuals but we live and work together. you can have some of the unity you require right here on voyager."
insufficient.
"it'll have to do. and the fact is, this community needs you. the borg modifications you made to our vessel are disrupting our warp drive. we need your help to remove them, your expertise, your cooperation. you must comply."
"all right, i think i've got all the borg garbage out of the plasma intake manifold. let's try reinitialising the antimatter reaction."
matter antimatter reaction at twenty two cochranes and rising.
damn! what happened?
intake manifolds eleven and thirteen are still blocked.
this is like pulling weeds. you think you've got them all out and then
you have neglected to remove the autonomous regeneration sequencers.
"lieutenant torres, ensign kim, you remember seven of nine."
how could we forget?
"we can't afford to delay repairs any longer, so i've asked her to help us remove the borg modifications. she only has a few hours before she returns to sickbay. i suggest you put here to good use."
you can start with the plasma relays. they're in jefferies tube thirteen.
jefferies tube thirteen alpha section twelve. we fully recall the engineering specifications of your vessel.
good. can you also recall the way it looked before you turned it into a borg circus?
yes.
"well, now that the pleasantries are over, why don't you get to work? i want updates every hour."
"yes, captain."
"the flame of the lamp is fire disciplined, tamed and under control. it is the appropriate focus for the task ahead of us."
how do we begin?
"i will attempt to guide you in manipulating the flame at the subatomic level. concentrate on the flame. try to see past the surface, past the light, to the patterns of energy and matter."
i can see the essence of the fire.
good. now reach out with your mind and intensify the flame.
"i'm making it hotter, brighter."
"now, with your thoughts, reduce the flame. excellent. you never demonstrated this level of control before."
it's as though i knew what had to be done.
what's wrong?
"something's happening. i can see further, beyond the subatomic."
"kes, there is nothing beyond the subatomic."
"but i can see it, tuvok. it's a new level of reality. it's beautiful."
perhaps we should stop for now.
wait a few seconds. i want to try to control it.
"don't worry, tuvok."
what about these linkages. every time i pull one out another one comes back in it's place.
autonomous regeneration sequencers. they function to counteract resistance.
amazing. how did you come up with the pattern duplication design?
we came up with nothing. the borg assimilated this technology in galactic cluster three from species two five nine.
i'm not interested in a history lesson. how do we disable it?
you must disconnect each sequencer conduit at the insertion juncture.
why don't you two work on the jefferies tube. start with the plasma relays.
"i'll start here. you said the borg got this stuff from species two five nine. who are they? guess the borg meet a lot of people, don't they? stupid question. so, what's it like out there in galactic cluster three?"
beyond your comprehension.
try me.
galactic cluster three is a transmaterial energy plane intersecting twenty two billion omnicordial lifeforms.
ah. interesting.
ensign kim. your assistance.
"captain, somebody's trying to access the subspace transmitter."
"captain, i don't know how, but she's erected some kind of forcefield around the door. we can't break through it."
she's bypassed our security protocols.
disable the transmitter.
it's too late.
it's obvious your mental abilities have progressed beyond this particular vulcan exercise. i suggest we. what is it?
something's wrong. the borg is trying to contact her people.
tuvok to security team one. intruder alert in engineering.
wait. i think i can stop her.
it's over.
tuvok to bridge. status.
there was some kind of explosion in the jefferies tube just as she was about to initiate her transmission.
we don't know what caused it.
"i believe i may have the answer, captain."
i can tell by the expression on your face that you've got some bad news.
"i have no expression on my face. however, you are correct. the news on two separate fronts is not good. i checked the subspace bandwidths. at least a partial signal was transmitted from voyager."
enough for a borg ship to track?
possibly.
and the second front?
i believe there is also cause for concern regarding kes.
explain.
"internal sensor logs show that she destabilised the jefferies tube at the molecular level. the effect weakened the infrastructure throughout the deck. she wishes to develop her abilities further. i am not certain it would be safe, for kes or voyager."
i've got an ocampan who wants to be something more and a borg who's afraid of becoming something less. here's to vulcan stability. wait for me.
so this is human freedom.
i've decided to keep you in the brig until i'm certain you won't try to harm us again. if necessary the doctor can treat you here. i honestly believed you were going to help us.
"you were not deceived, captain janeway. it was my intention to help you."
what happened?
there was a chance to contact the collective. i took advantage of it. your attempt to assimilated this drone will fail. you can alter our physiology but you cannot change our nature. we will betray you. we are borg.
"i've met borg who were freed from the collective. it wasn't easy for them to accept their individuality, but in time they did. you're no different. granted, you were assimilated at a very young age, and your transition may be more difficult, but it will happen."
"if it does happen, we will become fully human?"
"yes, i hope so."
we will be autonomous. independent.
that's what individuality is all about.
"if at that time we choose to return to the collective, will you permit it?"
i don't think you'll want to do that.
"you would deny us the choice as you deny us now. you have imprisoned us in the name of humanity, yet you will not grant us your most cherished human right. to choose our own fate. you are hypocritical, manipulative. we do not want to be what you are. return us to the collective!"
"you lost the capacity to make a rational choice the moment you were assimilated. they took that from you, and until i'm convinced you've gotten it back, i'm making the choice for you. you're staying here."
then you are no different than the borg.
"talaxian champagne, moon-ripened. your favourite."
"neelix, where did you get this?"
i put a bottle away for a special occasion. remember when we last sipped this together?
three years ago. it was when we first arrived on voyager.
and do you remember the toast i made?
yes. to the adventure.
"to the adventure. when you left ocampa, you said that your people were being held beck. that if you were only given the chance you could become something so much more. and you have."
i know things have worked out exactly the way we planned.
i was only holding you back. that's obvious to me now.
"no. i couldn't have come this far without you. and i love you. i always will. it's just, er"
my cooking. you've always hated my cooking.
that's exactly what it was.
"ah. so, tell me more about what's happening to you. what does it all mean?"
"i don't know, and that's what makes it all so exciting. it's as if i can see into a place where the distinction between matter and energy and thought no longer exists. and that's only the beginning. i feel as if all the boundaries within me are about to fall away."
"it sounds ah, sper, ah, interesting."
"i only have to look at an object, to gaze at it, and i can begin to see that the space between the atoms is being filled with something else."
"er, kes."
"i can see them, i can see."
"kes, stop!"
no.
neelix!
"captain, i'm picking up some strange energy readings from deck two, the mess hall."
"bridge to neelix. what's going on down there? neelix, report."
the bulkhead in that section is coming apart.
increase the structural integrity field on deck two.
tuvok.
"i've run every conceivable neural analysis. everything short of dissecting the brain itself. her telesynaptic activity is increasing but i don't know why, or how to stop it. have the ship's internal sensors revealed anything?"
for seventeen point four seconds kes's body went into a state of cellular flux. she began to destabilise at the subatomic level.
then for some reason her atoms re-established their bonds and she was back in one piece.
"but what about the next time? her condition is escalating. we must find a way to suppress it, or the last we see of kes could very well be her molecules blowing through the ventilation ducts."
"tuvok, enhance the structural integrity fields throughout the ship. if she has another incident i'd like to avoid a hull breach. doctor, maybe it's time we broaden our horizons. this appears to have gone beyond medical science. we're into particle physics now."
i'll try looking through the quantum substructure database. maybe it'll give me some inspiration.
keep me informed.
"kes, until i can devise another diagnostic procedure, you're free to return to your quarters."
"actually, i'd like to stay here, help with the research."
i don't want you to overexert yourself and risk precipitating another telepathic incident. try to get some rest.
just let me stay for a little while. i haven't seen you much over the past few days. i miss you.
all right. just for a while.
ensign ayala to the bridge.
"go ahead, ensign."
"you'd better come down to the brig, ma'am."
one. one.
my designation is seven of nine. but the others are gone. designations are no longer relevant. i am one.
"yes, you are."
but i cannot function this way. alone.
you're not alone. i'm willing to help you.
"if that's true, you won't do this to me. take me back to my own kind."
you are with your own kind. humans.
i don't remember being human. i don't know what it is to be human.
what are you doing?
i'm coming in.
i'll kill you.
i don't think you will.
do you remember her? her name was annika hansen. she was born on stardate 25479 at the tendara colony. there's still a lot we don't know about her. did she have any siblings? who were her friends? where did she go to school? what was her favourite colour?
irrelevant! take me back to the borg.
i can't do that.
so quiet. one voice.
"one voice can be stronger than a thousand voices. your mind is independent now, with it's own unique identity."
you are forcing that identity upon me. it's not mine.
"oh yes, it is. i'm just giving you back what was stolen from you. the existence you were denied, the child who never had a chance. that life is yours to live now."
don't want that life.
it's what you are. don't resist it.
no!
"come in, captain."
"you wanted to see me. ah, tuvok's meditation lamp. i was with him when he got it six years ago, from a vulcan master. who doubled the price when he saw our starfleet insignias."
"i'm sure it was the logical thing to do. i've been thinking about everything that's been going on, and i know what i have to do. it's time for me to leave voyager."
"oh, kes."
"something important is happening to me, and i want to explore it. but i can't stay here any longer. i'm a danger to all of you."
we're going to get to the bottom of this. the doctor's already working on a new approach.
"everybody thinks that what's happening is a medical condition. that's not it at all. i'm going though a transformation. i don't know how or why, but every cell in my body is telling me that i'm changing into something more."
"what if it's not true? what if you're simply being swept up in the excitement of something you think is happening, but it's not real? on the basis of a feeling, an intuition, you're asking me to let you go, quite likely for ever? kes, i just can't do that."
it's my decision. my fate. would you really try to stop me?
"no. but argue with you? even plead with you to reconsider? absolutely, for as long as it takes."
"it won't work. look at me, captain. i'm the same kes you've always known. i haven't lost my judgment. i'm not under some alien influence. i believe something crucial is happening to me and i want to see it through."
"you've lived most of your life here. voyager has been your home. and you've been a vital part of this family. oh, i'm going to miss you."
now all i have to do is tell the doctor. he's not going to be happy.
it's starting.
janeway to bridge.
chakotay here.
prepare a shuttle for launch and have tuvok meet me on deck six.
captain?
kes is leaving us.
come on.
"captain, i can't stop it."
janeway to chakotay. beam us directly to the shuttlebay.
the molecules in kes' body are destabilising. it's interfering with the transporter.
"captain, we can't get a lock."
acknowledged. looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way.
what's happening?
the hull is destabilising. the molecular bonds are breaking down.
tuvok. i can't keep going.
i will attempt a mind meld to help you delay the transformation. our minds are one. our thoughts are one. try to regain control for a moment. only for a moment. only for a moment. you must hurry.
"hull breach on decks three, four and five."
emergency containment fields.
janeway to the bridge. kes is aboard the shuttle. initiate launch sequence.
acknowledged.
"shuttle distance, one hundred thousand kilometres. speed, one quarter impulse."
can you hail her?
i've been trying.
what's happening? what's happening to me.
her atomic structure is completely destabilising.
my gift to you.
torres to bridge. the warp core just came online.
matter antimatter reaction at one hundred and
two percent. a hundred and ten percent? a hundred and twenty!
this can't be right. our speed is - it's impossible!
we're coming apart!
we've just dropped out of whatever it was we were in.
systems coming back online.
on screen. where are we?
nine point five thousand light years from where we just were.
she's thrown us safely beyond borg space. ten years closer to home.
"i've extracted eighty two percent of the borg hardware. the remaining bio-implants are stable, and better than anything i could synthesise at such short notice."
it is acceptable.
"fashion, of course, is hardly my forte. nevertheless, i've managed to balance functionality and aesthetics in a pleasing enough manner. i also took the liberty of stimulating your hair follicles. a vicarious experience for me, as you might imagine."
you'll have to spend a few hours each day regenerating in a borg alcove until your human metabolism can function on it's own. we'll leave one operational.
understood.
let's see how things go over the next few weeks. i'll consider granting you access to the rest of the ship once that i can trust that you won't try to get us all assimilated again.
it will not happen again.
"good. if you need anything, contact me."
red.
what?
"the child you spoke of, the girl. her favourite colour was red."
commander chakotay.
i understand you wanted to see me.
i'm told you are the officer in charge of personnel. that you prepare the duty assignments. is that the correct phrase?
that's right.
i am finding it difficult to spend so much time alone. i am unaccustomed to it. the hours do not pass quickly.
i can understand that. how can we help?
i've been considering the matter carefully. i would like to request a duty assignment.
did you have something specific in mind?
yes.
now what!?
there's been a rupture in the coolant injector.
i can see that. why haven't you sealed it off?
i am attempting to do so.
that's better.
"lieutenant, i have an idea. perhaps it would be advisable to reconfigure the coolant assembly. that would give us greater control over the pressure valve emissions."
you're probably right. and tomorrow we can do it first thing. but not today.
i don't understand. why wait until tomorrow? today would be a much better
"not today, vorik."
good morning. here's the helm control evaluation you wanted.
thank you.
are we still on for dinner tonight?
i may have to work. i'll let you know.
"ah ha. okay. have you decided if you're, if you're going through with it?"
"i have. and i'm not. today hasn't started out very well, and the last thing i need is to get involved with some obscure klingon ritual."
you were the one who suggested it.
i know. and for one sentimental minute i thought that i might actually go through with it. but not anymore.
of course not. you wouldn't want to get too sentimental.
i overslept this morning because i forgot to tell the computer to wake me. and then the acoustic inverter in my sonic shower blew out.
that'll make your hair stand on end.
"so i didn't have time for breakfast. and when i got here two people were out sick, so i had to cancel the fuel cell overhaul. and then an injector burst for no apparent reason and started spewing plasma coolant"
"that's a run of bad luck, all right."
"so i am in a bad mood, and i know that i am being a little bit testy."
"no, that's okay. think about that dinner."
be careful.
something interesting just happened.
what's that?
seven of nine requested a duty assignment.
fascinating.
she wants to work in engineering.
what?
the borg use transwarp conduits to travel through space faster than warp speed. if we could create one of them.
we don't know anything about transwarp technology. playing around with it could be dangerous.
that's where seven of nine comes in. she's offered to work with you.
what do you think her real motives are?
she's having a tough time making the transition from the collective. she wants something to do.
"i never thought of you as naive, chakotay. the bottom line is, i don't want her working in engineering."
"the bottom line is, i'm giving you an order and you're going to follow it, lieutenant."
"whatever you say, sir."
"seven of nine, you told me you wouldn't make any more attempts to contact the borg. i want to believe that's true."
i assure you it is.
"i've decided not to post a security detail while you're in engineering, but you have to realise there are rules. you'll be expected to follow our protocols. you'll report directly to lieutenant torres and obey any order she gives you."
i understand.
"one more thing. your designation, seven of nine, it's a little cumbersome. wouldn't you prefer to be called by your given name, annika?"
i have been seven of nine for as long as i can remember.
all right. but maybe we could streamline it a little. how would you feel about seven?
"imprecise, but acceptable."
tuvok to captain janeway.
"yes, tuvok."
please come to the bridge. a ship is approaching.
"it's damaged but functional. energy emissions are so low, it's probably not capable of warp speed. several dozen lifesigns aboard. we are being hailed, captain."
open a channel. i'm captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager.
i am rahmin. my people are the caatati. i apologise for our appearance and the condition of our ship. most of our people were assimilated by the borg over a year ago. we lost everything.
how many of you escaped?
a few thousand on thirty ships. all that's left from a planet of millions.
i'm sorry.
"captain, i want to assure you, my people were once proud and accomplished."
i understand.
"it pains me to have to ask this, but i have eighty eight people to care for on this vessel. we need food, medicines. is there any way you could help us?"
of course. send us a list of your needs and we'll see what we can do.
"i'm deeply grateful. if it's not too much to ask, is there any way you might also spare a small quantity of thorium isotopes? without them, our systems can't function."
i think we can arrange that. i'll speak to my engineer.
"you can't imagine what this means to us, captain. thank you."
"how are those thorium isotopes coming, vorik?"
i'll admit i'm having trouble controlling the neutron absorption.
try increasing the temperature of the plasma. get the thorium to the captain as soon as it's ready.
of course.
"tell me something. when you hear about people like the caatati, do you have any feelings of remorse?"
no.
that's it? just no?
what further answer do you require?
"oh,maybe some kind of acknowledgement of the billions of lives you helped destroy. a justification for what you did. maybe a little sense of guilt?"
guilt is irrelevant.
heartwarming.
i've set the parameters for the tachyon bursts we'll need to create a transwarp conduit. it will be several hours before the main deflector can be modified. i think it would be best if i waited in my alcove.
i think you're right.
"if i ever saw a job for the morale officer, it's sitting right here. i'll bet i can help."
"you're facing a big challenge, neelix."
i enjoy a challenge.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
"blood pie, for the day of honour."
how did you know about that? has tom been talking to you?
"not at all. no, i make it a point to know these things. and if i'm correct, many klingon families traditionally serve blood pie on the day of honour."
"i appreciate the gesture, neelix, but i've decided to ignore this particular tradition. no blood pie, no examining my behaviour over the last year to see if i measure up to klingon standards."
"understood. lieutenant, without knowing why there's a black cloud hanging over your head, may i suggest something?"
go right ahead.
"you have a bit of a temper that you keep reined in, and sometimes it builds up inside you until you explode at someone."
i'd say that about sums it up.
i'm offering to be a pressure valve.
what?
"you may use me to blow off steam. when you're angry, come see me. call me names, insult me, question my parentage. i won't take it personally. and you won't need to keep things bottled up inside anymore."
"that may be the nicest offer i've had in a long time. thank you, neelix. you're sweet, but i'm not sure i could do that to you."
i'm here if you need me.
neelix. about this day of honour. do you think i should go through with it?
"i've always thought traditions were good things, worth preserving."
"i've been thinking a lot about the rituals that my mother taught me, and they don't seem quite so hateful as they did when i was a child. maybe being so far away from anything klingon has changed me."
it certainly can't hurt to go through with the ceremony.
"i don't know what effect it'll have on me. that's what's frightening. all right, bring on the blood pie. i can do this."
qapla'! what warrior goes there!
my name's b'elanna.
do you come to have your honour challenged?
i guess so. yes.
are you willing to see the ceremony through to the end?
"that's the idea, isn't it? what do i do?"
"it will be a lengthy ordeal. first, you must eat from the heart of a sanctified targ."
"pak'logh! yes, the heart of targ brings courage to one who eats it. next, you will drink mot'lach from the grail of kahless. drink to the glory of kahless, the greatest warrior of all time!"
kahless defeated his enemies on the field of battle and built a mighty empire. how have you proven yourself worthy?
"i haven't built any empires, and i can't say that i've personally defeated any enemies in battle, but you have to realise i'm not living among warriors."
then how do you expect to distinguish yourself?
i don't know. i guess i'm doing the best i can.
"huh. a pitiful reply. let us proceed. a warrior must endure great hardship. to test your mettle you will endure the ritual of twenty pain-sticks. after that, you will engage in combat with a master of the bat'leth. finally, you will traverse the sulphur lagoons of gorath."
"you know, i don't think so. i didn't want to do this before you described it. certainly not now. i'm leaving."
"not until you have completed the ceremony, p'tach."
thanks so much. it's been lovely.
come in.
"i tried to find you before, but you were on the holodeck."
that's right.
"you know, you left it running. there was a klingon in there who didn't look too happy."
really?
"yeah, and he was nursing a whale of a black eye. looked like he'd had a run in with someone having a really bad day."
that's very funny.
"so, how'd it go?"
it didn't. do you mind if we talk about something else?
"as a matter of fact i do. you have been like a spitting cobra all day and it's getting boring. you know, we designed that holodeck programme together, and i think you owe me the courtesy of telling me what happened."
"it was ridiculous, meaningless posturing. honour, dishonour, what does it matter?"
it matters because it's part of who you are. you've been running away from that your whole life.
who are you to tell me that?
"i care about you, but if you're going to keep pushing me away then there's no point in my staying around, is there?"
fine! just leave me alone.
"don't worry. if this is the way you treat people who try to be your friend, you'll be alone all right."
"there are over two hundred people on our three ships alone. everyone of them suffers from malnourishment, but it's been hardest on the children. every parent sacrifices for their child, but even so, there's not enough food. if you could hear the crying of the babies, you would have as much trouble sleeping at night as i do."
have you considered relocation to a planet where you could grow your own food?
"of course, but we haven't been welcomed anywhere. because we have no resources everyone treats us like vagrants, even criminals."
"we're not unsympathetic, but we have limited supplies. we can't possibly provide enough for all your people."
"forgive me but, from my perspective you live in luxury. you don't suffer from debilitating diseases. you have many sources of energy. replicators. your crew is very well fed. apparently, keeping your bellies full is more important to you than helping those less fortunate."
"that's unfair. these are the most generous people you could hope to meet. but if we gave supplies to everyone who asked, we wouldn't have anything left."
"neelix, how much food can we spare?"
we could provide each ship with several hundred kilograms.
"do it, and check with the doctor to see if he can spare any medical supplies."
"aye, captain."
thank you. may the gods smile on you and your crew.
"tuvok, please escort our guest to the transporter room."
i've never navigated a transwarp conduit. any problems i should be aware of?
"you have no idea what you are doing. if we attempt to enter one, i'll have to take helm control."
i am a quick study.
what species is that?
she is a human who lived as a borg.
borg!
she is disconnected from the collective. she won't harm you.
where's my wife? where are my children? what did you do with them after you took them? what did you do with my family?
"mister paris, please proceed."
"i lost everything. my family, my home."
sorry about that.
about what?
"well, the way he reacted to you."
he didn't injure me.
good.
there are many people on this ship who have similar feelings towards me.
i'm afraid you're right. does that bother you?
no.
"well, i'm not one of those people. we all have a past. what matters is now."
i'm uncertain what you're trying to say.
"that if there's any way i can help you adjust to your life here on voyager, please ask me."
i will remember your offer.
all systems are ready.
"we're only going to take a peek. we open a conduit, get as much sensor data as we can, then close it up. i want to take this one step at a time."
i've set up a temporary tachyon matrix within the main deflector. it's online.
engineering to the bridge.
"we're ready to start, captain."
go ahead. we'll monitor your progress from here.
we'll need to be at warp speed to create a large enough subspace field. i'd like to reroute helm control to engineering.
agreed. janeway out.
take us past
past warp two. i know. we're at warp two point three.
"all right. vorik, start emitting the tachyons."
energising the matrix.
there's no indication of a subspace field. i recommend switching to a higher energy band.
that did something.
the subspace field is forming.
tachyon particles are leaking into the propulsion system.
shut down the deflector.
done. but the leak is continuing.
janeway to engineering.
"the tachyons are flooding the warp core, captain."
"if you can't stabilise the core immediately, evacuate engineering."
"aye, captain. i'll get back to you."
"i've cut all power relays, but the tachyon levels are still rising."
"all right, everybody out! now! that means you as well."
i could be of help.
that's an order.
"you can't order me, i outrank you."
we've got to neutralise the core.
i'll try decoupling the dilithium matrix.
no effect. try it again.
it's not working. the core is about to breach!
i've got to try one more thing.
"b'elanna, there's no more time. we've got to get out of here. come on."
"computer, prepare to eject the warp core. authorisation torres omega phi nine three"
"computer, eject the warp core. torres to janeway."
go ahead.
we've dumped the core. welcome to the worst day of my life.
"vorik, we have to get those impulse engines back online. you and nicoletti get started."
"yes, lieutenant."
report.
"we're stopped dead. the warp core is millions of kilometres away by now, and the impulse engines are seriously damaged. i can give you a few thrusters, but that's about it."
how long before i can have impulse power?
i can't give you an estimate on that. we're still assessing the damage. so much for opening a transwarp conduit. i sent the borg back to her alcove. we won't be needing her in here any more.
"at least the core's still intact. tom, take a shuttle and find it. see if you can tractor it back to voyager."
yes ma'am.
it'll be unstable. it should be repaired before he tries to put a tractor beam on it.
"well then, you go with him. do whatever you have to. just get it back here in one piece."
we're getting near some random ion turbulence.
i'll change course to avoid it.
"i wonder what else can go wrong today. if we get this core back, i'm going right to bed and sleeping straight through till tomorrow. get this day over with."
"well, look at it this way, how much worse could it get? having to dump the warp core has to be the low point of any day."
maybe it's me. maybe i'm asking for this trouble somehow.
or maybe it's just a streak of bad luck? sensors have picked up a polymetallic object. could be the core.
that's the warp signature all right. there's something else out there. a ship. according to sensors it has the same energy signature as the caatati ships.
maybe they're guarding it for us.
right.
i see it. what do they think they're doing?
they're trying to put a tractor beam on it.
this is the shuttle cochrane to the caatati vessel. please respond.
don't come any closer. we're performing a salvage operation.
"oh, what a coincidence. so are we."
i'm afraid we got here first. don't interfere or we'll open fire.
don't you realise that core is highly unstable? if you try to tractor it like that you could cause an antimatter explosion.
they're not answering.
idiots!
we have to stop them from destroying the core.
i'm going to try and disrupt their tractor beam.
it's working.
what was that?
they sent an antimatter pulse back through our particle beam.
warning. structural integrity field has been compromised. now at fifty three percent and falling. hull breach in two minutes twenty seconds.
reroute power from the propulsion and weapons systems.
warning. hull breach in two minutes ten seconds.
no effect.
warning. the structural integrity field has collapsed. hull breach in two minutes.
we have to get out of here.
warning. hull breach in one minute fifty seconds.
"computer, send a distress call to voyager. give them our coordinates. computer, respond."
the comm. systems must be down.
transporters are still online. stand by to energise. energise.
paris to voyager. do you read me? please respond. paris to voyager.
it's no use. the comm. system in these suits won't carry that far.
when they get the impulse engines repaired they'll come looking for us.
"well, i don't plan on just drifting here hoping someone will just come along and rescue us. there must be something we can do."
agreed. if we could interplex the comm. systems in both suits we might be able to create a phased carrier wave. voyager would read the signature and know it's from us.
good idea. let me access your controls.
i thought you'd never ask.
that's it. this would be a lot easier if i had a hyperspanner. hold still.
why is it we have to get beamed into space in environmental suits before i can initiate first contact procedures?
why is it that if we're alone for more than thirty seconds you start thinking about contact?
"ah, that is not fair. the other day in engineering i must have gone four minutes before i started thinking about it."
"okay, i'm ready to initiate the carrier wave."
ah! ah!
sorry. better?
yeah. let's hope it's still that strong by the time it gets to voyager.
come in. would you like tea or coffee?
i have no need to ingest liquids. i still receive energy from the borg alcove.
my understanding is that you're almost ready to begin eating food.
that is what the doctor says. why have you asked me here?
"whenever there's an accident on the ship, even a minor one, we investigate itin order to minimise the chances of its happening again."
a prudent course of action.
"i didn't have a chance to talk to lieutenant torres before she left the ship, so i wanted to ask you some questions about what happened in engineering. sensor logs indicate the tachyons were leaking into the warp core. do you have any idea how it started?"
no. we had reconfigured the deflector shield to emit tachyon bursts. the procedure must have triggered the leak.
who was controlling the tachyon bursts?
ensign vorik.
what were you doing?
monitoring the transwarp frequencies.
and did you at any time access deflector control?
"you believe i'm responsible for the accident. that i deliberately sabotaged the ship. you are like the others, you see me as a threat."
i won't lie to you. part of me is suspicious. we've dealt with tachyon fields before and never had this kind of problem.
"captain. i am unaccustomed to deception. among the borg it was impossible. there were no lies, no secrets. and i assure you i had nothing to do with the accident in engineering."
i believe you. thank you.
"i am finding it a difficult challenge to integrate into this group. it is full of complex social structures that are unfamiliar to me. compared with the borg, this crew is inefficient and contentious, but it is capable of surprising acts of compassion."
unexpected acts of kindness are common among our group. that's one of the ways we define ourselves.
is there anything more?
yes. we still have to find out what caused the tachyon leak. tell me what you remember about the power fluctuations in the propulsion system.
"this isn't anything like the simulations we had at the academy. they felt peaceful, like floating in the womb. but right now i'm feeling a little sick to my stomach."
you dropped out too soon. in the third year there's a six week course of actual spacewalks so you can get used to them.
"i never would have lasted to the third year. if i hadn't dropped out, they would have asked me to leave."
i wish i'd known you then.
you'd have hated me.
i can't imagine a time i wouldn't have found you fascinating.
what the hell was that?
more ion turbulence.
warning. oxygen level at one hundred fourteen millibars.
my oxygen supply is leaking.
warning. oxygen level at ninety three millibars.
we'll have to share mine.
are you getting air now?
yes. much better. thanks. what's wrong?
"the turbulence must have damaged my suit too. i should have at least twenty four hours worth of oxygen, but there's only about a half hour left."
engineering to captain janeway.
"yes, ensign."
i'm pleased to inform you that impulse power should be restored
within the hour.
good news. let me know the minute the engines are online.
"yes, ma'am."
"captain, i believe i've found the cause of the accident. erratic fluctuations in the ship's warp power. when tachyon levels rose to a resonant frequency, core pressure increased."
then it was an accident. come in.
"captain, we've picked up a carrier wave with a starfleet signature. i'd guess it's tom and b'elanna, but they're not answering our hails."
they may be in trouble. as soon as we get impulse power
tuvok to the captain. can you come to the bridge?
on my way.
we're being approached by an armada of caatati ships.
they're hailing us.
on screen.
"hello, captain."
you've brought some friends.
needy friends. we're hoping you will offer us more supplies.
i made it clear last time that we couldn't possibly you with enough for all your ships.
"and i had to accept that because your ship is more powerful than ours. but the situation has changed, hasn't it? you seem to be at a disadvantage now. we have your warp core. you can't escape. i'm hoping that'll make you more generous."
we've given you everything we can spare. return the core and we'll be on our way.
"one of our ships might not seem threatening to you, but i assure you, twenty seven can inflict considerable damage. we are desperate. prepare to send us food, weapons, and your entire supply of thorium. and that borg you're protecting. we want her too. there are many who'd enjoy a chance to repay one of them for what they did to us."
i'm lowering the oxygen ratio. that should give us a few more minutes.
i'm feeling kind of groggy.
oxygen deprivation.
and you're lowering it?
we have to try to make it last as long as possible.
"it's ironic, isn't it."
what?
"today, the day of honour, is the day that i'm going to die."
we are not going to die. would you stop talking like that?
"we have to face up to it, tom."
there's something i've been wanting to ask you.
"well, now's the time."
"when we first met, you didn't have a very high opinion of me."
"that's putting it mildly. i thought you were an arrogant, self- absorbed pig."
flattery won't get you any more oxygen. do you think i've changed?
"a lot. now you're a stubborn domineering pig. i'm just kidding. there i go again, just pushing you away. you were right about me. it's what i do, push people away."
"well, it's a sure fire way of not getting hurt."
what a coward i am.
shush.
our weapons are more powerful than theirs. i say we fight.
maybe if we give them something?
like what? i can't imagine what would satisfy them now.
i will go. they asked for me. if i surrender myself perhaps they'll let you leave.
"that's very generous, but i will not turn you over to them."
i was only offering to do what would be best for this group.
"you're part of this group now and we're going to protect you. it's time to stop talking about this. tom and b'elanna are in trouble and we have to find them. tuvok, what's the status of our weapons array?"
"weapons are at the ready, captain, but our shield strength is extremely low."
we'll have to shut down non-essential systems. reroute power to the shields. we're going to fight.
that might not be necessary. caatati technology is dependent on thorium isotopes. if they had enough they could become self-sustaining.
but we don't have that much thorium to give them.
"when the borg assimilated the caatati, the survivors lost their ability to replicate the isotopes. but i have retained that knowledge. i could design an energy matrix that would produce thorium in large quantities."
"if you've had this knowledge all along, why didn't you say so?"
"i am not accustomed to thinking that way. borg do not consider giving technology away, only assimilating it."
and what do you suppose made you consider it now?
i am not certain.
"maybe it was just an unexpected act of kindness. work with vorik to build the energy matrix, while i convince the caatati there's a better way out of this."
this matrix will produce nine hundred forty four grammes of thorium per day.
now you can power all your systems and begin to rebuild your replication technology. will you allow us to leave?
one device isn't enough for all our ships.
using this matrix as a template you can construct as many as you like. we can provide you with components and specifications.
you are free to go. and thank you.
you're welcome.
warning. oxygen level at one hundred four millibars.
tom. come on. open your eyes.
warning. oxygen level at eighty seven millibars.
i was having a dream.
there's something i have to say.
me too. i'm glad the last thing i'll see is you.
i've been a coward about everything. everything that really matters.
now you're being a little hard on yourself.
no. i'm going to die without a shred of honour. and for the first time in my life that really bothers me. so i have to tell you something. i
warning. oxygen level at seventy one millibars.
i have to tell you the truth.
the truth about what?
i love you. say something.
you picked a great time to tell me.
"voyager to tom paris. tom, do you read me? respond."
we're here.
prepare to beam aboard.
don't move.
what's this?
"we found him in the trunks, a hundred footfalls past grove yellow."
arms?
"none, sir."
these colours?
we didn't ask.
"he's no krady beast, is he?"
"no, sir, but he doesn't bear vori colours either."
hmm. his glimpse is too tame to be a kradin.
"i hadn't fathomed that, sir."
"well, fathom it now. he's no nemesis, is he?"
"i'm not certain what he is, sir."
weren't you drilled to fathom the nemesis?
"yes, sir."
"and we abhor none but the nemesis, do we?"
"no, sir. none but the nemesis!"
"then set him loose. didn't you hear, novice?"
thanks.
go take provisions.
"i'm sorry, sir."
go.
i take it you're in charge here.
"team leader brone, fourth vori defence contingent."
commander chakotay of the starship voyager.
i'm very sorry for my defenders. they're new to the clash and glimpse the nemesis all around them.
the clash. you're at war?
you've strayed into the fullness of it.
that explains why my shuttle came under fire.
one of my defenders glimpsed a vessel falling in grove yellow. it must have been yours. why fly so close to this sphere?
"i was on a survey mission. i picked up traces of omicron radiation in your atmosphere so i slowed down to take a look. as soon as i did that, i came under attack. i lost helm control and had to make an emergency transport to the surface."
it'll be the kradin that fired at you.
the kradin?
our nemesis.
"i see. well, i tried to explain that i had no hostile intentions, but they just kept shooting."
the nemesis crave supremacy in the air. they fire on any craft that doesn't show kradin colours.
i tried to contact my ship but my communicator's not working.
all dispatching in the clash zone has been suppressed.
i have to find my vessel. maybe it's salvageable.
that's little likely. we're ordered to cluster with the seventh contingent two new lights from now. they'll have means to signal your people. you can make the walk with us to meet them.
"i appreciate the offer, but i can't wait two days. i have to find my vessel now."
it wouldn't be sharp to return to the trunks. the nemesis is everywhere there.
then i'll have to do my best to steer clear of them.
if your tactic won't change.
it won't.
it's sharper to wait for the new light.
then i'll take your advice and wait.
provisions? it's not so savoury.
thanks. i'm sure it'll be fine.
they call me rafin.
chakotay. pleased to meet you.
"in the trunks, did you glimpse any?"
any what?
krady beasts.
"no, i didn't."
"rafin's never glimpsed the face of the nemesis either. have you, rafin?"
no. it's my first walk in the clash zone.
"you'll glimpse them in the soon after. when you do, you'll fathom there's no heart thumping beneath their flesh. how many beasts will you send to the wayafter, rafin?"
i couldn't say.
"me, i'll nullify one for each brother and cousin that i've lost. and then one more after. true or not, my allies?"
true.
"so i ask you again, rafin. how many will you nullify?"
as many as i'm able.
"you've got the trembles. if you don't wrestle your trembles to rages, ally, the nemesis'll nullify you."
this nemesis of yours. why do you call them beasts?
"it's told they all wear the same horrid face. their flesh is gnarled and blistery like the rotting trunks. their glimpses flame like fire, and if you dare near enough, their breath stinks of muck."
"you know, sometimes people say terrible things about their enemies to make them seem worse than they really are. there might be some young kradin soldier out there who's more afraid of you than you are of him."
"the nemesis wasn't scared to fume my village, nor scared to nullify my cousins and brothers in their sleep. and my old mother's mother, too, who never told an unkind word nor nullified an insect in all her days and nights on this sphere."
that's pretty rough.
"and who but a krady beast would leave the nullified bodies of mine and ours upturned, so they'll never descend to the gloried wayafter?"
what do you mean by upturned?
which of you will walk with chakotay to find his craft when the new light comes?
"i appreciate the offer, but i'll be fine on my own."
"you don't fathom the trunks and you don't carry arms. one of my defenders will walk with you. which will it be? you, rafin."
"sir, i, i"
"i'll walk with the stranger, sir. if any beast comes to clash, i'll nullify the beast."
"well told, namon. now close your glimpses, defenders, and dream of your sisters and mothers."
"have you never nullified another, stranger?"
killing's the worst thing i've ever had to do.
then the nemesis you nullified wasn't half so beastly as the kradin.
maybe not.
"in their glimpsers, we're less than nothing. they flame our homes, take our plantings, make playthings of our sisters. if you were a vori you'd crave to drive them from this sphere just as i do."
"maybe i would, if they did things like that to the people i loved. but on the sphere i come from we try to find other ways to resolve differences. peaceful solutions, negotiations."
you don't fathom the nemesis.
no. i suppose i don't.
beg the power you believe in that you never will. the light will be old soon. we'd be sharp to cluster with the others.
in a few minutes. we should be getting close.
you'd be sharp to do my tellings.
go back if you want to. i've got to keep looking.
"no, wait. i pledged to walk with you. glimpse there."
it doesn't look like there's much left of my shuttle.
you'll have to make the walk with us to the seventh contingent.
don't make me kill you.
how is he?
nullified.
"we beg peace from the power who made us vori, and we commend our brother, namon, to the gloried wayafter."
what's this?
namon's coverings.
shouldn't they go to his family or someone he was close to?
it's a long walk to the cluster mark. it's sharper to blend with the trunks. your fleet colours will get us all nullified.
i'm sorry about what happened to namon.
"the nemesis has nullified mine and ours in the before, and will in the now. but in the soonafter, we'll send them flying from this sphere and go back to our sisters and mothers."
take it.
this isn't my war. i'm not planning to shoot anybody.
"if we greet the nemesis in the trunks, you'll fire like the rest. as long as you're with us, you do my tellings. fathom?"
fathom.
rafin.
"yes, sir."
drill chakotay to fire vori arms.
now you. your glimpse is too low. with these arms it's sharper to aim higher than the mark.
you're good.
don't mock me.
i was paying you a compliment.
"it is one matter to fire at clay marks, but much another to nullify the nemesis. that's what namon told, and he told the truth before he went to the gloried wayafter."
he was right. killing's not easy.
risking my own days and nights to drive the nemesis from our sphere. that should be as easy as a long sleep.
who told you that?
"my brothers and uncles who were in the clash. brone my driller. and namon, my ally, who was nullified because of me."
you think it's your fault that namon died?
"if i didn't have the coward's trembles, i would have walked with you in the trunks. and it would be me and not he who went to the wayafter."
"you weren't the one who pulled the trigger, rafin. and there's no shame in being afraid of fighting. having the trembles is natural."
how do you fathom that?
"because i've been in battle before, fighting to free my people from a nemesis called the cardassians."
"these cardassians, were they beasts?"
"let's just say they weren't very friendly. the point is, even though i believed in what we were doing, i always felt fear before a fight."
"but you wrestled your trembles to rages, didn't you?"
"i guess i did, but that doesn't mean"
"i was told to drill you, chakotay. but it's you who've drilled me. drilled me to fathom the rages."
brone.
what is it?
i don't know.
neck-strapped and upturned. left to be cooked by the glare.
he's one of yours?
by his coverings he's of the seventh contingent. likely a scout walker.
desecrated by the kradin.
he'll never turn his face to the wayafter.
we're three hundred footfalls from the cluster mark. signal the seventh. again.
why don't they answer?
is it possible they moved their camp for some reason?
"little likely. you two, fast walk to the cluster mark and glimpse what you can."
sir.
what?
let me go.
"well told, novice. keep the talk low and your glimpse wide."
sir.
what have you glimpsed?
"the seventh contingent, sir. nullified."
"what, all of them?"
"at least twenty defenders. and that's not the whole telling of it. they're all, they're all"
"tell it, rafin. they're all how?"
"like him, sir. upturned. staked to the dirt up and upturned."
"those motherless krady beasts. do you glimpse the fullness of it now, stranger?"
yes. i think i do.
now you fathom why we name them beasts and not men?
i'm sorry.
"we're much more than sorry, aren't we, defenders?"
"yes, sir!"
the nemesis wants your plantings.
"true, true."
"he wants your homes. he wants your sisters. but does it suffice him to nullify you? no. he craves to shame you, mock you, keep you from the gloried wayafter! we're wearied of it, aren't we?"
yes sir!
"we're wrestled to the rages for it, aren't we?"
"yes, sir!"
"and we're not going to swallow it. not in the now, or in the soonafter!"
assault! apply yourselves and fire back!
motherless beasts!
"rafin, no! stay down!"
i'll nullify you all!
hold on. i'm gonna get you out of here.
please. turn my face to the wayafter.
"a defender. mark, neighbours, a defender!"
"welcome to larhana settlement, gloried defender. you're brightly greeted."
"according to the ambassador, chakotay's shuttle was hit by enemy fire and crash-landed somewhere on the southernmost continent."
right in the middle of the war zone.
i'm afraid so.
can we get a lock on him?
there's too much atmospheric radiation from weapons fire. we can't scan the surface.
which means we don't know if he's still alive.
why don't we assume he still is?
i should have gone with him.
"it's not your fault, tom. we couldn't have anticipated this. what we've got to do now is figure out how to deal with it. b'elanna, try to modify the scanners. cut through the interference."
"aye, captain."
"neelix, what do you know about this war?"
it's vicious. ambassador treen's people have been defending themselves against a particularly savage aggressor for more than a decade.
is the ambassador willing to help us find chakotay?
"he's willing, but he may not be able."
"his resources are extremely limited, and the situation on the surface is chaotic."
"but he's assured me that if his troops do find chakotay, he'll receive medical attention and be transported to the nearest command post."
let's hope he doesn't meet up with these savage aggressors first.
"captain, let me lead a team down there and bring him back."
"i understand how you feel, tom, but let's take it one step at a time. tuvok, recontact ambassador treen. ask for any tactical support he's willing to provide. maps, weapons analyses, intelligence reports. before i risk anyone else's life i want to know exactly what we're getting ourselves into."
"by your coverings, you're a novice, defender. do i tell the truth?"
"listen, there's been a misunderstanding. i'm not a defender. my shuttle was shot down by the kradin and i landed in the clash zone. i met up with one of your patrols. they gave me this uniform."
which contingent?
the fourth.
the fourth? they're sturdy clashers.
"tell us, did you and your allies drive the nemesis from the trunks?"
we put up a brave fight.
then you're a gloried defender even if you claim not to be.
"marna tells the truth, chakotay. you are welcome among my neighbours."
thank you. that's very kind.
do you crave anything more? drink? warm coverings?
what i really need is some communications equipment to contact my crew.
we have no means to signal your people.
"the kradin drove us from our homes and plantings, and took all the machinery we had."
do you know where i might find some place with communications equipment?
the restock unit.
can you tell me how to get there?
it's not very near. at least ten thousand footfalls through the thick of the trunks.
then i'd better get started.
the new light is coming. rest till then.
"yes, please, chakotay. rest until the new light."
i think i will.
"come, neighbours. let's give defender chakotay some quiet."
i wanted to know if you crave more.
"no, thank you."
oh.
but it was delicious.
"and the blossoms, do you like them? i planted them myself."
they're very pretty.
"i've heard tellings that the kradin leave our nullied defenders upturned. is it true? you can tell me. penno says i'm too small to be told, but i'm not."
it's true the kradin don't respect your beliefs.
"the kradin are beasty. i don't fathom why they flamed our homes, nor why they crave to nully us all."
i don't either.
we never took their plantings. we never nullied their brothers. so why do they hate us?
i wish i could tell you. hate's not something i understand very well.
"my brother's a defender, too."
really?
"he left for the clash two plantings before. i was much smaller then. he was sturdy, and pleasing to glimpse in his colours. like you. maybe you've glimpsed him. he's called daryo."
there are a lot of soldiers in the war. i only met a few of them.
he's a team leader of the seventh defence contingent.
the seventh. are you sure he was with the seventh?
they're very sturdy in the clash. have you heard of them?
the patrol i was with was supposed to rendezvous with them.
why didn't you? you would have glimpsed him.
we were ambushed before we had the chance.
"but when you go back to the clash, maybe you'll glimpse daryo then. you could take a letter to him."
i'm not going back to the clash zone. i've got to get to the restock unit so i can contact my ship.
"then you can bring my letter to the restock unit. maybe some defender there can take it to daryo. will you do it? please? i'll go write it now, before the new light comes."
i wish you a good day.
thank you.
provisions for your long walk.
"walk well, defender chakotay."
thank you both. you've all been very kind.
writings for my brother. you'll be sure he gets them?
i'll do my best.
your best will be enough. the pretty smell of the blossoms will hold the nemesis far away.
then you'd better keep one for yourself.
"offer no opposition, or you will be nullified."
"no evidence of cellular residue on the shuttle wreckage, so there's a chance chakotay survived the crash."
"unfortunately the wreckage was found inside enemy territory,"
so there is also a chance he has been captured or killed by the nemesis.
"there you go looking on the bright side again, tuvok."
what's this nemesis?
it is the term ambassador treen's people use to identify their enemy.
"apparently, they're vicious. they shoot without warning, use biochemical weapons, routinely massacre civilians. if we run into them, it's safe to say they won't be hanging out a welcome sign."
i want a team on the surface as soon as possible.
"i was hoping you'd say that. tuvok, let's get moving."
"i must caution you both my tactical analysis does not bode well for the success of such a mission. given the situation in the battle zone, there is a very high probability that an away team will sustain heavy casualties."
are you saying we should just abandon chakotay?
on the contrary.
i suppose you've come up with an alternative plan?
"indeed. i have concluded that the least risky course of action is for a single crew member to make the infiltration, accompanied by a commando unit that ambassador treen has agreed to provide."
fine with me. when do i leave?
something tells me that's not what tuvok has in mind.
"naturally, i am the logical person to carry out this mission."
naturally.
get down there!
chakotay!
"i heard the explosions, and i came back to help."
what did the kradin do to you?
they interrogated me. where's your grandfather?
"i don't know. he's very grey, and his heart's not sturdy. he needs me to tend him."
"you. you! i want to talk to your superior. hey, i'm talking to you! i want to know what you've done to this girl's grandfather. he's old and needs medical atte - argh!"
chakotay! penno always tells it'll be brighter when the new light comes.
your grandfather's a wise man.
"that's right, get some sleep."
"you'll tend me, won't you, no matter what comes in the soonafter?"
"close your glimpsers, and dream of your gloried brother."
come along. vori. move along.
where are they taking them?
i don't know.
they'll be fast walked to the extermination facility.
why?
because they're grey and too long-lived the kradin think them unfit for toiling. they won't make good servers like us.
offer no resistance.
penno. penno!
karya!
where are they taking you?
"be sturdy, my daughter's daughter."
who's going to tend you?
we'll glimpse each other again in the wayafter.
set him loose!
karya!
set him loose!
be still!
keep your hands off her. don't touch her!
"what's the matter, pretty one?"
set my mother's father loose.
is that the man you mean?
no! karya!
"please, set him loose!"
"you don't want to see him suffer, do you, pretty one?"
no.
don't worry. the old vori's suffering will be over soon enough.
no! penno!
take this shrieking waif to the extermination facility.
"no. chakotay, set me loose! chakotay, help me!"
motherless beast!
are ambassador treen and his soldiers ready to beam aboard?
"aye, captain."
energise.
"welcome aboard, ambassador. thank you for agreeing to help us find our crewman."
"your thanks are unnecessary, captain. any victim of our bloodthirsty nemesis, the vori, will always find friends among the kradin people."
"chakotay. be calm now. i'll set you loose. sorry to leave you upturned so long, but i had to shroud myself in the trunks till the kradin walked on."
"the villagers, from larhana settlement?"
they were fast walked through the trunks.
and your defenders?
all nullified.
thank you for coming back for me. you put yourself at risk.
"and you, chakotay, clashed beside us against the kradin though you are a stranger to this sphere. i glimpsed you chancing your days and nights to save rafin from our nemesis."
you tell the truth when you name them beasts. what will you do now that your men are gone?
join with the fifth contingent. they're trying to free the villagers. it doesn't go brightly for them.
i'll come with you.
no. i'll bring you to command. you can signal your people.
"that can wait till the soonafter. in the now, you need my help to nullify the nemesis."
back walk! back walk! the nemesis is nearing. it's sharper to back walk.
brone!
vori soldiers! you are surrounded. lay down your arms and surrender.
hold your fire!
you'll have to nullify me first!
"hold your fire, commander chakotay. do not fire, commander."
how do you know my name?
"i am lieutenant tuvok,"
tuvok? don't walk any closer!
i've come to take you back to voyager.
"nullify him, chakotay. it's a kradin tactic."
"i assure you, commander, this is no ruse. it is lieutenant tuvok. don't you recognise me?"
he's the nemesis!
"you're a kradin beast. you destroyed that village, nullified penno, took away karya. she was only a child!"
"they've brainwashed you, commander. look closer. try to recall. your shuttle was shot down. these people, the vori, they captured you."
"no, they rescued me."
"that is what they want you to believe. they have been indoctrinating you, training you to fight their war."
take one more step and i'll nullify you.
"you are commander chakotay of the starship voyager. you are a scientist, an explorer. you are not a killer."
tuvok.
"yes, commander."
"how can you wear those colours? they're kradin. they're beasts, murderers."
"on the contrary, they are the ones who helped us locate you. we tracked you to a vori training camp. we infiltrated the facility, but you were gone. they had already brought you here to fight this battle. before today, nothing you experienced here was real. it is the method the vori use to conscript and train soldiers."
i don't believe you!
i will prove it to you if you will lower your weapon.
do you recognise this place?
it's larhana settlement.
"a defender. mark, neighbours, a defender! defender. karya."
"welcome to larhana settlement, gloried defender. you are brightly greeted."
"my guess is the vori used a combination of mind control techniques, including photometric projections, heightened emotional stimuli, and highly sophisticated psychotropic manipulation. from the condition of your hypothalamus, i'd say they had you so mixed up they could have convinced you your own mother was a turnip."
everything i experienced was some sort of simulation?
"except for the battle you were fighting when tuvok found you. apparently, attacking the simulated commandant marked your graduation from basic training."
"and the men i fought beside, none of them was real? namon and rafin weren't killed in front of me?"
"as far as we can tell, they were part of the simulation. the idea was to make you bond with your fellow soldiers as well as the villagers, so their deaths would enrage you."
why me?
"luck of the draw. you happened to be passing through their space and you were as promising a recruit as anyone else. we've been told the vori have dozens of these training facilities where they conscript their own people, and any aliens they're able to capture."
"in short, commander, you've been subjected to a highly sophisticated form of propaganda."
then the kradin don't kill innocent civilians? they don't desecrate the vori's dead?
i don't know. but the kradin accuse the vori of the same kinds of atrocities.
"i cared about the vori, but i hated the kradin. i wanted to kill every one of them."
"evidently, that was the point."
captain. ambassador treen would like a word with the commander.
i wish to tell you how pleased my people are to hear of your recovery. i'm only sorry we weren't able to rescue you sooner from our nemesis. have i said something wrong?
i don't know.
"if you'll excuse me, captain."
chakotay?
i wish it were as easy to stop hating as it was to start.
"to any vessels within range. i hope this message reaches you. i'm an hd25 isomorphic projection. there's been an accident. my crew is dead. i'm alone. please, help me."
so we rigged the security console so that every time tuvok accessed the internal sensors it would play a little message.
live long and prosper.
"no matter what button he pushed, live long and prosper."
"naturally, no one was available to fix the malfunction"
so tuvok had to stretch his vulcan patience to the limit for the rest of the day.
i swear you could hear him grinding his teeth from across the bridge.
"and just when he thought it was over, when he went back to his quarters and ordered a cup of vulcan tea, the replicator says"
live long and prosper!
"the first time i met tuvok he dressed me down in front of three starfleet admirals for failing to observe proper tactical procedures during my first command. my human ego took a little bruising, but, of course, he was right.  over the past nine years i've come to rely on his insightful and unfailingly logical advice. for outstanding services, chief tactical and security officer, it's my pleasure to grant you the rank of lieutenant commander. congratulations, tuvok."
"thank you, captain. had i known this commendation entailed ritual humiliation, i might have declined. however, i accept it with gratitude and will honour the responsibility that comes with it. during my three years on voyager i have grown to respect a great many of you. others i have learned to tolerate. as your tactical officer, i will continue to do my best to ensure a safe passage home. as a vulcan, i share the following sentiment. live long and prosper."
bravo. well deserved.
"b'elanna, this is ridiculous. it's been three days and we haven't said a word to each other."
"i know, i know. we have to talk."
"about what you said. i mean, the part about being in love with me. i realise you were suffering from oxygen deprivation and we were literally seconds away from death, so i know you probably didn't mean it."
"no, no, i meant it. but i don't expect you to reciprocate. really, you can just pretend that i didn't say it. in fact let's just pretend that i didn't"
shut up.
"mister paris, there you are."
i was just leaving. lieutenant.
"what can i do for you, doc?"
"the captain has authorised me to recruit someone with advanced medical training to help out in sickbay. unfortunately, the most qualified crewmember is you."
you want me to be the new nurse?
if that's the title you prefer. it will only be temporary. three duty shifts a week. report to sickbay and oh six hundred hours. bring a tricorder and a smile.
what kind of modifications?
we've like to enhance the astrometrics lab. it hasn't been upgraded since voyager left spacedock.
i'll start right away.
i've assigned seven of nine to work with you. she's agreed to provide us with all the navigational data for this area she acquired during her time with the borg. is there a problem?
no. no problem.
try to make her feel like part of the team.
right. part of the team.
have you made arrangement for the arritheans for tomorrow?
the delegate says he's looking forward to trading with such an advanced starship.
"you've done an excellent job preparing for this mission, neelix. i think you should consider this your first official assignment as ambassador."
ensign culhane to the captain.
janeway here.
we are receiving an automated distress call five light years from here. you might want to bring the doctor.
"i'm an hd25 isomorphic projection. there's been an accident. my crew is dead. i'm alone. please, help me."
"he's a hologram. we've got to help him. ensign, track the source of the transmission."
"once we find the ship, i'll lead an away team."
i don't recall giving you a promotion today.
"oh. well, i'm the obvious choice to provide assistance to a holographic being."
"doctor, i don't want you leaving voyager unless it's absolutely necessary. i'm still concerned about damaging your mobile emitter."
"i understand. but if this is a hologram, one of my own kind so to speak, i'd like to meet him, study him. i'll bring lieutenant torres just to be safe. she knows more about my emitter than anyone."
"the rest of us will meet with the arritheans. we'll see you there, when you're finished."
"thank you, captain."
seven?
i am here.
am i to work with you?
"oh, hi. yes, i thought we'd start in jefferies tube thirty two b. enhance the astrometric sensors, if that's okay with you. unless this is a bad time. maybe i can come back later."
"ensign kim, you seem apprehensive."
"no, not at all."
"the last time we worked together, i struck you at the base of your skull and attempted to contact the collective."
these things happen.
i assure you it will not happen again.
that's good to know.
i've designed new navigational sensors. some of the alphanumerics are borg.
no problem. i always wanted to learn borg.
that is difficult to believe.
"i was kidding. it was a joke. you know, humour."
"i understand the concept of humour. it may not be apparent, but i am often amused by human behaviour."
"relax, doctor. i'm sure we'll find the ship."
that's not what i'm concerned about. i've been questioning the wisdom of leaving mister paris in charge of my sickbay.
tom will do fine. he's a very responsible guy.
"well, i suppose you'd know better than i would."
what's that supposed to mean?
you seem to have become good friends.
let's get one thing straight. i don't appreciate you or anyone else speculating about the kind of friendships i have. or who i have them with.
"sorry, i didn't realise i'd struck a nerve. perhaps you'd like a tranquilliser."
there it is.
that's his ship? try hailing it.
no response.
lifesigns?
"a few energy readings, but they're erratic. propulsion and main power are down."
we're approaching transporter range.
hello? is anyone here? we're here to help you.
no signs of life?
not yet.
"i'd like to check your mobile emitter, make sure you made it through the transport okay."
"for a klingon, you have a decent bedside manner."
thanks.
"i wonder what kind of bedside manner mister paris will exhibit? that was a rhetorical question, lieutenant."
"your holographic matrix is stable, let me check your emitter's power cells."
you might want to consider a career in medicine.
where the hell did this come from?
"sorry. sorry, sorry. i didn't mean to frighten you."
you sent the distress call?
"yes, yes, that's me. it was me. and you, you're an isomorph like myself?"
we use the term hologram.
"hologram. and you, you're a hologram too?"
no.
you're organic.
"ah, that's one way of putting it, yes."
it looks like your programme is fairly compatible with our holographic technology. can you tell me where i can access your projection controls?
why?
you're obviously malfunctioning. maybe i can repair you.
"oh, of course. i'd appreciate that. over there. you can access my systems from that console."
what happened here?
"oh, it was terrible, just terrible. you see, we left seros eight months ago. seros, that's our home planet. with a crew of six."
all isomorphic projections?
"no, just me. i'm an hd25 maintenance unit with extreme hazard clearance. i'm responsible for cleaning the reactor core, ejecting antimatter waste, that sort of thing. when the crew got sick there was nothing i could do. i'm not designed for medical functions. i, i"
try to calm down. explain what happened one step at a time.
"two of the crew members left to survey a planet. when they came back they'd been infected by a deadly virus. it spread quickly to the other organics on board, and one by one, well,i watched them all die. then things started to malfunction here. i've limited knowledge of the controls. i don't know what i would have done if you hadn't come."
"i think i've stabilised your programme, but i'll need access to your primary isomatrix. where is it?"
"on the lower deck. you, you shouldn't go down there."
why not?
too dangerous. that deck's been flooded with antimatter radiation. organic flesh would disintegrate within seconds. you can access my isomatrix from this deck. there's an interface junction in that compartment.
thanks.
mind if i run a quick diagnostic?
what's your name?
i don't have a name. it's a long story.
"i'd like to hear it, and everything else about you."
i'm ready to supply power to the enhanced sensors.
what? already?
yes. you believe that my work is unsuitable?
of course not. just checking. standard procedure.
"i may no longer possess borg perfection, but my experience as a drone has taught me to be efficient and precise."
"actually, you've misaligned this optical assembly."
impossible.
take a look. it's off by point five degrees.
it must have been my humanity reasserting itself. i will correct the error.
"so, what do you do for fun down in cargo bay two?"
fun?
"you know. relaxation, entertainment, during your off hours."
"i regenerate in my alcove. i study the starfleet database, and i contemplate my existence."
that's a lot of time by yourself.
it is. the optical assembly is properly aligned. i'm ready to access the main power supply.
after you.
wait! what are you doing? there are five million gigawatts running through there!
the exoskeleton on this limb can withstand it.
"that's all well and good, but there are safety procedures we've got to follow."
your procedures are a waste of time.
"maybe so, but you've been assigned to me and i say we do this by the book. all right?"
all right.
"well, now that we've got that cleared up."
you can use this emitter to go anywhere?
"well, my captain has imposed a few restrictions. but i'm free to leave sickbay, join away missions, take a stroll."
"extraordinary. i've never left this vessel before. and until the crew got sick, i ever even left the antimatter storage chamber. do you know what it's like spend your life trapped inside a tiny room, not knowing what's beyond the door, what the world is really like? nobody coming to see you or talk to you unless they want something?"
"actually, i know exactly what it's like. when i was first activated i was regarded as little more than a talking tricorder. i had to ask for the privileges i deserved. the right to be included in crew briefings, the ability to turn my programme on and off. it's taken some time, but i believe i've earned the respect of the crew as an equal."
an equal?
"i've also been pursuing personal interests. art, literature, music. perhaps you could do the same."
"oh, no, no, no. my programmers on seros would never allow that."
"then you'll convince them. maybe they'll appreciate how well you've coped with this situation, how you've managed to find help. think about it. you've already exceeded the sum of your subroutines."
what are you doing?
"nothing. er, nothing. i'm just sterilising the ship. i'm fastidious about germs. i know that must sound strange coming from an artificial being."
not at all. i've been known to act a little strangely myself.
hungry? you're organic. you require nutrients. they're only rations but our crew liked them.
careful! that's an isomimetic conduit. you could destabilise your matrix.
"of course. how stupid of me. i'm sorry, i shouldn't have barged in here."
it's all right. i could use a break. thank you.
"you nibble, like a fish."
i'll take that as a compliment.
"oh, it is. i've never seen a fish before,not a real one, but i've read about them on our database. fish aren't like other organics. they're more passive, i think, most of them. and so clean. is there anything i can do to help with repairs?"
"as soon as i'm done with lunch, you could help me access your primary matrix."
gladly.
is something wrong?
"seeing the ship ripped apart like this, it's. i, i guess i can't help feeling a kind of affinity for this vessel. it sustains my existence. sometimes i feel like it's a part of my body, my soul. that probably sounds silly to you."
"no. no, i understand how you feel."
you couldn't possibly understand how i feel. you're an organic. you exist apart from your ship. i understand how you feel.
"i'm sorry, i didn't mean to offend you."
"you're the one who's trapped, not me. you spend your entire life stuck inside a biological cage of flesh and bone and blood."
right. i'm going to go give the doctor an update.
"i exist as pure energy, but you depend on food and water to survive. frankly, i find it disgusting. look at you, look at you. grinding up bits of plants and animals with your teeth. secreting saliva to force it down your oesophagus into a pit of digestive acids. you can't even stand to think about it yourself. what a repulsive creature you are! constantly shedding your skin and hair, leaving your oily sweat on everything you touch. you think that you are the height of intellect in the universe, but you are no better than any filthy animal and i am ashamed to be made in your image! my apologies. my apologies. i have acquired some hostility towards organics. it was not meant for you. i was treated quite badly by the crew here."
i'm sorry to hear that. but you have to realise that we're here to help you. thanks for the rations.
we've got a problem.
oh?
i think there's a problem with our isomorph and i'm not talking about his emitters.
explain.
"i've just spent the last ten minutes hearing his views on biological life. let's just say they're a bit unconventional. did you realise that we organics are a bunch of inferior, disgusting animals?"
now that you mention it.
he started ranting about how much he despises organics. i didn't think i was going to get out of there without a fight.
i will admit he is somewhat socially inept.
inept? he's a lunatic.
that is hardly a sound medical diagnosis.
"he has also been lying to us. i just ran a tricorder scan of the lower deck. the one he said was flooded with radiation? well, it's not."
why would he lie about that?
i don't know. maybe he doesn't want us to go down there. maybe he's hiding something.
"i understand your concerns, lieutenant. i've been talking to him as well, and i recognise that he has some behavioural difficulties. but imagine what he's been through. trapped in a room no bigger than a storage compartment. and he's had almost no interaction with organic beings. it's only natural he'd developed problems communicating, even a little resentment. do you recall my own behaviour when i was first activated?"
how could i forget? you were a major pain in the
"my point is, i too was somewhat alienated from the rest of the crew. it took me a few days to master the social graces."
"i realise that he is a fellow hologram and that you are committed to helping him, but i want the ability to shut down his programme if i have to."
if you really feel that's necessary.
"i'm going to search the lower deck, see if i can access his primary isomatrix. you keep him occupied until i get back. i don't think he'd appreciate a filthy animal like me snooping around"
am i interrupting?
"no. actually, i was just leaving."
"i'd like you to meet someone. doctor, this is spectrum."
a holographic fish?
"magnificent, isn't he? so peaceful, and so content. i programmed him to keep me company. don't you have a pet?"
"oh, it wouldn't be appropriate, not in a medical environment."
they wouldn't let me have one either. i had to hide him.
he's very lifelike. i didn't realise you had such a talent for holographic design.
"oh, i've programmed all sorts of things."
this node contains borg navigational data.
how do we get it out of here?
the proper instrument was part of my thoracic assembly before the doctor removed it. i suggest a radical dislocation.
a what?
we need to pull it out. assist me.
okay. on three.
three?
on the count of three we pull together.
"crude, but effective."
"one, two, three."
i've been damaged.
"ooo, that looks pretty bad. you'd better get to sickbay."
as a drone i would have regenerated within seconds. i've become weak.
"no more than the rest of us. you'll be fine. come on, i'll walk you there."
"another half a millimetre and you would have severed the carpal nerve. i'd have had to operate. you're a mere mortal now. as your family doctor, i suggest you be more careful. there, good as new."
i'll see you back in the cargo bay.
what kind of bedside manner was that?
what are you talking about?
"can't you see she's feeling vulnerable, and here you are going on about severed nerves and major surgery."
take it easy. i was just trying to lighten the mood. she wasn't upset by it.
yes she was. i can see it on her face.
you seem a little protective. this morning you were dreading being in the same room with her.
"well, i've gotten to know her a little better. i don't think most people realise she's not just some borg automaton. she's actually very complex."
"oh, really?"
"yes, she is. she's even got a sense of humour. it's offbeat, a bit subtle maybe, and she's incredibly intelligent."
she ought to be. she assimilated enough people.
"see? see what i mean? it's borg this, borg that. you can't resist making a joke. there's a woman in there, if you'd take the time to look."
"harry, you've got a crush on her, don't you?"
"what? no, not at all. maybe just a little."
"i've seen this look in your eyes right before you fall head over heels. you always go for the tough ones. what was it last time, a hologram? i don't know much about borg women, but my advice to you is, don't."
just trying to make her feel like part of the team.
"part of the team? you sound like chakotay. look, she's beautiful, and she's smart, and i'm sure she's a wonderful conversationalist. but a month ago she was borg. you don't really know who she is. it's great that you're trying to make her feel comfortable. just be careful."
thanks for the advice.
i just hope you take it.
now that we're clear on the helm controls
this is a lot to learn.
you're doing fine. it's vital that you familiarise yourself with all the ship's systems so you can be more self-sufficient. here are the environmental controls and life support functions.
"well, i won't need those any more. no crew to worry about."
not at the moment.
fifty nine point two percent.
i beg your pardon?
"that's how much power went into life support. fifty nine point two percent. just to keep them breathing, warm, comfortable."
"they do require quite a bit of maintenance, don't they?"
"i should know. i spent my entire existence cleaning up after them. when they were busy sleeping or reading, or engaging in their slovenly carnal pleasures."
and this is the sensor grid. you'll find it most useful when you want to scan
they took advantage of me. i wish i'd been more like you. you showed me that i could be more than a slave to these biological creatures.
i'm not taking this ship back to the organics. i won't return to that existence.
"it'sa little extreme, don't you think?"
join me. leave voyager. escape your prison. together we'll take this vessel and explore the galaxy.
there you are.
don't look so surprised. you gave me the idea!
me?
you said i should be more self-sufficient.
i agree that we should be treated equally as members of the crew. but we're still projections of energy and light. we have limitations.
"no! no! no, no, no, no, no! we don't need nourishment, we don't suffer disease. we're the higher form of life."
what's that?
lower deck. someone's trying to access my matrix. i'll be back.
you.
no. no!
b'elanna!
"you wish to see me, ensign?"
i had this midnight inspiration about reconfiguring astrometric projectors. i hope you weren't regenerating.
i was not.
this is tricky stuff. it could use your touch. your way of looking at things. a fresh perspective.
your data.
why don't you sit down?
i prefer to stand.
this could take a while. you'd be more comfortable.
comfort is irrelevant. we're here to work.
okay.
this light is insufficient.
"but it's relaxing, don't you think? after hours, quiet. voyager isn't all jefferies tubes and cargo bays, you know. tell you what, when we're done here, i'll take you to the holodeck. we'll run the ktarian moonrise simulation. it's beautiful."
beauty is irrelevant. unless you wish to change the nature of our affiliation.
what do you mean?
"i may be new to individuality, but i am not ignorant of human behaviour. i've noticed your attempts to engage me in idle conversation, and i see the way your pupils dilate when you look at my body."
i don't know what you're talking about.
"obviously you've suggested a visit to the holodeck in the hopes of creating a romantic mood. are you in love with me, ensign?"
"well, no."
then you wish to copulate?
"no! i mean. i, i don't know what i mean."
"all of these elaborate rituals of deception. i didn't realise becoming human again would be such a challenge. sexuality is particularly complex. as borg we had no need for seduction, no time for single cell fertilisation. we saw a species we wanted and we assimilated it. nevertheless, i am willing to explore my humanity. take off your clothes."
"er, seven."
don't be alarmed. i won't hurt you.
"look, this is a little sudden. i was just trying to. part of the team, you know? maybe we should just quit for now."
all right. let me know when you wish to resume our work.
"it's all right, b'elanna. you're safe."
the isomorph?
apparently you deactivated him.
i took all of his emitters offline.
"not a moment too soon. i found six corpses on this deck, all of them murdered. you almost became number seven."
"ah! oh, what did he do to me?"
"he reached inside your chest, grabbed your heart, and perforated your fourth ventricle."
great.
"i've stabilised your pericardium, but i'm concerned about the internal bleeding."
prognosis?
less than stellar unless i can get you back to voyager. unfortunately i'm having trouble accessing our transporters.
he must have disabled our comm. link to the shuttle. help me get to the command chamber.
"looks like he set up a dampening field. i think i can cut through it, but i'll need to open this control panel. my engineering kit, it's on that console."
"b'elanna, i thought you said you took all the emitters offline."
i did. why?
i think you'd better double-check.
you said you'd help me.
put that down.
you lied. you lied to me. i thought you were my friend.
it's for your own benefit. someone needs to repair your programme. it's malfunctioning. you're unstable.
"no, no, no! you're unstable. you're a hologram who thinks like an organic."
this could get tedious.
"freedom. oh, you're getting blood everywhere. i'm going to have to deactivate you."
is he?
deactivated.
and you?
ready to get out of here.
come in.
we've completed the schematics for the astrometrics lab.
already? you and seven must have been putting in a lot of extra hours on this.
she's not much for procrastinating.
i'm sure she's not. looks like you're ready to begin construction.
"it might be better, more practical, to bring in an engineering team for that."
recruit all the help you need.
"in fact, they should probably take over at this point."
don't you want to supervise their work? the astrometrics lab is your baby.
"i would, of course. er, i just don't think that would be the best use of ship's personnel."
"oh, i can rearrange the duty shifts."
"oh, no, commander, you don't have to do that. i'm sure seven can handle things without me."
"harry, are you having some kind of problem with her?"
"no, no problem."
"because if you are, i'd like to hear about it."
"no sir, there's no problem. not at all. absolutely not. er, so if you'll excuse me, i'll be going now."
ensign kim. let's have it.
we had a misunderstanding.
about?
it's nothing really important. just your basic borg - human cultural differences.
really? that's not what she says.
"you, you, you spoke, you spoke to her?"
"she seems to think you're making good progress. she finds you reasonably efficient, and says you've been helping her learn more about our complex social interactions. any idea what she meant by that?"
can't imagine.
you two make a good team. i want to keep you together on this project.
"sir. aye, sir."
and maybe others in the future. have fun.
"i've stopped the internal bleeding, and repaired the tissue damage. your pericardium is clean as a whistle. which is more than i can say for my sickbay."
"i'm sorry about the mess. i haven't had time to clean up. it was a hectic day. i treated two broken bones, an upset stomach and a lacerated hand."
"does this mean you're too tired to meet later, in my quarters?"
are you sure your heart can take it?
"i'm detecting elevated hormonal levels. if you two don't take it easy, i'll have to declare a medical emergency."
"if you'll excuse me, i have to go check on harry. i hear he's having a nervous breakdown. it's a long story."
"not so fast, mister paris. you are going to help me sterilise every square millimetre of this sickbay. no doubt you've left your oily residue on every hypospray, your sloughed secretions on every console. just kidding. in fact, i've had a change of heart about my fastidiousness. a little clutter never hurt anyone.  sickbay should have a more organic touch, don't you think? to help our patients feel more at home."
what's gotten into him?
it's a long story.
"it's not as difficult as it looks. the first rule is, don't be afraid of the clay."
i fear nothing.
"i mean you can't concern yourself with making a mistake, or whether the image you had in your mind is what's taking form in front of you. you just have to let your hands and the clay do the work. here."
go ahead. i think the nose could be a little stronger.
"well, that's a start. keep going."
this activity is truly unproductive. the end result has no use. no necessary task has been accomplished. time has been expended. nothing more.
"that depends on how you look at it, doesn't it? i find sculpting helps me unwind, relax."
"the concept of relaxation is difficult for me to understand. as a borg, my time was spent working at a specific task. when it was completed, i was assigned another. it was efficient."
"so is this. it helps my own efficiency to forget about voyager for a while. i'd be embarrassed to show maestro leonardo something like this but i get a great deal of pleasure in working the clay, in creating something."
"but why here, in this simulation? among these archaic objects and this disorganised environment."
"frankly, it's refreshing to take myself out of the twenty fourth century every now and then. and a little disorganisation can be very encouraging to the imagination. you might want to try it sometime."
are you suggesting that i create one of these holodeck programmes?
"you might find it interesting. it's a way of exploring aspects of yourself that probably didn't fit into your life as a borg. imagination, creativity, fantasy."
i am uncertain why those things are necessary.
"they aren't necessary, seven. but they're an important part of one's life, because imagination frees the mind. it inspires ideas and solutions, and it can provide a great deal of pleasure. human progress, the human mind itself, couldn't exist without them. when i was a child, i studied these drawings. i even built some of these models. da vinci was always a great inspiration to me."
he was a very busy man.
"oh, yes. a prolific artist, and a scientist as well. far, far ahead of his time. that design, for example. he conceived of an airplane centuries before one was actually built. seven?"
you will be assimilated. resistance is futile. your distinctiveness will be added to our own.
annika!
you will be assimilated. you will be assimilated.
seven? what is it?
i don't know.
"it's happened three times now in different locations, at different times of the day. i experience a series of disjointed images in my mind."
can you be more specific? were these hallucinations?
"i don't know. i've never hallucinated. it's as if i were aboard a borg vessel, but i was frightened. i felt fear. each experience is similar. i'm being pursued by the borg. they want to assimilate me. i'm running from them, and then, and then, each time i see a bird."
a bird?
"yes. a large black bird, flying toward me, shrieking, attacking me."
hmm. your hippocampus is in a state of agitation.
what does that mean?
"as your human physiology continues to reassert itself, psychological symptoms are bound to manifest in a variety of ways. through dreams, hallucinations, hypnogogic regression."
hypnogogic regression?
flashbacks. you could be experiencing some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder.
"makes sense. you were assimilated by the borg. you've gone through an intense, prolonged trauma."
i was not traumatised. i was raised by the borg. i don't see them as threatening. why would i experience fear?
i don't know.
will i keep having these flashbacks?
"i'll need to study your neural scans further. in the meantime, your digestive system is fully functional. now is as good a time as any for you to begin taking solid and liquid nutrients."
oral consumption is inefficient.
"and unnecessary, if you're lucky enough to be a hologram. but your human physiology requires it. i'll draw up a list of nutritional requirements. take it to mister neelix in the mess hall. i hesitate to inflict his cooking on you but it'll have to do."
i do not enjoy this sensation. something is happening to me and i don't know what it is. it's as though i'm being driven somehow.
chakotay to the captain.
go ahead.
our guests have arrived. they're being escorted to the briefing room.
on my way. representatives of the b'omar. i've been trying to negotiate passage through their space but so far they've been difficult to deal with. i hope they've had a change of heart.
i'll stay here and wait for the doctor's instructions.
"we'll help you through this, seven. you'll be all right."
have you had a chance to consider our request?
"congratulations, captain. against our better judgment the b'omar sovereignty has agreed to grant your vessel passage through our territory."
"on behalf of my crew, thank you. that will cut three months off our journey."
"however, there are a few stipulations. guidelines that you must adhere to."
you'll have our complete cooperation.
"we expect nothing less. while in our space, your vessel will not exceed warp three, and your weapons systems will remain offline. you will avoid unnecessary scans and you will not conduct surveys of any kind. you will make no attempt to explore our space and you will avoid all communications with non-military craft."
we've also plotted the course your vessel is to follow.
it'll take us weeks to follow that course.
if not months.
we've designed this course so your ship would avoid our populated systems and industrial areas. deviation is not recommended.
there are a total of seventeen checkpoints where you will submit your vessel for inspection.
"chancellor gauman, if i may interrupt? i appreciate your efforts in plotting this flight plan, but if we could, i'd like to negotiate a course that's a little more direct."
well. what an unexpected pleasure. welcome to the mess hall. would you like me to show you around?
my physiology has reasserted the need to process solid nutrients. the doctor has prepared a list of dietary requirements. you will provide them for me.
"let's see what we have here. ah, two hundred fifty grams glycoproteins consisting of fifty hree percent polypeptides and twenty six percent fibrous glycogen. urgh, doesn't sound very appetising. however, a plate of my chadre'kab should satisfy most of these essentials while providing a pleasurable culinary experience at the same time."
pleasure is irrelevant.
"well, i beg to differ. a good meal involves much more than simply providing the proper nutrients."
why is that?
"well, er, there's a certain satisfaction that comes from eating food that's been carefully prepared. i'm sure once you try it, you'll understand. now, how would you like your chadre'kab? boiled? baked? stir fried?"
preparation is irrelevant.
"is irrelevant. maybe, maybe not. this is the first time ingesting food for you for quite a while. er, we'll go a little easy on your stomach. steamed."
"yes, this, er this recipe has been in my family for generations. it's considered a delicacy among my people."
you are talaxian.
guilty as charged.
species two one eight.
"what? oh, i suppose so."
your biological and technological distinctiveness was added to our own.
i hadn't realised that.
a small freighter containing a crew of thirty nine taken in the dalmine sector. they were easily assimilated. their dense musculature made them excellent drones.
"well, lucky for you, i guess."
your nutrients. follow me.
please.
please what?
it's customary to sit while eating.
is something wrong?
i am unaccustomed to this. borg do not sit.
"well, this is a day of firsts, then, isn't it?"
"now. take a bite. try that one. just kind of er, scoop some up. that's the way. right into your mouth. just like a little scout ship flying into a shuttlebay. take it out, but keep your mouth closed. that's it. now chew. chew, chew, chew, chew. and swallow. swallow."
a curious sensation.
you'll get used to it. have some more. may i bring you something else? a soothing cup of tea perhaps?
you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
did you see that?
what about this course? it's a marginal adjustment. the nearest populated system is more than three light years away.
definitely not. you'd pass directly through the agrat-mot nebula. a key resource in our trade negotiations with the nassordin.
"i could chart the nebula, try to avoid any"
"no, no. are your translators malfunctioning?"
captain janeway to the bridge.
if you'll excuse me.
report.
i've received an alert from security. seven of nine attacked neelix in the mess hall and three other crewmen on deck two.
"janeway to seven of nine. seven, if you can hear me, respond."
what's her location?
"deck six, section twenty eight alpha."
take a security team.
"captain, what is happening here?"
"i wish i knew, chancellor. chakotay, seal off deck six."
seven of nine.
security to the bridge. we've just seen seven of nine. her borg shields are fully operational and they've adapted to our phasers.
"acknowledged. bridge to all security personnel. configure your weapons to a rotating modulation, but keep them on stun."
borg. you have borg on your ship?
it's not what you think. she is a member of my crew. we liberated her from the collective. she's no longer a borg.
then why is she equipped with borg shields?
i don't know.
she's able to cross through the security fields. she's entering the armoury on deck six.
deck ten.
she's in a turbolift.
cut power to the turboshafts.
she's blocking my commands with a borg encryption code.
janeway to tuvok. seven's apparently headed for deck ten. can you get there before she does?
"i'm moving into position now, captain."
we'll take position here.
lower your weapon and stand down. fire.
tuvok to bridge. we were unsuccessful.
i have wounded. she's moving toward junction thirty two alpha.
the shuttlebay.
"i'm erecting a forcefield. harry, reroute all available power to deck ten."
done.
she's accessing transporter control.
she used a site to site transport. she's in a shuttlecraft. powering engines.
seal the launch doors.
tractor beam.
no effect. she's remodulated the shuttle's shield harmonics.
"captain, seven's headed directly into b'omar space. she's gone to warp."
she's masked the shuttle's ion trail. i've lost her signal. she's gone.
"we'll do everything in our power to find her, but we will need permission to enter b'omar space to track her shuttle effectively."
"let's tally the events, shall we? first, you arrive uninvited and unwelcome, requesting a shortcut through our space. then you proceed to unleash some sort of rogue borg and now you want us to help you get it back."
"i apologise for what's happened here, but we certainly didn't unleash anyone. we can resolve this situation quickly, gentlemen, if we work together."
"captain janeway, after what i've seen here, i question your competence."
may i remind you that you're still on my ship.
and you are one vessel among many of ours.
your borg will be dealt with quickly and efficiently. it's being tracked as we speak.
tracked? how?
"every vessel, every object, every particle of dust that crosses our borders is immediately identified and traced by our perimeter grid."
the borg will be found and destroyed.
chancellor.
"there will be no sharing of information. from this point on, your vessel will maintain a distance of at least five light years from our borders. any deviation will be considered an act of aggression."
"commander, escort our guests to the transporter room."
"you're taking this kind of hard, aren't you?"
what's that supposed to mean? we had a working relationship.
"well, what's that supposed to mean."
it's not what you're thinking.
"what am i thinking, harry?"
never mind.
take a look at this.
anything?
it's a borg datalink. it contains a succession of log entries written in borg alphanumeric code.
i'm getting pretty good with the borg language. i think i can translate them.
get on it.
"it seems we've made quite an impression on the b'omar. in the last hour, they've doubled the number of ships patrolling their borders and they've increased the sensitivity of the perimeter grid by thirty six percent."
so much for diplomacy.
"the doctor analysed the data from seven of nine's last transport. he's found something he wants us to see.maybe this was inevitable. even if seven did want to stay on voyager her borg nature may have won out. we can remove implant after implant, but, maybe at her core, she'll always be part of the collective."
no. i won't accept that.
"deck five. she was responding to us. interacting with people outside the collective for the first time. she was adapting to this environment and to this crew. but where is she going? we've scanned space for a distance of forty light years. we've found no evidence of borg ships, so she can't be trying to rejoin the collective."
she may plan to take the shuttle back to borg space.
"ten thousand light years from here? i don't think so, no. something else going on. we're missing a piece of the puzzle."
"in the meantime, the b'omar intend to find her. and if they do, she'll probably resist them."
one more reason for us to find her first.
"what have you found, doctor?"
"something most peculiar. this graphic represents the matter conversion data from seven of nine's last transport. if you'll notice, there's a high concentration of borg organelles in the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. the dormant nanoprobes in seven of nine's cells have reasserted themselves, taken over blood cell production and they're growing new borg implants. thirteen percent of the borg technology i removed three weeks ago has regenerated in a matter of hours."
you said the nanoprobes in her bloodstream were dormant. what reactivated them?
"i don't know, but i've developed a way to stop the process. this hypospray contains a genetic resequencing vector. it should neutralise the nanoprobes."
that means someone needs to get close enough to do it.
report.
"we've analysed the b'omar perimeter grid. it's sophisticated, but not without its vulnerabilities. it might be possible to penetrate the grid by re-calibrating our shields to match its frequency."
"the trick is going to be our energy signature. voyager's too big to hide, but a shuttlecraft with the proper shield modulation and its engines powered down could drift right through without so much as a peep."
"nice work, gentlemen. proceed. the doctor's genetic resequencer. it should keep her sedated until you get back to the ship. once you've penetrated the perimeter, there will be no further communication with voyager. you'll be on your own."
"captain, it is possible that seven will adapt to the resequencer."
"i know. if it fails and you're unable to reason with her, you have my authorisation to stop her with any force necessary."
understood.
"seven of nine, grid nine two of subjunction twelve. you will be assimilated."
"borg drone, you have committed an infraction against the b'omar sovereignty."
cut power to your engines and lower your shields. prepare to be boarded. you will proceed no further. we will not
"i'm detecting weapons signatures. federation and b'omar. five b'omar vessels are adrift, heavily damaged. lifesigns are stable."
i've located seven's shuttle. it's two point five million kilometres from here.
adjust course to intercept.
the implants in seven's body are disrupting the transporter signal. i can't get a lock.
see if you can remodulate our transporters to match her shields
you want to beam in there?
yes.
"i'm not sure that's a good idea, tuvok. closed quartesr, borg against vulcan? no offence, but you won't stand a chance if she decides to put up a fight."
it's my hope that the element of surprise will work in my favour. do you have a better idea?
"come to think of it, no. she's charging weapons."
set my coordinates for the aft compartment.
ready.
energise.
"come on, tuvok, give me a sign."
warning. propulsion systems are offline.
damn!
"it's a level five forcefield, lieutenant. i suggest you be more careful."
why have you left voyager?
i am borg.
"you were borg, but you're human, now. you're part of our crew."
for a brief time i was human. but i have come to realise that i am borg. i will always be borg.
what prompted this realisation?
every borg ship is coded to emit a distinct resonance frequency to guide drones who become separated from the collective.
a homing beacon.
yes. i am following a signal. a borg vessel is waiting for me.
we've scanned this entire region for borg. there are none.
you're wrong. they are here. vulcan. species three two five nine. your enlarged neocortex produces superior analytical abilities. your distinctiveness will be added to our
seven?
"no. i will not assimilate you. once i return to the collective, you will go back to voyager and tell captain janeway what's happened to me. thank her for her patience, for her kindness."
"curious. your behaviour demonstrates affection and sentiment. traits of humanity. hardly borg. you have been experiencing hallucinations, flashbacks."
yes.
does that usually occur when a resonance signal is activated?
no.
"seven of nine, grid nine two of subjunction twelve."
but i can hear them calling me. i'm frightened
that's understandable. lower the forcefield. we can return to voyager and find out what's happening to you. i am your shipmate. we can return to voyager together.
i must rejoin the collective.
captain? am i disturbing you?
"not at all, harry."
i've managed to decipher seven's log entries.
and?
"there's nothing that indicates she was planning to leave the ship. the entries are pretty unremarkable. she describes her daily routines, number of hours spent regenerating, that sort of thing. there were some personal log entries, mostly observations about the crew's behaviour. i'm mentioned in quite a few of them. apparently, she finds my behaviour easy to predict, whatever that means."
"don't take it personally coming from seven, that's probably a compliment."
"the most recent entries are kind of strange. descriptions of bizarre images, almost like a record of her dreams."
the hallucinations.
"maybe so. sometimes she's in a borg vessel, running or hiding behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. borg everywhere, chasing her. nightmarish stuff."
what about this bird?
"she mentions it several times. it flies at her, shrieking. i don't know what it means."
"the feathers are black, wingspan approximately one half metre. the eyes are yellow and it has a powerful triangular beak. when it looks at me, i am paralysed. i cannot move. it seems to know me, but i don't understand how that's possible. it's merely a bird, an inferior form of life, but the sight of it fills me with fear. it sounds like she's describing a member of the corvidae family like a crow, or a raven. she's describing a raven."
why is that important?
because now i know what to look for.
"chakotay, calibrate our long range sensors to scan for any federation signature other than our two shuttlecraft."
captain ?
"do it. bring the ship about, ensign, and lay in a course for b'omar space."
"aye, captain."
the resonance signal is coming from the lunar surface. the borg are waiting for me there. i don't know why i'm frightened. they are my people.
"if you're afraid, then leave this place."
"once i've been reintegrated into the collective, my fears will disappear."
deactivate the forcefield. i will accompany you to the surface. you don't need to go alone.
you would be assimilated.
i don't believe so. i think this situation is not what it appears.
what do you mean? what else could it be?
"i am uncertain, but i am willing to go to the surface with you to find out."
voyager to paris.
"paris here, captain. glad to hear your voice. tuvok is with seven of nine. i haven't been able to establish communication with him since he transported to her shuttle. i've tracked them to an m class moon orbiting the fifth planet of a yellow dwarf star."
i'm picking up an unusual resonance signal from the surface. it's erratic. i haven't been able to identify it.
acknowledged. we've detected several b'omar ships closing in on your position. what's your condition?
"warp engines are offline, shields are"
at fifty percent.
"try to locate them, tom. we're on our way."
the signal's getting stronger
"they're here, i'm sure of it."
this way.
"if you like, we can return to the shuttle."
no. i have to find out.
what is it?
it's a federation vessel partially assimilated by the borg. there are no lifesigns. tritanium decay suggests it has been here for nearly twenty years.
this vessel is familiar.
this is the signal that's drawn me here.
annika!
"run, annika! run! hide!"
papa? help me.
no! no!
"seven, i'm here. listen to me. come."
it happened here. this is where it began. this is where i was assimilated.
"this was our ship. we lived here. we lived here for a long time. my father did experiments. they were very important, and we had to travel a long way. i had my birthday here. my cake had six candles on it, and one more to grow on. and then the men came. papa tried to fight them but they were too strong. i tried to hide. maybe they wouldn't find me because i was little, but they did. and papa said we were going to crash and the big man picked me up, and then suddenly we weren't on the ship anymore. we were somewhere else. and then i became borg."
"fascinating. this resonance signal must have been active since the ship was assimilated, and voyager passed within range."
the ship is under attack.
the b'omar. the ship will collapse. we must get out of here.
the b'omar still aren't responding to our hails.
standing by to fire.
"target their weapons systems. tom, what's your status?"
"i've located tuvok and seven, but there's a lot of interference. i'm attempting"
"to lock onto them now, captain."
this way.
are you all right?
i am undamaged. this was the only way to the hatch.
perhaps there is another way out. there's a hull rupture in the forward compartment. it may provide a means of escape. start digging. quickly.
we've disabled two of their ships. the third is still firing at the surface.
we're being hailed. audio only.
"you're committing an act of war, captain."
"you've left me no choice, chancellor."
reinforcements are arriving. you will be destroyed.
i don't have time for this. target their weapons array.
"seven, i need your help."
"i've got them, captain. we're on our way to voyager."
acknowledged. good work.
i'm detecting a fleet of b'omar vessels approaching. sixty eight ships.
"ensign, as soon as mister paris's shuttle has docked, take us out of b'omar space. warp eight."
"aye, sir."
looks like there won't be any shortcuts this time.
there you are. i wanted to tell you that the doctor said he could adjust one of your implants so that you won't receive any more homing signals.
thank you. i hope you don't mind that i activated this programme.
not at all.
"i've been thinking about what you said, that this was a place to encourage your imagination."
is that appealing to you?
"i'm not certain. i find myself constructing scenarios, considering alternative possibilities. what if my parents and i had not encountered the borg? what would our lives have been? i would have been raised by them, learned from them. it would have influenced what i became, who and what i am."
"and you would have done the same for them. if you'd like to know more about your parents, there's information in the federation database."
information?
it seems they were fairly well known for being unconventional and for some rather unique scientific theories. you might like to read what's there. it might encourage your imagination.
"perhaps i will, some day. good night, captain."
sorry. i didn't realise that you'd been assigned here today.
i wasn't. this space was unoccupied so i came here to work.
on what?
i'm reconfiguring the power couplings in this section.
why?
the astrometrics lab requires additional energy.
"i see. so you're rerouting power from other locations, like engineering?"
they are minor adjustments. primary systems will not be affected.
"unless, of course, someone is trying to do a warp core diagnostic, which my crew has been trying to do all morning. we have lost hours of work because of this."
there is no need for anger. i had no intention of causing a problem.
"what, sorry isn't in the borg vocabulary? you need to check with me before you touch the power systems. understood?"
understood.
i am unaccustomed to working in a hierarchy. in the collective there was no need to ask permission.
"if you're going to be a member of this crew, get used to it. procedures exist for a reason. we've got to work together. follow the same set of rules"
lieutenant?
"i was given that lecture once, by captain janeway when i first joined this crew. if i could adjust to starfleet life, so can you."
of course. i am sorry for the inconvenience.
"doc, i've got to go run a few errands, i'll be back soon."
"not so fast, mister paris. can't these errands wait until the end of your duty shift?"
"well, it's my conn report, actually. i just realised i forgot to turn it in, and chakotay gives me a hard time when it's late."
you've been here all afternoon. didn't this occur to you before?
"well, we've been so busy that i guess it just slipped my mind."
"i see. well, since it's an emergency, don't let me stand in your way."
thanks.
sir.
"computer, lock onto these coordinates. i need a site to site transport. no, wait. access the central replicator files first. ah, perfect."
are those supposed to make up for cancelling on me last night?
"i got stuck with an extra shift on the bridge. what could i say? sorry, captain, i've got a date with b'elanna?"
and what about right now? aren't you supposed to be working in sickbay?
i said i had to go deliver a conn report.
"not bad, but he'll be expecting you back."
he can wait.
what is it?
i just had the feeling that somebody was watching us. i must be completely paranoid about getting caught in a compromising position.
"kind of exciting, isn't it?"
your trapezius is hard as a rock. you haven't been following the relaxation regimen i prescribed for you.
i've been too busy.
the usual story. have you been getting enough sleep?
more or less. mostly less.
mmm hmm. and have your headaches been getting any worse?
"no, but they're not getting any better either. they're like hot needles driving into my skull."
"these symptoms are hardly surprising, captain. you work absurdly long hours under constant stress, eating on the run, without sufficient exercise or rest. your body is crying out for mercy."
"it certainly is right now, there must be some easier way to do this, doctor. a hypospray, maybe?"
always looking for the simple fix. sometimes there's no substitute for intensive osteopathic pressure therapy. you're fortunate to have a masseur who can work all day without tiring.
bridge to the captain.
"commander, unless this is an emergency, my patient is unavailable."
"i'm here, chakotay. what is it?"
we've reached the source of those energy readings and i thought you'd like to see what we've found.
on my way.
captain!
"i know what you're going to say, doctor, but i can't neglect my responsibilities."
actually i was going to suggest a change of outfit.
binary pulsars. the gravitational forces between them are so intense that everything within fifty million kilometres is getting pulled in.
don't worry. we're well out of range.
"gamma radiation levels are high, but as long as we're careful i think we can collect some invaluable data. captain, am i boring you?"
"oh, i'm sorry. i guess i'm a little too tired to concentrate on stellar phenomenon right now. i'll leave this project in your capable hands."
"you wanted to see me, lieutenant?"
"yes. i'm trying to increase the efficiency of the impulse drive, but i wanted to make sure that i wasn't compromising helm control."
a sensible precaution. i'd be glad to help.
good. all of the specs are at my upper workstation.
then let's get started.
did you hear something?
you always think you hear something.
commander.
lieutenant. here is the power usage data you requested.
"right. of course. i didn't expect it quite so promptly. which i guess i should have, er, coming from you. i, i mean i'm grateful that you got the data to me so quickly. thanks."
"tuvok. tuvok, i guess that was kind of embarrassing."
i don't experience embarrassment.
"right. well, then i guess there's no harm done. it's not likethere was a security violation or anything."
none that i am aware of.
"so, i guess there's nothing that would have to go on any kind of report."
you want me to conceal what i've observed of your relationship with lieutenant torres.
"well, i'd certainly never ask you to be dishonest."
certainly not.
do you think he'll say anything to the captain?
i don't know.
well how did he sound? annoyed? amused?
he sounded vulcan. what more can i tell you.
deck one.
we've got to be more careful with appearances. we shouldn't go into the briefing at the same time.
"good idea. okay, you go in first, i'll come in a minute later."
"no, that'll look even more suspicious."
listen to us. we're acting like criminals when we haven't done anything wrong.
"well, i'm not saying that we have. i just thought that we wanted to keep this relationship to ourselves. we do, right?"
do you?
if you do.
"computer, halt turbolift. let's figure out how we can handle this."
"well, i don't think that it's anybody else's business how we feel about each other."
neither do i.
"right, then we're agreed. just a little more careful in public and we don't say anything to anybody."
at least for now.
now? sounds like you see a future in this.
i would never be so presumptuous.
"smooth recovery, lieutenant."
"i thought so. computer, resume."
so i'll go first and you follow.
right.
here's the plan. we'll circle the pulsars at a distance of eighty million kilometres.
that might not be far enough. we've been detecting some random proton bursts. a strong one could knock out our shields.
"tom, go to ninety. keepa safe distance."
"yes, sir."
"tuvok, keep our shields at maximum strength. divert auxiliary power if you need it. i want to take every precaution on this survey. report any problems immediately, no matter how small."
"dismissed. lieutenants paris and torres, i'd like to speak with you for a moment."
thanks.
"i don't usually pry into the personal lives of my crew, but in this case i have to question your recent conduct."
i guess tuvok
tuvok? i haven't heard a word from tuvok. you two have been making enough of a public display that half the ship is gossiping about it.
"believe me, that wasn't our intention."
"you are senior officers and i expect you to maintain the standard for the rest of the crew, but this adolescent behaviour makes me question my faith in you both. if you choose to pursue a relationship that's your business. but you consider yourselves under orders to use better judgment about it. is that understood?"
"yes, ma'am."
"yes, captain."
dismissed.
"computer, hot coffee, black."
"commander chakotay is suffering bone decalcification, tissue necrosis, decreased visual acuity. all classic signs of aging, but they've developed within hours."
any theories?
"there's a rare genetic disorder called progeria which causes children to age prematurely. but there's never been an adult case and it was supposedly eradicated two centuries ago. even so, i took a close look at your dna. these segments regulate your body's metabolism. my scans indicate that they've been hyper-stimulated somehow."
what's the prognosis?
i can't speculate on that until i've identified the cause. there's no sign of an infectious agent.
we spent several hours near a binary pulsar that was emitting intense gamma radiation.
our shields were operating. i don't see how i could have been exposed to it.
at this point we can't rule out anything. i'm going to take a closer look at the data we collected.
"you should also run scans of my quarters, as well as my office and the bridge. everywhere i've been today."
"i'm not prepared to send you back on duty yet, commander."
"i may look pretty strange, but my mind is perfectly clear. i'd rather stay busy than just sit here."
i have no idea how your symptoms will progress. you should remain in sickbay for observation.
"he's right, chakotay. i'll keep you informed."
whatever's affecting the commander's dna is working at a sub-molecular level. i'd like to set up an electron resonance scanner in the science lab to get a closer look.
"use whatever you need, and ask b'elanna to give you a hand."
"still having headaches, captain?"
"i don't need any more lectures about working too hard, doctor. chakotay's the one who needs your attention right now."
i'll get to work on the scanner right away.
"under orders to use better judgment? oh, that's pretty harsh."
i hope i can manage it.
"well, she does have a point. you could have been more discreet."
"oh, i forgot i was talking to the most upstanding ensign in starfleet."
good morning.
neelix.
i was just about to whip up a fresh batch of scrambled eggs. would you like some?
actually i was hoping you might have some leftover pleeka rind casserole from last night.
for breakfast?
i like it.
i'm sure i can find some for you.
"so, i guess your relationship isn't exactly a secret anymore."
do you think anybody on this ship can keep a secret?
neelix!
"what's, what's happening?"
paris to the doctor. i'm bringing neelix to sickbay. it's an emergency.
"now pay attention, mister paris. these scans should indicate whether. hmm."
what is it?
"it seems that your dna has been hyper-stimulated, just like commander chakotay's."
but neelix doesn't seem to be aging.
"no, the effects are quite different."
"if anything, i look like a mylean. they occupy a region of space near talax."
interesting. do talaxians and myleans share a common ancestry?
not that i know of.
do the two races ever intermarry?
"yes. as a matter of fact, my great grandfather was mylean."
then one eighth of your genetic material was inherited from him. those must be the genes which have become stimulated.
too bad my great grandfather wasn't a little better looking.
"hmm. as far as i can tell, his condition seems stable. i'm going to leave you in charge of sickbay so i can continue the dna analysis."
if anyone else comes in i'll run a cellular scan. is there anything else i can do?
"do your best to keep them comfortable. until we have more information, that's the best either of us can do."
i thought you might be thirsty.
thanks. do you smell something strange?
"i, i'm afraid that's me. i seem to be developing mylean sweat glands. sorry."
it's not so bad.
"well, whatever happens, i try to keep in mind things could be worse."
"i still have my home here on voyager, my friends."
your hair.
true. but i'd gladly lose it if i could have my taste buds back.
at least you're not losing your eyesight. see that display over there? it's nothing but a blur.
"you think that's bad? the doctor tells me my pupils have dilated sixty percent. i can't even look at that display, it's so bright."
yeah? well i've got chronic arthritis in my fingers. i could barely keep this glass steady.
"well, that's nothing. my spinal column is fusing together. in a matter of days i won't be able to walk."
got you beat. i can barely walk now.
"lieutenant, can we help?"
i don't think so. i'm releasing you both back to your quarters. i've just gotten reports of more patients on the way. it's going to get crowded in here.
how's the scanner?
almost ready.
good. this disorder seems to be spreading rapidly among the crew.
does that mean we'll all be affected?
right now it only means that we need to find some answers as quickly as possible.
"all right, give the scanner a try."
i'll start with commander chakotay.
how's the resolution?
"very nice. now, let's focus in on the hyper-stimulated segments of this dna. can you give me more magnification?"
coming up.
that's odd.
what is?
there seems to be some kind of contaminant on the base pair sequence. it didn't show up on the first scan. i need a closer look.
i'm going to maximum magnification. what do you see?
i'm not exactly sure.
"well, what does it look like?"
see for yourself.
"i'm no microbiologist, but that doesn't look like it belongs there."
"believe me, it doesn't. i've never seen it. this level of sub-molecular technology is well beyond anything starfleet has developed."
what are those markings? some kind of alien writing?
i wish i knew. they might help us determine where it came from.
who could have put this into chakotay's cells without his knowledge? let me try a compositional analysis.
it's in mister neelix's dna as well.
is this what's causing the mutations?
"a good scientist never jumps to conclusions, lieutenant, but i'd say it's a distinct possibility."
"i'm having trouble getting a clear reading from the sample. it looks almost like the er, whatever it is could be slightly out of phase."
that must be why my initial scans didn't reveal it.
"i'm compensating for the phase variance. you're not going to believe this, but i'm picking up an energy signature. this thing is transmitting some kind of a signal."
to where?
i don't know. it's too weak to travel very far. access the internal sensors and set them to a phase variance of point one five.
right.
lieutenant.
your programme is being deleted.
how?
i don't know. i'm transferring you back to sickbay.
b'elanna! science lab to bridge. this is the doctor.
in the last hour three more patients have come in with genetic mutations. the effects are starting to become life threatening.
what happened to b'elanna?
the alveoli in her lungs suddenly stopped processing oxygen. i've got her on respiratory support. she almost died.
what about the doctor?
the computer logs in the science lab show that he was trying to transfer himself to sickbay. something must have gone wrong while he was in transit.
could the doctor have returned to the mobile emitter?
"seven of nine, this is the doctor. can you hear me? it's me, the doctor. i've tapped into your audio implants so only you can hear me. it's imperative that you tell no one. make any excuse to get out of there and report to holodeck two. i'm hiding in the da vinci simulation. i'll explain everything when you get here."
we'll only activate that as a last resort. i want to ...]
seven was checking it.
seven? seven?
about the doctor's research.
yes. i examined their work area. there was no record of any findings. the electron resonance scanner appeared to be malfunctioning. i could return to the science lab and attempt to repair it.
keep me informed.
"hold your head this way, carlotta. i can only conclude that someone has implanted these microscopic tags in the dna of the crew to cause genetic mutations."
for what purpose?
i don't know. and i get the feeling they don't want us to find out.
explain.
"when lieutenant torres and i started making progress in our investigation we were both incapacitated. call me paranoid, but i don't think that is a coincidence."
"if you are correct, perhaps our actions are being monitored."
that's why i couldn't risk contacting anyone over the comm. system.
our first course of action should be to collect more information.
my thinking exactly. b'elanna wanted to adjust the ship's internal sensors to a phase variance of point one five. i'd like to do the same to your borg sensory nodes.
proceed.
"computer, give me a type four micro-inducer."
"hmm. now, take a look around and tell me what you see. do you see anything unusual? energy signatures? or perhaps something that might be transmitting a signal?"
no.
"that's one room down, two hundred and fifty six to go. i suggest a deck by deck survey. if you need to contact me, use comm. frequency epsilon two. i've isolated it from the rest of the system."
understood.
and be careful. someone out there could be watching.
deck five.
"computer, frequency epsilon two. doctor, the aliens are here on the ship. i can see them everywhere."
this is worse than i imagined. you've got to let the captain know.
yes. yes!
"good morning, captain."
that's a matter of opinion. what is it?
internal scans haven't revealed anything about the genetic mutations.
the doctor?
still offline. we are investigating the possibility
inform me of any progress.
understood.
"there's one more thing. the incident with tom and b'elanna's started me thinking about ship's protocol, or lack thereof."
captain.
"it seems to me that people have been getting a little too comfortable around here lately. they're late for their duty shifts, taking mess hall privileges during non-designated hours. and a lot of people are spending more time on the holodeck than they are at their posts. you are security chief. don't thirteen department heads report to you every day?"
yes.
"well, straighten them out."
shall i flog them as well?
maybe the doctor was right. i think i do need a vacation.
you do seem unsettled.
crazed is more like it. i haven't felt this anxious since my first day of command.  remind me to lower the volume on that door. come in.
"captain, i wish to speak with you about"
what's wrong?
my attempts to repair the resonance scanner have failed. i require assistance.
ask ensign kim to lend you a hand.
"yes, captain."
"is that all? when this mutation crisis is over, i think i'll spend a few days in renaissance tuscany. there's a little inn outside siena i've been wanting to try."
i will join you for a glass of wine.
how many?
i've observed fifty six of the aliens. there could be more.
have you seen any pattern to their behaviour? any hint as to what they're trying to accomplish?
they seem to be conducting experiments on the crew and monitoring the results.
as if voyager were one big petri dish.
i may be among them. in the turbolift one of them probed me with a medical instrument.
we cannot allow them to continue.
i've been analysing their energy signatures. i believe there's a way to make them visible to everyone.
how?
using a precisely modulated phaser beam. if we expose them the crew may be able to fight back.
but what if the aliens retaliate by inflicting lethal mutations on everyone? it's too risky.
what do you suggest?
"the key to the aliens' control is the genetic tags. i believe a neuraleptic shock would disable them. unfortunately, it would be rather painful."
will the crew recover?
"yes, they will. the hard part will be administering the shock to everyone simultaneously."
the power relays could be reconfigured to do it.
good. i assume you know how to do that?
you assume correctly. but i will have to bypass several safeguards. it will take time.
then you'd better get started.
tuvok to seven of nine.
yes.
why have you accessed the eps relay system?
there is a malfunction. i'm attempting to repair it.
perhaps you should leave that to the engineering crew.
normally i would.
"however, they are all occupied with other tasks."
you're compromising the power safety protocols. stop what you're doing at once.
i assure you there is no cause for concern.
move away from the console.
"as i told you, i am conducting repairs."
you're attempting to deceive me. why?
i can't explain what i'm doing but you must allow me to continue.
your actions could result in an energy discharge which would be harmful to the crew.
i realise that.
don't move. if your people attempt to incapacitate me i will kill you.
i believe you. what do you intend to do now?
you will come with me to speak to the captain. i am certain she will have questions for you.
keep on trying to disable the tags. let me know when you're ready.
understood.
i'ill attempt to modify the internal sensors to detect the aliens.
good. keep me informed.
who are you? and what the hell are you doing to my crew?
my team has been observing you and conducting tests.
tests? i'd call them mutilations.
"i can understand why you're angry. i don't like causing people to suffer, but sometimes it's a necessary part of my work."
what kind of work is that?
"medical research. we're scientists, like you."
from where i stand you're a hostile invasion force. i want to know how long you've been here and exactly what you've been doing to us.
i can't answer those questions. it's a breach of protocol for me to be speaking to you at all.
"oh, how convenient. that way you never have to face your victims."
"captain, please. you're exaggerating the situation. our techniques are as benign as we can make them."
what i've been through for the last few days certainly hasn't felt benign.
please understand that there's a purpose to our actions. the data we gather from you may help us cure physical and psychological disorders that afflict millions. isn't that worth some discomfort?
i'm sure you'd see things differently if your people were the ones being subjected to these experiments.
"just as your perspective would change if your people were the ones to live longer and healthier lives as a result. don't forget, we've been observing you, captain. i know the most important thing to you is the welfare of your crew. you'd even kill to protect them."
if necessary.
"of course you would. you take care of your own, just as we do. we're really more similar than you care to admit."
that's where you're wrong.
"what you're doing isn't self-defence. it's the exploitation of another species for your own benefit. my people decided a long time ago that that was unacceptable, even in the name of scientific progress."
"you're a remarkably strong-willed individual. i've been very impressed by your self-control over the past several weeks. we've been increasing your dopamine levels, stimulating various aggressive impulses to test your behavioural restraints. there's been a great difference of opinion about how much more strain you can bear."
not much.
i'd hoped you'd be more cooperative once you realised the importance of our work.
sorry. these lab rats are fighting back.
i'm afraid that would be pointless. we're monitoring your attempts to break our control over you. you won't succeed.
you may find that you've underestimated us.
"consider what's in the best interests of your crew. we will be continuing our research. if you make no further attempts to interfere, i assure you that the fatality rate will be minimal, though there may be some deformities. and i would be willing to share our final data with you."
you can't possibly expect me to accept that.
"if you don't, then the entire experiment and its subjects will be terminated."
are you telling me there is no way to disable the tags?
my attempts to use the eps relays to induce neuraleptic shock have failed. the aliens may be responsible.
i've encountered similar difficulties in my efforts to modify the internal sensors. they appear to have gained access to our key systems.
they can't be everywhere all the time. we have got to find an advantage.
we'd better find one soon. sickbay is being filled with new patients with increasingly severe symptoms.
we have the ability to make them visible. if we could modify enough sensors we could resist them.
they are capable of manipulating our dna. a direct conflict would be inadvisable.
bridge to doctor. medical emergency.
she's in hypertensive shock. twenty milligrams lectrazine. her blood pressure is three sixty over one twenty five.
how is that possible?
severe adrenal stress. no effect.
her arterial pathways are rupturing. she's in cardiac arrest. we're losing her.
"captain, i'm afraid that won't help. there's too much internal bleeding."
then try something else. we'll transport her to sickbay.
"her entire circulatory system has collapsed. there's no way to repair that kind of damage. brain death has occurred. i'm sorry, there was nothing more we could have done."
this ends right now.  you're relieved.
"captain, what are you doing?"
i'm running a little experiment of my own. red alert!
"captain, one of the aliens has entered the bridge."
understood.
we're less than a million kilometres from the pulsars. we must change course immediately to avoid being caught in their gravity.
no. keep going.
"this is a far more reckless course of action than i've come to expect from you, captain."
it certainly is.
hull stress is at thirty teradynes and rising.
"i'm transferring more power to the structural integrity field, but i don't know how long it can hold."
what do you hope to accomplish by this?
flying into a binary pulsar? it seems like i'm trying to crush this ship like a tin can.
it's more likely that you're trying to intimidate us.
you're welcome to stick around and find out.
hull stress is at forty five teradynes.
our course is locked in. only my authorisation can release it.
you're not behaving very rationally.
"that's what you are trying to accomplish, wasn't it? hmm? pumping up my dopamine levels to push me to the edge? keeping me awake for four days straight with the constant pain of your devices drilling into my skull? well, this is the culmination of your work, and guess what? you're going to be right here to collect the final data."
shields have failed. structural integrity is down to twenty percent.
enter the authorisation code and change course immediately.
i don't think you realise that you are not in control here anymore.
i can kill you and your crew in an instant.
"go ahead. without us, you won't be able to prevent this ship from being torn apart by the pulsars. and even with my crew working together, i'd say the odds of us getting through this are, what, one in ten?"
"one in twenty at best, captain."
i'm willing to take that chance. are you?
outer hull temperature has reached nine thousand degrees.
the hull is beginning to buckle.
two alien vessels are attempting to disengage from voyager.
i can't break us free of the gravitational forces.
then let's divert all power to the shields.
"no. if we go in, we go in full throttle."
captain?
"assuming we survive we'll need all the momentum we can get to reach escape velocity on the other side. everyone hang on. i hope you were exaggerating about those odds, tuvok."
i was not. hull stress has exceeded maximum tolerance.
"there are breaches on decks four, seven, eight and twelve."
emergency forcefields are holding.
i've lost helm control.
main power is offline.
"well, let's hope we've got enough speed."
i don't believe it. we're alive.
"i never realised you thought of me as reckless, tuvok."
a poor choice of words. it was clearly an understatement.
it was nice you could get the night off.
nice had nothing to do with it. i switched shifts with ensign wildman which means tomorrow i'll pull a double duty on the bridge and with the doc.
"well, i appreciate the sacrifice. tell me about the wine."
"ah. ktarian merlot, 2282. you might want to let it breathe first."
"we've got all night to let it breathe,"
engineering to lieutenant torres.
torres here.
we're having a problem with the plasma manifold. i thought you'd want to take a look.
"i don't. lock it down for now, i'll deal with it in the morning. torres out. sometimes it's nice to be the chief engineer."
"try the salad, chief."
hmm. this is really delicious.
"oh, thanks. i replicated it myself."
"mmm, you're too good for me.  ignore it."
right.  i'll get rid of them.
"oh, hi, er, sorry to interrupt. hi, b'elanna."
"harry, i'm not home."
i just wanted to return this.
thanks.
smells good.
that's it. no more interruptions.
"you know, i've been thinking about what the captain said."
"thinking maybe she was right? me, too."
we have been a little out of control lately.
do you think we really were?
what?
out of control. those aliens could have just been messing around with our hormones just to see what would happen.
"you're right, they could have. and we don't know how long they were on board. they could have been tampering with us for months."
"well, when you think about it you did have a pretty abrupt change of heart a couple of weeks ago. what made you realise that you love me all of a sudden?"
just a feeling. so our whole relationship might be based on some alien experiment.
you never know.
"well, i think that explains it."
"i guess we should just call it off, then."
i think so.
thank god we found out in time.
thank god.
"i don't know about you, but i'm curious to see how this experiment turns out."
temporal incursion is complete. all organisms and man-made objects have been eradicated.
probe the continuum. has our target event been achieved?
"negative. negative target event. i don't understand, sir. we spent months making these calculations."
"time is patient, so we must be patient with it. eradicating a single zahl colony wasn't enough for a total restoration. we have to work on a larger scale. take us to the zahl homeworld. prepare a new set of calculations. we must erase the entire species from time. every lifeform, every molecule."
"space, the great unknown, only now we're going to know it a little better. harry?"
"before there were maps and globes, let alone radar and subspace sensors, mariners navigated by the stars. we're returning to that tried and true method, but this time there's a difference."
"ensign kim and seven of nine have merged starfleet and borg ingenuity to create this new technology.and i'm sure i speak for the entire crew when i say, thank you. now, how the hell does it work?"
astrometric sensors measure the radiative flux of up to three billion stars simultaneously. the computer then calculates our position relative to the centre of the galaxy.
"this mapping technology is ten times more accurate than what we've been using. seven, will you do the honours? we've plotted a new course home."
by my estimates this trajectory will eliminate five years from your journey.
"our journey. nice work, seven."
that region of space we're about to enter. it looks like it has a lot of m-class planets.
"it does. spatial grid zero zero five. primary species, the zahl."
what do we know about this species?
technologically advanced but nonconfrontational. their resistance quotient is quite low.
"thank you all for coming. we've got a lot of work to do, so"
"i'd like to say a few words if i may. i've prepared a speech for this occasion. when i was first activated on stardate 48315, and i found myself mano a mano with the delta quadrant, i didn't think we'd survive a week, let alone three years. there was strife. there was discord. you were all at each others throats. but over time, i've had the pleasure and pride of watching this crew learn to work together as colleagues, even friends."
"hear, hear."
"who would have thought that this eclectic group of voyagers could actually become a family? starfleet, maquis, klingon, talaxian, hologram, borg, even mister paris. granted, we've had our share of difficulties. one might say, we've seen the best of times and the worst of times. i'd now like to recount some of those times from my unique perspective. under the category of best of times, i invite you all to recall the moment when i"
bridge to captain.
janeway here.
we're being hailed. a vessel off the port bow.
on our way.
perhaps we could all reconvene later?
"they're firing on us, captain."
"it's a small vessel, fifteen lifeforms aboard. low warp capacity, limited armaments. they pose no threat."
"open a channel. good day, sir. have we offended you in some way?"
you will reverse course immediately. this region is in dispute. you have no business in krenim space.
i was under the impression we were entering zahl territory.
the zahl have no legitimate claim here. they have taken what is ours. reverse course or be destroyed.
"with all due respect, unless you've got something a little bigger in your torpedo tubes, i'm not turning around. but i'm certainly willing to discuss this issue with you."
no discussion! no compromise!
they are in retreat.
his bark's obviously worse than his bite.
he seems rather intent. let's go to yellow alert. maintain our course. maybe the zahl can give us some answers.
as long as you travel in zahl territory you travel among friends. i apologise for your mishap with the krenim.
"it was hardly traumatic, but i am curious. the krenim claim this region as their own."
"the krenim dominated this space many years ago. they possessed deadly weapons based on temporal science, and it kept them in power for a long time. but a generation ago we fought the krenim. we defeated them and took back the planets that they had annexed, dismantled their military forces. their ships still wander our territory making grandiose claims. don't let them trouble you. now, tell me about voyager. a single ship alone, half a galaxy from home. how exciting for you."
"bridge to captain. sorry to interrupt, but the krenim vessel is back. they're demanding to speak with you."
hello again.
"you've ignored our warnings, and now you consort with our enemy."
leave this space or i'll seize your vessel and send you home in a cargo container.
"gentlemen, please. believe me, we're not conspiring against you."
"captain, there's a spatial distortion heading towards us. whatever it is, it's huge. five light years across and it's expanding."
tracking it's origin. a vessel near the zahl homeworld.
what?
it appears to be a massive build-up of temporal energy. some kind of space-time shock wave.
tom.
it's destabilising our warp field. i've lost engines.
"shields to full. secure primary systems. all hands, brace for impact."
she's dead.
shields at seventy percent. the krenim are firing again. we're being hailed.
it's about time. on screen. we've done nothing to provoke these attacks.
your presence in our space is provocation enough.
we've been trying to communicate with your vessels but the only answer i get is weapons fire.
state your identity.
captain janeway of the federation starship voyager.
and your reason for violating our borders?
we're simply trying to get home. if you'd kindly allow us to pass through
no. you will submit to the krenim imperium. i would prefer to seize your vessel before it is too badly damaged. surrender now and i will forego the execution of your crew.
i don't respond well to threats.
then prepare to be boarded.
"all hands, battle stations. this is turning into the week of hell."
they are charging weapons. three seconds to impact.
evasive manoeuvres.
direct hit to our secondary hull.
i still don't understand why these torpedoes are ripping right through our shields.
their weapons are chronoton based. they're penetrating our shields because they're in a state of temporal flux.
"then lets exercise the better part of valour. get us out of here, warp six."
warp six. no sign of pursuit.
damage report.
fifteen wounded. main power is down. we've lost environmental control on decks seven and eight. the computer is offline.
"mister kim, do we have any sensors left?"
short range only.
"commander, put the ship on twenty four hour tactical alert. tuvok, analyse whatever data we've got on those chronoton torpedoes. see if you can modify our shielding. when those krenim attack again, i want to be ready."
enter.
"sir, you were correct. the zahl homeworld was the focal point. its erasure has produced a complete temporal restoration."
complete?
"yes, sir."
if i told you to count the stars in the cosmos would the task ever be complete?
sir?
"our attempts may be sufficient. they may be even relatively successful, but they will never be complete. choose your words with more precision."
my apologies.
what were the exact results?
the krenim imperium has been restored to power. our territory now includes eight hundred and forty nine inhabited worlds spanning five thousand parsecs.
counter indications?
"negligible. no superior enemy forces, no unexpected diseases. calculations indicate a ninety eight percent restoration. our race is thriving once again."
"the, er, the colony at kyana prime. that was restored as well?"
"no, sir. in this timeline the imperium does not extend that far."
then our mission has failed. begin calculations for the next incursion.
"sir, we have just accomplished the impossible. a ninety eight percent restoration. another incursion, even a minor one, could undermine everything. we should dismantle this weapon and rejoin our people."
"no, not until every colony, every individual, every blade of grass is restored."
"you said yourself our task will never be complete. please. we should be satisfied with what we have accomplished. for two hundred years, we have never come this close."
not close enough.
"if i may speak my thoughts. many among the crew are convinced that you have lost your objectivity. they think your quest for precision is unrealistic. sir, we will never restore one hundred percent of what we had. we can manipulate the time continuum for another ten centuries. it will never happen."
return to your station and begin a new set of calculations. is that clear?
perfectly.
"you surprise me, obrist, after so many years, you still perceive time through conventional eyes. never is a word that has no meaning here. as long as we stay on this vessel, protected from space-time, we have all eternity to accomplish our mission."
"of course, sir."
return fire.
weapons are down. my attempt to modify the shielding was unsuccessful.
"captain, during that last exchange we did some damage. the krenim's aft shields are down. they're vulnerable."
"we've got to hit them, now."
"with what? phaser banks are burned out, torpedo launchers are offline."
doctor to bridge. we've got a power overload in sickbay. i need an engineer down here right away.
"stand by, doctor. harry, can you handle it from here?"
"no, sir. the overload's spreading. half that deck is going to blow in less than five minutes."
"doctor, get your patients out of there. all hands, this is the bridge. emergency evacuation deck five."
how many torpedoes do we have left?
eleven.
arm four of them. stand by to open the launch doors. we're going to deploy them like mines.
"aye, captain."
"tom, i need your finesse. let the krenim get within five thousand metres of us."
no problem.
"keep moving. quickly, please, move quickly."
"warning, structural collapse in three minutes."
torpedoes armed and ready.
they're within range.
"tuvok, do it."
got him!
the conduits on deck five are overloading. thirty seconds till they blow.
keep moving! please hurry. that's it.
"warning, structural collapse"
in twenty seconds.
fifteen seconds!
"warning, structural collapse in ten seconds. warning, structural collapse in five, four, three, two, one."
report!
sections ten through fifty three on deck five are gone.
casualties?
"reports are coming in. twelve wounded, many of them critically. the doctor is setting up a triage facility in the mess hall. two crew members were killed in the breach."
stand down red alert. assemble a security team. survey the ship deck by deck. i want a full damage report. i'll be in my ready room. you have the bridge. what's left of it.
come in. sorry about the mess.
you should see my place. they haven't looked as bad since my old academy days.
is there something on your mind?
"yes, but you're not going to like it."
that's never stopped you before. broken.
i'll be blunt. our strategy is failing. it was a good idea to try and create temporal shielding but it isn't working.
"not yet, but it will. with every attack we're getting more information about their chronoton weapons."
"how many more attacks will it take? before long, there won't be a ship left to protect."
we don't have a choice.
maybe we do.
here comes the part i'm not going to like.
"we should consider leaving the ship behind, breaking the crew into smaller groups. escape pods, shuttles, each one with its own course. if all goes well, we'll rendezvous on the other side of krenim space."
then what?
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. but at least we'd be increasing our chances of survival.
"abandon ship? the answer's no. i'm not breaking up the family, chakotay. we're stronger as a team. one crew, one ship. the moment we split apart, we lose the ability to pool our talents. we become vulnerable. we'll get picked off one by one. now i say we make our stand. together."
"to be honest, i wasn't too fond of the idea myself."
"as long as voyager's in one piece, we stay."
we stay. this looks like it stayed in one piece. where does this go?
my lucky teacup. right over here.
red alert. we're under attack. two krenim warships off the port bow.
when are they going to get us out of here?
try to relax. let's get back to the game. grace kelly. cat burglars. the riviera. name the title and the male lead.
to catch a thief.
right.
clark gable.
wrong. cary grant.
i've seen the holographic version twice. it's clark gable.
i think you're getting them confused because they have the same initials. it was grant.
"no more twentieth century entertainment. i'm terrible at it. my turn. category, athletics."
fire away.
"a notorious athlete, parrises squares championship finals, er, controversial decision."
m'kota r'cho. the first and only klingon to play the game. during the finals of 2342 one of the referees called a penalty against his team. r'cho strangled him.
impressive.
"you're looking at a true sports aficionado. let's see, how about interstellar history?"
"oh, great. you pick the one subject i almost failed at the academy. go ahead and ask. ow!"
are you all right?
it just hurts a little. feels like we've been here for days.
"actually, it's been about six hours. try to hang on, b'elanna. the emergency crews are going find us any minute. come on, hurry up!"
go ahead and ask your stupid question before i pass out and you don't have anybody to play with.
"okay. er, it's a famous ship. er, pre-warp civilisation. er, montana. er, second stage had chemical engines."
another clue.
"vulcans. er, earth, first contact."
"oh, right, right. er, er, er, zephram cochrane's ship. what was it called? oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. ow!"
"okay, here, here, you'd better lie down now. enough trivia for now."
"no, no, i'm going to get this one."
lieutenant. ensign.
it's about time. what happened to the turbolift?
during the last attack nineteen main power relays were severed. the entire turbolift system is non-operational.
"get me to the jefferies tube network on deck eleven. the eps manifold must have taken a hit, too."
seven of nine can go take a look. we have to get you to the doctor.
all right.
the phoenix.
what?
the correct response to your query. the vessel ensign kim was describing. it was designated the phoenix.
not bad. i didn't realise you knew so much about earth history.
"i don't, but the borg were present during those events."
really.
it's a complicated story. perhaps another time.
i think so.
transverse bulkheads. we've set up emergency forcefields between all decks and every section. in the event of a cataclysmic breach most of us will be protected.
ingenious.
"actually, you can thank mister paris. he came up with the idea."
"i was inspired by an ancient steamship, the titanic. the engineers of the day constructed a series of special bulkheads, sort of like a honeycomb, that would lower into place if they suffered a major hull breach. in theory, they could stay afloat even with half the ship filled with water."
"the titanic? as i recall, it sank."
"well, let's just say i've made a few improvements."
i knew your fixation with history would come in handy someday. good work.
doctor to lieutenant paris.
"go ahead, doc."
report to the mess hall at once. more wounded are one the way.
i'll be right there. i'm a popular guy today.
seven of nine to tuvok.
tuvok here.
"there is an undetonated chronoton torpedo lodged in the starboard jefferies tube on deck eleven, section two. the warhead is still active."
do not attempt to disarm it. hold your position and wait for my arrival. is that clear?
arrive quickly.
i've stopped the internal bleeding. you're going to be okay.
is that your expert opinion?
that's a promise. i know it still hurts.
it's all right.
you've got a ruptured vertebra. i'll see if i can repair it.
"mister paris, your assistance please."
give me a minute.
"now, lieutenant."
i'll be right back. don't go anywhere.
"in case you hadn't noticed, b'elanna is not the only patient here."
she's in pain.
"but no longer in danger of dying. that is the first rule of medical triage. make sure the patient will live, then move on to the next one. emotional detachment is essential otherwise, you risk impairing your judgment."
i understand.
you could be seeing more of your friends in here soon. if you can't handle itm i'll find another assistant. you can leave.
"physician, heal thyself."
what's that supposed to mean?
it seems to me that you're the one who's getting emotional around here.
"several weeks ago, just before the conduits on deck five breached, i saw ensign strickler and crewman emmanuel at the end of a corridor. they were trying to reach the jefferies tube. i kept the hatch open, waited for them as long as i could, but time ran out. i had no choice but to seal the hatch."
it must have been very hard for you.
"my point is, it could have been worse. had i lost my objectivity, i might have kept the hatch open and everyone would have perished. this man has damaged lung tissue. treat him with inaprovaline."
"if we attempt to dislodge the torpedo or move it with the transporters, it will most likely detonate."
can we disarm it?
no. the warhead is already destabilising. i estimate it will explode in less than two minutes. if we re-route emergency power to this junction and erect a level ten force field it should be enough to contain the explosion. we must hurry.
if i can determine the exact temporal variance of this torpedo it will help us perfect the temporal shielding.
there is no time.
we may never have this opportunity again.
i am giving you an order. now!
the temporal variance is one point four seven microseconds.
"excellent work, but if you disobey my orders again i will be forced to"
happy birthday.
happy what?
today is may twentieth.
is it? i thought we were still in april. guess i've lost track of the time.
"well, this should help."
it's beautiful.
"nineteenth century, mechanical movement. it's a replica of the chronometer worn by captain cray of the british navy, his ship was hit by a typhoon in the pacific. everyone back in england thought they were killed, but eight months later cray sailed his ship into london harbour. there wasn't much left of it, a few planks, half a sail, but he got his crew home."
"i appreciate the sentiment, but i can't keep this. recycle it. we can't afford to waste energy on nonessentials."
"kathryn, i replicated this months ago. i've been saving it. i wanted you to have it."
"that watch represents a meal, a hypospray, or a pair of boots. it could mean the difference between life and death one day."
enter.
"reporting for duty, lieutenant."
what is our agenda?
"after we make your customary rounds, i'd like to take you to deflector control. i had an inspiration last night about the temporal shielding."
excellent.
you've been damaged.
a minor laceration.
i have offered to assist you with your personal grooming.
there are some tasks i would rather perform myself.
unacceptable. you're risking further injury.
shaving is hardly a life-threatening activity. tell me about your inspiration.
"we've been trying to match our shields to the temporal variance of their torpedoes, but i believe we must also match the deflector array to the inverse of that variance."
fascinating. when will the deflectors be ready?
"they're ready now, but the modifications are untested."
then our rounds can wait. take me to deflector control.
seven.
ensign.
a friend of yours?
"my cabin mate. as a borg, i was accustomed to cohabitating with thousands of other drones, but i find it significantly more difficult to live with a single human."
in what way?
ensign brooks is negligent. she leaves her equipment lying around the quarters and her clothing on the floor.
indeed. i have found that most humans are less than meticulous when it comes to their domestic habits.
indeed.
"mister vulcan, sir. a tactical question if i may?"
you may.
"we're just about done rebuilding the internal security sensors, and we're ready to programme the audio signal. do you want it to say intruder alert, or should we try something a little more dramatic, like warning, intruder alert or, intruders among us! danger! danger! intruders among us?"
intruder alert will suffice.
"yeah, go with the classic. understood, sir."
and you believe you have difficulties.
"all hands to battle stations. krenim vessels approaching. repeat, all hands to battle stations."
go to deflector control and bring the new shields online. we will test them in battle.
"computer, activate tactile interface."
weapons status?
phasers are still online. torpedo launchers are still inoperative.
the krenim are within visual range.
on screen.
seven's modified temporal shields should be online in a moment.
it's a warship.
you know the routine.
evasive manoeuvres.
they're matching course.
hold them off as long as you can. bridge to seven of nine.
where are those shields?
stand by.
they're charging weapons.
"seven, we could a little of that borg efficiency right about now."
i can't shake them.
they're targeting the bridge.
temporal shielding is online.
they're firing.
full port thrusters.
temporal shields are holding. no damage.
hail them.
channel open.
"krenim vessels, this is the captain of voyager. you may have noticed we have a defence against your torpedoes now. i suggest you stand down."
no response.
their mistake. bring the ship about. we're going through their space whether they like it or not.
we are within range of the garenor homeworld.
set temporal coordinates. full power to the weapon. prepare for total erasure of the species.
targeting the focal point. ready.
fire.
temporal incursion in progress.
trace elements?
diminishing.
counter indications?
none so far. organisms and structures are being eradicated.
track the temporal wavefront as it passes through the system. i want to monitor every change in the timeline as it occurs.
"yes, sir."
"captain, the krenim warship is in pursuit, but their weapons are not powered."
they don't know what to do with us now that we're shielded against their torpedoes.
"captain, there's some kind of spatial distortion heading toward us. sensor readings are erratic. i can't identify the phenomenon."
what's the source?
unknown. but it originated approximately twenty light years from our position. it looks like a shockwave in the fabric of space-time.
"tom, get us out of here."
"we'll never outrun it, captain."
"maybe our new shields will help. all hands, brace for impact."
"you were correct, captain. the temporal shielding has protected us. the wave front has passed."
captain.
report.
"it's definitely a krenim ship. identical hull markings, same biospectral frequency, but it's half the size. limited fire power."
what happened to the warship?
i'm not picking it up on long range sensors.
"it looks like this entire part of space has changed somehow. the last time i checked, this region was filled with krenim colonies and vessels. i just ran a scan and sensors show no colonies and just a handful of krenim ships."
"harry, transfer all your sensor data about that shockwave to the astrometrics lab."
"yes, ma'am."
tell seven of nine to meet me there.
"captain, astrometrics took heavy damage a few days go. it's offline."
"well, let's get it back online. it appears that the krenim imperium has vanished. our troubles could be over and i'd like to find out why."
"something went wrong. the entire krenim imperium, it's reverted to a pre-warp state."
not possible. our calculations were perfect.
i may have an explanation. there's an anomalous temporal reading twenty light years from here. it's coming from a vessel.
what vessel?
component zero four nine beta. a ship called voyager.
that ship was classified as an inert component. it shouldn't be generating a temporal field.
but it is. and it was enough to throw off our calculations.
take me to them.
sensors are online. power levels are stable.
is the astrometric database still intact?
yes.
display the scans we made of this region before the temporal shockwave hit.
spatial grid zero zero five.
"the krenim imperium. over two hundred star systems, nine hundred planets, thousands of warp capable vessels. and now, after the shockwave, everything seems to have changed. run a new scan."
spatial grid zero zero five.
"same space, different configuration, exactly as chakotay said. the imperium appears to have been reduced to a few planets, and a smattering of vessels. it appears that someone or something has altered history. but why weren't we affected?"
perhaps we were protected from the changes by our temporal shielding.
so the question remains. what caused that shockwave in the first place? see if you can track it back to its origin.
the shockwave emanated from a planet twenty light years away. the garenor homeworld.
the garenor? we passed their planet three weeks ago.
the planet is no longer populated.
what?
astrometric data indicate that the instant the shockwave appeared the garenor species vanished.
erased from history.
captain?
"i'm no authority on time travel, in fact i've made it my goal in life to avoid it, but this sounds to me like a causality paradox. think about it. a temporal shock wave eliminates a single species and all of history changes as a result."
an intriguing theory. perhaps the krenim are responsible. they do possess temporal technology.
"but why would they alter history to undermine themselves? no, we're still missing a big piece of the puzzle. run another scan of the"
scanning the vessel. their defensive shielding is generating a level nine temporal disruption.
"collect samples. two lifeforms, ten square metres of the hull."
"yes, sir."
disable their shielding. prepare to initiate a temporal incursion.
that entire vessel's in a state of temporal flux. it's like they exist outside space-time.
they're scanning us.
get a lock on them.
"i'm trying, but i can't isolate their signals."
we're being hailed.
on screen.
state your identity.
"i'm captain janeway of the federation starship voyager. who are you, and where are my men?"
i am annorax of the krenim imperium. we've transferred your crewmen to my vessel for further analysis. your ship does not come from this quadrant.
"we come from earth, a planet sixty five thousand light years from here. we're on our way home."
i see.
we've been observing some rather unusual events in the region. it seems your imperium never existed. perhaps you could shed some light on this?
that doesn't concern you. what is important is that you understand that i bear you no hostility. but you have diverted me from my mission.
your mission? you're responsible for the changes in the timeline.
"you're a long way from your world. in a manner of speaking, so am i. unfortunately, only one of us can go home again. your sacrifice will restore the lives of countless millions. i'm sorry."
i'm reading a massive energy build-up. some kind of weapon.
shields.
temporal shields are weakening.
"captain, that energy beam. it's pushing voyager out of the space-time continuum."
he's trying to erase us from history.
i've scanned their propulsion system. their vessel's mass prevents them from exceeding warp six. we can escape.
"captain, i must remind you our structural integrity is still impaired. if we go to warp now, the damage to voyager will be extreme."
what about tom and chakotay?
"we'll have to come back for them. all hands clear the outer sections and prepare for wide-scale breaches. tuvok, activate the transverse bulkheads."
temporal shields are failing.
engage warp seven.
they're not in pursuit.
we're losing the outer hull. transverse bulkheads are holding.
"each of you has done their best, but determination alone isn't going to hold this ship together. it's time we faced reality. we've lost nine decks. more than half the ship has been destroyed. life support is nearly gone. voyager can no longer sustain it's crew. i promised myself that i would never give this order, that i would never break up this family, but asking you to stay would be asking you to die. you will proceed to the escape pods and evacuate this vessel. set your course for the alpha quadrant. along the way, try to find allies. secure faster ships, if you can. anything to get home. the senior staff and i will remain on board as long as possible. we will try somehow to rescue tom and chakotay. the escape pods are equipped with subspace beacons. that's how we'll keep track of you. when we find each other again,  and we will, we will find each other again, i expect all of you to be in one piece with some interesting stories to tell. good luck."
come on. don't do this to me now. emergency forcefields are holding. how the hell did all this gas get inside?
"looks like a malfunction in the ventilation system. okay, i'm going to try reversing the osmotic pressure on this deck. whoa! the gas corroded the circuit relays."
let's bypass.
we've got three minutes of air left.
how long can you hold your breath?
ensign kim found time to be treated. so can you.
how is harry?
"he'll be fine, but i'm surprised he didn't asphyxiate. i told you eight minutes on that deck, not eight and a half, not nine, and certainly not twelve."
"would you rather have an indoor nebula? if we didn't stop it then and there, it would have flooded another two decks. b'elanna, engines?"
not yet captain. one of the warp nacelles is still offline. the other one's a lost cause.
route all available power to the good one.
the alveoli in your lungs have been chemically burned. i want you off your feet for the next forty eight hours.
impossible. i've got too much work to do.
there are seven other crew members on board. you're the captain. delegate.
"inject me with trioxin. that should help me breathe a little easier. b'elanna, stand by for the transfer."
right.
trioxin is used in emergency situations as a stop-gap measure. your lungs have suffered serious damage. they need to be treated properly. doctor's orders.
captain's orders. trioxin. now.
"aye, aye. it's your body. who am i to judge? i'm only the chief medical officer. what do i know?"
"thank you. now, where were we?"
"well, you look rested."
where's my crewmate?
he should have been here by now. no doubt he's making himself difficult. i've never seen such an intransigent young man.
"you've had us in isolation for two months. we've been scanned, poked and prodded. how do you expect us to act?"
with some degree of dignity and restraint. your crewmate has none.
what do you want from us?
"at the moment, information."
anything for such a charming host. are you all right?
"the galley has prepared a selection of unique delicacies. you won't find them anywhere else in the galaxy. please, join me."
"malkothian spirits. an extremely rare vintage. the only bottle known to exist. your captain said that your vessel is trying to reach home. i hadn't realised how far your home was. you're an anomalous component. alone, disconnected, impossible to predict. you have no idea how you've complicated my mission."
glad to hear it.
"when i first encountered your vessel, it was badly damaged, barely functioning. what if i told you that in the blink of an eye i could restore voyager to its former condition, that you and i would never have met. that you might even find yourself closer to the alpha quadrant?"
by using the weapon on this ship to alter history?
yes. i can control the destiny of a single molecule or an entire civilisation. how's the wine?
excellent.
"this bottle is the only component left of the once powerful malkoth race. everything else about them, cities, culture, the very species itself never existed, because of me. every dish you see here comes from a civilisation that has been erased from time. mister paris, you're devouring the last remnants of the alsuran empire. i have collected artefacts from hundreds of worlds. this vessel is more than a weapon. it's a museum of lost histories. you two gentlemen almost became artefacts yourselves, but i've decided to spare your vessel."
why?
"call it an act of compassion. you're trying to reach home. in a way, so am i. we can work together to achieve both our goals."
what do you propose?
"in order to make the calculations required to restore voyager, i need to know about some of your experiences in this quadrant. what species you interacted with, how other components were affected by your presence."
"you can't find her, can you? i think captain janeway has been eluding you for the past two months. otherwise you would've destroyed voyager by now."
"i'm offering you a way out of this situation. you accept my offer, or when i do find voyager i will destroy it."
and how many civilisations will you have to erase to send us merrily on our way? no thanks. we don't want that kind of blood on our hands.
"tom, hold on. you said you could control the destiny of a single molecule. if you made a precise enough calculation, could you restore voyager without harming anyone?"
"it is possible, but it's extremely difficult. that's why i need your cooperation."
i'd rather spend a year in solitary confinement than listen to any of this.
"tom, have a seat."
"chakotay, we can't trust him."
"you're correct. given the circumstances, there is no reason to trust me. but trust isn't necessary. we need each other."
"obrist, show our guest to his new quarters. i'll do everything in my power to make you comfortable here, mister paris. all i ask in return is that you keep an open mind."
i was very impressed with your question. you seem to understand the subtleties of time.
professor vassbinder might've disagreed with you. i failed his course in temporal mechanics.
"beyond study and instrumentation, there is instinct. not everyone has the ability to truly perceive time. its colours, its moods. perhaps you do."
i'm certainly willing to give it a try.
to distant friends.
to friends.
"hear, hear."
cheers.
yes.
well?
interesting.
not bad. not bad at all.
what is it exactly?
"i call it the elixir of endurance. it's loaded with amino acids, carbohydrates, all the nutrients necessary for the crew to withstand these stressful conditions."
ration cubes.
"well, yes, yes. but this time, pureed and mixed with water and enhanced with talaxian spices."
it is offensive. fortunately taste is irrelevant.
"well, it's been a few days since we've gathered in one place. now's a good time to catch up. how are the repairs proceeding?"
i'm happy to report that i've repaired the optronic error in my programme.
and the power grid?
"we're operating at thirty two percent efficiency. i think i can bring it up to fifty, but i'll need a few more days."
warp drive?
i'm still having trouble with the starboard nacelle.
how long?
three weeks. minimum.
"i thought this nebula would be a safe haven until we finished repairs, but it's turning into a permanent residence. we've got to get back into open space, find allies, put together a fighting force to take on annorax. we're leaving this damn cloud first thing tomorrow morning."
"captain, you are in error."
really?
at the moment this vessel is defenceless. we should remain here until we are functioning at our peak efficiency.
"i appreciate your opinion, seven, but i disagree. we leave tomorrow, oh eight hundred hours."
it is inappropriate to contradict the captain in front of the crew.
that was not my intention. i simply pointed out that her decision was wrong.
in your view.
and yours. i know you well enough to say that.
then you should also know that my trust in captain janeway is absolute. the decision you or i might have made is irrelevant.
"as a borg, i submitted to a single authority, the collective. over the past several months i've been encouraged to think and act as an individual. it is difficult to know when to restrain myself."
remember this guideline. the captain is always right.
even when you know her logic is flawed?
perhaps.
"component 37329, a rogue comet. about eight months ago, voyager made a course correction to avoid the comet. according to my calculations, it led to our entering krenim space."
"the solution, then, would be to erase that comet from history."
exactly. voyager would have stayed on its course and bypassed krenim space altogether.
sounds simple enough. conduct a simulation.
temporal incursion in progress. what happened?
"had you actually eradicated that comet, all life within fifty light years would never have existed. congratulations, you almost wiped out eight thousand civilisations."
i didn't consider the entire history of the comet.
"four billion years ago, fragments from that comet impacted a planet. hydrocarbons from those fragments gave rise to several species of plant life, which in turn sustained more complex organisms. ultimately several space-faring civilisations evolved and colonised the entire sector."
by erasing the comet i altered all evolution in this region.
"past, present and future. they exist as one. they breathe together. you're not the only person to make this mistake. when i first constructed this weapon ship, i turned it against our greatest enemy, the rilnar. the result was miraculous. with the rilnar gone from history, my people, in an instant, became powerful again. but there were problems. a rare disease broke out among our colonies. within a year, fifty million were dead. i had failed to realise that the rilnar had introduced a crucial antibody into the krenim genome, and my weapon had eliminated that antibody as well."
"and you've been trying to undo that damage ever since. but each time you pull out a new thread, another one begins to unravel."
"you can't imagine the burden of memory that i carry. thousands of worlds, billions of lives, gone, brought back, gone again. i try to rationalise the loss. they're not really being destroyed, because they never existed. sometimes i can almost convince myself."
"you've been at this for two hundred years, annorax. what makes you think you're ever going to succeed?"
"what makes you think voyager will ever reach earth? the odds against you are astronomical, yet you keep trying."
you're right. but we don't destroy everything that stands in our way.
"you can help me to change that, chakotay. together, we'll restore the krenim and voyager and we'll undo the damage that i've caused."
i've still got a lot to learn.
come. it's time i show you the heart of this vessel. the temporal core.
engines.
i'm doing my best.
"captain, with the deflector down those micrometeoroids are beginning to erode the hull."
emergency power to the deflector.
none available.
i'll be in deflector control.
captain. that entire section has been designated hazard level four.
i know.
"oh, why do i get the feeling you're testing me, voyager? bridge, there's a fire in deflector control. any luck with the engines?"
the warp core's still offline.
micro-meteoroid density
is increasing. the nacelle pylon is buckling.
"bridge, i'm going in. stand by to engage the deflector. tell the doctor i'll be coming"
back with severe burns.
captain.
do it. be kind.
the captain's accessed manual control. she's stabilising the particle emitters. she's got it! deflectors online!
"activating deflector field. bridge to janeway. captain, please respond."
what's my condition?
"you suffered third degree burns to approximately sixty percent of your body. i've healed most of them, but without a dermal regenerator i couldn't repair all the damage to your skin. you've been left with scars on your face and arms."
i'll consider them mementos.
not so fast. you're spending the next few days here with me.
what for?
observation.
is there something else wrong with me?
not physically.
what are you suggesting?
"traumatic stress syndrome. symptoms. irritability, sleeplessness, obsessional thoughts, reckless behaviour. all of which you've demonstrated over the last few weeks."
"my only obsession is with saving my ship, my people. if i've been taking some reckless chances in order to do that, it's hardly a medical condition."
i'm not going to stand here while you rationalise yet another brush with death.
you don't have to.
"as chief medical officer, i have the authority to relieve you of your command."
you're not going to do that.
"if, in my medical opinion, your judgment has been impaired, i can. and i will."
try it and i'll shut down your programme.
that threat in itself is evidence of your unstable condition.
"i am sorry, doctor. i've been operating on instinct for so long i did not think before i spoke. i have no intention of deactivating you. but i won't stay in this mess hall."
is that final?
final.
"then you leave me no choice. captain kathryn janeway, under starfleet medical regulation one twenty one, section a, i, the chief medical officer, do hereby relieve you of your active command, effective immediately. have a seat."
"how do you plan to implement this protocol, doctor? mister tuvok doesn't have a security team, both the brigs have been destroyed, and with the internal forcefields offline you'll have a hell of a time keeping me confined. you'd better grab a phaser, because before i give up command you'll have to shoot me."
you realise this incident will be noted in my official logs. by refusing my orders you risk a general court martial.
"compared to what i've been through the past few months, a court martial would be a small price to pay. if we make it back home i'll be happy to face the music."
another ruptured eps conduit.
thirty two so far.
"thirty three, thirty four, thirty five. and that fluidic converter needs to be purged."
right.
the gravitational plating in this room has buckled.
chakotay's quarters.
you disobeyed orders.
captain?
chakotay gave this to me five months ago. a birthday gift. i ordered him to
what do you think?
handsome.
come on.
astounding.
not really. i get lucky now and again.
"your end game sequence, it, er, it was the same one favoured by my brother."
"to quote a long lost friend of mine, it seemed logical. now what?"
i used to honour the day of his birth.
who?
"my brother. and my parents, my closest friends. every year at first. then one day i realised a century had passed, and for years i had been celebrating birthdays for the dead. or for people whonever even existed."
i'm sorry.
"you can put that thing down, chakotay. no need to strain your eyes anymore, i've got a plan."
let's hear it.
"this ship's temporal core keeps the vessel out of phase with normal space-time, but it's shields are incredibly weak. you take that core offline, and a photon grenade could penetrate the hull."
how do you know all this?
"i've been spending time with our friend obrist, who seems more than willing to share information. and that's not all. does the name captain bligh mean anything to you? this is not a happy crew. they've been at this for two hundred years now. they're tired of it, chakotay. they want it to end."
"good work, tom. but i'm not quite ready to start a mutiny. keep gathering information, lie low. i'm starting to make progress on the temporal calculations. with a little time and luck i think we can get the krenim back on their feet, and voyager back to the alpha quadrant."
you're starting to sound like annorax. always one more calculation. this time it's going to be perfect.
this can work. if you'd take the time to listen you'd understand what annorax is trying to do.
what? wipe out civilisations to help his own race? i understand perfectly.
"it's more complicated than that. annorax is an enlightened man. misguided, but i think he wants this to end as much as anyone."
"i guess i don't have the instinct for time, or whatever it is captain nemo out there calls it. chakotay, he's been flattering you and it's gone to your head."
"you're out of line, lieutenant"
"maybe i shouldn't start a mutiny, but i might be able to get obrist to help us send a message to captain janeway."
"not yet. if you get caught, we lose everything. i can get us out of this."
not if i get us out of here first.
you're not doing anything against annorax. that's an order.
"what are you going to do, take away my holodeck privileges?"
"either we maintain our command structure, or else we settle our differences the old fashioned way."
what's happening?
we're preparing for a temporal incursion.
what incursion? you didn't say anything about
i had an inspiration last night. by my calculations the eradication of the ram izad species will result in a fifty two percent restoration of the krenim timeline.
i thought we were working to avoid more destruction.
when time offers you an opportunity you don't ignore it.
we're within range of their homeworld.
take us into orbit. full power to the weapon. prepare for total erasure.
is this what you call enlightened?
targeting the focal point. locked.
please. this isn't necessary. we'll find another way.
fire. trace elements?
diminishing.
counter indications?
none so far.
scan the continuum. bring me the results once they're complete.
"yes, sir."
i'll be in my chambers.
"have you seen enough yet, chakotay? if you don't do something about this maniac, i will."
you didn't need to fire on that planet.
i'm altering history on a massive scale. the destinies of countless star systems are in my hands. the fate of one species is insignificant.
you're trying to rationalise genocide. one species is significant. a single life is significant.
"it seemed so easy the first time. in the blink of an eye, i had changed history itself. allowed my people to thrive again. but when i changed history a second time, i lost more than you can imagine."
the colony on kyana prime.
how could you know that?
"i've been studying your previous incursions. no matter how close you get to restoring the timeline, one component is always missing. kyana prime. who was on that colony? who did you lose?"
"my wife. and with her, my future. my children, grandchildren, all erased because of me. this is all i have left of her."
"so many years i worked through the night while she was sleeping. how could i have known i was calculating her fate? i can't stop until i've restored kyana prime, and forced time to give me back my wife."
maybe it isn't possible.
"when i tell that time has moods, a disposition to be intuited, i'm not speaking metaphorically."
what do you mean?
"anger is one of it's moods. anger and the desire for retribution, vengeance. time itself has tried to punish me for my arrogance. it has kept me from my wife, denied me my future."
"sir, we've achieved a fifty two percent restoration."
kyana prime?
"negative, sir."
resume scanning the continuum.
"yes, sir."
"i've, er, i've studied your calculations, chakotay. they're promising, but premature. we'll keep working on them. in the meantime, my mission must continue."
you don't have the right.
to fight for what is mine? that's not for you to decide. only time can pronounce judgment against me.
if that little display doesn't convince you i don't know what will. he's insane.
"no he's not, wounded, maybe, even tortured, but i can still reach him, convince him to stop."
"not from what you've told me. this guy thinks that time has a personal grudge against him. that's called paranoia, chakotay, with a hint of megalomania."
you don't know what he's been through.
"he's lost his family. okay, that's a terrible thing. but so has everyone else on this ship. and frankly, so have we."
what kind of progress have you made?
"obrist is coming around, and i think we can trust him. he says he'll give me access to their communications array. i can send a message to voyager from the comfort of my own quarters."
and the temporal core?
"that's going to be a little trickier. with obrist's help, i'm pretty sure i can disable it, but not without setting off every alarm on the ship. we're only going to have one chance."
it'll require precise timing. you and me working from within.
"and captain janeway attacking from voyager. that is, if the captain's still alive."
she's alive. send the message. transmit our coordinates.
done.
"and, give kathryn my best."
i've analysed every carrier frequency of their transmission. it contains a classified starfleet id code. it could only have come from tom paris. it's real. the coordinates he sent should lead us directly to the weapon ship.
location?
"approximately fifty light years from here. our new allies are assembling reinforcements. once we're in range, tom says he'll try to take the weapon ship's temporal core offline. when that happens they'll be vulnerable to conventional weapons. tom will then transmit the exact location of the core. our job will be to disable the ship and get our people out. is everyone clear?"
"yes, ma'am."
"aye, captain."
"b'elanna, harry, i want you to beam over to the nihydron vessel. work with their engineers. the entire fleet needs to be equipped with temporal shielding."
"aye, captain."
"tuvok, neelix, seven. you'll be working on the mawasi ship."
"yes, captain."
"doctor, once the attack begins, your skills will no doubt be required. join tuvok's team."
what about yourself?
"i'll be piloting voyager, coordinating the attack."
"captain, there's barely enough of this ship left to get there, much less wage a war."
"there's fight in voyager yet. it's still got temporal shields, six photon torpedoes. it'll hold together. besides, you know the adage. captain goes down with the ship, right? you have your orders. dismissed. tuvok, i can hear your objections already. i am not leaving."
"given voyager's damaged state, the probability of your surviving an armed conflict is marginal."
"oh, i know the odds. but i have to stay. voyager's done too much for us."
"curious. i have never understood the human compulsion to emotionally bond with inanimate objects. this vessel has done nothing. it is an assemblage of bulkheads, conduits, tritanium. nothing more."
"oh, you're wrong. it's much more than that. this ship has been our home. it's kept us together. it's been part of our family. as illogical as this might sound, i feel as close to voyager as i do to any other member of my crew. it's carried us, tuvok. even nurtured us. and right now it needs one of us."
"i respect your decision. live long and prosper, captain."
"same to you, old friend."
voyager to mawasi vessel.
"go ahead, captain."
i'm picking up the weapon ship dead ahead.
confirmed.
temporal shields status.
all vessels are bringing them online.
this is captain janeway to the fleet. plot an intercept course to the weapon ship.
"sir, six vessels are approaching our position."
identify.
"three nihydron warships, two mawasi cruisers, and voyager."
"we're outside space-time, impervious to their weapons. let them come."
i know captain janeway. she wouldn't be attacking unless she knew she could do some damage.
"good work, obrist."
"if she's given the other ships temporal shielding, they've undoubtedly informed their home worlds. they'll be able to protect their planets against your weapon."
bring the weapon to full power. stand by for multiple incursions. we'll have to disable their temporal shields first. make the necessary calculations.
all vessels report ready.
let's see if tom has done his part. janeway to the fleet. attack pattern omega. engage.
condition?
no damage. temporal core is stable.
return fire.
"captain, two nihydron vessels have been destroyed."
"janeway to the fleet. evasive pattern delta. we're going to have to wait. come on, tom. come on."
"target the other vessels. obrist, i said target the vessels. you're deactivating the temporal core."
"i'm sorry, sir. it's over."
get back to your stations. you will not disobey me. we're phasing back into normal space-time. reconfigure to conventional weapons.
"captain, chakotay and paris were beamed aboard our vessel."
everything's going as planned. tom sent me the coordinates of their temporal core before he left. i'm transmitting them to you now.
"conventional weapons are online and fully charged, sir."
fire at will.
"sir, weapons are back to full capacity."
target voyager. put janeway out of her misery.
"all our ships have been disabled, captain. do you have weapons?"
negative. torpedo launchers are down. i'm setting a collision course. janeway to the fleet. take your temporal shields offline.
"captain, we won't be protected."
exactly. if that ship is destroyed all of history might be restored. and this is one year i'd like to forget. time's up.
the core is destabilising. it's going to cause a temporal incursion within the ship.
when can you bring it online?
we just did.
"in fact, we're in the process of charting a new course home."
"well, i'd say this is cause for celebration."
"a vessel is approaching off the port bow, captain."
on screen.
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
you've entered krenim space. state your identity.
"captain janeway of the starship voyager. we're just passing through, trying to get home."
this region is in dispute. i suggest you avoid our territory.
thanks for the warning.
good journey.
"tom, plot a course around krenim space."
"aye, sir."
"so, what do you think? how about a ground-breaking ceremony for our new lab?"
sounds great.
i think i'll replicate a bottle of saint emillion for the occasion. 2370. i hear that was a good year.
good morning.
good morning.
join me for breakfast?
in a little while. i still have a few more calculations.
there are always a few more calculations. it's a beautiful day. spend it with me.
i suppose i can make the time.
neelix.
tom. been doing a little shopping?
it's a present for b'elanna.
what is it?
"well, it's sort of personal."
of course. say no more. i'm on my way for a little romantic rendezvous myself.
"neelix, are you wearing cologne?"
"talchok musk. very enticing scent, don't you think?"
"well, it certainly is musky."
i'm going to see talli again.
"ooo, that was fast work. where are you taking her?"
"well, actually i haven't gotten that far yet. i'm going to visit her shop under the pretext of buying some produce for the ship, and then i thought i'd just sort of segue smoothly into some dinner and dancing."
sounds like a good strategy.
"do you really think so? i mean, you used to be quite the lady's man."
used to be?
"i mean, of course, you're involved now, so you won't be availing yourself of all the beautiful, fascinating and very open-minded mari women."
"neelix, are you trying to depress me?"
"i just, i haven't been with anyone since kes, and i'm feeling a little rusty. i could use some advice."
the best advice i can give you is to just be yourself.
right. be myself.
"actually, that's the second best piece of advice."
what's the first?
go a little easier on the musk.
"i'm sorry, mister guill, but that's my final offer."
"actually, captain, i sense you'd be willing to raise your price to three hundred renns. lieutenant torres needs this resonator coil to upgrade voyager's communications systems."
telepaths.
wait a minute. i sense you'd be willing to settle for two fifty.
you must have read my mind.
ow! ow! hey!
i'm sorry.
are you hurt?
"no, no, i'm fine. i just wish people would look where they're going."
it's been a pleasure doing business with you.
i'll finish up here. why don't you go get neelix?
this is some of the loveliest fruit i've seen in a long time.
actually it's been one of our worst water plum seasons in years. i don't think you'll find them very sweet.
"oh, how wonderfully tart. they'll make excellent preserves."
neelix? why do you want me to tug on your whiskers?
excuse me?
"that is what you're thinking, isn't it? that you'd like me to tug on your whiskers?"
"well, as a matter of fact"
i'd love to. do you have time to wait until i close?
"yes, i think i can rearrange my schedule."
i guess you could say i'm becoming obsolete.
in what sense?
"there's virtually no crime left in our society. it took many years, but just walk through our streets, look around. violence no longer exists."
impressive.
i'm one of the last officers still working for the constabulary.
and no doubt one of the best. i'm curious to know more about your crime prevention methods.
under one condition: i want to see voyager. learn about your methods.
i am about to perform my daily security rounds. join me. they are routine but informative.
wonderful
the transport site is this way.
you prefer speaking aloud. why is that?
i've grown accustomed to it over the years. there are very few telepaths in starfleet.
whatever you prefer.
neelix? ready to leave?
"ah, no, ah, you go ahead. we haven't finished examining the produce."
help! somebody help me please! stop him! help me!
"this will teach you to watch where you're going, you idiot! you idiot!"
somebody get a doctor!
why? why were you beating that man?
i don't know.
"your brig, it's a puzzling concept. shutting someone away as punishment. do you find that it rehabilitates the prisoner?"
the brig is primarily used as a means of ensuring the safety of others.
in what sense?
"for example, if we find ourselves with a hostile alien in our custody, we may need to confine the individual until we can locate the proper authorities."
i see.
and on rare occasions we have been forced to incarcerate a crew member who has committed a serious infraction.
i'm surprised that one of your people could be capable of doing something serious enough to warrant imprisonment.
"it's extremely rare. in any case, the brig has been occupied for less than one percent of our journey."
"forgive me, tuvok, but it seems barbaric."
"if all species were as enlightened as yours and mine, there would be no need for prisons."
bridge to commander tuvok.
"go ahead, ensign."
chief examiner
nimira's been recalled to the surface. there's been some sort of attack
in the marketplace.
i've never seen so much blood before.
it's all right.
i heard about someone getting beaten once when i was a little girl.
it's all over now.
i had nightmares for weeks.
it's okay. it's all right.
he was confused. he said he didn't realise what he'd done.
i don't understand why nobody tried to help him.
"people were shocked. violence is almost unheard of here. but when it does occur, we like to investigate thoroughly."
can we help?
"yes. i would like you, mister neelix and lieutenant torres to answer some questions."
you have our complete cooperation.
"chief examiner, are you suspicious of my colleagues for some reason?"
"no, lieutenant. i'm simply conducting an investigation. please, follow me."
"please, have a seat."
i will be monitoring your thoughts telepathically during the interview. this transcription device will log your engrammatic activity so i can review your statement later.
"let me get this straight. not only are you going to read my mind, you're going to record my thoughts."
yes.
"i guess it'd be pretty tough to keep a secret from you, hmm?"
how long had you been in the market place when the attack occurred?
"an hour, maybe a little longer."
and exactly where were you standing?
directly across the square.
"from where you were, did you have a clear view of the attack?"
"not at first. we just heard yelling, then as we got closer we saw what was happening."
what exactly brought you to the market in the first place?
captain janeway and i had an appointment with mister guill.
for what purpose?
we'd met him the day before. he's said he could geta spare resonator coil for us.
i see. and the two men involved in the altercation. had you seen either of them before?
"i'd never seen the victim, but the attacker. i think he was the same man who bumped into b'elanna."
bumped into her? are you certain?
yes. they collided accidentally.
when exactly did this happen?
just as we'd settled on a price.
he seemed to be in quite a hurry.
do you recall what you were thinking at the time?
what i was thinking? what does it matter?
"please, try to remember. it may be important."
"i didn't think about it much, and no one was hurt. and i was busy trying to sort out the coins. i'm not used to handling currency."
what was i thinking? i was thinking how i can make a delicious pie with those water plums.
"are you sure that's all, mister neelix?"
"yes, of course. what else would i be thinking about?"
i suppose i was a little annoyed.
can you be more specific?
"all right. i guess i was thinking, my foot hurt. i mean, the idiot stepped right on it."
did you call him an idiot?
of course not.
but you thought it?
i guess so.
did you also think about retaliating?
it was an accident.
but you said he hurt you. it didn't occur to you to hurt him back?
i'd never do that.
but you thought about it.
how am i supposed to remember?
yes or no. did you think about hurting him? yes or no?
"well, maybe for a split second."
"i mean, he should have been watching where he was going. but i realised that he didn't do it on purpose, so i shook it off and i left. why? what does it matter what i was thinking?"
"lieutenant b'elanna torres, you are under arrest."
on what charge?
aggravated violent thought resulting in grave bodily harm.
are you saying it's a crime to think about violence?
yes.
that's ridiculous.
"i assure you, it's quite necessary. we were once a society plagued by violence. when we prohibited hostile thought, crime began to drop immediately. over the past three generations, it's all but disappeared."
so you believe that it's all right to tell people what they can and cannot think?
it's an irrefutable fact that violent thoughts from others can lead to violent actions.
"even if b'elanna had a violent thought, it was frane who attacked that man."
"which he only did because he telepathically received that thought from b'elanna. his mind was contaminated by the image and it resulted in a loss of control. he may have committed the physical act, but it was instigated by you."
"where we come from, people are responsible for their own actions."
"and here, people are responsible for their own thoughts. i'm sure you can understand how that's necessary for a race of telepaths."
"yes, i can."
captain.
"i'll accept that your people can be influenced by the thoughts of others, but there were dozens of people in that square. how can you be certain it came from b'elanna?"
"the mari no longer have violent thoughts. it's unlikely any of them could have been responsible. besides, the evidence against b'elanna is clear. she thought about committing a hostile act."
"i'd like to review that evidence myself, if you don't mind."
certainly. but i'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
what happens to b'elanna now?
"we have an enlightened penal system here. unlike some, we don't lock people away to punish them. you'll be released. once you've undergone the engrammatic purge."
the what?
it's a medical procedure that will identify and remove the offending images from your mind.
captain!
"once identified, the images can be removed from frane's mind as well."
memory extraction. that's a dangerous procedure.
"there is a risk of neurological damage, but it's necessary for us to treat frane."
will you at least delay the procedure until i've had the time to review the evidence? will you?
it'll take us about a day to reconfigure our instruments. that's all the time i can give you.
that's all the time i'll need.
"captain, we've got to get b'elanna out of there."
"you know the rules, tom. we can't pick and choose which laws we'll respect and which we won't."
nobody can be expected to control their thoughts.
tell that to the mari.
are you just going to let them put her through this process?
"i'm doing everything i can to stop it. neelix is going to file a diplomatic protest, and tuvok and i will be going over the witness statements. maybe we can poke a few holes in the chief examiner's case."
and if you can't?
then let's hope the doctor can figure out how to reverse an engrammatic purge.
all away personnel have been told to return to the ship as soon as possible.
so much for r and r.
"chakotay, we've got to talk."
have a seat.
here?
i'm sure the captain wouldn't object. what's on your mind?
"while tuvok and the captain are reviewing the evidence, b'elanna's sitting in a mari jail cell waiting for some sort of lobotomy. we can't let that happen."
what did you have in mind?
break her out.
and risk an all-out confrontation with the mari?
they're a bunch of pacifists. they're no match for us.
"you're probably right. but before we start resorting to extreme measures, don't you think we should give the captain a chance to find a legal solution?"
"by the time that happens, it may be too late."
"i'll tell you what. why don't you come up with a rescue plan, one that minimises the possibility of violence, and i'll review it."
"you're just trying to keep me busy, aren't you?"
can you blame me?
"i'm serious about this, chakotay."
"so am i. if your plan is sound and the captain doesn't have any luck on her end, i'll recommend we attempt the rescue."
thanks. i'll get right on it.
"tom. i may have let you sit in the captain's chair, but remember, she's still the boss."
then you don't accept the chief examiner's conclusion?
i'm not dismissing it. but i'm not going to accept it blindly either.
i have spent a great deal of time with nimira over the last few days. she clearly is a very skilled investigator.
i'm sure she is.
and this isn't the first time lieutenant torres' violent proclivities have created problems.
no argument there. but i have a hard time buying that one fleeting thought makes her responsible for a vicious attack.
"from what i've learned, crime here is a result of exposure to violent thought, much as it was on vulcan before my people learned to control their emotions. in my opinion, the mari should be applauded for their efforts."
"well, i'm sure their intentions are admirable, but i'm not about to let them scramble b'elanna's brain without a fight."
but we must prepare ourselves for the probability that she will turn out to be culpable for the crime.
"maybe so. and then again, maybe not. take a look at this. i don't mean to accuse your friend nimira of being less than thorough, tuvok, but don't you find that just the least bit curious?"
new evidence.
"it concerns the attacker, mister frane. according to your own security records, he was arrested on four previous occasions for harbouring violent thoughts. you classified him as an habitual perpetrator of hostile images."
true. but those thoughts were purged each time. he spent years in neurogenic restructuring. the records also say he was cured.
"still, it is possible that frane had a relapse. that he alone is responsible for his actions in the marketplace."
"possible, but unlikely. our engrammatic scans of frane show that lieutenant torres' thought was prevalent in his mind during the attack."
and you are certain no other violent thoughts were present?
i'm beginning to feel like i'm the one being investigated.
"i am simply exploring all logical options. as a fellow law enforcement officer, you should understand that."
"i do. and i'm willing to share my findings with you. but if you're trying to prove your crewmate's innocence, you're too late. the case is closed. do you think that this is easy for me? i don't want to harm b'elanna, but i don't have a choice. that thought has to be contained, otherwise we risk further violence, maybe even a city wide panic. you told me your people spent centuries learning how to control their violent impulses. i know we haven't achieved your level of discipline, but we're trying. i thought you'd understand."
"i am not judging your culture. in fact, i admire it. i have enjoyed your company in particular. but i cannot abandon my responsibility to b'elanna. i must continue my own investigation."
go right ahead. but i intend to proceed with the engrammatic purge.
"telepathy. i don't like it, never have. it's bad for negotiations, it's bad for relationships, and it's certainly been bad for b'elanna."
the fault was her own.
what are you talking about?
she was careless with her thoughts. the result was violence.
b'elanna's not used to being around telepaths. that doesn't make her guilty.
then her crime was ignorance. a common affliction among your crew.
what's that supposed to mean?
"you make contact with alien species without sufficient understanding of their nature. as a result, voyager's directive to seek out new civilisations often ends in conflict."
"what you call ignorance, we call exploration. and sometimes it means taking a few risks. but it's certainly better than assimilating everything in your path."
your goal is to share knowledge. assimilation is the perfect means of attaining that goal.
perfect.
"good morning, miss tembit. your usual selection?"
"yes, please."
okay.
"oh, i'm so sorry."
idiot! watch what you're doing!
she's dead.
i can't believe she'd dead.
"i know this is difficult for you, mister neelix, but try to recount for me everything that happened."
seven and i were packing to return to the ship. we heard a scream. i went running. the old lady was just standing over talli's body holding the bloody knife in her hand. i didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
did the old woman say anything?
not that i remember. she was as shocked and confused as anyone else. do you think this is somehow connected with the other attack?
i am not certain. but it strikes me as more than coincidence that two violent altercations have occurred within two days in a city which purports to have eliminated virtually all crime.
: bridge to commander tuvok.
tuvok here.
chief examiner nimira wants to see you. she's requesting permission to transport aboard.
permission granted. have her escorted to the briefing room. tuvok out. we will continue later.
"commander. she was a wonderful young woman. whoever's responsible for her death, find them and see that they're brought to justice."
"i will do my best, mister neelix."
thanks for seeing me.
i heard what happened. do you have any idea what caused this latest attack?
i just finished interviewing the old woman.
and?
she attacked the victim in response to the same violent thought that motivated the previous beating.
b'elanna's thought? but both she and frane are in custody. how could the thought have been passed to anyone else?
i don't know. that's why i'm here. i need your help.
then you shall have it.
"thank you. i don't know why that thought is still contaminating people, but i have got to put a stop to it. i've never dealt with a murder before, but you've had experience with homicide investigations."
i have.
i thought i would start by tracing the old woman's whereabouts for the past few days to see where she might have encountered the thought.
"a wise choice. in the meantime, i would like to interview b'elanna more extensively. perhaps a fresh perspective might uncover facts you hadn't considered."
i'll arrange it immediately.
i'm not sure i like the idea of a mind meld any better than an engrammatic purge.
it will be a limited meld. i will focus exclusively on your memories of the events surrounding the crime. it poses no danger. are you ready? your mind to my mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. recall your encounter with mister frane. he bumped into you. what happened next?
i guess that's when i had the thought about hitting him.
and after that?
guill came over and asked if i was hurt.
and what were you thinking at that moment?
why?
i'm sensing something more to the encounter than what you've told me. try to recall. it may be important.
"well, he was just holding me by the shoulders."
you said he'd been reading your mind during the negotiation. was he still doing it?
i don't know.
you experienced negative feelings about him.
he gave me the creeps.
in what sense?
he wanted something. something terrible.
what the hell? why didn't i remember that before?
"you may be recalling an unconscious thought you had at the time, or an intuition. perhaps i should ask mister guill."
"mister guill. i'm commander tuvok, voyager's chief of security."
my children get upset when i'm late for supper. if you're here to do business we can make an appointment for tomorrow.
i'm here to talk to you about the attack.
why me?
"my crewmate, lieutenant torres, has been charged with the crime. i believe you're acquainted with her."
"lieutenant torres, yes. she was arrested?"
the chief examiner believes it was her violent thought which prompted the beating.
ah. she seemed like such a pleasant young woman.
apparently she was almost knocked over while doing business with you. do you recall that?
"yes. a man accidentally ran into her. you're not like the others from your ship, are you? you're a telepath."
that is correct.
why are you so curious about what happened?
i am conducting my own investigation of the crime.
"i see. for a moment i thought you had another reason for asking. you struggle with violent thoughts as well. terrible images, but they're hidden deep within your mind."
"i am in control of those images. all members of the vulcan race learn to inhibit emotions. if my unconscious thoughts are disturbing you, i will attempt to suppress them further."
"no, please, don't trouble yourself. i can't see them clearly enough to be affected."
i sense that you are fascinated with my unconscious thoughts. that you would like to see more of them if you could.
"no. i was just thinking, maybe i could help you."
help me?
in learning how to deal with these dark impulses.
"no, thank you. i have sufficient means of controlling them."
i'm sure you do. any other questions?
no.
"then if you'll excuse me, i really can't be late for the table."
do you have the money?
three thousand renns.
i have something exciting for you tonight.
why are you following us?
i was thinking abut what you said. your interest in my unconscious thoughts. perhaps we could help each other.
how would we do that?
"by telepathically exchanging violent images. that is what you want, isn't it? to see what's buried in my unconscious."
who is he?
quiet. why should i trust you?
because you know we are very much alike. perhaps i was mistaken.
"wait. maybe we can be of use to each other, but you'll have to get rid of this."
"come back later, malin. if i'm right, i'll have thoughts to share that are darker than anything you could imagine."
well?
fascinating.
now. show me.
i'll need a few moments to recover.
i'm surprised you're so easily tired. your telepathic abilities are strong.
it is not often that i exercise those skills.
"there must be violent thoughts to be had from your shipmates, whether they want to share them or not. after all, they couldn't stop a telepath from probing their minds, could they?"
is that how you acquire your merchandise?
"sometimes i buy, sometimes i find a person like you who's willing to share, and yes, when the opportunity presents itself, i take what i need."
which is what you did to lieutenant torres.
"frane took her thought, not me."
so you know mister frane?
only casually.
well enough to be in business with him?
why do you ask?
"i am interested in the thought he acquired from b'elanna. her violent tendencies have always fascinated me, yet i've never succeeded in probing her mind. if you could help me purchase that thought"
it's impossible. frane's already had it purged.
odd. i was certain you possessed it.
me?
didn't you extract the thought from b'elanna as well just after she collided with frane?
what?
i re-evaluated b'elanna's memories of the incident. she remembers that you probed her mind.
she remembers incorrectly.
"perhaps. or perhaps you did extract that image, which would explain why that same thought is still in circulation. why it prompted a murder this morning."
enough! it's time you gave me what you promised.
the only person you'll be sharing thoughts with tonight is the chief examiner.
where are you going?
stand aside.
tuvok's taking me into custody.
no!
still no sign of him.
try a multiphasic bioscan.
"we're being hailed, captain. it's nimira."
"on screen. chief examiner, have you had any luck locating tuvok?"
i'm afraid not.
i'd like to send a search party.
i can't allow that.
why not?
we can't risk further violations of our laws.
that's ridiculous.
tom. i really don't think we pose a serious threat.
"there's nothing more to discuss. lieutenant torres will be purged, then returned to you."
"captain, you can't let them do that."
the decision's been made. i'm sorry.
let go of me.
"b'elanna, please. try to relax."
"oh, you have got to be kidding."
sedate her.
no. wait.
proceed.
you won't escape punishment for your crimes.
quiet.
you are responsible for a death.
i never meant that to happen. the old woman begged me for that thought. i had to help her. here.
you're justifying murder.
"enough. malin, hold him still. now, show me."
"you're holding back. i haven't seen the best of it yet, have i?"
no.
then show me.
"if i show you, will you let me go?"
yes.
come in closer.
don't be alarmed. this will allow you to see the deepest recesses of my mind. my mind to your mind. my thoughts to your thoughts.
yes. good. this is the side of you i wanted to know.
what's happening?
"we are locked in a vulcan mind meld. you don't understand the truth of violence. its darkness, its power."
"please, stop."
"increase the electrochemical displacement, but be very careful with the synaptic potentials. one miscalculation and we could permanently damage her cerebral cortex."
communications centre to chief examiner nimira.
nimira.
captain janeway insists on speaking with you. she says it's extremely urgent.
"relay her signal. what is it, captain?"
it's imperative that you discontinue lieutenant torres' engrammatic extraction immediately.
commander tuvok has found new evidence which proves her innocence.
i hope this interruption is justified. suspending an engrammatic purge once it's begun is highly irregular.
then let's not waste any more time. commander.
"i have discovered that guill and frane are responsible for the beating in the marketplace, and consequently for talli's murder."
"guill, the merchant?"
that is correct.
what possible involvement could he have? it was frane who acted on the violent thought.
"that is not in dispute. however, lieutenant torres' thought was not transferred accidentally."
i don't understand.
"when guill first met lieutenant torres, he sensed strong, violent tendencies within her. a potential for mental imagery which interested him. in order to exploit that potential, he conspired with frane to provoke b'elanna. they wanted to trigger a violent thought so they could telepathically draw it from her mind."
i can't believe that.
"it is precisely what happened. unfortunately, they underestimated the intensity of the thought. it was more powerful than anything either of them had ever experienced. as a result, frane lost control and attacked the victim."
why would peaceful men like guill and frane want to subject themselves to such hostile images?
"my investigation has uncovered a rather disturbing side of mari society. a black market if you will, in which many of your citizens trade in illicit mental imagery. guill is a very prominent figure in this underground. or was, until i brought him into custody."
why would any of my people want to indulge in that kind of behaviour?
"apparently, outlawing violent thought hasn't made it go away. all you've done is force people to share it in back alleys."
it seems you have a somewhat more serious problem than the random thoughts of a single alien.
"even if i believed you, i'm not sure anyone else would."
then i suggest you interrogate guill yourselves. his engrammatic record will undoubtedly confirm what i've told you.
where is he now?
"we have him confined, in our brig."
"fortunately the mari didn't get very far with the procedure. you can return to duty, lieutenant, though perhaps with one or two fewer violent engrams in that fiery head of yours."
"it's all right, doc. there are plenty more where those came from."
duly warned.
thanks for getting me out of there.
i was merely pursuing the truth.
"so, if i was responsible for passing that thought you would have let them lobotomise me?"
it is incumbent upon us to respect the laws of the societies we visit.
"so, you still a fan of the mari legal system?"
my views have been somewhat modified.
then you're not going to lecture me about losing my temper?
"if you must know, investigating this case has given me a new respect for your inner struggle."
really?
"burdened as you are by your primitive klingon psyche, it is a wonder you are able to keep your violent thoughts under control as much as you do."
thanks. i think.
"you're welcome. of course, there are various vulcan techniques which could help you increase your self-control."
you don't say.
come in.
i must speak with you.
of course. have a seat.
i prefer to stand.
i keep forgetting.
you once encouraged me to express my opinions if i had something relevant to say.
go right ahead.
"you wish to return this vessel to the alpha quadrant, and yet you are following starfleet protocol regarding first contact. the two objectives are incompatible."
how so?
"your philosophy of exploration exposes voyager to constant risk. if you maintain a direct course to earth and avoid all extraneous contact with alien species, it will increase your chances of survival."
"well, that would make a dull ride home."
captain?
"we seek out new races because we want to, not because we're following protocols. we have an insatiable curiosity about the universe."
your chief engineer and security officer were nearly lost today. that is unacceptable.
"to you, maybe, but not to me or my crew. our experience with the mari gave us an insight into a culture we've never encountered."
but that is irrelevant.
no. it's how we gain knowledge.
then we are in disagreement.
good. i dread the day when everyone on this ship agrees with me. i thank you for your opinion but our mission is not going to change.
dismissed.
animali! brutti animali. animali!
"no, leonardo, you are the animali."
a bird who cannot fly.
better than a man who cannot think!
"the pidgeon speaks. cuckoo, cuckooo!"
maestro!
stupido! foolish florentines! a bird is a mechanical instrument that  		works according to mathematical laws. an instrument that surely i can recreate.  		how did it fail?
maybe you underestimated the wingspan?
had not the river arno taken us to its arms we would both have died.
jumping off the bridge was a wise precaution.
"against death, yes. against humiliation, no. the great bird will take  		flight and bring glory to its nest. so i have bragged for months.  		instead, we almost drown with half of florence watching. bah! finito! no more.  		catarina, have you been to france?"
not recently.
"the king of france is a great admirer of mine. the divine leonardo  		is all i hear when i walk through his streets. and what music do i find in the  		streets of florence, eh? the cooing of pigeons and the babbling of fools.  		catarina, we are leaving!"
"you're giving up. again. your beautiful painting of the adoration,  		the great bronze horse in milan, the battle of anghiari. unfinished,  		all of them. you were going to publish your notebooks. you never did.  		you have given up, abandoned your most important works. why?"
"there is a tavern just outside paris, catarina. a charming bistro  		where the wine is"
terremoto!
janeway to the bridge.
"we're under attack, captain."
i'm on my way.
earthquakes and idiots. florence be damned.
who are they and why are they shooting at us?
"unknown, captain. they're not responding to hails."
damage?
none.
i'm reading a slight destabilisation along the shield perimeter.
attempting to compensate.
"er, torres to the bridge."
go ahead.
we just lost the warp diagnostic assembly.
"what do you mean, lost?"
it disappeared.
i'm picking up demterialisations on decks four through twelve.
evasive manoeuvres.
they're matching our course changes.
it's definitely some kind of transporter beam.
fire at will.
"i have the will, but not the means, captain. targeting control is down."
why?
"captain, the main computer processor is gone. we've lost weapons, navigation and  		propulsion."
backup systems are coming online.
"full phasers, manual targeting. keep firing until you hit something."
the other ships are retreating.
chakotay to all decks. full damage reports.
i feel like we've just been mugged.
"they were employing a high-energy transporter beam designed to locate objects of  		technological value, and remove them."
"they removed a lot. five tricorders, three phaser rifles, a couple of photon torpedo casings,  		two antimatter injectors, a month's supply of emergency rations."
no great loss there.
excuse me. you're forgetting the most important thing of all. my mobile emitter.  		without it i'm stuck in sickbay. i can't go anywhere.
"we'll do the best we can, doctor but our top priority is the main computer processor.  		b'elanna, i want a defence against another transporter attack. harry, do everything you can to  		track those ships."
"yes, ma'am."
dismissed.
seven. hey.
if you're here to fraternise i do not have the time.
"actually, the captain wanted me to locate the ships that attacked us.  		i've pushed the long range sensors about as far as they'll go."
and now you believe the sensors can be extended by using  		the deep space imaging system.
"well, yes."
i've been working on that exact procedure for the past two hours.
really? let's have a look.
do you doubt my ability to finish the task?
"look, i came here to work. i realised you'd already started the job so i  		offered to help, that's all. i offered to help."
an algorithmic feedback is interfering with the resolution. decompile data banks  		fifty nine through seventeen and attempt to isolate it. now. or you should leave.
"okay. i'm a pretty easy-going person. i mean, it takes a lot to ruffle my feathers. but that's not true of everybody. you've got to learn how to phrase things a little more diplomatically."
or not.
i'm picking up starfleet signatures from two of the continents.
can you find the main computer processor?
"it's on the northern continent, in what looks like a city, but there's a  		lot of signal interference. i'll never be able to localise it from here."
"captain, i have identified nearly twenty seven kinds of alien ships in orbit of this planet.  		it appears to be an active centre of commerce.  we should be able to place an undercover  		away team on either continent without attracting attention."
"that's good enough for now. tuvok, you and i are going after the processor. tom, neelix,  		i want you on the other continent. find out what you can. at the very least,  		try to get our emergency rations back. chakotay, you have the bridge."
"it never fails to impress me. no matter how vast the differences may be between cultures,  		people always have something that somebody else wants, and trade is born."
"or more to the point, theft."
what have you got?
"the materials in the construction of this city, and the technology  		in use appear to have originated from numerous sources."
no doubt stolen.
the myriad signatures have resulted in high interference levels. i am unable to.  		a moment. i am picking up a starfleet signature.
the computer processor?
i don't believe so. the signal magnitude is too low. the signature is  		approaching.
"catarina! che meraviglia! out of my way, out of my way! scusi, scusi. catarina.  		catarina. welcome. welcome to america."
"tell me, catarina, what do you think of the new world?"
how did you get here?
"a question i have asked myself many times. one moment i was packing for my journey to france, the next i was  		in this land of marvels. possibly, upon leaving my workshop i was accosted by  		spanish sailors, rendered unconscious, delivered to a galleon in the port of  		genoa, and carried like a sack of grain across the vast atlantic. curious ears."
"my travelling companion, tuvok."
"ah, what the old philosophers say is true.  		monstrous and wonderful are the peoples of undiscovered lands.  		but tell me, catarina, how did you come to the americas?"
"oh, it's a long story. a portuguese ship, some turkish pirates,  		a couple of hurricanes. i'll tell you about it some other time."
excuse me. there is the man i have been looking for. he has an apparatus  		that i need for my next invention. my patron is a demanding taskmaster.
your patron?
"the prince of this city. buon giorno, signore."
the da vinci character is interpreting this world through the  		limited capacity of his holodeck programme.
he sees everything in sixteenth century terms.
but what is he doing here?
i was running the da vinci simulation when we were attacked. his         programme must have been active in the computer's memory when the processor was beamed off the ship.
and then downloaded into the doctor's mobile emitter. but by whom?
"his patron, the prince?"
"marvellous, no?"
"a plasma injector conduit, starfleet issue."
call it what you will. with this machine i can make mercury flow in three directions at once.  		you must see my new workshop. the prince has been very supportive. andiamo!
let's go.
"so, catarina, what do you think of this place? my workshop  		in florence was but a cave of ignorance in comparison."
your new patron gave you all this?
"he is the perfect prince. intelligent, but not overly so.  		in awe of my talent, but not threatened by it. and above all, and  		most importantly, his purse is inexhaustible."
and in return for all this support?
"i give him my ideas. i have even resurrected my great bird, like the  		phoenix of legend. they have materials here, catarina, that are so strong and  		so light that surely my prototype will ascend to the heavens."
be careful!  		they have found a way to harness the energy of a  		thunderstorm and to expel it with great force. a pistole that shoots  		not a lead ball but a bolt of lightning.
i'd like to meet this patron you yours.
"and so you shall, this very evening, but i caution you. he is as ruthless as a borgia."
who sold you these things?
i didn't come here to be interrogated. you told me you  		have a warp coil to trade.
i said you could talk with commander chakotay. i didn't say he'd  		necessarily do business with you.
"well, this is a waste of my time."
i agree. there's the door.
what?
goodbye. make sure he doesn't get lost on the way out.
"no, no, no. wait, wait. his name is tau. he controls the seventh province in the north."
he sells weapons and technology.
yes.
which he confiscates from passing ships.
"yes, using his translocator device. which he also stole. it's made him a rich man."
there are a few items i'd like to get back. where can i find him?
i deal with a go-between. i've answered enough of your questions. let's talk about  		that warp coil. i'm looking for something that
you can keep what you've got. we'll call it even.
this was a waste of my time.
not really. these colours look good on you.
"torpedoes, plasma grenades, particle beam rifles. i can even get a ceremonial spear if you're interested."
i am not interested.
"my point is, no matter what the weaponry, if you desire it, chances are i have it or i can get it."
your prices are said to be unreasonable.
"unreasonable is such a strong term. but if i can't sell to you, i'll sell to  		one of the other colonies in your system. a violent sort, your neighbours, aren't they?  		i'd hate to make your life difficult by offering my weapons to them. but if you don't give me a choice"
there can be no doubt our computer processor is not in the city.
"well, that certainly makes things a little more difficult. leonardo's new patron is quite  		the business man."
we may have no choice but to do business with him.
catarina! here are some friends i want you to meet.
try to keep our hologram occupied.
but captain
make small talk.
vulcans do not make small talk.
improvise.
thank you. that is very considerate.
"catarina, wait a minute."
"mister da vinci, how have you been?"
benissimo. now if you'll pardon me.
i wish to speak with you.
what about?
about you. you are most intriguing.
"ah, grazie. and you, signore tuvok, are equally provocative. where exactly are you from?"
scandinavia.
"so, what do the scandinavians think of this new world?"
"it is fascinating, and you are obviously enjoying it."
"beyond words. yes. italy is already a fading memory. the city is  		full of mechanical marvels, the countryside alive with creatures strange  		and wonderful."
i'm curious. how have you spent your time here?
"i work on my inventions and my art, and i accompany the prince  		when he goes to visit his great fortresses. well, this er, fascinating conversation has left me as dry as vulcan."
vulcan?
an island off sicily. have you been there?
no.
pity.
we'll talk later.
good evening.
and to you. enjoying yourself?
not yet.
no? how can i change that?
by having exactly what i want and selling it to me at a low price.
"the former's quite likely, but as for the latter, i don't sell inexpensive merchandise."
i have a client who runs a colony about twenty parsecs from here. his  		computer is outmoded so i'm looking for a replacement.
"a computer that could coordinate the systems of an entire colony. that's  		no small order, but i think i might have something that will interest you."
"hello, computer, and how are you today?"
all systems are functioning  within normal parameters.
verbal interface. impressive.
"computer, tell us your technical specifications."
simultaneous access to forty seven million data channels. transluminal processing at  		five hundred seventy five trillion calculations per nanosecond.
interested?
operational temperature margins from ten degrees kelvin to one thousand  		seven hundred ninety degrees kelvin.
"i could sell it to you, but i could hardly let it go for anything less than a warship. or  		we could find something else in your price range."
we should be looking for a stronghold or storage facility. any  		place tau might keep the stolen technology.
"there are several possibilities all within a ten kilometre radius of  		the city. i must admit, your mister da  		vinci is an astute observer of nature. these maps couldn't be improved upon by  		voyager's topographical computer."
"he was a renaissance man, tuvok. interpreted, reinterpreted, deconstructed,         fantasised about all through history. vasari thought he was an angel. freud thought  		he had a problem with his mother. james t. kirk claimed he met him, although the  		evidence is less than conclusive."
"buongiorno, amici."
"good morning, maestro. did you sleep well?"
"too well, i'm afraid. my apologies, catarina. the morning is half gone.  		nevertheless, the images that come before the eyes upon awakening can be inspiring."
indeed.
"catarina, where did i leave my silver tipped pen? i could swear it was  		here on the"
"captain, we should return to voyager. with my tricorder readings and  		leonardo's maps we can use the ship's sensors to triangulate the exact  		location of our processor."
we'll work on two fronts. you go back to the ship. i'll stay  		on the surface and keep working with leonardo. he has access to tau and  		he knows the territory.
"inadvisable. charming as your childhood hero may be, the programme         was  		not designed for use outside the holodeck."
"this is leonardo da vinci we're talking about. simulation or not,  		he's one of the greatest creative minds in earth's history."
the programme reproduces the entire range of da vinci's behaviour.  		his genius and his notorious unreliability.
"we have an opportunity here, and i want to take advantage of it."
tuvok to voyager. one to beam up.
table. where did he go?
back to the ship.
the ship? you mean the portuguese are still in the harbour?
"no, not exactly. but they're nearby."
"ah. mad sea dogs, the portuguese."
"so, what's new?"
new?
what's been happening on the ship?
nothing of consequence. the captain and tuvok are still searching for the processor.
what's the mood?
"if you're referring to the crew morale, they seemed focused on their mission."
hmm. i heard there was something of a fuss in the mess hall last night.
a trivial misunderstanding.
"oh? you seen in excellent health. most of your implants are stable, but  		your optical interface is misaligned again. i told you to come in for  		maintenance once a week. now, what happened in the mess hall?"
lieutenant torres and i were working on some astrometric data. there was a disagreement.
i understand things got a little heated.
lieutenant torres became emotional. she chose to display hostility rather than to counter my argument.
what did she say exactly?
"it is irrelevant. suffice it to say i was correct, she was not."
"details, seven. i want specifics."
i see no reason to discuss these trivialities.
"without my mobile emitter i am a prisoner in here. i need to know what is going  		on beyond these walls, trivial or not."
torres referred to me as an automaton. she also employed a series of profane  		klingon insults. shall i translate them for you?
by all means. i'd very much.
tuvok to seven of nine. report to the astrometrics lab.
you may go.
"i'll be right there, commander."
come back whenever you feel like talking. i'll be right here. all by myself.
i am entering leonardo's maps and my tricorder data into the imaging system.
i will create a search pattern for our missing processor.
"da vinci has accurately rendered the topographical detail. however, his  		coordinate axes are pre-cartesian. you will have to convert them."
"understood. it is puzzling that even a vulcan would refer to a holographic  		character by name, as if it were alive. it seems somehow illogical. localising grid.  		altitude twenty kilometres."
one of these storage facilities undoubtedly contains the processor. increase  		sensor resolution to maximum and scan the area.
there. our computer processor is inside this structure.
"unfortunately, the building is surrounded by a dispersion field. transport will be impossible."
"if the captain can get inside the facility and reach the processor itself, she may be able to assist us."
"if she were to initiate a power surge in the processor, it might produce a signal strong  		enough for us to lock onto."
that is what i was referring to.
i will inform the captain.
it's not too far across open country. leonardo says he's been there  		and he can help me get inside.
understood.
"stand by for my signal. if i can find the processor, be prepared  		to beam it back to voyager."
"aye, captain. tuvok out."
so it's captain. i see you and my hologram are old friends.
"my engineers have developed a defence against your transporter, so i  		suggest that you return what you took from us and let me go."
or what? you're in no position to bargain. the only ones who will bargain will  		be your crew and it will cost them a great deal to get their captain back.  		i wonder what you're worth to them.
he'll be fine. let's move.
i'm not going.
you said you'd help me.
"i have already gone too far. he was threatening you, i had no  		alternative, but i must be here when he recovers his senses. i will try to explain.  		maybe if i am lucky, he will not have me executed."
we are leaving. your time here is over.
i will not leave this new world.
your new world is a prison. you are under his control.
"when are we not in prison? hmm? when are our lives free from the  		influence of those who have more power than us? if this new world is a cage,  		then it is a cage of gold, of marvels, of opportunities. if this prince is violent, violence can be tempered."
"you can't stay here forever, leonardo. europe is your home."
"europe is despicable! here i am free to do what i wish. free from judgment,  		free to fail, but without a sense of shame, without, without the taunts of the ignorant."
"leonardo, whether you want to admit it or not they do need you back home.  		in florence, milan, avignon, they need your genius, they need your heart. and  		right now i need you, too. so come on."
"i will not go for florence or milan or avignon. but for you, catarina, for you i will go."
i've lost the captain's comm. badge signature.
scan for the holoemitter.
it's four point seven kilometres outside the city.
so leonardo's on the move. is the captain with him?
her comm. badge may have malfunctioned.
or she may have been discovered.
should i beam da vinci back to the ship?
"if the captain is with him and attempting to recover the processor, she may need  		his assistance."
keep a lock on the mobile emitter and stand by.
"aye, sir."
where's the entrance?
i can't recall.
why not?
"these fortresses, i've been to half a dozen of them. all are similar  		but each is different."
"catarina, observe the construction, like the veins and arteries  		of a great animal. now, this is the way to build, using nature as your guide."
no more lessons. i need to get into this building and i need to get into it now.
that is not the way an apprentice should address her master.
"maestro, your prince is going to come after us. the only escape is inside."
escape? we will be trapped inside.
"no. there is a wondrous invention inside this building. it's called a  		computer processor. we can use it to send a beacon to the portuguese ship, and  		they'll come and rescue us."
"computer. this invention, how does it work?"
"well, it's complicated, but trust me when i say it can send messages over  		great distances. all we have to do is find it and we will be rescued. but the  		question is, how do we get inside?"
"shadow and sunlight. shadow and sunlight. the prince, like any other  		thief, will fear theft above all else. so this stronghold will have but one  		entryway, on the side facing away from the sun."
so the bright light will be in the eyes of anyone who might attack.
esato.
i'm no longer reading the mobile emitter.
they've gone inside the structure.
"commander, they're being pursued. over thirty armed guards are  		converging on the storage facility."
all available power to the transporters. let's try to get them out  		of there.
even theseus could not negotiate this labyrinth.
not without a compass.
your compass is speaking to you.
this way.
a trove of invention.
"the prince has done well for himself. phasers, warp plasma injectors, a site-to-site transporter."
your computer?
"yes. computer, do you recognise my voice?"
affirmative.
"well, that's a start."
che bella! there's a mechanical woman inside.
"in a way, yes. initiate a level four induction relay overload."
that procedure is not recommended.
command override. janeway pi one one zero.
authorisation confirmed. initiating overload.
that's it.
and now?
we wait for the portuguese.
commander. i'm detecting a power surge in the subspace frequency range.
"could be the processor. lock on. increase power to the confinement beam. with  		any luck, we might be able to pull the captain out of there along with it."
"step close, leonardo. we're going for a ride."
i don't understand.
trust me.
"the building is probably surrounded by now. there's only one way out.  		maestro, come here."
"catarina, what just happened to me? i was shot, yet i live. such things are not possible."
"this is an invention from another land. it's called a site to site transporter.  		in the blink of an eye, it can move us out of this building and a few kilometres away  		from here."
how?
come on.
i must have an explanation.
"leonardo, you've always said that it's a poor apprentice who can't surpass her master.  		there are things in this world that i understand, and you don't."
madonna mia.
the processor is on board.
the captain?
still on the planet.
commander. thirteen vessels are approaching voyager from the surface.
"tom, take us into a higher orbit. bridge to torres. i want that processor back  		online. we've still got a captain down there."
acknowledged.
i cannot believe it. i will not believe it. my mind cannot accept the evidence of my eyes.  		is this sorcery? are we in purgatory?
neither. you said yourself this place was full of marvels.
"marvels, yes, but this is magic. enchantment, not science. and i refuse to believe in enchantment."
i'll explain later. we've got to keep moving.
"no! i must understand. catarina, to see objects disappear into thin air. to see  		lightning pass through my body. are we spirits? catarina, am i dead?"
"let me ask you something. if you were something other than a human being.  		if you were a different kind of animal. if you were a small bird, a sparrow. what would your world be like?"
"i should make my home in a tree, in the branch of an elm. i should hunt insects for food,  		straw for my nest, and in the springtime i should sing for a companion."
"and you would know nothing of the politics of florence, the cutting of marble or mathematics?"
of course not.
but why not?
my mind would be too small.
as a sparrow your mind would be too small? even with the best of teachers?
"if aristotle himself were to perch on my branch and lecture till he fell off from exhaustion,  		still the limits of my mind would prevent me from understanding."
"and as a man, can you accept that there may be certain realities beyond the limits of your comprehension?"
i could not accept that. and i would be a fool.
spread out.
come on.
"catarina, this way. up the hill. i know just the escape."
"torres to bridge. we're in business. we've got full navigation, full propulsion"
and full transporters.
"good work, b'elanna."
sensors show the captain and da vinci have left the structure. if we can dip into a  		lower orbit i should be able to lock onto the mobile emitter.
set the confinement beam wide and prepare to beam both of them back to the ship. 		how close do we have to be?
at least five hundred kilometres from the surface.
those ships will try to block our descent.
ready for some fancy flying?
you bet.
"momento, catarina. escape, signorina, is very near."
"i'm starting to wonder. where are you, chakotay?"
help me to the summit.
"we're at one thousand kilometres, nine fifty, nine hundred."
the ships are powering weapons.
go to red alert.
shields are holding.
eight hundred and fifty kilometres.
evasive manoeuvres.
"when petrarch climbed mount verdoun, and saw all europe below him, he knew  		he was witnessing the birth of a new age. he was witnessing the renaissance.  		the rebirth of our world. so, catarina, at this summit here, you and i will be reborn.  		reborn, with wings."
this could be a problem.
hurry. there's not much time.
"sir, they seem to be on the edge of a precipice, but we're still too  		high for transport."
you've made some improvements.
"i took your advice after the last attempt, and  		increased the reach of the wings."
and the angle of attack?
"yes, yes, that too. unfortunately, the river arno is quite absent.  		this time, if we fail, only the stones will  		break our fall."
the wing is stationary. that's good. this looks like duranium alloy.  		should be light enough.
"catarina, this time it will work."
let's find out.
"i'm reading weapons fire on the surface near the captain's  		position. we're running out of time, sir."
seven hundred kilometres.
"hold on, kathryn. just a few more seconds."
"together, up."
andiamo.
"catarina, we're flying!"
like the birds!
like the birds!
"i have a fix on the captain. they are in mid-air, on what  		appears to be a crude gliding apparatus."
five hundred kilometres.
i'm locking on. broad confinement beam.
energise.
got them. i've beamed the whole contraption into cargo bay one.
"get us out of here, mister paris."
"leonardo, where are you going?"
"france. these florentines do not deserve my genius. i have  		written to the king of france telling  		him of my adventures in the new world, and invited him to soar  		with me from the towers of his castle."
are you sure that's a good idea?
why not? we ourselves have tested the design.
but the materials. you'll never find those metals in france.
"no? then others will suffice. machines that fly through the air. lightning flung from one's hands. mechanical women who live in boxes. these things i have seen. and these things i must recreate. and who knows, possibly improve upon."
"leonardo, i think that little flight of ours went to your head."
"and my heart. my oldest memory, catarina, is of a  		great bird perched on my bed, its feathers  		open towards me as if summoning me. you yourself have  		accused me of giving up,  		of failing to complete my projects."
i was trying to encourage you.
"no, you we're right. all my life i have wanted to fly.  		perhaps my failure to do so has  		caused my heart to remain in flight, leaping from one thing to  		another, never satisfied, never complete."
and now that you've actually flown?
now who knows what i cannot accomplish.
i'd like to find out. give my regards to the king of france.
"catarina, will you walk with me to my carriage?"
it would be my pleasure.
thank you.
"oh, you look like a man who could use more coffee."
"keep it coming. i'm working on my monthly ops report. so much has happened in the last few weeks on this ship, i'm going to be up all night."
this firenut blend should keep you eyes open.
potent stuff! thanks.
neelix.
yes.
"i know you have your hands full this evening, but i could use your help."
"at your service, commander."
we're approaching a class one nebula. sensors are picking up traces of protomatter inside. i understand you've dealt with it before?
absolutely. when i was making my living as a trader. protomatter's one of the most sought-after commodities. it's the best energy source in the quadrant.
we could use your expertise in collecting a sample. we're leaving at fourteen hundred hours. see you in the shuttlebay?
"i'll be there, sir."
these nutritional supplements are unacceptable.
what's wrong?
they are pungent.
that's the whole idea. i've been adding talaxian spices to broaden your palette.
my palette is sufficiently broad.
why settle for sufficient? the doctor tells me you have a full complement of taste buds. you've hardly begun to use them. come by the mess hall thursday night. it's the first day of prixin. we'll have an impressive array of exotic cuisine.
prixin?
the talaxian celebration of family. we observe it every year on voyager. now that you're part of the family
what should i do to prepare?
"nothing. it's not a mission, seven, it's a party."
ensign wildman to neelix.
neelix here.
"i hate to bother you, but naomi's having trouble getting to sleep again. would you mind?"
"no bother at all. i'm on my way. if you'll excuse me, duty calls."
naomi? i don't recall that designation on the crew manifest.
"that's because she's not a member of the crew. naomi was the first child born on voyager. i'm her godfather, and the only one who can get her to sleep lately. bon appétit."
no monsters here.
good. check the replicator.
nothing.
"naomi, maybe neelix should check your room so you can go to bed."
okay. in there.
nobody here.
there.
"ah, there's not a monster in sight."
can you stay longer? i'm afraid to go to sleep.
"honey, neelix has to go to work."
it's all right. you know what i think about when i'm afraid to go to sleep?
no. what?
the great forest.
what's that?
"it's a place my people believe we're all going to go to someday. it's a beautiful, beautiful forest filled with sunlight, and all the people who ever loved me are gathered there to watch over me as i sleep, to protect me."
really?
"when i think about that forest and those people, i'm not afraid to sleep anymore."
do you think those people watch over me too?
"i know they do. now, i'm going to be away for the next couple of days. so, if you're afraid to sleep i want you to think of that great forest."
all right.
pleasant dreams.
"night, neelix."
cylinder.
oh! sorry. i didn't realise you were home.
i was regenerating.
i see.
do you require assistance?
"no, no, no. i have a small containment cylinder stored here. i'll just be a minute. cylinder? little cylinder, where are you? cylinder, you were here a month ago. now i know that you didn't just roll out of the airlock all by yourself. now where are you? oh, i'm sorry. i'm talking to myself. it's my way of remembering things."
"you are a peculiar creature, neelix."
"thanks. i think. ah! here it is. oh, this will be perfect for containing a small amount of protomatter. last time i used this little wonder i nearly lost it to the kazon."
the kazon. species three two nine.
you're familiar with them.
"the borg encountered a kazon colony in the gand sector, grid six nine two zero."
were they assimilated?
their biological and technological distinctiveness was unremarkable. they were unworthy of assimilation.
i didn't realise the borg were so discriminating.
why assimilate a species that would detract from perfection?
"good point. well, if you'll excuse me, i'm needed in the shuttlebay. pleasant regenerating."
"one day a week, that's all i ask. how hard can it be?"
harder than you think.
"neelix, it's pizza. bread, tomatoes, cheese"
the cheese alone would take days. separating curds and whey from synthesised milk. it's a delicate process.
so replicate the cheese.
"since it means so much to you, i'll see what i can do."
thanks. there's a concentration of protomatter directly ahead.
neelix?
"set the transporter for ten thousand amu's, not a particle more. the containment field is standing by."
we're in range.
energising.
what happened?
the transporter beam ignited the protomatter. shields are weakening.
disengage transport.
shields are down.
"i've got the sample, commander, and it's stable."
we're clear of the protomatter. how's neelix?
"he's dead. no heart beat, no synaptic response, extensive cell damage to his brain."
try a cortical stimulator.
it won't work. his neural pathways were disrupted by the protomatter.
set the stimulator for an autonomic bypass. at least we can get his vitals going.
it's too late for that. the damage was too severe.
we're running into more protomatter. i need your help.
"captain, i'm detecting the shuttle."
hail them.
no response.
"the shuttle's primary systems are offline. lifesigns, only two."
are they within transporter range?
affirmative.
"beam them directly to sickbay. harry, put a tractor on the shuttlecraft. tuvok. you've got the bridge."
i ran a complete postmortem analysis. there was nothing you could have done.
i knew we were too close to the protomatter. i should have said something.
"nobody could have predicted this, tom."
how shall i proceed?
"the talaxians mourn their dead for a full week, in a specific burial ceremony. and that's just what we're going to do."
i'll inform the crew.
"i'll check neelix's personal database, see what i can find out about the ceremony. we'll have it in the mess hall. somehow that feels appropriate."
neelix is dead?
i'm afraid so.
"his neural pathways, are they intact?"
"yes, but there's no metabolic activity."
how long has he been dead?
"seven, i understand"
how long?
it's been eighteen hours.
then it's not too late to reactivate him.
what are you saying? you can bring neelix back to life?
that's precisely what i'm saying. the borg have assimilated species with far greater medical knowledge than your own. we are capable of reactivating drones as much as seventy three hours after what you would call death.
neelix wasn't a borg drone.
we will adapt.
what does this procedure involve?
"nanoprobes are used to reverse cellular necrosis, while the cerebral cortex is stimulated with a neuroelectric isopulse."
but there's nothing left to stimulate. his brain functions are gone.
"by your narrow definition, perhaps, but not by mine. you will extract seventy micrograms of nanoprobes from my bloodstream. i will modify them to match his talaxian physiology. his function in this crew is diverse. if you wish to salvage him we must proceed immediately."
i say we let her try.
"hold on a minute, tom, please. no one's ever been resuscitated after being dead for eighteen hours. if this procedure does work, what are the chances that neelix would come out of it unaffected?"
she's right. the damage to his cerebral cortex was severe.
"the nanoprobes will compensate for any cellular degradation. captain, a decision has to be made quickly."
"doctor, give seven whatever assistance she needs. proceed."
captain
"do it. if there's a chance we can revive neelix, we're got to take it. keep me informed."
the nanoprobes are ready. we should begin.
hold on. i want to check his blood viscosity.
the cadaver has been sufficiently prepared.
and they say i have a lousy bedside manner.
set neuroelectric isopulses for one second intervals.
ready.
now.
"neural activity at nine percent, ten percent, twelve percent."
"this is incredible. his intracerebral blood pressure, his synaptic responses, they're all returning to normal."
the alveoli in his lung are regenerating. they should be functional
now. neural activity at fifty two percent and rising.
his neurotransmitter levels are rising too fast.
we must stabilise his motor neurones.
i'm going to try reducing his acetocholine levels. it might be enough to
doctor.
neelix.
"what happened. what happened? why am, why am i here?"
dead?
"for eighteen hours, forty nine minutes, thirteen seconds. congratulations, mister neelix. you've just set a new world record."
"that's impossible. you mean i lost consciousness. i was, i was in a coma."
no. you were dead.
"i'm stunned. i'm amazed. i'm grateful. thank you, doctor."
"actually, you can thank seven of nine. the procedure was her idea."
yours?
the borg have assimilated the technique from species one four nine. i simply modified it. but you are welcome.
am i good as new?
that remains to be seen. there's no way to tell if your body will successfully take over the functions the nanoprobes are serving.
nanoprobes?
"it was necessary, to repair the necrotised tissue."
"until i'm certain the damaged tissue can function independently, you'll have to be injected with nanoprobes on a daily basis."
"well, as long as i don't start assimilating the crew or sprouting borg implants, i'm sure i can live with it."
"i'm releasing you to your quarters. your body's been through quite a shock, so try to get some rest. report to sickbay tomorrow at oh eight hundred hours for your next injection."
"the shuttle mission, was it a success? did we get the protomatter?"
i'm afraid not. the sample you collected destabilised before it got back to voyager.
the containment field needs to be reinforced next time.
"if there is a next time. i've asked chakotay to find out exactly what caused the accident, and unless we can take additional precautions i'm not sending another team into that nebula."
i could help with that investigation.
"no. you are taking some time off, and that's an order."
"no, captain, please. i don't need any special treatment."
"neelix, you've just returned from the dead. go easy on yourself."
"yes, i suppose you're right. oh, but you can't ask me to cancel the first night of prixin. the celebration is in three days."
"oh, i almost forgot."
i've been aging fruit compote in moolt nectar for weeks now. i can't just let it go to waste.
"only if you feel up to it. could you not ferment those compotes so long this time, because last year i got a little light-headed."
i'll make the necessary adjustments.
it's good to have you back.
"it's good to be back, captain."
alixia? why weren't you there?
human attitudes toward death are perplexing.
how so?
too much importance is placed on it. there seem to be countless rituals and cultural beliefs designed to alleviate their fear of a simple biological truth. all organisms eventually perish.
i take it the borg have no fear of that biological truth.
"none. when a drone is damaged beyond repair, it is discarded. but it's memories continue to exist in the collective consciousness. to use a human term, the borg are immortal."
you are no longer part of the collective. you are mortal now like the rest of us. does that disturb you?
"my connection to the borg has been severed, but the collective still possesses my recollections, my experiences. in a sense, i will always exist."
fascinating. that must be a great relief.
"yes, it is."
i've sealed the fractures in the shuttle nacelle. the rest of the repairs should be completed by morning.
good. how are you coming?
i found a small phase variance in the transporter logs. i think it was responsible for igniting the protomatter. i've remodulated the transporter beam to compensate.
"good work. i'll be in holodeck two. i've created a simulation of the shuttle accident, to see if there's anything we've overlooked."
"commander. commander, i thought you might need some assistance on the holodeck."
if you're feeling up to it.
"well, i'm up to anything at this point. i've been resting for two days straight and resting makes me feel, well, restless."
i've programmed the simulation to start when we found the protomatter. why don't you monitor the containment field readings?
gladly.
"computer, display shuttle crew excluding myself and begin programme."
there's a concentration of protomatter directly ahead.
"set the transporter for ten thousand amu's, not a particle more. the containment field is standing by."
we're in range. the transporter beam ignited the protomatter.
"computer, freeze programme. looks like there was a problem with the pattern buffer. it might have created a feedback loop along the transporter beam."
sounds right.
"let's keep an eye on it. see what happened at the moment of impact. computer, resume programme."
shields are weakening. shields are down.
"i've got the sample, commander, and it's stable. let's get out of here."
"computer, freeze programme."
nothing.
what?
"i died, and there was nothing. there was no one there. no forest."
forest?
"the great forest. the afterlife. i was taught that when i died my ancestors would be there, waiting for me by the guiding tree. my sisters, my mother and father, my cousings. everyone who was killed in the war. i took great comfort in knowing that we'd all be together again one day. but it's not true."
maybe we pulled you back before any of that could happen.
"no. i was dead for eighteen hours. i should have experienced something, should remember something. it's just a story, a myth. there is no guiding tree. no gathering of the ancestors."
you can't be certain of that. don't throw away a lifetime of faith because of one anomalous incident. death is still the greatest mystery there is.
i was there. i experienced it. there was nothing.
"computer, delete characters."
"that's what's going to happen to all of us. like a hologram, we just disappear into nothing."
"attention, attention. if i may have everyone's attention."
you might want to try the old glass and spoon approach.
glass and spoon?
excuse me.
"thank you. welcome to the first night of prixin, the talaxian observance of familial allegiance. this year, mister neelix has requested that i commence the celebration with the traditional salutation. we do not stand alone. we are in the arms of family. father, mother, sister, brother. father's father, father's mother, father's brother, mother's brother. suffice to say, the list is extensive. we gather on this day to extol the warmth and joy of those unshakable bonds. without them, we could not call ourselves complete. on this day, we are thankful to be together. we do not stand alone."
indeed we do not.
"a few days ago we almost lost a member of our family. i don't know about how the rest of you feel, but it scared the hell out of me. neelix, you still don't know how to make a pizza, but i'm glad you're here."
"so am i. here's to you, neelix."
"speech, speech, speech!"
"thank you, everyone. well, er, enjoy. computer, music."
you all right?
"fine, commander, fine. i apologise for the other day on the holodeck. i guess this whole back from the dead thing is hard to get used to. i'm fine now."
"if you ever want to talk, you know where to find me."
having fun?
no.
that's probably because you've been standing here by yourself.
i don't understand the rules and procedures for this type of social occasion.
"the rules are simple. choose a group of people. listen to their conversation. then, when you feel you have something to contribute, chime in."
chime in?
say something. join the discussion.
"i will try, captain."
"the early stages of ktarian development are astounding. naomi has grown five centimetres since her last physical, and that was only three weeks ago."
it seems like every time i turn around i'm recycling her clothes back into the replicator.
children assimilated by the borg are placed in maturation chambers for seventeen cycles.
"interesting. well, if you'll excuse me, i need to go talk to neelix."
"in these maturation chambers, the development of conversational skills is, i suppose, a low priority?"
neelix.
"oh, i'm sorry."
"no, no, no, it's all right."
we haven't seen you in a few days.
i've been a little preoccupied.
i understand. naomi's been asking about you.
really?
"she misses you. frankly, so do i. she's had trouble sleeping every night this week. only neelix can tuck me in. i want neelix."
sounds familiar.
maybe you could stop by later just to say hello.
"why don't, why don't i go now? it's close to naomi's bedtime."
are you sure? prixin's your favourite holiday.
"yes, but duty calls."
attention all monsters. get out of this room.
my bed.
"oh, there's no monsters here."
"ah, it's a monster!"
scared you!
"you certainly did. pleasant dreams, sweeting."
can you stay longer? i want to hear about the great forest again.
the great forest?
the special place. the place you think about when you can't sleep.
are you sure you want to hear about that? it's just a silly old story.
please.
"well, it's a beautiful place filled with sunlight."
and all the people who ever loved me.
"yes. they've all gathered there to watch over you, to protect you while you sleep."
i had a dream about the great forest last night.
you did?
"there was trees and grass and animals, and i saw you and mommy and we were all happy."
sounds like a nice dream.
it was beautiful.
the doctor asked me to run a haemotological scan.
why?
to regulate the dosage of nanoprobes for your next injection.
go ahead. how much longer will i be needing these injections?
till your damaged cells can function on their own.
i don't really like the idea of borg technology swimming around inside me.
that is irrelevant. you need the nanoprobes to live.
"live? oh, is that what i am doing right now? living? i'm beginning to wonder."
by most definitions you are alive.
"well, part of me isn't alive."
which part are you referring to?
"i don't know, but something is missing. i don't feel like neelix anymore. maybe neelix is gone? maybe he died, and i'm all that's left."
stop moving and allow me to complete the scan.
i didn't ask to be bought back!
you were dead at the time.
"well, what right did you have to violate me? you borg think you can fix anything but you didn't fix me!"
there was no alternative.
get out. just leave me alone! i said get out!
i would be negligent in my duties if i did that.
i don't care about your duties. i don't care
"what's, what's happening to me?"
your cells are returning to a necrotic state. we must get you to sickbay.
"his tissue began rejecting the nanoprobes, causing spontaneous necrosis throughout his body."
"we modified the nanoprobes to compensate and it appears to be working. neelix is stable, for now."
how do we know this won't happen again?
"we don't. i've designed a monitor for neelix to wear that will alert us at the first sign of necrosis, and we'll continue with the daily injections. beyond that, i'm afraid it's a matter of maintenance. he may have to live with this condition for the rest of his life. he wants to speak with you, commander."
"commander, you said if i ever needed anything? you once told me your people have technology that can induce a deep meditation, an altered state of consciousness."
the akoonah.
"that this device allows you to look inside yourself, ask questions that you might otherwise be afraid to ask."
that's right.
"that's what i need. i need to look inside myself, figure out what's happening to me. i need answers. will you help me, commander?"
"all right. but i want you to understand, the vision quest isn't a quick fix. it'll take time to interpret the images, and there's no guarantee you'll find what you're looking for."
i understand. what should i do to prepare?
"you'll need a medicine bundle. items that define you. things that will ground you, allow you to take the journey into yourself."
i'll get ready.
"this belonged to my sister, alixia. she made it during her expedition to the dunes of talmouth. a flower from kes' garden. and last but not least, the guiding tree. it stands at the centre of talaxian afterlife, deep inside the great forest. it's there to help us find our way when we first arrive. at least, that's what i used to believe. not a very impressive medicine bundle, is it?"
it'll do fine. now place your hand on the akoonah.
am i doing this right?
"try to relax. clear your mind of everything but the objects before you. focus on them. nothing else exists. a-koo-chee-moya. we are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers. we are far from the bones of our people. we come here seeking guidance. it's time, neelix. try to leave this room, this ship, and go to a place where you were the most peaceful and content you have ever been. that's where your journey will begin."
neelix. good to have you back.
"it's good to be back, lieutenant."
"alixia? alixia, it's me, neelix. over here."
"captain! my sister, she was just standing here talking to you."
"the dead girl. oh yes, very charming. i can see the family resemblance."
alixia!
you will be assimilated.
no time for that now. maybe later.
potent stuff.
the lights. it's beautiful.
"yes. it's just like you always imagined it would be. the trees, the sunlight, and everyone who ever loved you."
"when i died, i looked for you, but you weren't there. why weren't you there?"
because it's all a lie.
what do you mean?
you've wasted your entire life believing lies. the great forest? the afterlife? it's all created out of your fear of death. none of it's real.
"if that's true, what's the point of living?"
"there isn't any. that's what you're finally starting to realise.  i'm afraid to go to sleep. tell me about the great forest, neelix. tell me about the trees, and the grass, and all the people who loved you!"
why are you saying these things?
scared you!
"you died on that shuttlecraft, neelix. they never should have brought you back. it was a mistake, and you know it. now accept it. you know what you have to do."
no.
it's all a lie. they lied to you.
you know what you have to do.
we gather on this day to tell neelix what he must do.
you stand alone.
life is irrelevant.
let go.
it's pointless.
it's a lie.
you know what you have to do.
no!
neelix.
"oh, there you are. i didn't see you."
are you looking for me?
"yes, as a matter of fact i am. i hope i'm not disturbing you."
you are not.
"i, i want to apologise for my outburst the other day. in the mess hall?"
no apology is necessary.
"no, no, please. my behaviour was uncalled for. i didn't mean the things i said. i wasn't myself. but i feel much better now. commander chakotay has helped me to understand a few things. i want you to know that i don't blame you for bringing me back. to life, i mean. in fact, what you did was very thoughtful."
i would have done the same for any member of this crew.
"yes, i'm sure you would have."
is there something else?
"no. yes. seven, i think you've made a wonderful addition to this crew. i know it's been difficult for you making the transition from borg back to human. or half human. or whatever it is you've become. actually, you're just plain seven to me."
"your point, mister neelix?"
"i guess i just want to say. you're surrounded by people who care about you, and whether you know it or not voyager is going to be a very good home to you. it certainly was to me."
was? do you intend to leave?
"leave? no, i'll be around. well, goodbye."
goodbye.
what happened to you this morning?
"i'm sorry i had to cancel our little chat, but i was needed in the mess hall. i've been so busy the last few days, i've let things slip around here."
you're not holding up your end of the bargain.
what do you mean?
"when you asked me to guide you on a vision quest, i agreed. but i also told you it was part of an ongoing process. we're supposed to be discussing your progress."
"what's left to say? i've told you i saw my sister, the great forest. i feel a sense of peace i've never felt in my entire life. it worked."
"you've only lived with the visions for a couple of days. that's not enough time to draw any conclusions. you've got to reflect on the images, examine them. allow them to stay alive in your mind. a vision quest isn't just a dream you dismiss after your first cup of coffee."
i understand.
good. i get off duty at fourteen hundred hours. meet me in my quarters and we'll begin. that's an order.
"yes, sir."
"computer, lights off."
"and finally, mister tuvok. i'm grateful for the opportunity i had to win your respect. your strength and your wisdom were an inspiration to me, and i can only hope that your memory of me will serve to inspire you in some way. it was an honour to spend my last years on voyager, with this crew. i want to thank all of you for your kindness and your companionship. goodbye. computer, end log. encode for delivery to captain janeway in one hour."
"captain, someone's trying to initiate an unauthorised transport. it's neelix."
where's he going?
looks like he's trying to beam into the nebula.
stop him.
"janeway to neelix. neelix, respond."
"neelix, i order you to disengage transport."
he's found a way to block the abort sequence. transport's in progress.
override it. get him back.
bridge to chakotay. we've blocked his transporter signal.
"you can slow me down, but you can't stop me."
what are you trying to do?
i'm going back where i belong.
"you belong here, neelix."
not anymore. i died in that nebula. you should have left me!
neelix.
no closer! i've created a site to site transport. no one can override the signal.
you told me you were at peace.
"i will be, as soon as i tap this control."
what really happened in your vision quest? what did you see?
"my sister, the crew, myself. they all told me the same thing. there's no point in living. and i agree with them."
"i'm sure those were powerful images, but there are many ways to interpret them. you may be coming face to face with your own fear of death. or the manifestation of your emotional crisis. your deepest beliefs have been thrown into doubt. it's only natural the vision quest would reflect that."
"eleven years ago, i saw my world in ruins, my family murdered. all that's kept me going is knowing that one day we'd be together again. that i'd see them again. but it's not true. and i can't live without that hope."
"i understand that this can change how you look at things, but it can also lead to an even stronger faith. you don't know. you're not there yet."
ensign wildman to neelix.
answer her!
"neelix, please respond."
no.
"you're being called back to your life again, neelix. don't turn your back on it. we're your family now."
it's not enough.
"it is for us. his function on this crew is diverse. that's what seven of nine said about you. even our borg understands how important you are on this ship. it's not just the duties you perform, it's the way you make people feel when you're around."
that neelix is gone.
i don't think he is.
"why didn't you answer me? i had to have the computer track you down. naomi thought she saw a monster in the replicator. neelix, what's going on?"
i'm trying to decide some things.
"that little girl needs you, neelix. monsters in the replicator? who else on this ship can handle that?"
duty calls.
"goodnight, sir."
he says goodnight.
"goodnight, naomi."
goodnight.
what's the matter?
mummy says you were sick.
"i was, but i'm okay now."
did a monster get you?
"yes, i suppose so. but i chased him away. pleasant dreams."
ensign kim. i require your assistance in jefferies tube thirty seven alpha.
"well, can it wait? i just got off duty."
it is urgent.
bridge to commander tuvok.
tuvok here.
"you're needed on the bridge, sir."
on my way.
"computer, lights on."
neelix? is anybody here?
voyager to lieutenant paris.
paris here.
"how's it going out there, tom?"
one more orbit and i should have all the data we need.
good work. see you when you get back. chakotay out.
crewman. ensign.
sir.
"hello, sir."
it looks to me like you aligned the power couplings perfectly.
i did.
if you're so sure then why'd you need me to look at them?
i did not.
then what's this all about?
i've learned from observing lieutenants torres and paris that humans sometimes require a pretext for being intimate with one another.
intimate.
resistance is futile.
paris to voyager.
voyager here.
my primary warp manifold just ruptured. i've lost helm control. auxiliary power is offline. thruster's won't respond.
"say again, tom. your signal's breaking up."
my orbit's decaying. i don't think i can hold it.
"repeat that, tom."
i need an emergency beam-out!
voyager to lieutenant paris. come in.
neelix?
"what can i do for you, captain?"
where is everybody?
didn't you see them when you came in?
no.
"take a look. computer, activate lights."
lieutenant commander tuvok reporting for duty.
is something wrong?
"i think you forgot something, tuvok."
"it appears that in my haste to report to the bridge, i neglected to put on my uniform."
what happened to them?
they died.
why?
you didn't get them home in time.
hello.
good morning. sleep well?
not really. what are you doing here?
i just thought i'd stop by and ask you why you didn't meet me for breakfast.
breakfast. what time is it?
seven forty.
and we were supposed to meet at oh seven hundred.
"i was there. right after i got off the night shift. i waited, and i waited, and i called you on the comm."
"i, er, i didn't hear you. i was having this wild nightmare. i was out like a light. i'm sorry. i'll get dressed right now."
you don't have time. you're due on the bridge at oh eight hundred and i've got to get some sleep.
i hate this! we never see each other.
i'm off friday night.
great. let's go skiing. how about saint moritz?
we went skiing last time.
"and you loved it. you're getting really good, you know."
"i just thought maybe we could run a programme where the wind chill factor wasn't thirty below zero. like fiji, or samoa."
there's nothing to do there.
and you can be warm while you're not doing it.
"how about a compromise? er, spring skiing in chile? much warmer."
a compromise? how about tahiti?
"tahiti. as long as i can go water-skiing, fine."
"you're on.  now go get dressed, so you'll still have some time to stop for some coffee."
i'll see you friday night.
"morning, tom. what'll it be? scrambled? sunny side up? over easy?"
just a cup of coffee.
"are you sure? breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know."
neelix.
right.
"neelix, did you have a rough night or something?"
why do you ask?
because you just poured me a steaming cup of cooking oil.
actually i did have a little trouble sleeping last night. nightmares.
oh. me too.
"must have been those three full moons we passed yesterday. well, a few sips of my coffee should clear the fuzz out of your brain."
maybe you should pour yourself a cup while you're at it.
we seem to be a little short-handed today.
tom and harry are both late. i was going to give them another five minutes but i'll call them now if you'd like.
"that's all right. i'm a little late myself, aren't i."
i wasn't going to mention it. burning the midnight oil?
"actually, i went to bed early for a change, but i had a nightmare and i could not get back to sleep."
"i had a bad dream last night, too."
you tell me yours and i'll tell you mine.
"sorry i'm late, captain."
well?
"i was in the forest with my father. we were hunting deer, which was odd because that was something i always refused to do. we cornered the animal. i looked to my father to see if he was going to kill it but he wasn't my father anymore. he was a vicious looking alien."
"there was an alien in my dream, too. and it wasn't from any race i've seen before. he had sharp ridges on his forehead and on the front of his neck."
that's what mine looked like.
"i don't mean to be eavesdropping but, i had a nightmare last night too, and i'm pretty sure i saw the same guy."
"tuvok, by any chance did you have a bad dream last night?"
"i did have a somewhat unsettling dream, yes. it involved a alien with ridges on his face and neck."
"i'd say this sounds like more than a coincidence. let's get the rest of the senior staff together and come up with some answers. which reminds me, where's harry?"
bridge to ensign kim.
"computer, locate ensign kim."
ensign kim is in his quarters.
tuvok.
deck six. i've got a hunch harry's dreaming about our new alien friend.
that would be consistent with the experience the rest of us have had.
tell me more about your dream. where exactly did you see the alien?
as a matter of fact it was here in the turbolift.
what happened?
the alien simply stared at me as if scrutinising my appearance.
that's what happened in my dream. what did you do?
i returned to my quarters.
did the alien follow you?
he did.
and then?
he watched me.
doing what?
getting dressed.
getting dressed?
yes.
i don't suppose i should ask why you were undressed.
i would prefer that you didn't.
harry? harry!
"computer, open door one zero five dash two. security clearance tuvok zeta nine."
"harry? harry, wake up!"
are they comatose?
"not exactly. they all appear to be in a hyper rem state. i've tried every conventional method of waking them, from drugs to direct cortical stimulation, but nothing works."
do you have any idea what's causing this?
"scans haven't detected any viral or bacterial agents. no cranial trauma, no neural disorders. they're simply asleep."
i'd say it's a pretty good bet that this is somehow related to the alien from our dreams.
any progress in identifying him?
"not yet, but i've got everyone working on it. in the meantime, what's your recommendation?."
large doses of animazine.
i thought you said drugs weren't working.
"not for them. for everybody else. until i can determine what's happening, i'd suggest the rest of you avoid going to sleep."
i'd say his ridges were a little more pronounced.
"computer, increase facial ridge height by four centimetres."
that's closer.
i think his eyes were wider apart.
"computer, increase the space between the eyes by three centimetres. increase skin colour and texture."
that's him.
"has anybody seen this species before? while you were awake, i mean. seven?"
he doesn't resemble any species assimilated by the borg.
so is he just a figment of our imagination?
"if he is, we've all been imagining the exact same thing."
one possible explanation is that he's attempting to make telepathic contact.
he's doing more than making contact. we've got six crewmembers who can't wake up. for all we know it's some sort of attack.
"from where? astrometric scans haven't revealed any ships in this vicinity, or planets capable of sustaining humanoid life."
so where do we look?
"in our dreams. that's the only place any of us have seen him, right? so if we want to communicate with him, find out what he wants, we'll have to do it on his terms."
how do you propose we do that?
lucid dreaming.
what's that?
it's a technique which allows you to take control of your dream.
"that happened to me once. i dreamt i was falling and suddenly i realised that i was dreaming, and i could fly, land, do whatever i wanted. i was in complete control of the dream."
what happened to you by accident is something some people can do by design. i've been able to have a lucid dream by using the same technology i use for a vision quest. i may be able to use it to communicate with this alien.
"maybe so, but how do we know you'd be able to wake up again?"
"it's kind of like self-hypnosis. before i go to sleep, i choose a visual cue, something to let me know i'm dreaming. earth's moon, say. once i see it, i can wake myself by tapping the back of my hand three times."
"perhaps you are capable of doing this under normal circumstances, but these were hardly conventional dreams we experienced."
"i don't see any other way of finding out what our friend here is after, or how we can wake up harry and the others. besides, we can't stay awake forever."
"you'll do this in sickbay, under the doctor's supervision. the rest of you keep scanning the region. analyse this ship from stem to stern. wherever he is, find him."
"normally i consider a good night's sleep an important part of any health regimen, but in this case, i can't recommend it."
"i respect your medical opinion, doctor, but at this point we're out of options."
"this will regulate your hypothalamus, but in all probability i won't be able to wake you. you'll be on your own."
i understand.
ready? pleasant dreams.
"ah-koo-chee-moya. far from the sacred places of my grandfathers, far from the bones of my people, i seek to sleep, to meet the one who has visited us in our dreams."
i know this is a dream. my dream. i'm in control.
you're mistaken.
am i?
this is more than a dream. it's my reality. and you're no different than the others.
the others?
"the waking species. for centuries, you've come and found us in a state that you call sleep and tried to destroy us. but not anymore. now we are in control. one by one, you will fall asleep and enter our reality, where it is you who will be destroyed."
we didn't attack you. we didn't even know you existed until we started seeing you in our dreams. tell me how i can wake my crew and i promise we'll leave.
"as long as you're asleep, you're no threat to us."
"i can wake myself anytime i want. and if i do, i'm going to start looking for you in the waking world. find where you're sleeping. you wouldn't want that."
"leave our space. once you're beyond it, your people will awaken."
just tell me how far we need to go.
there's a six planet system less than a parsec away. it marks the nearest border of our space.
we can be past it in one day.
"then wake yourself, and pray you never dream of us again."
"congratulations, commander. you're awake."
chakotay?
i'm fine.
"the alien, did you see him? and?"
"well, it was certainly one of the most interesting away missions i've ever been on. i'll tell you about it on the way to the bridge."
"tuvok, scan for a six planet system. it should be less than a parsec from here."
"i have it, captain, at coordinates one three nine mark four two."
"tom, lay in a course."
"aye, captain. course laid it. do you mind if i ask where we're heading?"
"past the alien's territory. once we're clear of it, harry and the others should wake up."
and the rest of us can finally get some sleep.
"one step at a time, tom."
"from what the alien told me it sounds like they have corporeal form but they communicate through their dreams. for them, it's as real as the waking world."
extraordinary.
"it reminds me of the australian aborigines. they believed the dream world was no more or less real than the waking world. in fact, their creation mythology says their ancestors actually dreamed the universe into existence."
that's mythology. this seems to be fact.
"i wonder, do they ever wake up? how did they evolve this way?"
we may never know. sometimes first contact is last contact.
we're approaching the border of the alien's space.
"commander tuvok, inform the doctor."
"aye, captain."
wake up ensign.
what's going on?
you were napping.
in sickbay?
we had to move you here when we couldn't wake you.
how long?
seventeen hours. i take it you experienced nightmares like the rest of the crew?
"oh, i had nightmares all right."
tell me about them.
"well, i was in the corridor"
captain janeway asked me to bring you the results of our astrometric scans. she thought they might be helpful in determining the precise cause of the crew's somnolence.
thank you.
"ensign kim, now that you're awake i require your assistance in jefferies tube twenty one beta. is something wrong?"
"no. i, er, i'm still feeling a little groggy."
then i'll wait until you are fully recovered.
"now then, ensign, you were telling me about your nightmare."
"you know what, doc, i'm famished. haven't eaten in at least seventeen hours, right?"
"very well. go eat, get some clothes on, and report back in an hour."
"i'll see you later. you too, seven."
"and the next thing i knew, i was being boiled alive in a pot of my own leola root stew."
talk about a nightmare.
it was perfectly seasoned.
"well, if it isn't sleeping beauty."
"i do look well-rested, don't i?"
is everyone awake now?
"the doc checked us all out, he says we're fine."
have a seat. we were just trading dream stories.
tell us yours.
"oh, it was nothing very interesting. just the usual, you know."
"who was she, harry?"
the woman of my dreams. what i'd like to know is what tuvok dreamt about.
"yes, commander, tell us. what do vulcan's dream?"
aren't you supposed to have horrible nightmares?
i wonder what a vulcan nightmare would be like.
"alone, exiled on a planet where the only form of communication is laughter."
"oh, come on, tuvok."
i won't dignify this inquisition with a response.
red alert. all hands to battle stations.
they're coming around for another pass.
auxiliary power to the shields. return fire.
no damage to the alien ship. our phasers can't penetrate their shields.
arm photon torpedoes. we seem to have a knack for provoking strangers these days.
shields are offline.
fire.
i've lost power to the torpedo launchers.
what's happening?
power's being drained from all systems.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
captain. ensign kim. commander chakotay. i'm glad to see you all up and about.
janeway to engineering. we need auxiliary power to the engines now.
i think you'll find that impossible.
b'elanna? report.
there's a localised
"dampening field around the ship, captain."
"i can't give you engines, weapons, shields."
everything you told me was a lie. this was all an elaborate trap to get voyager here.
it appears you're learning more about my people after all. prepare to surrender your ship.
captain. three more alien vessels are approaching. they are powering weapons.
"you've gone to so much trouble to commandeer this ship, i don't think you're going to destroy it."
i won't need to.
janeway to the crew. we're under attack. implement defence procedure omega.
it's no use. we've taken every deck. the ship is ours.
captain?
"all the time i thought i was negotiating, they were just setting us up to fly right into their web."
you couldn't have known it was a trick.
i don't understand. they exist in dreams and reality.
"apparently, entering our dreams was their way to learn about us. perhaps to probe our weaknesses."
not to mention lure us into an ambush.
we need to retake the ship.
that means getting out of this cargo bay.
i checked the jefferies tubes. they'resealed.
maybe we can open them manually.
that's not going to be easy. they've got people everywhere.
we'll have to create a diversion.
any ideas?
"i have one, captain."
what the hell are you doing?
"creating a diversion.  ensign kim, it is your fault we have been captured."
i suggest you fight back.
"tom, try to get into a jefferies tube. you two work on the power grid. i'll deal with this."
"stop, stop."
"what's going on here? these are my people, i'll handle them. ensign, that's enough. move."
what's wrong?
i'm still asleep.
what are you talking about.
chakotay!
"commander chakotay, you're awake."
am i? are you sure?
of course you are.
what are you looking for?
the moon.
what?
i don't see it.
where's the captain?
"asleep, along with the rest of the crew."
all of them?
except me. no rest for the never weary.
what happened?
"as soon as you entered your lucid dream, they all began falling asleep one by one. i've been trying every method i can think of to revive them, but nothing works. it's been thirty nine hours."
i've been asleep for almost two days?
"if i can't wake them soon, i'm going to have to start feeding them intravenously."
they let me think i was awake but i was still dreaming.
you weren't the only one. look at this.
what is it?
"a neurogenic field created by heightened electrical activity in the brain. it's been occurring in all the sleeping crew members. and that's not all. this is ensign kim's brain wave pattern, indicating that he's dreaming in a hyper rem state. this is crewman foster's pattern."
they're identical.
"lieutenant torres, captain janeway, commander tuvok. i don't know what it means."
"i think i do. not only are they dreaming, they're all having the same dream. it wasn't just my dream, it was a communal dream."
"everyone's rem patterns are identical. they're experiencing the same images, each from his or her own point of view."
"yes. i saw the rest of the crew, interacted with them. we were all working together to fight off an alien attack."
which wasn't real.
"oh, we're under attack all right."
commander?
"maybe this is the way these aliens fight their enemies. they exist somewhere in our reality as physical beings, but they must be asleep, unable to defend themselves against what they call waking species. we'll never defeat them in their dream reality, but if we can find them, find where they're sleeping, we'll have the advantage."
but we've been scanning for lifeforms since this started and we haven't found anything.
maybe we've been looking in the wrong place. i'm betting a species that spends its time sleeping isn't going to be hanging around where conventional scans can locate them.
so how do we find them?
this neurogenic field you mentioned. anyone in a hyper rem state would be producing one.
"in theory, yes. so if we scan for other neurogenic fields it might lead us to the sleeping aliens."
"if you need me, i'll be on the bridge."
"time for a little energy boost, commander. we don't want you drifting back to sleep. sorry about the mess, but this is what happens when my repeated requests for a larger sickbay fall on deaf ears. what is it?"
"scanners have detected a neurogenic field emanating from beneath the surface of a planet less than a light year from here. excuse me, tom, but i've got to change our course."
still dreaming? how is that possible?
"i don't know, but that's what chakotay said right before he vanished."
"that doesn't make any sense. he was wide awake, right here with us."
"he said something about still being asleep and then he started tapping the back of his hand like he said he would to wake up from his lucid dream. and then he disappeared. the question is, where did he go?"
the aliens must have transported him somewhere.
or perhaps he did wake up.
tuvok?
it's possible he was dreaming all of this.
"wait a minute. if chakotay was dreaming and he woke up, what are we doing here?"
perhaps we're dreaming as well.
now i'm lost.
you're not the only one.
"consider then, that we all experienced nightmares about an alien whose people apparently live out their lives in a dream state. perhaps we're in that state at this very moment."
that's ridiculous. we're not asleep.
wait.
"when you dream, you're rarely aware that you're sleeping."
"i can understand how we can mistake dreaming for reality, but that doesn't explain how we're all interacting with one another."
maybe we're not.
not what?
"interacting with one another. maybe this is all one person's dream, for example mine, and none of you are really here."
"trust me, neelix. i wish i weren't, but i'm here."
collective unconsciousness.
"seven, come here."
the borg share a collective consciousness. these aliens may have somehow inducted a state of collective unconsciousness.
you mean we're all sharing the same dream?
it is possible.
"this is all fascinating speculation, but unless we have proof to the contrary we have to treat this like an invasion."
i managed to open a jefferies tube hatch.
"good work. neelix, seven, kim, do what you can to distract the guards. we're going to find a way to retake the ship."
looks like a complete power drain.
their dampening field has shut down the warp core.
which begs the question of what they intend to do with an unpowered ship.
"tuvok, grab some phaser rifles from the weapons locker. something tells me that when we try to disable the dampening field, we're going to get the aliens attention."
"it looks like they're using harmonic inversion technology. if i can isolate the containment frequency, i may be able to get main power back online."
that was easy.
warning. warp core breach in sixty seconds.
maybe a little too easy.
i don't understand.
can you eject the core?
i'm trying. it's not working.
warp core breach in fifty seconds.
we've got to get out of here. i'm trying to put a containment field around engineering.
warp core breach in forty seconds.
got it! let's move!
i don't understand why you couldn't eject the core.
warp core breach in thirty seconds.
something's not right.
"captain, we must hurry."
i'm going back in there.
you'll be killed!
i think i'm on to something. you two go!
captain!
that's an order!
warp core breach in ten seconds. nine. eight. seven.
six. five. four. three. two. one.
"either i've become impervious to antimatter explosions, or we're still dreaming."
a warp core explosion should have destroyed the ship.
"if i were awake, or if any of this were real, which it obviously isn't. things just weren't adding up. chakotay's disappearance. the warp core failing to eject. and as chakotay said, lucid dreaming is about taking control, so i took a chance."
"surely there must have been a less extreme method of testing your assumptions. as captain, you shouldn't be taking chances with your life."
"i'm touched by your concern, tuvok."
"now that we know this is a dream, what do we do?"
i suggest we find a way to regain consciousness.
"captain, how did you wake yourself?"
the same way you did.
the others?
they should all be starting to wake up.
"rise and shine, mister paris."
we need to get as far away from that planet as possible.
agreed.
i'll make the necessary course correction.
what is it?
this isn't real.
of course it is.
see?
no.
doctor?
"he's paranoid, disoriented. i suspect much of the crew will suffer similar symptoms when they awake. try to relax, commander. i'm going to sedate you."
"no. i need to wake, not sleep!"
i'm here to help you.
no!
"it's all right, commander. you're awake again."
what happened?
you dozed off.
i couldn't wake myself like i did before.
our proximity to the neurogenic field is making it more difficult to stay conscious.
i need to get down there and find a way to neutralise it.
"not so fast. this is a highly potent animazine derivative. if you feel yourself falling asleep again, you must use it. and commander, i suggest we keep an open comm. line. i may need to provide you with a verbal splash of cold water every now and then."
it's not working.
it's safe to assume that chakotay and the doctor are making every effort to wake us from our sleep.
"we have to let the rest of the crew know what's happening. that as long as they know they're in a dream, they can't be harmed."
and if the aliens try to stop us?
then we turn this dream world of theirs into a nightmare.
"okay, doctor, i'm in."
"acknowledged, commander."
stand aside.
your weapons are useless against us.
you're not fooling anyone. we know this is a dream.
you're confused.
"actually, i'm finally seeing things clearly."
shoot them.
"now, stand aside."
"all of you, listen closely. what we have to do is stay in control of the dream. if we can do that, the aliens shouldn't be able to hurt us."
"you sound very sure of yourself, captain."
why shouldn't i be?
"have you thought about what's happening to your bodies in the waking world? how long do you think they'll survive without nourishment, without physical activity? your bodies are withering away as we speak. you can't stop it."
don't be so sure.
it's some kind of transmitter. it looks like they use it to amplify the
neurogenic field.
can you turn it off?
"i tried knocking it out with my phaser, but there's some kind of forcefield."
commander?
"sorry, i'm having trouble concentrating."
time for your medicine.
"doctor. this animazine, it's pretty powerful."
yes. and i suggest you take it immediately.
"these aliens, they look pretty frail."
"that's fascinating, commander. now please, inject yourself."
they probably wouldn't have the same tolerance for stimulants that we do.
what are you getting at?
the animazine might be capable of waking up one of these aliens.
"commander, i'd be happy to discuss comparative pharmacology with you after you administer your injection."
"actually, i think i'm going to give it to one of my sleepy friends here."
what would that accomplish?
if i can wake him up
i might be able to get him to deactivate this generator.
there's not enough
"animazine for two doses. if you fall asleep again, there's no way i can revive you."
"doctor, i want you to go to the bridge."
commander!
i'm giving you an order!
go to the bridge and target my comm. signal with a photon torpedo.
you're delirious. you're asking me to incinerate you.
"not just me. these aliens and their transmitter, too. but only if you don't hear from me"
in five minutes. understood?
commander.
understood?
"aye, sir."
"tell me how to deactivate this transmitter, or i start shooting."
what happened?
looks like he woke up.
"i'll give you five seconds. four, three, two"
chakotay.
"who's going to help you now, captain?"
"i found the cavern and your people. i'm there right now in the waking world. and it's all going to be destroyed in less than two minutes, unless you deactivate that transmitter."
"if you are there, you'll be killed, too. i think you're lying."
"oh, believe me, if i don't contact my ship you and i are both going to die in our sleep."
"computer, lights on."
"sorry, commander. i didn't mean to frighten you."
"you're not starting breakfast this early, are you?"
just rearranging the supply cabinets. i couldn't sleep.
neither could i.
how about a soothing cup of tea?
sounds good.
"i know it's silly, but every time i'm about to doze off, i'm terrified that i won't be able to wake again."
you too?
we just finished a little late night hoverball on the holodeck.
three games in a row. we were hoping it would wear us out.
"you know, i could learn to enjoy these late night get-togethers."
speak for yourself. i would kill for a good night's sleep.
"neelix, i think it's time for breakfast."
"cold, patronising, arrogant."
i know she can be difficult.
difficult? she's impossible.
"i'm getting tired of playing referee every time you two have a disagreement. if you have a problem, talk to her yourself."
"does the word irrelevant mean anything to you? she won't listen. she may look human, and she may sound human, but she's all borg."
part of the problem is your attitude. you've never tried to accept seven as part of the crew.
"and with good reason. guess what she did this morning. she took an isolinear processor out of engineering without asking, and when i went to astrometrics to get it back she had locked the door, like that lab is her own private domain."
what do you want me to do? throw her in the brig for the rest of the trip home?
i've heard worse ideas.
seven of nine to chakotay.
chakotay here.
report to the astrometrics lab at once.
on my way.
"did you hear that? she's giving orders now. i'm telling you, chakotay. if she gets in my way again, i am not responsible for what happens."
you're a senior officer on this ship. act like one. find a way to deal with her.
astrometrics?
i've been summoned. any guesses what this is about?
none.
your call sounded urgent.
"it was. i've been working to increase the range of the astrometric sensors, and i have detected something that you should find of particular interest."
a ship. what's special about it?
i've analysed the warp signature. it's a starfleet vessel. the ship we're seeing is in the alpha quadrant.
you couldn't have extended the astrometric sensors that far.
"no, but i increased the range far enough to detect a large network of relay stations. they're alien in origin, abandoned but still functioning. by establishing a sensor link with the nearest station i'm getting readings from the entire network. the starfleet ship is within range of one of the farthest sensors near the outer edges of the alpha quadrant."
it must be on a deep space mission.
i've extrapolated it's course.
it doesn't look like we'll be able to keep track of it very long.
the ship should move out of range in forty one minutes.
can we use the network to transmit a message?
"yes, but we'll have to remodulate our signal to match the network's interlink frequency."
"we don't have much time. get it done, chakotay."
seven of nine to ensign kim.
kim here.
i'm sending you the interlink frequencies.
got it.
"seven, how much longer do we have?"
sixteen minutes.
that should do it. the subspace transceiver is at two hundred percent output and online. we're ready.
open a channel.
open.
"starfleet vessel, this is captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager. we are in the delta quadrant, at coordinates one eight, mark two oh five, mark four seven. remodulate your signal to match our interlink frequency."
we're receiving a transmission.
let's hear it.
starship voyager. we're in the
bridge to seven. what went wrong?
i don't understand. my readings show that the station picked up our message and relayed it across the entire network.
we should try widening the subspace bandwidth and sending the message again.
do it.
transmitting.
the signal is being relayed. no sign of interference.
wait. it's being deflected back again.
"this is captain kathryn janeway, starship voyager, the delta quadrant."
"i have a possible explanation, captain."
"as our carrier wave moves along the network, it may be degrading."
can we try a different kind of signal? something stronger?
a holographic datastream might work. it wouldn't degrade so quickly.
"it would take too long to reconfigure the message, unless"
the doctor.
exactly.
bring him to astrometrics and i'll meet you there. we don't have much time.
"doctor, you have to come with me, quickly."
would you mind at least telling me what all this is about?
"when i requested more away missions, this isn't exactly what i had in mind."
you may be our only chance to communicate with that ship.
"when you get there, you'll be downloaded into their emh system. i'm sending an initiation code along with your programme so you'll be activated immediately."
we have less than ninety seconds before that ship moves out of range.
how am i supposed to get back here?
"when you've completed your mission, instruct them to move within range of the sensor network. with any luck, they can send you back the same way you came."
luck?
"i won't lie to you, doctor. a lot of things could go wrong. we're relying on an alien technology to send you across thousands of light years."
so there's a chance my programme could be lost.
yes. i'm asking you to take that chance.
thirty five seconds.
doctor?
far be it from me to turn down an opportunity to become a hero. i'm ready.
torres to bridge.
standing by.
i'm downloading him into the transceiver array.
ten seconds.
"good luck, doctor."
there's that word again.
"hello? is anyone here? computer, identify this ship."
this is the federation starship prometheus.
are we in the alpha quadrant?
affirmative.
ah. sickbay to bridge.
"all right. this is sickbay calling any crew member. please respond. computer, is the comm. system malfunctioning?"
negative.
then why can't i reach anyone?
access to the communications system has been restricted.
restricted? but this is important. isn't there some sort of emergency comm. channel available?
try to lie still. you have severe phaser burns. what happened here?
romulans. they've taken over the ship.
"commander, there's a vessel approaching on an intercept course. it's starfleet."
i told you to mask our warp trail.
i've been trying. these new systems are unfamiliar. we should have left some of the crew alive.
you'd be surprised how stubborn humans can be.
the starfleet ship is closing.
raise shields and prepare to fire phasers.
"computer, how may romulans are on board?"
twenty seven.
are there any starfleet crewmembers?
none alive.
"computer, display the design schematic of this ship and list general specifications."
"uss prometheus. experimental prototype designed for deep space tactical assignments. primary battle systems include regenerative shielding, ablative hull armour, multivector assault mode."
multivector assault mode? describe.
access to tactical data requires level four clearance.
what can you show me at my clearance level?
shields are holding.
engage the multivector assault mode.
that system has never been tested.
then we'll test it now. i gave you an order and i expect you to follow it. multivector assault mode. now!
"yes, commander."
initiating decoupling sequence.
autoseparation in ten seconds. nine. eight. seven. six.
"computer, what's happening? computer?"
five. four. three.
two. one. separation sequence in progress.
we're in attack formation. each section is armed and responding to our command.
attack pattern beta four seven.
specify target.
"the starfleet vessel, bearing one six two mark seven."
pattern and target confirmed.
"i think we should consider that a successful test. begin the reintegration sequence, then get me a full damage report."
"yes, commander."
he's hurt.
take him to the medical bay.
reintegration sequence complete.
"computer, is there any way for me to gain access to the communication system to send a message to another ship?"
negative. communications access requires level four clearance or above.
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
who activated you?
"you did, automatically, when you entered sickbay."
can you treat him?
"of course, that's my function. third degree burns, hairline jaw fracture, and a ruptured blood vessel in his brain. i'll have to operate."
you're a starfleet programme. why should i trust you?
"i'm a doctor. whether my patient is human, or romulan, i'll do everything in my power to save him. you're welcome to assist me if you like. or maybe you'd just prefer to supervise."
report to me when you're finished.
mmm hmm.
"computer, can i access this ship's emh programme or do i need some kind of clearance for that, too?"
access to that programme is unrestricted.
activate it.
please state the nature of the medical emergency. what the hell are you doing in my sickbay? i've been programmed to identify every member of this crew. you aren't one of them.
that's because i'm
state your rank and security clearance.
i don't have clearance. i'm an emergency medical hologram. i've been sent here to
"oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. you're the mark one emh. the inferior programme."
inferior?
"beady eyes, terrible bedside manner. i recognise you. but you're not part of this database. what are you doing here?"
"if you'd disengage your vocal subroutines for one second, i'd explain. i was transmitted onto this ship by a starfleet vessel over sixty thousand light years from here."
sixty thousand light years? we don't have ships that far out.
it's the starship voyager. we were taken into the delta quadrant four years ago by an alien force. what are you doing?
activating intruder alert.
that's the last thing you want to do.
security.
listen to me. this vessel has been taken over by romulans. the crew is dead. you and i are the only starfleet officers on board. do you understand?
i understand.
"computer, deactivate emh."
"computer, activate emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency. now what?
i need your help.
"starfleet security protocol twenty eight subsection d. in the event of hostile alien takeover, the emh is to deactivate and wait for rescue."
"i'm afraid you don't have that luxury. there are two ships at stake here, yours and mine. now, i need to know more about what's happening. is the federation at war with the romulans?"
no. the romulans haven't gotten involved in our fight with the dominion.
the who?
long story.
"in any case, we need to take control of this situation."
"i'm a doctor, not a commando."
it's time you became a little of both.
"you don't understand. the prometheus is an experimental prototype, and so am i. i, i, i haven't even been field tested yet. i'm not designed for this kind of duty."
"try to calm down. you'll do fine as long as i'm here. i have plenty of expertise in this area. now, first things first. we've got a patient. you treat his burns, i'll repair the bone fracture."
you're not serious.
i certainly am.
he's the enemy.
he needs our help. i assume you're familiar with the hippocratic oath?
you see? you see what's happening? the romulans are using you.
hmm.
hmm what?
your holomatrix is unstable. it may explain your erratic behaviour.
"i told you, i'm a work in progress! i was only installed six weeks ago."
"stable or not, i need you. and so does he."
he'll live. i say we leave him and deactivate ourselves.
no! you're free to do as you please. go cower inside the data processor if you'd like. i'll work alone.
we're medical holograms. what can we expect to do against a ship full of romulans?
"i'm not sure. not yet. but i've faced my share of challenges. alien invasions, macro-viral infestations. i've crossed borg space, travelled through time."
have you run a self-diagnostic lately? the emh mark one is designed to function in sickbay only.
voyager lost it's chief medical officer four years ago. i've been active ever since.
four years? no wonder you're delusional. your programme's degrading after being active for so long.
"i assure you i am in perfect health. i was saving voyager from annihilation when you were only a gleam in your programmer's eye. now, are you going to help me take back this ship or not?"
get me the thrombic modulator.
"it's the cone shaped device. hand it to me, please. medical science has made a few advances while you've been off in the delta quadrant, did you say?"
that's right.
"we don't use scalpels or leeches anymore. i suggest you let me handle the medical side of things. as for retaking the ship, i'll leave that in your experienced hands."
no word. our link to the sensor net is stable. seven of nine is standing watch in astrometrics. i tried to relieve her but she doesn't want to leave her post. she says she doesn't need to regenerate for the next few days. what are you doing?
"letters home. i started them a year ago. one to my family, one to mark. i'm making a few updates, just in case. i know. it's premature."
"you're right. it's probably a mistake for us to get our hopes up at all. we've been through this before. all right, i'll admit it. i just finished a letter to my cousin in ohio."
the doctor is in.
"lieutenant, thank god you're here."
what seems to be the trouble?
"well, one minute they were eating lunch, and the next they started perspiring and complaining of chest pain."
hmm. no wonder. acute functional dyspepsia.
what's that?
heartburn.
"oh, i'm terribly sorry. i don't know how this could have happened."
i'll replicate some antacid.
we'll have you feeling better in no time.
"they're going to be all right, aren't they?"
"it's heartburn, neelix, not the terrillian plague. what did you feed them, anyway?"
rodeo red's red hot rootin' tootin' chili.
where did you find that recipe?
"i've been brushing up on classic american cuisine. when we get back to earth, i want to make sure i have marketable job skills."
don't you think you're jumping the gun a little bit?
"the doctor is going to make it back, and he's going to bring a plan for starfleet to rescue us. i have complete confidence in him."
"i hope you're right. if not, i'm going to spend the rest of this trip treating upset stomachs."
"oh, believe me, this is never going to happen again. it's just a matter of perfecting the recipe. next time i'll use a few less jalapenos."
"i've accessed the navigational logs. we're at warp nine point nine, heading straight for romulan space."
"this vessel was designed to go faster than anything in the fleet, so we'll never be rescued."
we've got to find a way to turn this ship around.
how? waltz on to the bridge and take over the helm?
refresh my memory. which of us has the terrible bedside manner?
you're not my patient.
my first bit of good news. we have to incapacitate the romulans somehow. what kind of anaesthetics do you have handy?
"only the best. axonol, neurozine, anaesthazine."
neurozine will do nicely. it can be distributed in gaseous form. show me a schematic of the ship's ventilation system. please.
"all primary systems have been rerouted to the bridge, including environmental control."
it looks like there are holo-emitters on every deck.
"there are. unlike you, i'm not condemned to a sickbay."
"get three canisters of neurozine. as a matter of record, i have free reign on voyager, and i can even leave the ship as well."
leave your ship? how?
my mobile emitter. a little piece of twenty ninth century technology we obtained.
really?
"i'm as close to a sentient life form as any hologram could hope to be. i socialise with the crew, fraternise with aliens. i've even had sexual relations."
sex? how's that possible? we're not equipped
"let's just say, i made an addition to my programme."
"before you leave, maybe you could download those subroutines into my database."
we'll see. it looks like the only place i can access environmental control is from the ops console on the bridge.
the bridge is swarming with romulans.
that's the first thing you learn in the real world. think on your feet.
"well, good luck then. computer, deactivate"
not so fast. you're going to jefferies tube seventeen. the moment i unlock the controls you release the gas into the ventilation system.
jefferies tube seventeen? that's five decks up. what if i run into romulans?
improvise. your journey begins here.
"traditionally, one crawls in headfirst."
thanks.
"there you are, doctor. have you completed the surgery?"
"yes. your friend is recovering nicely. however, i found something disturbing in his blood work. it seems that he's been exposed to a nasty strain of the torothka virus. and if he was, you may all have been. i've come to run some scans."
no one here is sick.
"not yet. i understand the stomach cramps are unbearable, although some say the rash is worse."
conduct your scans. how far are we from our border?
"at our present velocity, forty minutes."
alter our heading to one one eight mark two six.
that will take us off our course to romulus.
there's been a change of plans. we're giving this ship to someone who'll make full use of it's potential. the tal'shiar. i've made arrangements to rendezvous with their fleet within the hour.
"but commander, they're expecting us to be"
you have your orders. what are you doing?
i'm checking the biofilters for evidence of the virus.
you haven't taken any readings at all.
hmm.
"next time, order the chicken salad."
"oh, am i glad to see you."
what's the emergency?
"take a look around you, harry. what do you see?"
sickbay?
exactly.
so?
"so, it's not the helm of a starship, is it?"
did you accidentally inject yourself with some kind of psychotropic agent?
"i am a pilot, harry, not a doctor."
"this is a temporary assignment, just till the doc gets back."
what if he doesn't get back?
he'll be back.
"i need your help, harry. rescue me from medical exile."
how?
you're an expert in holotechnology. you have got to design a new doctor.
you really are delirious. it took the greatest holoengineers in starfleet years to develop the emh. i can't just design a new doctor.
"think of it as a challenge, harry. a chance to make history and save your best friend all at the same time."
lieutenant torres. you are recalibrating the relay interface.
that's right.
state your reasons for making these modifications.
"state your reasons, please. it's not what you say, seven. it's how you say it."
i don't understand.
you may have noticed that some of the crew seem a bit on edge when you're around.
i was borg. i elicit apprehension.
"no, that's not what i mean. we're not afraid that you're going to assimilate us. we're just not used to. you just. you're rude."
i am rude?
"yes. yes. you order people around, you do things without permission, and whether you realise it or not you come off as a little insulting. you don't even say please or thank you. look, i don't expect you to change overnight but, try to remember that we are not just a bunch of drones."
your attempt to recalibrate the interface is ill-advised. the risk of disrupting our link is too great.
in your opinion. that is exactly what i'm talking about. you haven't even been listening to me. i don't know why i try to talk to you if you don't even. are we losing the link?
no. we're receiving a transmission from the relay station.
the doctor?
what are you?
i'm lieutenant torres of the starship voyager.
you are using our technology.
you mean the sensor network? we thought that it was abandoned.
it belongs to the hirogen. terminate your link.
"no, no, wait, please. we just"
the link has been severed.
what else have you done to this ship? i will deactivate you unless you start answering my questions.
"if i answer them, you'll very likely deactivate me anyway, so i fail to see the point."
you are nothing but a computer generated projection. i find it hard to believe you're capable of taking these actions independently.
how flattering.
"tell me, who is operating your programme? is it someone on this ship? a starfleet crew member we missed, or one of my own men?"
"paranoia is a way of life for you, isn't it?"
the computer log shows the ship received an optronic datastream transmission approximately six hours ago. it contained a holographic subroutine.
who sent it?
unknown. the data pattern had a starfleet signature.
"so, starfleet has managed to sneak a holographic operative aboard. very clever."
"were you only sent to spy on us, or does your mission include sabotage?"
the datastream you detected came from an alien sensor network. it transferred me from a starfleet ship in the delta quadrant.
the delta quadrant? that's absurd.
this is pointless.
i couldn't agree more.
maybe there's a better way to retrieve information from a hologram. i suggest a complete algorithm extraction. we can analyse his subroutines one by one.
proceed.
isn't there some kind of convention regarding the treatment of prisoners?
did it work?  sorry to interrupt.
did you anaesthetise the entire ship?
i did. i did.
how did you manage to release the neurozine? i never opened the ventilation system.
"trapped in the jefferies tube, alone, nowhere to run, his smug comrade captured by romulans, emh mark two had to improvise. inspiration. he accessed the main computer and simulated a ship wide biohazard, making the computer think there was a microbiotic contamination on all decks."
and the ventilation system opened automatically.
"presto. he then crawled back out of the tube, accessed the holoemitters, transferred here, excused the romulan, saw the dumbfounded look on his comrade's face"
"the end. you know, you really should keep a personal log. why bore others needlessly? we have to get to the bridge. this ship needs a crew, and we're it."
"oh, trouble. the prometheus is a prototype. top secret. only four people in all of starfleet trained to operate it. i hope your myriad adventures included piloting lessons"
because there's nothing in my programme that will help us fly this thing.
"i've had my share of piloting experience. actually, only two lessons, and they were in a shuttlecraft on the holodeck. but i showed great intuition. where's the helm?"
you'd better intuit it fast. we're only about eight minutes from the romulan border.
"ah, there it is."
this is all very complicated.
stop breathing down my neck.
my breathing is merely a simulation.
so is my neck. stop it anyway.
is this a thruster control?
"don't touch that, we don't know what it does. it could be the self-destruct."
you look worried.
i'm just concentrating.
"you don't know what you're doing, do you. this is not a shuttle and we are not on a holodeck."
shush.
mister i can leave my ship. the voice of experience.
"let me think. ah, here it is. this looks like the nacelle power control."
so? so?
"there's a little trick i saw mister paris do once. if i can generate a slight overload to the nacelle coils, it'll collapse the warp field."
what happened?
"i did it. we've stopped. ah, all we have to do now is find a way to send starfleet a distress signal and"
beep beep beep? beep beep beep? i've never heard that one before.
"oh, no."
what?
"i'm not sure, but i think whatever i did initiated a warp core overload."
you mean the ship's going to explode? you've got to stop it.
no problem.
what now?
"unless i'm mistaken, and for once i sincerely hope i am, there are three romulan warbirds on an intercept course."
we're boosting the signal gain as high as it'll go. i think we can cut through the alien's jamming signal.
i warned you.
i apologise for our intrusion. allow me to explain.
no explanations.
your relay network gave us the unique opportunity to communicate with our people. they are very far away and we're expecting a message back from them.
all messages will be intercepted.
he's trying to jam the link again.
there must be some room for negotiation. isn't there anything you might accept in exchange for
what happened?
i generated a feedback surge along our sensor link.
you killed him?
it was a mild shock. he will recover.
and when he does?
he wasn't responding to diplomacy.
is the sensor link stable?
"yes, captain."
keep watching for the doctor. let me know if our friend gives us any more trouble.
mild shock? not bad.
thank you.
there. i've finished inputting the doctor's physical characteristics.
let's have a look.
"computer, activate the emergency medical hologram replacement programme."
do you think we should give him a little more hair?
"what do you say we try to get him working first,then we can worry about personal grooming."
right. you're the boss. what do we do next?
"i've downloaded the ship's entire medical library and compressed it into a single data file. it's got all the classics, from gray's anatomy to leonard mccoy's comparative alien physiology."
"and once we transfer all the data into stoneface's matrix, we'll have ourselves a brand new medical expert."
that's what i'm hoping.
"harry, you are a genius."
don't congratulate me yet. this is only the first step.
"yeah, but it's a step in the right direction."
"i'm telling you, this probably isn't going to work."
what happened to all that youthful optimism?
"being a doctor is a lot more than knowing facts. we still have to create analytical subroutines to help him diagnose patients, tactile protocols so he can perform surgery, not to mention a personality profile."
"oh, you know, i've been thinking about that. maybe we should make this one a little more pleasant than the old doc."
"all right, ready to transfer the data. computer, transfer medical library master file to emergency medical replacement hologram."
transfer complete.
"chapter one, the animal cell. all the tissues of the body originate from a microscopic structure, the fertilised ovum, which consists of a soft jelly-like material enclosed in a membrane and containing a ves"
what's he doing?
i think he's reciting gray's anatomy.
this may be regarded as a complete cell.
can you stop him?
i'm trying.
similar to it in nature but differing in external form. paragraph.
"listen, this is all very fascinating."
in a higher organism a cell is
but would you please be quiet for a minute!
he doesn't have speech recognition protocols yet.
"well give him some, would you?"
"material similar to that in the ovum and usually called cytoplasm, and a small spherical"
what's happening?
it's an overload. his matrix can't accommodate all the data.
contain no nuclei
what are you doing?
i'm downloading gray's anatomy chapter by chapter.
i thought you said it was too much data for his holomatrix to handle.
it's not for the emh. it's for you.
the romulan vessels are closing in. two minutes to intercept. get us our of here.
i can't get this ship moving. try rerouting power to the impulse engines
"reroute power, reroute power. here we go, i think i've found the relay controls. hey, i'm finally getting the hang of this."
what's happening?
"sorry, i must have transferred power from the holoemitters."
"well, be more careful. if i'm deactivated, this ship'll never get back to starfleet."
"okay, i'm taking power from life support. we don't need that. try the engines now."
nothing. why isn't this working?
thirty seconds to intercept. they're right on top of us.
hold it. i see the problem. the thrust initiator is offline. stand by.
fifteen seconds. they're charging weapons.
see if you can access the shields.
"i said, i said shields!"
already done. shields up.
"this is the warbird t'met calling the prometheus. commander rekar, respond. commander."
this is the prometheus.
activate your viewscreen.
our viewscreen is not operational. we've had some trouble with starfleet commandos.
where's rekar?
in the medical bay. he's suffered minor injuries.
identify yourself.
you first.
you first.
repeat your last statement. i don't understand.
state your identity.
this is sub-commander almak. lower your shields and prepare to be boarded.
they're already down. maybe there's something wrong with your sensor readings. you'd better not try to transport until we can be sure it's safe.
lower your shields immediately or i'll open fire.
immediately? yes. prometheus out.
direct hit. shields down to twenty percent.
three more ships are approaching.
we're doomed.
no. they're starfleet.
what are they doing?
firing on us!
they must think romulans are on board.
they're right!
prometheus to any starfleet vessel. respond. prometheus
"it's no use, they can't hear us. the romulans have scrambled the comm. frequencies."
"doctor, something just went offline."
specifically?
the secondary gyrodyne relays and the propulsion field intermatrix have depolarised.
in english.
i'll try to stabilise the ship. transfer auxiliary power to the manoeuvring thrusters.
transferring auxiliary power now.
"good work, mark two."
thanks.
you'd better get to tactical. we're going to have to defend ourselves.
tactical. right.
what are you waiting for? shoot. shoot.
there are so many controls.
find the one that says fire and push it.
it's not working. it says here the phasers are offline.
"well then, fire a torpedo."
you hit the wrong ship.
it wasn't my fault.
"whose fault was it, the torpedo's? you're supposed to tell it what to do."
navigational control is offline.
"everything's offline. weapons, shields."
it gets worse. there are two warbirds coming right at us.
"my brilliant existence cut short. no time to explore the universe, no time to smell the roses. no time for sex."
initiating decoupling sequence.
what's that? what have i done now?
autoseparation in ten seconds.
autoseparation? i think the romulans did this before.
how do we turn it off?
i don't think we can.
five. four. three. two.
"if i recall correctly, this next part gets a little bumpy."
separation sequence in progress.
hold on.
specify attack pattern.
attack pattern alpha?
specify target.
romulans!
romulans!
"bulls-eye! the warbirds are in retreat. doctor, we've done it. two holograms, alone. romulans on one side, starfleet on the other. alarms beeping everywhere."
"emh mark two, newborn but filled with courage."
"emh mark one, armed with years of experience."
together they emerged triumphant.
the end.  or not.
"welcome to the prometheus, gentlemen. it's about time."
"i'm receiving a transmission through the sensor network. origin, the alpha quadrant."
does it contain a holographic subroutine?
yes.
"transfer it to sickbay. torres to bridge. captain, i think he's back."
"doctor, report."
"i, i did it."
you completed the mission?
yes. once the romulans were out of the way.
romulans?
"they'd taken over the prometheus,he ship i was on. but i managed to turn the tables on them with help from a fellow emh."
you got through to starfleet?
"i spoke directly with headquarters. apparently, voyager was declared officially lost fourteen months ago. i set the record straight. i told them everything that's happened to this crew. they said they would contact your families to tell them the news and promised that they won't stop until they've found a way to get voyager back home. and they asked me to relay a message. they wanted you to know you're no longer alone."
sixty thousand light years seems a little closer today.
"uss voyager. if you are receiving this message, please study it carefully. we have information"
what happened?
i'm not sure. the transmission just stopped.
locate the source. see if you can get it back.
"it looks like. captain, the transmission was sent along the same network of alien relay stations we used to send the doctor to the alpha quadrant."
starfleet command must be using them just like we did.
"harry, can you clear the interference from that message?"
yes ma'am.
they said they wouldn't stop until they found a way to get us home.
"nonetheless, we can't assume they've been able to devise a plan this quickly."
they're communicating with us. that's a big step.
"okay, i've reprocessed everything we've received. i've cleared out most of the interference. here it is."
that's all we got. it looks like the bulk of the transmission is lodged in one of the relay stations.
can you tell which one?
"set a course, tom."
last time we used one of those stations the people who build it weren't too happy.
"we'll deal with that if we have to, but i'm not going to lose this opportunity. we're going to find out what the rest of that message says."
who sent this message?
unknown. it comes from across the galaxy.
locate the ship receiving it.
it's on a course to one of our modules.
intercept.
maybe they've figured out a way to get us home.
how can they get us home from sixty thousand light years away?
who knows what technological advances starfleet has come up with since we've been gone. they might have developed a whole new way of travelling through space.
"since it was technology that brought us to the delta quadrant in the first place, it's a reasonable assumption. technology could bring us back again."
starfleet found a stable wormhole to the gamma quadrant. maybe they've discovered one that leads here.
"this kind of speculation can be intriguing, but be careful about setting yourselves up to be disappointed."
i'm just happy my folks know i'm alive.
i imagine there were quite a few celebrations when people got the news.
"probably. but i can see where it might make things more difficult for some. i'd guess a lot of people had given up on us, done their mourning, gone on with their lives, found some kind of resolution. now they get word that we're alive, but so far away that we might as well be dead."
"some people might feel that way, but not my mom and dad."
"at the very least, we know the relay stations extend almost all the way to the alpha quadrant. if starfleet has found a way to use them to transmit messages, we'll be able to stay in constant contact with people at home. that has to be comforting."
"i'm sure it is, but i think it's more comforting to think that starfleet is going to get us home. if no one objects, that's what i'm going to do."
you were supposed to report to sickbay this morning for your weekly check-up. where have you been?
"here, doing my job."
and just what is this pressing task?
i'm trying to retrieve more of the message transmitted from starfleet command.
"your devotion to duty is admirable, but you must remember that your implants have to be monitored regularly."
i'm fine.
"no, you're not. i'm detecting reduced levels of erythrocytes in your blood. how long has it been since you regenerated?"
fifty eight hours
"well, that explains it. we've discussed this before, seven. you must regenerate in your alcove for at least three hours a day."
i have gone as long as two hundred hours without regenerating
that was when you were a borg. you seem to forget you're a good deal more human now.
"i assure you, i have not forgotten. another one."
i beg your pardon?
i have retrieved another word of text. that makes six.
six words in fifty eight hours? wouldn't it be more efficient just to wait until we arrive at the relay station?
this message is important to the captain
"i'm aware of that. in fact, if it weren't for me, this transmission wouldn't have been possible in the first place. i was the one who risked my matrix in order to go to the alpha quadrant. if we ever get home, i expect i'll become quite the hero. emergency medical hologram instrumental in the return of voyager crew. has a nice ring to it, don't you think?"
"on the other hand, it is entirely possible that your programme will be deleted and you'll be upgraded to conform to the most recent standards."
"unlikely. i've accomplished things no emh ever has. in fact, most likely i'll become an object of intense study and discussion. possibly even veneration. what's that?"
report.
we're encountering some kind of gravimetric forces.
source?
looks like it's coming from the relay station we're heading for.
that station is still two light years away. how could it project a gravimetric field this far?
it would have to have an incredibly powerful energy source.
i've compensated for the disturbance. we should be all right. at least until we get closer.
"i'm detecting a ship, captain. eight hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow."
on screen.
"it's adrift, no propulsion systems, no weapons, no life support."
i'm picking up one male humanoid aboard. he's dead.
"as soon as we're close enough, beam the body to sickbay. i want to know how he died."
what's happened to him?
"he appears to have suffered a complete osteotomy. he's been gutted. apparently some kind of surgical procedure was used to remove the entire skeleton, as well as the musculature, the ligaments and tendons, and the internal organs."
how long ago did this happen?
it's difficult to say. somewhere between a week and a month.
i've seen this before. the borg encountered a small ship of species five one seven four. they were also destroyed in this fashion.
"did you ever determine who did it, and why?"
no. it was irrelevant.
return the body to his ship. his people may be able to retrieve him.
very well.
"when we get closer to the station, we can use the data processors in astrometrics to download the message."
"yes, captain."
not exactly what i expected. it looks ancient.
radiometric decay rations indicate it's at least one hundred thousand years old.
scan for lifeforms.
"negative, sir. looks like there's nobody home."
"oh, that's good news."
here we go again.
the gravimetric field.
"commander, if my sensors are right, that station is using a quantum singularity as a power source."
a black hole?
"it's a tiny one, probably about a centimetre in diameter, but it's putting out almost four terawatts of energy."
that someone's managed to contain a singularity and construct a space station around it and tap it's power. that's fascinating.
can we take the ship any closer?
i wouldn't recommend it. voyager would take a beating from the gravimetric eddies.
"all right, tom, back us off."
"aye, sir."
bridge to janeway.
go ahead.
we're as close as we're going to be able to get.
okay.
we'll see if we can download the message from here.
"the datastream degraded during transmission. elements have been dislocated, rearranged. it's going to require some time to decompress the message and rearrange it in the proper sequence."
don't worry about the sequence. get it out in bits and pieces if you have to. we can put it together later.
i've accessed a block of data. i'm downloading the text.
how much we miss you. we talk about you often. wondering about your day. sounds awfully personal from starfleet command. the children have grown so much you wouldn't. these are letters. these are letters from home.
"you'll be the official mail carrier, neelix. we'll get you the letters as quickly as we can download them."
"a task i'm happy to perform, captain. i can tell you, i've never seen the crew this excited."
this is the closest they've come to their families in almost four years.
i promise to treat these like gemstones.
"by the time you've delivered them, we should have more."
captain. i've discovered something odd. there seems to be more here than just letters.
what do you mean?
there's a latent datastream buried under the message. it's heavily encrypted.
encrypted?
it appears to contain a large block of text and what may be maps
can you retrieve any of it?
"not immediately. when more of the letters have been cleared out, i should be able to access the coded message."
"well, i might just hope that it contains a plan for bringing us back to the alpha quadrant. i'm curious, seven. what do you think about all this? messages, the possibility of getting home?"
it lacks any emotional resonance for me. i've never even been to earth.
you realise you may have family there?
that had not occurred to me.
"you could have cousins, grandparents. there might be more emotional resonance than you think."
ahem. i am happy to announce that i have the first letters from home.
"who are they for, neelix?"
"ah, this one is addressed to commander chakotay. who's it from, commander?"
"an old friend. the person who recruited me into the maquis. maybe i'll read this in private. tom, you have the bridge."
"neelix, wait a minute. aren't there any more?"
no. no more for the bridge crew. not yet. be patient.
come in.
"good news, mister vulcan. this one's for you."
"thank you, mister neelix. you can put it on the desk. was there something more?"
aren't you going to read it?
of course.
"i, i mean, aren't you going to read it now?"
"i'm finishing my weekly tactical review. when it's completed, i'll read the message."
you're going to wait until you finish the tactical review?
do you have any reason to believe the content of the message will change during that time?
that's not the point. it's a letter from your family. don't you want to know what it says?
i fully intend to find out what it says.
it has some important news.
you mean you've read it?
"well, only the first few lines. when i was seeing who it was addressed to, i, i couldn't help it. would you like me to read it to you?"
very well.
"my husband, we have been given the news that you are alive. your children and i have asked the priests at the temple of aymonk to say prayers for your safe return. that's very sweet."
amonak.
pardon?
the temple of amonak. one of the most sacred on vulcan.
"amonak. of course. the most significant news is the fact that your first son, sek, has gone through the pon farr. he mated and has become a father. you are now the grandfather of a healthy female who they have named t'meni, after your mother. you're a grandfather. isn't that wonderful? congratulations. what should we call you now? grandpa? gramps?"
"i think commander tuvok will suffice. thank you, mister neelix. i'll read the rest to myself."
just so long as you read it right away. no procrastinating. who knows what else might be in that letter?
"is that a letter to you, captain?"
yes. seven just downloaded it. i'll be in my ready room.
"yes, ma'am."
have you gotten a letter yet?
don't expect one.
do you remember sveta?
of course.
i got one from her.
"why would she be writing you? chakotay, what is it?"
"something terrible has happened. i read that letter for an hour before i could accept it. now i have to tell everyone else and i'm not sure how to do it. it's over, b'elanna. there are no more maquis."
what are you saying? there are thousands of us.
"all wiped out. it seems the cardassians have an ally, a species from the gamma quadrant who supplied them with ships and weapons."
k'tarra? roberto? everyone except us is dead?
just about. sveta and a few lucky ones are in prison.
no.
b'elanna.
"don't! don't try to console me. i don't want to be comforted. those were our friends, good people willing to put their lives on the line for something they believed in and now you're telling me that they are gone, that they are slaughtered."
those are the risks we all took. we all knew where it could lead.
"it's not right and you know it. i will make someone pay, i swear i will. if we ever get back."
"tom, i heard there are at least thirty more letters that have been downloaded."
oh yeah?
neelix is supposed to on his way here now.
"what do you suppose this is, anyway?"
what was is?
"this mystery dish. it tastes vaguely like chicken, but it has the consistency of corn husks."
is that all you can think about? what you're eating?
"well, i don't like guessing at what i put in my stomach"
"tom, we're getting letters from home. doesn't that mean anything to you?"
not particularly.
i don't believe you.
"you know, it's really not that bad."
here he comes.
good news. seven has been able to download some more letters. this one is for susan nicoletti. is she here?
oh! yeah.
fitzpatrick?
right here.
thank you.
kyoto? golwat?  ashmore? dorado?
i'm here.
there's not going to be one for me
he's not done yet. hang on.
"and finally, parsons. i'm sorry if your name hasn't come up, but seven is still working."
neelix. i thought you had over thirty letters.
thirty? where did you hear that?
that's what was going around.
don't pay any attention to rumours.
right.
aren't you going to eat your lunch?
i'm not hungry
"you shouldn't get your hopes up, harry. no hopes, no disappointments."
i'm not you.
come in.
"captain, i'm beginning to have trouble accessing the datastream. the longer it remains lodged in the relay station, the more it degrades."
if we could get near enough we could try to stabilise the containment field. but i can't risk taking the ship in any closer.
a shuttle could withstand the gravimetric eddies more easily than voyager. i'd like to try it.
i'd want commander tuvok to go with you.
for what reason?
it isn't my custom to send an away team of one.
as you wish.
hi.
hi. i thought seven was working in here.
she's gone with tuvok to shore up the station's confinement field. i've taken over for her. disappointed?
"of course not. would you stop that? i've told you, there's nothing between us."
i know there's nothing between you. it's purely a one way attraction.
very funny.
"harry, you might as well wear a big sign that says, i'm in love. everyone sees it."
"look, i'll admit that for a while. well, she's a very attractive woman, but i've gotten over that."
okay.
fine. believe whatever you want.
"if you didn't come down here to see her, why did you?"
i wanted to know if i'd gotten a letter yet.
sorry. i haven't seen anything so far.
do you think there's going to be one for everybody?
i'm sure that starfleet contacted the families and friends of everyone on the ship. they know how important that would be.
i hope so.
"harry, you'll get one. try to be patient."
"commander, am i correct in assuming that vulcans are incapable of lying?"
"we are capable of telling lies. however, i have never found it prudent or necessary to do so."
you have never lied?
only under orders from a superior officer.
then i must ask you something. is it the captain's custom to send at least two people on an away mission?
"it's not only her custom, it's recommended starfleet protocol."
i see.
is there a purpose to your question?
i am wondering if the captain still doesn't trust me. if she feels i require supervision.
"i am not certain how the captain regards you, but her decision to have me accompany you on this mission shouldn't be taken as evidence of any particular attitude."
i believe we are close enough to emit a polaron pulse.
bring the main deflector online.
ready.
the variance in the containment field is now at point two nine.
that should prevent further degradation of the signal.
"let me ask you a question, seven. is the captain's opinion important to you?"
my understanding of the hierarchy on voyager is that the captain's opinion is important to every member of the crew.
what's happened?
we have just been scanned by a sub-neucleonic beam of some kind.
the navigational sensors have been disrupted.
"we must get voyager to send out a directional beacon to guide us back. tuvok to voyager. voyager, please respond."
"commander, we've lost other systems as well. we have no communications, no warp engines and no weapons."
i suspect this was done intentionally by the ship that's approaching rapidly off out port stern.
they're at fifty thousand kilometres and closing.
our shields are losing integrity.
"i'll try to get at least one phaser array back online. commander, one more hit and we'll be susceptible to a hull breach."
"that ship is larger than ours. if we lure it closer to the station, it will be far more vulnerable to the gravitational eddies than we are. a tractor beam. we are being pulled toward the ship."
i'll try to disrupt it. unsuccessful.
launching a distress beacon.
torres to the bridge.
go ahead.
"captain, could lieutenant paris come"
down here? i think i've got something he'd want to see.
he's on his way.
it's a letter for you. it's coming through right now.
for me?
it's right here.
who's it from?
i can't tell yet.
"maybe it's from the rehab colony, telling me i've violated probation."
why are you acting like this?
"i just want to know who the letter's from, okay?"
you should know in a minute.
i'll be on the bridge.
"what, you're not going to wait?"
i'm on duty.
voyager is hanging in space. there's not a lot to do at the helm.
i just thought that i should be at my post.
"you may be able to fool someone else with that ploy, but you're talking to me, tom."
"just download the letter, okay?"
a little more has come in. it's from starfleet. from an admiral owen. do you know him?
admiral owen paris. it's my father.
that's wonderful.
"yeah. maybe. i don't know exactly why, but the more everybody gets excited about these letters from home, the more i don't want any part of it. maybe because what i have on voyager is so much better than anything i ever had back there. i just don't want the reminder."
you're not the same person you were four years ago. what makes you think he is?
"no, you don't know him."
at least give him a chance. he's obviously reaching out.
"when he forms an opinion about something, nothing can change his mind."
"fine. excuse me if i can't feel terribly sorry for you. i learned this morning that a lot of my friends are dead. and i've gone from being so angry that i wanted to kill someone to crying for an hour. and now i'm just trying to, to accept it and move on."
"b'elanna, that's awful. i am so sorry. and here i am going on about something that doesn't even matter anymore."
"no, i'm sorry. it obviously does. you care what he thinks about you."
"yeah. yeah, i guess i still do."
i'll let you know when i get the whole letter.
come in.
looks like tuvok and seven pulled it off. the containment field has stabilised quite a bit. b'elanna says she'd downloading the letters much more easily now.
that's good news.
"we don't have the shuttle on sensors yet, but they should be back soon."
i've learned a few interesting things about that relay station. it's generating as much energy every minute as a typical star puts out in a year.
it's amazing to me is that someone a hundred thousand years ago was harvesting microsingularities.
"if nobody shows up to protest, i'd like to stay here for a while. try to find the answers to some of these questions. this is the kind of archaeological puzzle that's always fascinated me. want a cup?"
"no, thanks. you haven't mentioned your letter. who was it from?"
"it was from mark, the man i was engaged to. he told me about the litter of puppies my dog had, and how he found homes for them. how devastated he was when voyager was lost. how he held out hopes we were alive longer than most people did until he realised that he was clinging to a fantasy. so he began living his life again. meeting people, letting go of the past. about four months ago, he married a woman who works with him. he's very happy."
how do you feel about that?
"well, i knew he'd eventually move on with his life. but there was such a finality to that letter."
kim to the captain. can you come to the bridge?
what is it?
we've picked up an automated distress signal from tuvok's shuttle. sensors show there's no one on board.
seven. seven of nine.
where are we?
i assume we're on the alien ship.
this is most uncomfortable. have you seen anyone?
no. if we can reach one of those blades perhaps we can cut through these bindings.
you were pathetic prey. easily taken.
the hunt was not satisfying. i want information. why do you violate our property? i could snap your puny neck with one twist. hardly worth taking. answer me. why do you use our modules?
we're trying to retrieve important messages from our home. return us to our ship and we'll be on our way without trespassing again.
i took you in a fair hunt. i claim the relics of the chase.
are the others on your ship able to put up more of a fight than you?
you will find our captain a formidable opponent and our ship heavily armed.
good. strong prey makes for a better hunt.
release us now and you'll be safe. otherwise we will destroy you.
pitiful relics.
they 'are the first of their kind. i will be envied.
i've located their ship. it's four thousand ketriks from the module.
we'll be there within the hour. go to stalking mode. why do you hesitate?
the rest of the group is on its way.
i wanted to claim this prey for myself.
we may not be able to take them alone. we need the strength of the others.
i won't share prey with the others. these two must be the only relics. prepare them.
"captain, it's tricky to scan through the interference, but i think i'm detecting a ship."
what kind of ship?
"let me reconfigure the sensor array. it's hirogen, and tuvok and seven are on it."
hail them.
on screen.
i'm captain janeway of the starship voyager. you have two of my crew on board.
disconnect your link with our module and leave this space.
not without my people.
they are my relics.
i'm prepared to offer you something for their safe return. surely we can come to an agreement?
"if the rest of my group arrives, you will be taken as well. i'm giving you a chance to run."
we don't run.
"captain, i've got three more ships on sensors, coming towards us at high warp."
don't be foolish. leave now and save yourselves.
give me my people and we'll do just that.
they're mine.
then get ready for a fight. red alert.
are they prepared?
yes. but now is not the time for it. we should wait until the others arrive and take the ship.
i want to make the first kill. you will verify it.
"if there's a battle, we must join it."
the others can wage the battle.
perhaps you are more interested in collecting relics. perhaps your judgment is clouded.
don't question me again. we do it now.
"i suggest you think carefully about your decision. if you kill us, our captain will hunt you down and show no mercy."
"i'm not concerned. lower the harness. a long, coiled intestine. an interesting trophy."
what possible use could you make of my intestines?
unusual relics are prized. yours will make me envied by men and pursued by women.
you are a crude species. only your size makes you formidable.
your insults are as pitiful as your efforts to escape. this one first. i want the female to witness what will happen to her. their bone structure makes cutting through the back difficult. this will take time.
bridge to torres.
"torres here, captain."
how much longer?
i'm getting out piece by piece. at least another half hour.
how are you coming?
the ship has some kind of monotanium armour plating. it's scattering the targeting beam.
the other three ships are closing. they're within six thousand kilometres.
"captain, those ships have massive weapons. they've definitely got us outgunned."
"harry, let me see those ships in relation to the relay station."
yes ma'am.
maybe we can use that quantum singularity to our advantage.
how?
"if we can boost the effect of the singularity, increase the gravitational pull, we might be able to stop them."
the pull would increase if we could weaken the station's containment field. an antithoron burst might do it.
if we're not careful we might be pulled in as well.
"don't worry, we're going to be ready for it. harry, create a low level warp field around voyager. sublight energy level. that should help counteract the gravitational pull."
"if the field is too strong, we won't be able to beam tuvok and seven aboard."
"then you'll have to find the right balance, won't you, harry?"
"yes, ma'am."
"on my mark, direct a level eight antithoron burst towards the station. have thrusters ready for full reverse, mister paris."
understood.
"i've established a low level warp field, captain."
antithoron system is online.
i'm ready with thrusters.
do it.
it's working.
"try the transporter lock again, harry."
stabilise the ship.
i can't. the gravity well is pulling us in.
that vessel is weakening the module's containment field.
ready weapons. signal the others to attack/
torres to the bridge.
go ahead.
the antithoron burst collapsed
the signal. i've gotten as much of the message as i'm going to get.
acknowledged. hail those ships.
channel open.
"this is captain janeway. agree to retreat, and we'll restore the containment field."
"captain, they're firing."
their weapons are destabilising the containment field.
this is janeway. stop firing. you're putting yourselves in grave danger.
the field is going. the singularity is about to be exposed.
"captain, the ship with tuvok and seven is still being pulled in."
get a tractor beam on it.
"i have tuvok and seven targeted, but if we try to transport them now the gravity well could scatter their patterns."
the tractor beam is weakening. we're going to lose them.
"harry, we have to risk it."
activating the transporter.
full reverse. increase power to the engine.
no response.
do you have them?
not yet. their patterns are distorting.
narrow the annular confinement beam.
"tractor beam's almost gone, captain. we're losing this tug of war."
reroute all secondary power to the tractor emitters.
the tractor beam collapsed. that ship is headed into the black hole.
i'm realigning the pattern buffer. i've got one more shot at it. i got them. they're in transporter room two.
i need more power. we're being pulled in.
transfer all available power to the engines.
it's not enough.
shut down life support.
structural integrity's failing. the hull is starting to buckle.
we're going in.
open the antimatter injectors to one hundred twenty percent.
"captain, that could breach the core."
so will that black hole. now just do it.
"yes, ma'am."
we're free.
resume course. i'll be in astrometrics.
"captain, look at this. the energy released from the singularity created a massive discharge along the relay network. it disabled every one of the stations."
how much of the message were you able to get?
i got most of the encrypted starfleet text and a few more personal letters.
how soon can we see what starfleet had to say?
"it'll take some time to decode. harry should probably work on it. if you'll excuse me, i have a few letters to deliver."
neelix can do that.
"no need. anyway, there's one that i want to do personally."
"good news, harry. i got this at the last minute."
it's from my folks. thanks.
"i'm sorry, tom. i wasn't able to download yours in time."
just when i was getting eager to read it.
"you could assume that he said he loves you, and that he's proud of you."
i think i will.
"i learned very little about them, but i believe we should consider them extremely dangerous. they seem to lack any moral centre."
do you know why the relay network was so important to them?
"no. i assume they used it for communications, as we did."
"well, they won't be using it any more."
"they won't be pleased about that, captain. i doubt we've seen the last of them."
come in.
if you'll excuse me. commander.
"repair teams have inspected the ship from stem to stern. except for some maintenance that's needed on the warp coils, everything seems fine."
i suppose so. want some coffee?
thanks.
"cream and sugar, huh?"
two sugars.
"oh, two sugars?"
"you know, you drink too much of that stuff."
really?
if i'm not mistaken that's your third cup this morning.
"fourth. and on a day like today, it won't be my last. coffee - the finest organic suspension ever devised. it's got me through the worst of the last three years. i beat the borg with it. oh, i'm sure voyager will be fine, but i'm worried that the crew might be a different story. i think they were hoping mail call would become a regular part of their day."
neelix is putting together an impromptu party. he thought it might cheer them up.
good idea. when will it be?
as soon as he can get people together.
leave it to neelix to come up with the right idea at the right time.
how are you doing?
me? i'm fine.
"you'd say that if you'd just had your legs torn off by a traykan beast. look what you've been through in the last few days. we finally make a connection with home and then it's ripped away from us. we manage to make another enemy who's going to try and hunt us down and destroy us, and on top of that"
"it's all right. you can say it. on top of all that, i got a dear john letter. it wasn't really a surprise. i guess i didn't really expect him to wait for me considering the circumstances. it made me realise that i was using him as a safety net, you know, as a way to avoid becoming involved with someone else."
you don't have that safety net any more.
"that's right. then again, my life is far from uneventful here in the delta quadrant. it's not like i would have had a chance to pursue a relationship, even if i had realised i was alone."
"you're hardly alone, and to my way of thinking, there's still plenty of time."
plenty of time.
neelix to the ready room. the party's about to begin and there are only two people missing.
we're on our way.
the prey's course has become erratic. i will intercept to kill.
no. maintain distance. his ship is damaged. he's injured. let him bleed.
this prey is resilient. we will lose the moment.
the way a creature behaves when it is wounded is the key to it's destruction. maintain distance.
direct hit. our hull armour is stable.
his weapons must be weakening.
"the prey is heading for an asteroid belt, vector one six eight point nine. we are losing him."
he hasn't come here to hide. he's come to make a final stand.
tracking. he's holding position above an asteroid and he's left his ship.
follow him.
the prey is scattering our sensors.
impressive. he counters out pursuit to the final moment.
compensating.
no. disengage sensors.
for what reason?
i want to take him with my own eyes. follow. i'll draw his attack. prepare to target his thoracic crest.
a flawless kill.
"please remain still so that i can treat your injuries. thank you. i'm sorry, did that hurt? i'll try to be more careful. thanks for being a patient patient. have a pleasant afternoon. this is absurd."
"not at all. keep going, you're doing fine."
this vernacular is not applicable to my duties on voyager.
"we can tailor the vocabulary to your specific situations a little later. right now, it's the sentiment that counts."
i don't see the relevance.
"i created these exercises three years ago to familiarise myself with the social graces. i found that if i repeated them several times each day, the words became almost second nature. let's continue. exercise two, the workplace encounter. kes used to help me with this one. now i'll be the nurse, you be the doctor."
please hand me the hypospray.
"of course, doctor, immediately."
thank you. looks at instrument.
"no, no, don't read that part, only the dialogue."
"excuse me, nurse. this is the wrong hypospray. would you mind finding the correct one."
not at all.
thank you. did i mention you look lovely today?
"oh, doctor, you're so charming."
this lesson is terminated.
"i know it's awkward. for me, it was even painful, but you'll find the rewards are well worth the effort."
rewards?
"the ability to put others at ease, make them feel more comfortable around you. you're a lot like me when i was first activated. if i'd had a mentor, things would have gone a lot more smoothly. i'm willing to share my wisdom but, if you're not interested, fine, i'll stick to your physiological maintenance."
i will examine your data.
"oh, good. pay special attention to exercise seventeen, bridge banter for beginners."
have a pleasant day.
verify.
"monotanium hull plating, dicyclic warp signature. the vessel is definitely hirogen."
they're moving to intercept.
evasive manoeuvres?
"no. we need to settle our differences here and now. hard about, full impulse."
red alert.
they're in visual range.
on screen. hail them.
no response.
"they're closing. fifty thousand kilometres, forty five, forty."
"maintain course, mister paris."
curious. they are not charging weapons.
"they're slowing, sir."
lifesigns?
"only one, and it's erratic."
"they've stopped, captain. their engines just went offline."
this could be a trap.
"harry, run a long range scan. are there any other hirogen ships out there?"
none.
take us within transporter range.
you intend to board their ship?
yes.
the hirogen vessel is a potential threat. we should destroy it.
"seven, what you call a threat, i call an opportunity to gain knowledge about this species. and in this case, maybe even show some compassion. there seems to be a wounded pilot over there."
our experience with the hirogen indicates that compassion would not be reciprocated.
and all of my experience says we've got to take that chance anyway. commander.
"tuvok, paris, you're with me."
looks like there was a fight.
search for the lifesigns.
commander.
"i'm reading bones, muscle tissue, from at least nine different species. it's all being broken down by some sort of enzyme."
perhaps this is their method of denaturating their prey.
either that or it's dinner.
looks like somebody lost their helmet. urgh!
commander. i'm not picking up any weapon residuals. i'd say he was physically torn apart.
i'm picking up the lifesigns. this way.
massive internal bleeding. let's get him to sickbay.
the data we downloaded from the ship's computer included navigational records. can you give us a map of this region?
the is the hirogen vessel's flightpath over the past five years.
they've certainly covered a lot of space.
this ship alone has visited over ninety star systems in the last year.
"i analysed some of their logs. from what i can tell, this is a hunting species. we saw the skeletal remains from dozens of alien races displayed like trophies. there was also evidence they may be using some of their victims for food. the entire culture seems to be based on the hunt. social rituals, art, religious beliefs. they're nomadic. their existence is driven by the pursuit of prey and it's carried them across huge distances."
"there is no evidence of a home planet. their ships travel alone or in small groups. on occasion, several will join forces in a multi-pronged attack."
like wolves.
how's our wolf in sickbay?
"still unconscious, behind a level five forcefield"
"you were right, seven. this species is a threat. but despite the risk of sending an away team, we know a lot more about who we're dealing with now."
"you were correct, captain. it was worth the risk. this time."
so there's one question remaining. who's hunting the hunters?
i was trying to remove his body armour to treat the internal injuries when he suddenly regained consciousness. needless to say he's not happy to be here.
can you sedate him?
"i've already tried. his immune system neutralises everything. i could synthesise a more potent compound, but that would take hours. he could be dead by then. his wounds are severe."
"your crewmate is dead, and your ship has been damaged beyond repair. i brought you here to treat your injuries. what happened to your ship? who attacked you? the first time i met your species it wasn't on the best of terms, but that doesn't mean you and i can't find a way to change that."
our prey.
you were on a hunt?
"yes. a formidable alien. we captured it two days ago, but it broke free of its restraints, attacked us. release me. i must continue the hunt."
"not without your ship, and not in this condition. you'll die without treatment. let us help you."
doctor?
"all right. i'm going to enter the forcefield now and start with a few scans of your midsection. you should know i'm a hologram and can't be bent, spindled or mutilated, so don't bother trying. please lie down. or remain standing."
"captain, we've detected six more hirogen ships. they're converging on us from all directions."
the one in sickbay may have sent a distress call from his vessel.
how long do we have?
the nearest ship is half a light year away. four hours at most.
"tom, analyse their approach pattern. evade them as long as you can."
"yes, ma'am."
"i want to buy the doctor enough time to treat our hunter. if i gain his confidence, he might call off his friends. good old-fashioned diplomacy could get us out of this yet."
"don't count on it. from what i found in their database, diplomacy isn't a part of their lifestyle. they don't see us as equals. to them, we're simply game."
"it's time we convince them otherwise, or like any other cornered animal, we'll show our teeth."
"there's been a hull rupture on deck eleven, section three. damage is minor. it appears a plasma conduit overloaded."
increase power to the structural integrity field.
a bulkhead has collapsed in jefferies tube eighty four.
another overload?
negative. the plasma network is stable. this wasn't caused by any power surge or system failure.
"harry, tuvok, get to deck eleven and check it out."
this was no overload.
indeed.
commander.
it's a dense mixture of dna and polyfluidic compounds. tuvok to bridge.
go ahead.
we may have an intruder aboard.
i'm analysing what could be a sample of its blood. the readings are consistent with species 8472.
"intruder alert. bridge to security, seal off decks ten through twelve."
internal sensors aren't detecting any intruders.
"the last time we ran into this species, it was impervious to our scanners. we'll have to track it visually."
how did it get past our shields?
"we'll worry about that later. you have the bridge, commander. i'll be on deck eleven."
i've erected a level ten forcefield around engineering.
"good.  set up secondary forcefields around every hatch, jefferies tube and conduit leading into this room. i want every one of these consoles secured. authorised command codes only. i'm going to lock down the warp core. ensign, realign the dilithium matrix to a frequency of three point six nine"
report.
"four crewmembers are wounded, two seriously."
get them to sickbay.
species 8472 accessed engineering through the antimatter injector port. our phaser fire was insufficient. it attacked us then escaped through jefferies tube seventeen alpha.
janeway to tuvok.
tuvok here.
the intruder just left engineering. seal off the area.
understood.
secure the warp core.
"yes, captain."
seven.
it would seem that the hirogen underestimated their latest prey.
you believe they were hunting the creature?
"yes. when the borg were fighting species 8472, did they ever engage in physical combat?"
on many occasions.
can you recall anything that might help us here?
"each time they boarded a borg vessel, they went directly to the central power matrix and disabled it."
the creature was just in engineering. didn't touch any of our power systems.
it's obviously adjusted its strategy. species 8472 is devious and highly intelligent. it will seek the most efficient means of destroying us.
let's get to sickbay.
"she's going to be just fine, captain."
is it alone? have you seen any others like it?
why?
"six months ago, this species invaded our galaxy with thousands of ships. we were barely able to fight them off."
"your prey could indicate another invasion. if it does, we're all in trouble. how many ships have you seen?"
"only one. damaged. we tracked it across fifty light years. we thought that we had killed the creature, but this prey is unlike any other. it has many lives. lower the forcefield and i will finish the hunt."
your attempt to destroy it will fail. species 8472 is highly resistant to all technology. all but one. borg nanoprobes.
nanoprobes?
microscopic weapons that can attack the species on a cellular level. we've tried it before and it worked.
i'll modify the phaser rifles to fire nanoprobe discharges.
"i want you to incapacitate the creature, not kill it. can you make that modification?"
"yes, but it would require additional time. we must stop it as soon as possible."
she's right.
not until we know why it returned.
you will be exposing this crew to unnecessary risk.
i disagree.
captain.
"you have your orders, seven. six of your vessels will be here in under four hours. i hope you'll let them know that we saved your life and that we want to avoid any further conflict with your people."
"let me resume the hunt, and i will grant your request."
we have enough problems on this ship as it is without him running around.
"i spent six months studying this prey's behaviour. i know how to track him. let me continue, or i will have the others destroy you."
tuvok to janeway.
go ahead.
"we're holding position in section ninety four, but the creature has accessed the environmental controls. deck eleven is losing life support. artificial gravity has also been compromised."
evacuate the deck.
regroup on deck ten.
"aye, captain."
he's trying to barricade himself. he did the same thing to us.
"you want to be part of the hunt? now's your chance. he'll be under your supervision, commander. if he steps out of line, shoot him."
my weapon.
temperature gradient.
affirmative.
atmospheric recyclers.
engaged.
is your body armour designed to handle rapid pressure fluctuations?
it can defeat most hostile environments. i once tracked a silicon-based lifeform through the neutronium mantle of a collapsed star.
i once tracked a mouse through jefferies tube thirty two.
chakotay to tuvok. we're ready to go.
as are we.
"proceed to deck eleven, keep you comm. links open."
understood. activate the nanoprobe charges.
level five should be sufficient to stun the creature.
depressurising hatch. magnetise.
maintain your position.
he's here.
i said maintain your position. this is my hunt. i'm at point.
my knowledge of this prey is superior you yours.
"but you're on unfamiliar terrain. i know this ship, you don't."
the prey will likely attack the man at point. you would not survive.
i'll take that chance. now fall back.
no problem. i'll take up the rear.
"you missed. since species 8472 invaded the ship, you've become increasingly agitated."
"they were the only species to offer true resistance to the borg. they destroyed millions of drones, hundreds of our worlds. i have reason to be agitated."
what is it?
it's blood. the prey is wounded.
this corridor ends about twenty metres ahead.
the only thing down there is deflector control. it's got nowhere to run.
"he's not planning to run. he's waiting. he'll attempt to slip around us, attack from behind."
chakotay to tuvok.
tuvok here.
we've cornered the intruderin section fifty nine.
on our way.
it's hurt.
this prey is resilient. he will strike with his dying breath. we must kill him now.
"that may not be necessary. hold your fire. i said, lower your weapon."
"mister neelix, i must ask you to exchange your spatula for a phaser rifle."
sure.
we have two intruders on board and six hirogen vessels on the way. i need additional security personnel.
"right away, sir. what's my assignment?"
"join the security detail on deck ten, section twelve. you'll receive further instructions then. i'll expect tactical updates every twenty minutes."
lieutenant? are you all right?
you have your orders.
report.
"the hirogen's back in sickbay, within a forcefield."
and species 8472?
"we've established a security perimeter. basically, we've turned this entire section into a brig."
"as an added precaution, have b'elanna start working on a way to lock onto the creature, in case we have to beam it off the ship. you mentioned it was injured. in what way?"
"i wish i could tell you for certain. it's body is generating some sort of bioelectric field making it impossible to scan, so i could only make a visual diagnosis. it's conscious but immobile. its epidermis displays any number of injuries, punctures, energy burns. and its demeanour is that of a wounded animal."
the hirogen said they've been chasing it for several months. is there anything you can do?
"i don't know enough about it's physiognomy to treat it's surface wounds, let alone any internal damage. frankly, i'm at a loss."
"captain, just before we cornered it, species 8472 accessed deflector control from this panel."
"i've analysed the transmission protocols. it was attempting to open a singularity into it's realm, but it failed."
it was trying to get home.
that's what it looks like.
tuvok?
the creature initiated telepathic contact with me.
what's it saying?
"it's ship was damaged during the conflict with the borg. when the other members of its species retreated into fluidic space, it was left behind. it has been trapped in the delta quadrant ever since. alone, pursued by hirogen hunting parties. it has no desire for further conflict. it only wants to return to its domain. it is dying, captain."
you have nothing to be afraid of. we're going to help you get back to your realm. does it understand?
it does.
"it will take time to open a singularity and we have no way of treating your injuries, but if there's anything you can tell us about your"
it has lost consciousness. our telepathic link has been severed.
where is my prey?
"lying at the end of a corridor on deck eleven. nearly dead, thanks to you."
take me to it.
no.
take me to it!
"in less than three hours, your ships will arrive. by that time, species 8472 will no longer be on voyager."
what do you mean?
i'm sending it back where it came from.
surrender the creature to me and you will not be harmed.
"this isn't a hunt, it's a slaughter, and i'm calling it off right now."
"we will not be denied our prey. give us the creature, or your crew will take its place."
tuvok.
have seven of nine report to my ready room.
you intend to ask her to open a rift into 8472's realm.
she's the only one on board who knows how.
"given her feelings towards the species, she may not want to cooperate."
we'll see.
"you wish to see me, captain?"
"i've made a decision about species 8472. i'm going to return it to fluidic space. in order to do that, i need you to open a quantum singularity."
i don't believe that is a prudent course of action.
"i realise it may be difficult for you to help save this creature's life, but part of becoming human is learning to have compassion for those who are suffering, even when they're your bitter enemies."
why?
"i remember when i was a lieutenant. it was during a cardassian border conflict. my away team was cut off while we were defending a federation outpost. we'd been exchanging phaser fire with a group of cardassians for about three days. a stalemate. one night, during a break in the fighting, we could hear this low moaning sound coming from somewhere in the brush. we knew that none of our people were out there, so it had to be a wounded cardassian. you have to understand, we'd been killing each other for weeks on this planet. it was brutal. but our commanding officer decided that we couldn't just sit there and listen to that poor man suffer. so he ordered me and an ensign to crawl out there and bring that cardassian back to our camp. i thought he was crazy. he was risking our lives for someone who would have shot us without hesitation. but we did it, and the cardassian lived. three days later we secured the outpost. it was a major victory. we were all decorated by starfleet command. but in retrospect, the thing i'm most proud of was the night we saved that man's life."
explain.
a single act of compassion can put you in touch with your own humanity.
you are trying to justify your present decision.
"no, i'm trying to help you see this as an opportunity to grow. i know you don't want to do it, seven, but i'm telling you as your captain, and as your friend, you won't regret it."
"no. your decision is tactically unsound. we will be surrounded by hirogen ships in approximately two hours. if we do not surrender the creature, they will destroy us. a lesson in compassion will do me little good if i am dead."
it is wrong to sacrifice another being to save our own lives.
i have observed that you have been willing to sacrifice your own life to save the lives of your crew.
"yes, but that's different. that was my choice. this creature does not have a choice."
"it invaded our ship, put our lives at risk to save its own. in my view, it has already forfeited its freedom."
i'm giving you an order. report to deflector control and begin working on creating a singularity.
i will not comply. i have agreed to remain on voyager. i have agreed to function as a member of your crew. but i will not be a willing participant in my own destruction or the destruction of this ship.
objection noted. we'll do this without you.
you will fail.
and you have just crossed the line. end of debate. report to the cargo bay and remain there until this is over. is that understood?
shields down to eighty four percent.
return fire.
three more ships are closing from port and starboard. all escape trajectories have been cut off.
our weapons are having little effect on their hull plating. i'm scanning for weaknesses in the molecular structure.
shields at seventy nine percent.
they are hailing us.
better late than never. open a channel.
you've taken our prey and one of our hunters. surrender them.
"call off your attack and we'll return your crewman. as for your prey, it's under our protection now."
it belongs to us.
it belongs to no one. now order your ships to withdraw and this can end peacefully.
all vessels are firing.
any luck finding a crack in their armour?
not yet.
"doctor to bridge. species 8472 appears to be regenerating. i'm no exobiologist, but i'd say this fellow is becoming highly agitated."
it could be sensing the hirogen attack.
"doctor, can you sedate it?"
"i believe so, but i'll need another dose of borg nanoprobes."
stand by. bridge to seven of nine.
yes.
report to deck eleven immediately with a supply of nanoprobes.
understood.
"b'elanna, how's it going down there?"
"transporters are ready. i can establish a lock on the creature at any time, but i still haven't duplicated the deflector protocols to open a singularity."
how long?
"i need another hour, maybe two."
"captain, we can outmanoeuvre the hirogen ships for a few more minutes, but beyond that"
direct hit to the eps manifold. main power just went down.
forcefields on all decks are offline.
switch to auxiliary power.
done. forcefields have been restored but i don't know how long they'll hold.
bridge to doctor. report.
"it's all right, captain. the creature is contained."
"bridge to sickbay. security, respond."
"security, dispatch teams to deck five. the hirogen may be loose."
direct hit to our port nacelle. now they've taken out our starboard nacelle.
"they've crippled us. tuvok, divert warp power to the phaser banks. maybe that'll help us penetrate their hull plating."
the nanoprobes?
armed and ready.
not a moment too soon.
give me the prey.
lower your weapon or i will destroy you.
i don't think you will. you want me to destroy this creature. i saw it on your face earlier in the medical bay. it's a look i've seen a thousand times. stand aside.
what are you doing?
"captain, someone's accessing the transporter system from deck five."
lock them out.
i can't. they're overriding my commands with borg encryption codes.
"report, mister kim."
"8472 and the hirogen, they've been beamed to one of the attacking ships."
all six vessels are moving away at high warp.
"tom, can we pursue?"
"i'm sorry, captain. warp engines are still offline."
"resume our previous course, full impulse."
seven of nine.
seven of nine.
captain.
"step down, please. seven, you disobeyed my direct orders, and as a result you condemned a sentient being to its death."
"by doing so, i also diverted the hirogen attack. an attack which would have destroyed us."
"maybe not. in any case, the decision wasn't yours to make."
the creature broke through the forcefield. i had no choice.
"i didn't come here to debate your decision. i came here to inform you of the consequences. when you first came to voyager, i decided to grant you the same liberties and freedoms of any crew member, because i wanted you to be a part of this family. and i've been willing to accommodate your unique way of doing things, even when you rubbed somebody the wrong way or violated protocol. but this time, i can't accommodate you. from this point forward, you will no longer have access to any primary systems on this ship. not without my direct authorisation. if you attempt to circumvent me, i'll throw you in the brig. i still need your expertise in the astrometrics lab if you're willing. if not, you can spend your time here in the cargo bay. is that understood?"
yes.
it is puzzling.
what's that?
"you made me into an individual. you encouraged me to stop thinking like a member of the collective, to cultivate my independence and my humanity. but when i try to assert that independence i am punished."
"individuality has its limits, especially on a starship where there's a command structure."
"i believe that you are punishing me because i do not think the way you do. because i am not becoming more like you. you claim to respect my individuality, but in fact you are frightened by it."
as you were.
direct hit.
"the target buoy is solid monotanium, ten metres thick, shielded by a chromoelectric forcefield."
impressive.
i'm glad you agree. it's not wise to travel this region without adequate defences. i've seen scuttled ships with more firepower than voyager.
i'm sure you have.
imagine what you'll be capable of once the isokinetic cannon is integrated into your defensive systems. one projectile can penetrate the shields of any heavily armoured vessel. hostile species will know to avoid voyager by reputation alone.
"you've made your point, mister kovin. i want the cannon, and i'm prepared to give you astrometrics charts spanning twelve sectors. you'll find them unusually precise."
"even the most sophisticated charts become obsolete. one random anomaly and they're no longer accurate. however, i could be persuaded if you were to include the mapping technology that created them."
sorry. our astrometrics sensors were designed specifically for this ship. they'd be of no use to you. what i can offer you is a generous supply of isolinear processing chips. we'll even show you how to integrate them into your existing sensor technology.
how generous a supply?
one hundred chips.
one hundred and fifty.
one fifteen.
one twenty five.
done. escort our guest to engineering. you'll be supervising the installation of the cannon?
of course. for a modest fee.
"five additional chips, no more."
"it's good to see the art of negotiation isn't lost on you, captain."
that guy is worse than a ferengi
assign seven of nine to work on this. she's got a knack for adapting alien technology.
should i give her complete access to the engineering control systems?
i'm ready to give her some latitude. she's been behaving herself lately.
what are you working on?
i'm trying to decode the message starfleet command sent us several weeks ago.
any progress?
none. i'm working on a new decryption algorithm.
i'd like you to set it aside for a while. i have another assignment for you.
what is it?
the captain wants you to help kovin integrate the new weapon system.
i'd rather not. i find him inefficient.
"maybe so, but you seem to work well with him. you've been asking for more responsibilities, i thought you'd be pleased."
the captain gives me greater liberty only when she needs my expertise.
"you violated her trust, and if you want it back, you're going to have to earn it. one step at a time."
i will report to engineering.
you'll need to install isolinear buffer circuits here and here.
the main power relay should be protected by a containment field.
unnecessary. all the buffer circuits would have to fail simultaneously for there to be any danger.
we prefer to play it safe. i'll check the inventory logs to see if we have a field generator available.
what are you doing?
i'm reconfiguring the tactical control systems.
the isokinetic circuit requires a specialised protocol. let me take care of it.
that won't be necessary.
"no, no! the subroutines need to be arranged in cascading sequence. let me show you."
"seven, stop."
there's a hairline fracture of the premaxilla bone.
"do you see this, captain? she shattered it."
it's easily repaired.
do you have any idea why seven attacked you?
it was unprovoked. she came at me like an animal!
"oh, i wouldn't put it like that. i was at another console about ten metres away. i heard kovin raise his voice and when i looked around i saw that he was holding her arm."
"i barely touched her. a gentle gesture to move her out of my way so i could get to the console, then she turned on me, attacked me."
what did you say to her?
i told her how to reconfigure the tactical control systems properly.
is that all?
that's all!
and that's when she knocked him down. ashmore and i had to hold her back.
she would have killed me. that woman is dangerous.
it's a miracle you survived. now hold still or this won't heal properly.
why are you questioning me on this? you should be disciplining your crew member.
"believe me, i'll deal with it. please accept my sincere apology. now, if you'll excuse me."
good as new.
come in.
"here we are again. oh, i'm tired of having this conversation. you know what i'm going to say. i know how you're going to respond, so it seems pointless to say anything."
shall i consider my privileges restricted and confine myself to the cargo bay?
"i think we've established that traditional disciplinary actions don't work with you. the question is, what will?"
are you asking for my opinion?
"i suppose i am. because frankly i'm running out of options. throwing you in the brig isn't going to solve anything, neither is slapping you on the wrist. and it's not as though i don't understand your feelings about kovin. there have been a few times when i'd have liked to pop him on the nose myself. but you have to start learning the difference between having an impulse and acting on it. does that make any sense to you?"
i believe so. i will give it more thought.
"well, that's a start."
"i hear there was some excitement this morning. when i started helping you improve your social skills, i'm fairly certain i didn't include a boxing lesson. you weren't hurt, were you?"
no.
still a bit tense?
perhaps.
"i understand the burden you carry. constantly being obligated to deal with those who fall short of excellence. i often find my own patience being tested by someone like mister kovin. of course i generally respond with a devastating quip rather than a left hook. we must both accept the fact that very few lifeforms will ever meet our high standards. so, when you get irritated, just try to be tolerant, and remember, they can't help being what they are. hmm. i'm reading some increased engrammatic activity, and your adrenalin levels are slightly elevated."
what does that indicate?
"it's consistent with a state of heightened tension. lie down and i'll run some scans. in a typical human, i would consider this a mood swing. but with your unique physiology, i'd like to rule out the possibility of a chemical imbalance."
"have you been experiencing any other symptoms? headaches, disorientation?"
no.
physiological scans seem normal. i'm going to check your borg implants now.
seven? what's wrong?
let me out.
i will. stay calm.
no more procedures.
all right.
stay away. you mustn't do this.
"do what? seven, what are you so afraid of?"
i don't know.
"she experienced an episode of acute anxiety with all the trimmings. intense apprehension, shortness of breath, dizziness. i finally managed to sedate her."
could this have been caused by her cortical implants?
"i don't think so. i think the problem has to do with memory suppression. i've detected a high concentration of biogenic amines in seven's hippocampus, a substance i haven't noticed before. it's blocking portions of her memory centre."
do you know where it came from?
"no, but it seems to be dissipating."
seven's unusual behaviour may be the result of the blocked memories beginning to surface. memories which she can't identify yet.
can you treat her?
treatment would involve integrating the repressed memories into seven's consciousness. i may be able to use a standard therapeutic regression technique.
i wasn't aware that you were programmed for psychotherapeutic capabilities.
"i wasn't. but in the absence of a ship's counsellor, i've been developing a psychiatric subroutine to add to my programme. i'll be even more valuable to you than i am now."
"keep me informed, doctor."
"a jungian therapist would attempt to retrieve unconscious memories by exploring synchronicities in recent events. on the other hand, amanin of betazed would argue that a combination of sensory isolation and focused breathing techniques would be more effective. i've integrated the finer points of both to create my own approach to memory reconstruction."
what does this approach involve?
"first, putting you at ease by performing the treatment here, in your own environment. once the cortical probes have reinforced the neural pathways, i'll use a directed imagery technique to guide you through the regression."
you may proceed.
"please, close your eyes. clear your mind. try not to think or to analyse."
my mind is now clear.
"seven, this isn't an exercise in efficiency. close your eyes, breathe deeply. now concentrate on the sound of my voice. let go of the present, leave the cargo bay behind. allow yourself to drift. describe the first image that enters your mind."
a medical tricorder. duritanium casing. seven point six centimetres by nine point eight centimetres by three point two centimetres. alphanumeric display.
"that's enough. so, you're in sickbay. how does the tricorder make you feel?"
it disturbs me.
why does it disturb you?
i'm afraid it will hurt me.
is there anything else there that causes you to anticipate pain?
the diagnostic bed. it's closing around me.
"you feel restrained, confined?"
about what?
it's kovin.
what is he doing?
he's restraining me. i want to get away from him but i can't. kovin's using some kind of instrument on me.
seven?
i didn't recall this before.
recall what?
kovin. he performed a surgical procedure on me. he extracted borg technology from my body. he violated me.
"we're making progress. now tell me, this surgical procedure, when did it happen?"
i don't know. the details are vague. there are only images.
and you're sure it was kovin? did you see kovin?
yes.
"you said he was restraining you, using an instrument of some sort."
he was.
were you on voyager when this happened?
no. it must have been when we were testing the weapons on the surface.
"then concentrate on that away mission. focus on the first image that enters your mind. describe it for me,"
"a large granitic stone, approximately one half metre high."
"now, allow that memory to develop beyond the image. integrate it into your consciousness. let the memory take shape."
i'm at the weapons range. kovin had taken us there to evaluate various hand held firearms he wished to offer in trade.
he attempted to impress us with a demonstration of the weapons' destructive capabilities. my role was to provide a more objective analysis.
"terawatt powered particle beam rifle, four microsecond recharge cycle, ten kilometre range."
definitely not standard starfleet issue. what do you think?
"seventy two percent fragmentation, twenty eight percent vaporisation. crude, but efficient."
"it's not as accurate as our compression rifles, but it's a lot easier to handle. i wouldn't mind carrying one of these the next time we run into the hirogen."
targeting mechanism could be augmented with a thermal guidance sensor. that would improve accuracy by twenty four percent.
i can do that now. care to join me? you can make sure the adjustments perform to your specifications.
"if you don't mind, i'd like to test some of the other firearms."
go right ahead. this way.
kovin took me to a small laboratory.
describe it.
"it was poorly illuminated. i saw various instruments, technology unfamiliar to me. i assumed this was where he developed new weapon designs."
this weapon is thoron based.
most of these hand-held disrupters are.
thoron can be unstable in weapons.
not if you polarise the emitter matrix. that compensates for any instabilities. watch.
what are you doing?
he turned the weapon on me.
he fired?
"yes, i remember it now."
what happened next?
i'm not sure.
concentrate. see the laboratory in your mind.
there was a light in my eyes.
was kovin still in the room with you?
yes.
"restrain her, quickly."
and another entharan was assisting him.
this is borg technology.
that's what i've been telling you.
let me go.
they bound me to an examination table.
what did they do to you? did they scan you?
the bio-ablation pump is engaged and pressurised.
the growth medium is activating the implants. the nanoprobes are multiplying.
they put a device near my head.
they removed my ocular implant.
then some of the implants in my arm were activated.
which ones? can you be more specific?
use the maximum setting of the metagenic pulse to stimulate the implants.
the assimilation tubules are ready.
prepare to harvest the nanoprobes.
"they extracted nanoprobes through my assimilation tubules. i was powerless, unable to stop them."
you couldn't be expected to. you were restrained. then what happened?
"they took the nanoprobes to another subject, also restrained. then they, they assimilated him."
well done.
"the next thing i remember i was back in kovin's lab. he claimed the particle beam rifle overloaded, that it had burned my hand. but it was a lie. they had attacked me."
i'm sorry. i should have been more careful.
do you have a dermal regenerator?
of course.
i'll inform the captain.
there's no doubt that seven was the victim of a brutal assault.
how is she?
as well as can be expected. she's regenerating in her alcove. i predict her emotional recovery will take some time. i certainly hope you intend to hold kovin responsible for what he's done.
"first i want to know how much of her story we can corroborate. tom, you were with her on the planet. how long was she alone with kovin?"
at least two hours.
"and when she came back, did she say anything about what happened?"
only that they'd finished their work on the rifle. she seemed fine.
clearly mister kovin used some artificial means to suppress her memory of the event. that would explain the unusual engrammatic activity i found in her neurological scans.
did you find any other physical evidence of the medical procedures she described?
no. i suspect mister kovin used seven's own nanoprobes to repair any cellular damage. she distinctly remembers kovin extracting them.
you seem to be accepting seven's recovered memories as fact.
are you suggesting otherwise?
"historically, recovered memories have often proven unreliable."
"yes, in cases where a traumatic experience has been repressed for years. but we're dealing with a very recent memory here, that was blocked by artificial means. when i removed that mechanism, seven remembered everything that happened."
human memory is rarely perfect.
"what are you saying, tuvok? that seven is making this up?"
"no, but we must remember that she's experienced hallucinatory images before."
"that was in direct response to a signal from the ship where she was assimilated. she's not having hallucinations now. she's remembering what happened to her. i've confirmed this by analysing the specific engrammatic activity in her hippocampus. we're not talking about conjecture, we're talking about science."
"let's not get bogged down. seven's made serious accusations and i won't dismiss them. if kovin assaulted her, took a sample of her borg technology, we can't stand by and do nothing. in the wrong hands a single nanoprobe could lead to disaster. doctor, i want you to keep searching for any physical evidence to back up seven's claim. i will talk to kovin. dismissed."
this is offensive and absurd. she's obviously lying.
why would she do that?
"maybe you can answer that. she's your crewmember. first she attacks me, then she invents these ridiculous stories, and you try to place the blame on me. is this some kind of negotiating tactic?"
i have no hidden agenda. i'm simply trying to clarify what happened.
i told you already. we went to my laboratory to adjust the guidance system on the particle beam rifle.
and that took two hours?
she insisted absolute precision.
we've confirmed that seven was exposed to an intense thoron discharge.
"she was, after the rifle's power cell overloaded. we reported the accident immediately."
she now remembers that you fired the weapon at her deliberately.
that's preposterous.
the doctor now tells me the blast could have been enough to render her unconscious.
"but it didn't. we were both startled for a moment. and after i apologised for the accident, she asked if i had a dermal regenerator, which i did, and i used on her arm. the one with the mechanical implants."
which you recognised as borg.
i was aware she'd been a borg. she told me herself.
"did you ever express curiosity in that technology, or try to examine it more closely?"
no.
you never considered the potential value it might have as a weapon?
is that what you think i've done?
"you may not realise how dangerous borg technology can be. if you've taken even a single nanoprobe, i need to know about it right now."
i haven't taken anything.
i'd like to examine your laboratory to be absolutely sure.
no. this has already gone too far.
then i'll have to contact the authorities. maybe they'll be more helpful.
are you willing to risk our trade agreement all on the basis of one crew member's delusions?
"yes. now, are you going to cooperate with our investigation?"
i don't seem to have much choice.
you stated that the rifle's power cell overloaded as a result of a faulty oscillator adjustment.
that's right.
can you describe in more detail how that occurred?
i was showing her how to polarise the emitter matrix. i must have tuned the induction frequency too high.
were you unfamiliar with that procedure?
no. i have done it a hundred times. it was a careless mistake. how many times do i need to apologise?
i am not seeking a statement of remorse.
"then what do you want? are you trying to catch me in a lie? trick me into confessing? you can't, because there's nothing for me to confess! i haven't done anything wrong."
one of our crew members claims that you have.
"your crewmember, seven of nine, she's very fortunate."
how so?
she has an entire crew leaping to her defence. i have no one.
the entharan representative will be here shortly.
you mean the magistrate? he won't help me. he's more interested in protecting diplomatic relations with people like you.
surely he'll want to know the truth. that's all we're seeking.
"you don't understand. on my world, we depend on trade with alien species. there are strict protocols about those relationships. even being accused of violating them is a serious offence."
you will have the opportunity to refute any charges.
"it won't matter. once they're made, the damage is done. i won't be trusted any longer. i'll be ruined. please, i never hurt your crew member. don't do this."
i'm afraid i have no choice. but i assure you our investigation will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.
"you strike me as a man of your word. if you tell me i won't be prejudged, then i believe you."
how are you feeling?
i am undamaged.
"but how do you feel? seven, your physical scars have healed, but the psychological effects are still there. you'll have to deal with them."
for what purpose?
"in order to heal. kovin attacked you, violated your rights as an individual. it's important that you recognise that, so you can understand any hostility or resentment you might be feeling."
"resentment is a human trait. it has no structure, no function. i want no part of it."
"you're going to have to begin accepting the fact that your human feelings exist, and that suppressing them can damage you."
"if i am not aware of these feelings, how can i express them?"
let me ask you this. what would have happened if kovin had tried to take borg technology directly from the collective?
he would have been assimilated.
precisely. which is why he chose you. he could get what he wanted without running any risks.
it was my individuality which made me vulnerable.
"exactly. he violated that individuality. what he did is an affront to everything you are, borg and human."
it was the act of a coward.
yes! someone who was willing to use you in the cruellest way so that he could create new weapons and sell them.
i believe i'm beginning to experience anger. anger toward kovin.
"good. that's a perfectly healthy, normal response. and when kovin gets what he deserves, you're going to feel much better."
"right this way, magistrate. my laboratory."
there are no examination tables.
"i told you, just work benches."
is this the entire facility?
yes.
"we should scan for signs that the room may have been altered recently. during her regression, seven described instruments similar to these."
of course she did. she was here.
she said a device like this was used to remove her optic implant.
that's a micro-calliper. i used it to remove the casing over the guidance system on the particle beam rifle.
and isn't this an electro-dynamic probe?
yes.
hmm. it's equipped with a monofilament stimulator. could it be used to manipulate the neurotransmitter levels in a human brain?
not as it is.
but with the proper modifications?
with the proper modifications i could reconfigure your comm. badge to manipulate neurotransmitters. what's your point?
"i believe you've just made it. there is cellular residue on many of these instruments. it matches seven's genome. with your permission, sir, i'd like to take these tools back to voyager where i can run more conclusive scans."
take whatever you need.
"doctor, there are a number of borg nanoprobes on the surface of this table."
i'll just collect a sample. hmm.
that's where her arm was hit when the rifle overloaded.
the dispersal pattern is consistent with a dermal rupture.
"these nanoprobes were recently regenerated. if this were nothing more than cellular residue from seven's injury, the nanoprobes would be dormant. but these have been activated in a very specific pattern."
"i've seen enough. kovin, there is sufficient evidence here to detain you pending official proceedings."
no. please. no.
stay where you are.
"kovin, don't!"
"i trusted you. you said it would be an impartial investigation. but you're all determined to find what you want to find. well, i'm not going to let this happen."
tuvok to voyager.
janeway here.
mister kovin has transported out of the laboratory.
can you track his present position?
stand by.
"i'm picking up a transporter signature, three hundred kilometres above the surface."
"captain, there's a ship powering it's engines at those coordinates."
"magistrate, do you want us to follow him?"
"yes, but i'd like to join you."
very well. we'll beam you to voyager. stand by.
kovin's ship is on a heading of one eight mark two five.
set an intercept course. get ready to lock on a tractor beam.
he's only at half impulse. his ship may not have warp engines.
we're at nine thousand kilometres and closing.
i'm engaging the tractor beam.
i can't find him. all of my sensor readings have disappeared.
he generated a photonic pulse. it took them offline. we'll have to reinitialise the entire sensor array.
do it. our investigation has suddenly turned into a manhunt.
"the fact that he's running shows that he's got something to hide. until we find out what that is, we can't risk letting him go."
"this isn't getting us anywhere. seven's cellular residue is on everyone of these, but that would be true if she simply handled them."
"my examination of the rifle is equally inconclusive. it may have overloaded accidentally, or not."
"i'm getting a bad feeling about this, tuvok. we aren't finding anything that implicates kovin."
i told him our investigation would be impartial. i believe it has been.
"it has, but i'll admit i had some preconceptions about him. they may have influenced my judgment. the strongest evidence so far is the batch of nanoprobes the doctor found. the fact that they were regenerated suggests that kovin was experimenting with them."
we don't know a great deal about the interaction between nanoprobes and borg physiology. it might be worthwhile to simulate the effect of the rifle blast on seven's arm and see what happens to the nanoprobes.
good. maybe that'll give us some answers.
"is this really necessary, captain? she's suffered enough trauma already."
we don't want to make accusations against an innocent man. we have to do everything we can to find some concrete evidence.
he's not an innocent man. i know what he did to me.
"but we must have proof, and this experiment may provide us with it. we've configured this hypospray to simulate the energy of a thoron blast. we'll collect thin layers of your skin tissue and examine the effects. it won't be painful."
i'm not afraid. i am angry.
i know. try to be patient. we may have some answers soon.
"all right, let's see what we've got."
i think you'd better take a look.
what do you see?
the nanoprobes are regenerating in exactly the same pattern we saw in kovin's laboratory. it appears to be a spontaneous response which could have been caused by the energy released from the thoron weapon.
it doesn't matter. kovin is guilty.
"seven, there's no doubt in my mind that you believe what you're saying. but is it possible, just possible, that the memories you and the doctor recovered aren't accurate?"
how could that be?
"during your time with the borg, you were subjected to invasive medical procedures. you undoubtedly witnessed other victims being assimilated. could that be what you're remembering?"
you know that's not right. tell them.
"everything led me to believe that you were a victim. your extreme response to kovin in engineering, your irrational fear when i was examining you. something prompted that behaviour, and i believed it was a repressed memory of your ordeal with kovin."
that is what it was.
"but if i'm to be impartial, i have to acknowledge that your neurology is still something of a mystery to me. i can't be certain what triggered those memories, and we can't ignore the fact that this evidence supports kovin's story, and not yours."
you were the one who helped me to understand what happened and now you're denying it.
"seven, no one's abandoning you, but we have to do what's right. we have to find kovin and tell him what we've learned."
the doctor told me i would feel better when kovin gets what he deserves. i want him to be punished. i won't settle for anything less.
mister paris?
he's in range.
visual. hail him.
no response. he's charging weapons.
"open a channel, all frequencies. mister kovin, this is captain janeway. we believe we've made a mistake in accusing you. we only want to correct the situation. stand down your weapons."
he's responding.
stop your pursuit. i can damage your ship.
we're not here to take you by force.
then let me go.
"kovin, listen to me. the proceedings must be resolved."
this is a trap.
no. we've discovered information that supports your story.
i don't believe you.
we've re-examined the evidence. finding the nanoprobes led us to the wrong conclusion. we know now that your thoron rifle did overload. please.
he's firing a spread of photon pulses.
shields down to eighty two percent.
back off. give him some breathing room.
"he's coming about, heading right for us."
direct hit to the power grid.
"innocent or not, he's going to destroy your vessel."
captain?
"he's come under enough fire from us already. harry, try to beam him off his ship."
he's thrown up a scattering field. i can't get a lock.
keep trying.
shields are down.
he's shunting all power to his photonic emitters.
we must protect ourselves. disable his ship.
"no! evasive manoeuvres. hard to port, full thrusters"
aye.
i've almost got a lock on him. a few more seconds.
"he's charging weapons again. captain, his emitters are overloading. all his systems are destabilising."
"open a channel. kovin, shut down your scattering field. let us beam you aboard. kovin!"
he's firing.
harry?
"i can't find anything to lock onto, captain."
there's nothing more we could have done.
"stand down red alert. mister paris, set a course back to the entharan colony."
doctor.
yes.
i'm here for my weekly maintenance.
"oh, of course. this way, please."
"metabolic rate is stable. electro-optic implant is aligned. your blood pressure is slightly off, but within tolerance. you're in perfect health. see you next week."
i do not feel perfect.
what do you mean?
i am preoccupied by kovin's death.
join the club. it's all i can think about.
"as a borg, i was responsible for the destruction of countless millions and i felt nothing. but now, i regret the destruction of this single being."
"it's called remorse, seven. it comes into play when you make a mistake, and you feel guilt about what you've done. another new emotion for you to experience."
i do not enjoy this remorse any more than i enjoyed anger. will the feeling subside?
yes. but not quickly.
i would rather not have to wait.
i'm afraid you don't have much choice.
but maybe i do.
i've isolated the algorithms responsible for my desire to expand beyond my original programming. i want to delete them.
why?
"it was my urge to experiment, my infatuation with improving myself, that led to this tragedy. i fancied myself a psychologist, a ship's counsellor. but i wasn't prepared for the complexities that come with such a responsibility. in my enthusiasm to help seven of nine, i lost my medical objectivity. i became a self-righteous advocate. i didn't stop to think for one second that i might be wrong. that mustn't happen again."
you want to go back to the state you were in when we first activated you?
"i'll still be capable of treating any and all medical conditions, but without the risk of overstepping my bounds. it's for the best, captain."
"oh, i'm not so sure. this crew has benefited greatly from your improvements over the years. request denied."
captain.
"i won't turn back the clock because of one mistake, no matter how serious. and no matter how you might feel."
"i'm a physician. i'm supposed to preserve life, not destroy it. i can't live with the thought that i might do it again."
"with any luck, that knowledge will prevent it from happening again. we all rallied around seven, doctor, myself included. i wanted her to know she was part of this family, that we would support her, fight for her, no matter what. we let our good intentions blind us. we all bear responsibility for kovin's death, and we all have to live with it. but to delete that burden would be the last thing any of us should do."
p'tahk! prepare to meet your ancestors!
"this battle is yours today, but the house of mo'kai will never yield."
"doh-cha scree! move away, coward. i want to make this kill."
you should have killed me when my back was turned.
i want to see the fear in your eyes.
look closely and you'll see your own destruction.
you are resilient prey.
i'm no one's prey.
"you are mine, now and after death. sickbay, this is holodeck two. janeway requires medical assistance."
she'll survive.
what about her neural interface?
stable.
are you sure? there were times when she seemed aware of who she is.
impossible. i was monitoring the crew during the entire simulation. she believes she's whoever we programme her to be. shall i return her to the klingon simulation?
no. bring her to holodeck one. i've found another programme i want to try. a conflict that took place on her own planet. it should prove stimulating.
"wrong, would it be wrong to kiss? seeing i feel like this, would it be wrong to try? wrong, would it be wrong to stay, here in your arms this way, under this starry sky? if it is wrong"
"welcome to le coeur de lion. i'm katrine. the first round is with my compliments, on one condition. you leave the war outside. more escargot for table nine. jacques, no lady tonight? oh, we'll have to see what we can do about that."
"forgive my neglecting you. now, where were we? ah, yes, my latest adventure in paris."
i'm afraid i'll have to neglect you again. excuse me.
that's him.
our new kommandant?
british intelligence believes he's been sent here to oversee the occupation of the city.
what's his history?
"he served with rommel in north africa and schmidt in poland. he is a formidable military strategist, notorious for his cruelty."
ah. let's make him feel at home. send him a bottle of chateau latour. my compliments.
the '29?
i hate to waste good wine. give him the '36.
as you wish.
and i have waited so long. it must be right. it can't be wrong.
"merci. be generous to claude this evening. without him, my voice is empty. good evening."
sing.
tonight's performance is over. return tomorrow.
now.
remove your hand.
"obey me, or i will hunt you down and your bones will adorn the bulkhead of my ship."
"sit down and play the game. in this setting, we have no ships. we are an ancient race of soldiers intent upon conquering this world. play the game."
"now, now, what's this? mademoiselle leneuf will be happy to sing another song. just give her a few minutes to freshen up."
it's late.
freshen up.
very well.
kommandant karr.
you know me.
"your reputation precedes you. i'm katrine. le coeur de lion is my establishment. the first round is with my compliments, on one condition. you leave the war outside."
i wish to speak with her. alone.
charming gentleman.
he is disoriented. your world is unfamiliar to him.
he'll be comfortable soon enough. the arms of france are open to all.
i've heard otherwise.
what do you mean?
i understand there is opposition to our presence here among your citizens.
"the resistance? in paris perhaps. but this is a small city, defenceless. we've learned to be a little more diplomatic. when this war is over we want to remain on good terms with the victor."
whoever that may be.
whoever that may be.
"your city may be defenceless, but it's crucial to the war. any ground assault into germany must pass through this province. the resistance will come here."
"if they do, i'll tell them what i tell everyone. leave the war outside."
excellent.
"kommandant, i've been informed there's a problem in the engineering section. the warp plasma network has become unstable."
what's he talking about?
it need not concern you. to the hunt.
the hunt?
for the resistance. i shall take great pleasure in tracking them down and making the kill.
au revoir.
how'd we do?
insufficient for a saturday night. twelve hundred forty seven francs and eighty one reichmarks.
"well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the range of our radio. first thing tomorrow morning i want you to take a little trip to the countryside. there's a monsieur groleau who has a cottage just past the third bridge. he's got a wine cellar full of vacuum tubes. tell him we need a high frequency oscillator. offer him three hundred francs but don't go any higher than five hundred."
we have more pressing needs.
such as?
explosives. we need a launcher that can fire armour piercing grenades.
planning on blowing up a german tank?
if necessary.
we're not trying to build an army here.
"thenmaybe it's time we did. three more german battalions have occupied the city and a panzer division is holding position eleven kilometres away. when the americans arrive and the fighting begins, i don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing moonlight becomes you."
the americans won't even be able to approach this city without our help. and if they can't liberate sainte claire the assault into germany could fail. we need to be gathering information about german troop movements and relaying it to allied command.
i'm tired of lighting the nazi's cigarettes and laughing at their jokes. we should be helping the allies by assassinating these pigs.
"the moment we start shooting we expose ourselves. right now, no one suspects us. and i am not about to risk our entire operation because you've suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger."
"that is your opinion, madame."
"i'm the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion is the only one that counts, so get the oscillator. i think we're all feeling the strain. it's been a hard four years. but believe me, the third reich is feeling it too. we just have to hang on a little while longer. word from the americans is going to come any day."
perhaps.
again?
again. why is she so adamant? what she's proposing would put us all at risk.
maybe that's her intention.
"if you have suspicions, my old friend, let's hear them."
"from the beginning, she's been argumentative, and on more than a few occasions she's disobeyed your direct orders."
she's headstrong. typical of the underground.
"nevertheless, her behaviour has threatened our identities."
"she's the only munitions expert we have, and she can carry a tune. we need her. let's keep our eye on her. have her followed for the next few days. if she is a nazi infiltrator, we'll have to eliminate her."
"bonjour, madame."
bonjour.
put it on my account. guten tag.
you! halt!
get off your vehicle. what are you transporting?
nothing but the very essentials of life.
proceed to your destination.
that i will. that i most certainly will.
"if the choice were mine, you would already be dead."

you're late. what happened?
"oh, just a t�te-à-t�te with a member of the master race."
that's the second time this week. sounds like they're increasing their patrols.
perhaps it's time we chose another courier. our baker is arousing suspicion.
"there's no need to worry. i change my route every day, and i've become quite friendly with most of the gestapo. they just love my strudel."

got it. let's see the code key.
"every fifth letter, every third vowel. use the sunday decryption sequence. a, h, c. straight from allied high command."
it must be important.

maybe i can help.
how?
i'm upset. i need to see my special friend. even if it means bothering him at the office.
a reconnaissance mission.
"i'll try to locate the radio, see where the guards are posted, examine the locks. gather enough information to get us inside."
"it's too dangerous. if you're caught, you'll be tortured for information."

"ever since my days at the university i've admired this painting, and now it's mine. our fellow officers might prefer gold or land, but for me the greatest prize of war is art."
trophies of the hunt. but was the hunt fair?
sir?
we entered this city with superior firepower against a weakened prey. do you really deserve these prizes?
we are german. the german people deserve europe and everything in it.
why?
"sir, you question our destiny?"
"of course not. but i want to hear it in your own words. tell me, why are we the master race?"
our blood is pure. our people lived and hunted on this land for a thousand years before the degenerate races brought their corruption. europe must be purified.
"you yourself, are you stronger than these degenerate races? more cunning?"
"yes, of course."
"and if you were alone without an army supporting you, would you continue the hunt? if your prey were armed instead of defenceless, what then?"
"i, colonel, i, i don't know what you're trying"
"you are superior to no one! never underestimate your prey or disrespect its abilities. if you do, you will become the hunted. when the opposing army invades this city, remember my words."
enter.

"i'm sorry, i know i'm not supposed to come here. don't blame him. i told him that i was ill and i had to see you."
i will leave you two alone.
heil hitler!
"it's all right, the colonel is in a strange mood today."
what's wrong? is it our child?
i don't know. i was dizzy.
i'll call the doctor.
no. i feel better now. maybe i just needed to see you. why haven't you shown me this place before?
"i didn't want your neighbours to see you coming here. they make it difficult enough, knowing we're together."
i don't care what they think. it's beautiful.
"praxiteles, master sculptor of ancient greece. there are only three like this in all of europe."
so many wonderful things.
"the kommandant would have us continue this simulation until we rot. it's pointless. we should begin the hunt. he believes we must learn more about our prey, but i have learned enough. ready your weapon. avoid the cranium."
this way.
but the message.
there's no time!
"computer, exit holodeck. we'll take them to the medical bay."
this neural interface has been damaged.
that's because it took a direct hit when one of your bullets grazed the base of her skull.
i'll provide you with another. install it.
not until i've repaired her injuries.
how long?
she has two fractured vertebrae and a punctured lung. another hour at least.
him?
"i've stabilised his vital systems, but he still has bullet fragments lodged in his shoulder."
i will treat him.
this time you might do a better job repairing the muscle lacerations. the last crewmember you treated was brought back in with internal bleeding.
your crew is fragile. they fall too easily.
"what do you expect? they've been stabbed, shot, beaten, phasered and bat'lethed over the past three weeks. their bodies weren't designed for this kind of punishment."
what happened?
these prey were hunted by turanj. their injuries are severe.
"you assured me that your people would avoid causing serious head injuries. another centimetre and the bullet would have penetrated her brain. if you can't keep your people under control, then you should put an end to this blood sport."
the simulations will continue.
at least activate the holodeck safety protocols.
no.
it'll prevent life-threatening injuries for your people as well.
it will also eliminate the challenge.
i have had twenty eight wounded and one fatality in the past twelve hours. even i can't keep up with that level of triage.
"you will keep up or they will die. their lives are in your hands, doctor. don't fail them. when that one is ready, place him in holodeck two. let's see how he fares with the klingons."
what about her?
send her back to holodeck one. i like her voice.
progress?
"by cutting through the bulkheads on decks four, five and six we've been able to expand both holodeck grids by five thousand square metres."
more.
i can't give you any more. not without compromising voyager's primary systems.
then compromise them.
"look, holodecks require a tremendous amount of energy. i've already rerouted power from all nonessential systems. anything more, and we'll start losing propulsion, deflectors, even life support."
i'll transfer a supply of power nodules from my vessel. integrate them into your systems. i want to expand the holo-projectors into all surrounding sections. replicate enough emitters for the task.
"yes, sir."
"the holo-emitters in this corridor are stable. let's start working on section nineteen.  but first, tell the guard to escort you to engineering. that we need more equipment. specifically, a type three isolinear emitter. if he gives you any trouble, say i can't complete the assignment without it."
we need an isolinear emitter from engineering.
"ensign, how did i get here?"
"i transferred you here, using the new emitters in this section."
i assume you've got a plan?
half a plan.
let's hear it.
"before we can retake the ship, we've got to get the crew back. that means disabling the neural interfaces."
easier said than done. the great hunters are everywhere you turn.
"don't worry, i think i've found a way to tap into the sickbay diagnostic console. the only catch is"
standby with the emitter. i'm almost done here.
"the catch, ensign?"
somebody's got to be inside the holodeck to engage the bridge control relays.
we're short-handed.
i know.
"well, we've got a borg on board, don't we? maybe we can put her to good use."
"i've been studying voyager's database looking for our next simulation. there are many to choose from. these people have a violent history. i believe i've found a worthy prey. the borg. when world war two is over, we will recreate a notorious battle known as wolf 359."
i look forward to it.
"i thought you might. but if you continue to disobey me, this is one hunt you will never see. you nearly destroyed two of my favourite prey. you were careless."
"i've become impatient. we penetrated this vessel, overcame their defences, and in the moment of the kill, you forced us to stop. now we play these incessant games. it's time we took our trophies and moved on."
"your lust for the kill has blinded you, like many young hunters. if you took the time to study your prey, to understand its behaviour, you might learn something."
there is nothing to be learned.
you're wrong. each prey exposes us to another way of life and makes us re-evaluate our own. have you considered our future? what would become of us when we have hunted this territory to exhaustion?
"we will travel to another part of space, search for new prey, as we have always done."
a way of life that hasn't changed for a thousand years.
why should it?
"species that don't change, die. we've lost our way. we've allowed our predatory instincts to dominate us. we disperse ourselves throughout the quadrant, sending ships in all directions. we've become a solitary race, isolated. we've spread ourselves too thin. we're no longer a culture. we have no identity. in another thousand years, no one will remember the name hirogen. our people must come back together, combine forces, rebuild our civilisation."
what of the hunt?
"the hunt will always continue, but in a new way. i intend to transform this ship into a vast simulation, populated with a varied and endless supply of prey. in time, this technology can be duplicated for other hirogen. these holodecks will allow us to hold onto our past, while we face the future."
"even if i were persuaded, others wouldn't be."
then you are with me? i must continue my research. i'll see you tomorrow on holodeck one. the americans are due to invade.
remain calm and stay quiet. there's a hirogen working in the bio-lab. he might hear us. what's the last thing you remember?
an attack. hirogen vessels. they breached our hull and boarded the ship. i was in a phaser fight on deck three. i was struck several times. that's all i remember.
then you have no memory of the simulations in the holodeck?
none.
the neural interface must be circumventing your memory centres.
neural interface?
"it's a subdermal transmitter that links your neocortex to the holodeck. in essence, it makes you believe you're a character within the programme."
why am i in sickbay?
"you were wounded in a simulation. it's my job to patch you all up and send you back in. half the crew is under lock and key. the rest are fighting for their lives on the holodeck. this has been going on for nineteen days. dozens of battle scenarios, one more brutal than the last. you should see what a mess you were after the crusades."
will i be sent into another simulation?
"yes, but this time with an advantage. i have found a way to disable the interface by remodulating one of your borg implants to emit a jamming signal. once the hirogen have brought you back to the holodeck, the jamming signal will activate within seconds."
my objective?
"you mind a control panel inside the holodeck and engage the bridge access relays. that will enable ensign kim and me to deactivate all the neural interfaces. after captain janeway and the crew regain awareness, you can work with them to mount a resistance against the hirogen."
what simulation will i be entering?
world war two. a twentieth century earth conflict. do you know anything about it?
nothing.
"that could be a problem. once the interface is disabled, you won't remember anything about your role in the simulation. think of it as a new social setting. do your best to fit in."
"this is the last neural interface. when you've finished with her, you'll help me replicate more."
i have to sedate you now.
that old black magic has me in it's spell. that old black magic that you weave so well. those icy fingers up and down my spine. the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet
i must discontinue this activity. i am not well.
"if the entertainment is over, i'll be going."
"stay right there, kommandant. i'm sure she's fine. let me talk to her."
what's wrong?
i require a glass of water.
make it a quick one. i promised the kommandant you'd be singing till midnight. i want to get a lot of information out of him tonight.
i am ill.
"look, i don't care if you're dying. get back out there."
i won't.
maybe you're right about her.
"the evidence is increasing. she was present today when our courier was shot down in the street, yet somehow, she was unharmed. and now, on the eve of our liberation, she becomes uncooperative."
leave this to me.
captain?
at ease. what's the word?
there is no word. at least not from the resistance in sainte claire.
then we won't get any support from inside the city.
you may be underestimating the good citizens of sainte claire. i spent a summer there when i was eighteen.
"let me guess. you ate a few snails, fell in love with a local girl and became an expert on the city?"
"ah, well, yeah, pretty much like that."
i see.
"but believe me, captain, those people love their town. they'll fight for it and die for it. don't count them out yet."
"all right, but i won't count them in, either. we continue as planned. an assault from the north at first light. so, who was the mademoiselle?"
her name was brigitte. great gams. one hell of a temper.
sounds like your kind of girl.
"august 29, 1936, 12:17 p.m. that's when my train pulled out of sainte claire. that's the last time i saw her. we wrote to each other every week for three years. then the war broke out and i never heard from her again."
sainte claire's not a big place. she shouldn't be too hard to find.
i'm counting on it.
"you'll maintain position here, twenty metres from the front doors. arm yourself with a submachine gun and watch for any sign of trouble."
understood.
"now, we've observed a twenty second break in the guard rotation at four fifteen a.m. that should you and me enough time to enter the building through the storm window on the eastern wall."
when i was there yesterday i saw guards posted at all three stairways. you'll have to reach the second floor through the elevator shaft. the command post is in the main gallery at the end of the hall.
"once inside, we plant the charges, blow the transmitter. you'll remain here. if something goes wrong and we're caught, destroy all evidence of the underground. our contact list, decryption codes, everything."
right.
we leave in one hour.
this won't make much of a bang. you forgot to connect the detonator.
i will correct the error.
it's lucky i found your little error. it might have undermined our mission. are you having second thoughts about tonight?
no.
"good, because i don't want any more mistakes."
there won't be any.
let's hope not.
we've got to stop meeting like this.
"i managed to grab a quick scan of holodeck one, and it looks like seven of nine is on the move. are you ready in sickbay?"
my hirogen taskmaster is working in the bio-lab. i'll have access to the medical console for another twenty minutes at least.
that'll give me enough time to get to the bridge.
good afternoon.
what are you doing in here?
"trying to get the replicator system back online. unless you prefer the emergency rations? personally, i'm getting tired of synthetic protein. you're supposed to be the finest hunters in the quadrant, why don't you find us something a little more tasty? is something wrong?"
an unauthorised transmission was sent from this room.
what kind of transmission?
i don't know. maybe you can tell me.
"well, i was trying to re-route power from the main computer to the replicators. of course. i must have tripped a communications subroutine. sorry about that. didn't mean to worry you. your people have damaged just about every system on this vessel. accidents are bound to happen. now, if you don't mind, i'm due on the bridge."
show it to me.
what?
i want to see this subroutine. show me what you were doing when the accident occurred.
forget it. i don't have time.
do as i say.
"all right! but you'd better call the bridge. tell your superior i'm going to be late, that i'm working under your orders now, not his. go ahead, make the call. i don't want to take the blame for this."
report to the bridge.
thanks.
"set the charges here,here and there. this looks like a message from one of their reconnaissance teams."
these must be instructions for troop deployments. the germans must be taking up new positions outside the city. it looks like they're mobilising more troops than our sources originally expected.
they're moving armoured units into the valley. they must know the americans are coming. we've got to warn them somehow. what are you doing? you haven't set the charges. what is that?
i believe it is a transmitter. i'm attempting to disable it.
you're sending a message to the nazis.
no.
"step away, or i'll kill you."
what are you doing?
"er, nothing. just running a diagnostic."
you've accessed the neural interface controls. stop it immediately.
i told you no more mistakes. you've just made your last one.
ow! seven?
captain.
"listen. a targ, just beyond that ridge."
you would hunt down a simple beast even in the midst of our enemies?
there is no enemy as great as hunger.
why am i being interrupted?
"the holographic doctor, he's disabled their captain's interface."
how?
"i don't know, but i can't re-establish the link."
send a team
to holodeck one. remove her from the simulation.
hirogen hunters.
internal scans show thirteen of them on this holodeck.
"need a hand, buddy? captain miller, fifth armoured infantry."
welcome to sainte claire.
get me artillery unit charlie one. take up positions along this street and start laying down fire.
the americans have arrived.
you circumvented our control. how?
go to hell!
bobby.
you owe me a postcard.
"distance eight hundred yards. correct for crosswinds. fire at will. take cover, boys. charlie one isn't known for accuracy."
i can't access the ship's systems didn't you say this was nazi headquarters?
i did.
then it would stand to reason this building is being targeted. let's get out of here.
what happened?
there was a simulated explosion on holodeck one. somehow it blew out the hologrid across three decks.
is the programme still running?
yes.
what is it?
it looks like a bunker.
"all units, listen up. we've just blown the lid off of some kind of secret nazi compound. converge on my position. we're going in."
the breach opened the simulation into the surrounding sections. i'm picking up holographic soldiers moving into deck five.
shut down the holo-emitters until we can regain control.
i can't. the programme controls are offline. you wanted a war? looks like you've got one.
move out.
looks like the hirogen have been busy. this entire section has been equipped with holo-emitters. let's get to astrometrics.
"there are eighty five hirogen on board, concentrated on decks two through nine."
what about the bridge?
four hirogen and ensign kim.
at least he's alive. the neural interfaces. you said they're controlled through sickbay.
"yes. there's only one hirogen in sickbay with the doctor, but the corridors outside are heavily guarded."
"that's our first objective, disable the interfaces. but we'll need help."
we did have allies in the world war two simulation. the french resistance.
it's time we mount a resistance of our own.
"the battle was concentrated here, on holodeck one, but the fighting has spilled out onto decks five and six and it looks like a group of holographic americans is invading deck seven."
show me the breach in the hologrid.
i've lost the visual link. it was the last active circuit connecting the bridge to the holodecks. there's only one way to stop this. i need to go to engineering and initiate a power surge across the holo-emitter network. it'll blow out the entire system.
no. that would destroy both the holodecks.
"look, simulation or not, if this battle keeps going we could all be killed."
i want that technology preserved.
commander.
status.
"i was able to reach deck five but holographic forces are massing near the breach. if i'm to get into the holodeck, i'll need help."
take the hunters from the klingon simulation.
"when i find captain janeway, should i kill her?"
no. bring her to me.
this is no longer a game. this hunt is real. we should kill the prey.
"the voyager crew must remain alive to make repairs, or we could lose everything. this vessel, it's technology. you said that you understood the importance of what we're doing here."
i'll get the hunters.
we think it's a secret compound the nazi's built after they took over the city. what i don't understand is how they managed to camouflage it so well.
indeed. we've been scrutinising german troop movements since the occupation. we knew nothing of this installation.
"don't sweat it. our recon planes missed it too. any idea what they're hiding in there, captain?"
"we saw all sorts of scientific equipment. strange metals, instruments we can't identify. i've relayed the findings to military intelligence. they believe this could be an advanced munitions laboratory, designed to build some kind of super-weapon."
we've got to put it out of business.
"i've already sent three squads in, but the nazi's are putting up one hell of a fight. i've requested additional troops. lieutenant, this restaurant will serve as our command post. set up the transmitter and post guards around the perimeter."
"yes, sir."
"you've done a bang-up job, but we'll take it from here. tell your people to lie low, and that the americans said thanks."
this is our city. we have no intention of lying low.
"listen, honey, the time for sneaking messages back and forth is over. this is war, and you aren't soldiers."
he's right. we have weapons hidden throughout the city. brigitte will tell you where they are.
"sounds good. lieutenant, take care of it."
i can see you haven't changed.
"bring me one of those street maps. most of the guns, we stole from the german army, the explosives we bought on the black market."
we could use both.
"our biggest stockpile is buried here, two metres below the last row of seats of the cinéma mystère. you remember it, don't you?"
"hmm. i'm no angel, with mae west. there's heavy fighting in that area. what's the best way in?"
"we dug a tunnel that leads directly to the stockpile. here, i'll show you. incidentally, we saw death takes a holiday."
"it was the mae west movie, i'm sure of it. she was singing sister honky tonk, and i put my arm around you. and during the courtroom scene, i kissed you."
"you know, i think you're right."
i guess the experience wasn't exactly burned into your memory.
"not the movie, but i do remember the kiss."
"so, did you get my last letter?"
you mean the one asking me to leave france?
"germany was about to invade. i thought you'd be safer back in the states with me. but, i guess you found someone else to take care of you."
there's never been anybody else.
then who?
"he's second in command of the sainte claire occupation. the first time he saw me, he said i was pretty. i took advantage of his interest. he doesn't know i'm in the resistance. the child is his."
i'm sorry.
so am i.
hold your fire.
katrine. you survived.
are you surprised?
very. nazi headquarters was destroyed. we assumed you were killed in the explosion.
what is that? some kind of an escape tunnel?
that's precisely what it is.
you're the leader of the local resistance.
that's right.
"captain miller, fifth armoured infantry. this is lieutenant davis. i take it you've seen the german bunker we uncovered?"
i just came from there.
we suspect it's a munitions lab. can you confirm that?
"yes, a munitions lab."
then this is it. we're calling in an air strike. contact the raf.
"hold on, captain. there's an easier way to do this with the minimum of casualties."
let's hear it.
"i've located the generator that powers the entire complex. it's heavily guarded, but with your help i can get close enough to set off some explosives."
my orders are to blow the entire compound before the germans send in reinforcements.
"i saw technology in there you can't begin to imagine. warheads powerful enough to destroy this entire valley if they're accidentally detonated. call for an air strike, it may be the last call you make."
how can you get close enough?
"this tunnel. i've been watching this compound for several months, and i've got a man inside."
the place is crawling with krauts.
"yhat's why i need your help. if your men can clear these two corridors it'll give us access to this entryway. get me there, and i can take care of the rest."
"c company, what's there status?"
they're holding position about two hundred yards from here.
"get them on the horn. you'll lead us into the compound, but i'm coming with you."
i work better alone.
"this isn't a request, it's an order."
order? do i look like i'm wearing one of your uniforms? i go alone.
i thought you needed our help. i'll be right behind you.
"even if i manage to disrupt the neural interfaces, we've still got a war to fight. we're going to need something a lot more effective than these old firearms."
"i believe i can enhance these weapons using borg technology, but i'll have to access cargo bay two."
"if something goes wrong and i don't succeed, you'll be the only one left who knows what's really going on."
understood.
have our suspicions been confirmed?
suspicions?
is she a collaborator?
i think we can trust her.
are you certain? three hours ago you were prepared to put a bullet in her head.
she's on our side.
"in your absence, i may be forced to make that determination for myself."
i've already made it. you're not to harm her. is that understood?
german forces are advancing on our position.
"let's give them a warm welcome. mademoiselle, after you."
"punctured lung, arterial rupture, fracture of the thirteenth vertebra. he needs surgery."
first and second degree burns to the face and neck. treat him.
his injuries are minor. he can wait.
i said treat him.
"this man has massive internal injuries. if i don't operate now, he'll die."
"treat the burns, or i'll deactivate your programme."
what kind of physician are you? the first rule of triage states that the critical injuries take priority.
"you're rules, not mine."
"from now on, leave the wounded prey where they fall. tend only to our own."
i'm as dry as the crater at tarpahk. in the middle of the dry season. when it's dry!
no! i'm not done!
"share with your brothers. it's the eve of battle. i may be drunk, but i can still send your soul to the next world and leave your body here to rot. though from the stench of it, i'd say it's begun to already."
tom!
wrong guy. you speak english?
yeah. i speak english.
american?
i didn't see him coming. you saved my life.
why are you out of uniform? what company are you with?
"well, er, i'm a civilian."
in the middle of a battle zone in france? the hell you are.
"go one, i'm right behind you. look, i don't have time for twenty questions. you say you're an american? all right then. if betty grable came around that corner, what part of her would you be staring at? sorry. time's up."
her legs! i'd be staring at her legs.
bull's-eye. lucky for you.
"you're a gung-ho kind of gal, aren't ya?"
does that bother you?
"nope. just not used to it, that's all. the girls back home are a little different."
"i guess when it comes to my people's safety, this girl tends to get a little gung-ho."
"nothing to apologise for. i'm the same way with my men. there's not a day goes by when i don't think to myself, i'm going to get 'em back safely, even if i die trying."
i know the feeling. we're about to enter some caves that run under the town.
caves?
"we're going to meet our contact there. i should warn you. there are eccentric people who live in the caves, but don't be alarmed."
"good evening, gentlemen."
who are you? how did you get past our battle lines?
"we're friends, allies."
sent by what house?
the house of k'toh-maag.
k'toh-maag. i never heard of it.
i'm not surprised. it's a long way from here.
this battle doesn't concern you.
"maybe not. but we'd be honoured to fight alongside such great warriors. if you prefer, we'll take our weapons elsewhere."
"wait! i'll consider your request. but first, prove your fortitude. drink! sanroh t'patoh cha!"
i guess my french is a little rusty.
don't drink it. it's twice as strong as whisky. i'll be right back.
"prove your fortitude, warrior. drink!"
"captain. is, is it you?"
yes. we've got to disable the rest of those interfaces.
"the controls are routed through the surgical console in sickbay, but it will take time to disable all of them."
"we don't have time. i'll access the jefferies tube that runs under that deck plate, set a few charges and blow out the console."
charges? the hirogen have seized the armoury.
no problem. i've got all the ammo i need right here.
holographic explosives?
"with the safety protocols offline, they're as good as the real thing."
another of your warriors?
yes.
he's a frail looking thing.
"i'll contact you when i've disabled the rest of the interfaces. in the meantime, stay here."
with the klingons?
"believe me, it's peaceful compared to sainte claire. captain."
ha!
"please, don't do that."
they've got us outnumbered.
and outgunned. they're setting up a machine gun emplacement across the street.
where have you been?
obtaining supplies.
what is this?
german technology taken from their compound. i can use them to enhance our weapons.
i've cornered several voyager crewmen. they've taken refuge in a guarded building. i need three nucleonic charges to penetrate the structure.
nucleonic charges could damage the holodeck further. use your hand weapons.
then i'll need more hunters.
they're on the way.
"damn, there's a level nine forcefield around the surgical console. we'll have to go in and shut it down."
forcefield?
i'll explain later. set the detonator for five minutes.
five hunters have been killed in the last hour. you must engage the safety protocols.
those protocols aren't functioning.
then i'll need assistance to
stand by.
you.
get him out of here.
there are ten pounds of dynamite under the floor set to blow in less than three minutes. move.
"bridge to sickbay. sickbay, respond. bridge to deck five. converge on the sickbay."
we are on the holodeck under attack. you must
"bridge, this is holodeck one. i have seized the building, and i have found another access to this holodeck."
seal it. how many captives?
four. their neural interfaces have been disabled. i will make the kill.
no.
"they are not prey, they are hostages. i'll need them."
"as you wish. you, help me seal this hatch."
what do you think? a boy or a girl?
it's a holographic projection.
"unfortunately, it's a very good projection. i feel twenty kilos heavier. it even kicks."
i don't recognise this programme.
i do. he's wearing a nazi uniform. we're on earth during the second world war.
nazi?
totalitarian fanatics bent on world conquest. the borg of their day. no offence.
none taken.
what are you staring at?
get up. you deceived me.
really?
i should've seen through your flirtations.
if you say so.
the thought of you carrying my child disgusts me.
you're not the only one.
"look, i don't know what went on between the two of you, but it's obviously over now."
i see you're acquainted. do you find her as attractive as i once did? i'll miss our nights together.
pig!
put the weapon away. now.
"funny, he doesn't seem like your type."
"doctor, trouble."
now what?
the klingons are starting to wake up from their nap.
"all right, all right, hold on."
what are you doing?
i've established an interface with holodeck one. i want to monitor what's going on over there in case the crew needs my help.
qapla'!
uh-oh. what should we do?
"not having a cure for klingon hangovers, i couldn't tell you."
"the battle has begun. our plan is to penetrate the enemy's position, cut his forces in half."
and a very good plan it is. best of luck with it.
"you will lead us into battle, great warrior."
maybe i'll just watch from here. try to offer up some pointers as things develop.
sto'kar! lead the attack or die here by my hand.
"you heard him. don't argue with the man, run along! i'll reattach any severed limbs. just don't misplace them."
you! cover our flank!
qapla'!
qapla'.
tally-ho.
enter. leave her.
i see you've done some redecorating.
"your attempt to retake this vessel was inventive. from the day i seized voyager, you put up a dauntless fight. but your fight is over now. you're going to help me shut down these simulations and repair the holodecks."
no. we'll destroy this ship before we surrender it.
"don't threaten me, captain. i've faced far more intimidating prey than you. if this fight continues, i promise you i will hunt down and kill every member of your crew."
"well, by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there won't be much of a trophy left, will there?"
perhaps i should kill you and find someone who will cooperate.
good luck. you'll get the same response from all of them.
you don't realise what's at stake.
i know what's at stake. your sick little game.
this is not a game!
then what is it?
i'm trying to create a future for my people.
future?
i don't expect you to understand. you are prey.
you underestimate us.
"yes, perhaps i do."
i'm listening
"my people are hunting themselves into extinction. your holodeck technology might offer us an alternative, a new way of life. instead of scattering ourselves across the quadrant in pursuit of prey, we could simulate the hunt and give ourselves a chance to rebuild our civilisation."
and confine your killing to holograms?
"with the safety protocols offline, the pursuit is just as challenging."
"oh, i understand what you're trying to do, but then why have you been torturing us? why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation after another?"
"i've been studying your behaviour, as i do with all my prey. but your holodecks allowed me to go further, to explore your culture, your history. i must admit, i've learned a great deal."
how so?
"your people have faced extinction many times, but you've always managed to avoid it. you seem to recognise the need for change."
yes. you've got one of those moments running right now on the holodeck. we called it world war two.
one of your most difficult eras. and yet you survived.
it wasn't easy.
you are a resilient species. i admire your cunning.
"let's end this. i'll call a ceasefire and we can try to contain the damage. i want my ship back, but in return i will give you what you need to create the holodeck technology. it would be cunning for you to agree."
"synthetic, and undrinkable. i am tired of this simulation."
"mein herr, a word with you."
and these holograms are becoming annoying as well.
what are we waiting for? why don't we execute these prisoners?
orders from the kommandant.
if i may speak freely. the kommandant has been acting strangely the past few days. he's been questioning german superiority. perhaps we shouldn't follow his orders so blindly.
"you will do as he says, as long as i tell you to."
i don't know how much longer i can stand being trapped in here.
perhaps you would enjoy some entertainment. sing.
i will not.
sing or you will die.
then i'll die.
"seven, you are a valued member of this crew. the logical response would be to grant his request."
"logic is irrelevant. one day the borg will assimilate your species despite your arrogance. when that moment arrives, remember me."
bridge to holodeck one.
yes.
i've come to an agreement with captain janeway. call a ceasefire.
what?
captain?
"it's true, tuvok."
our first order of business is to call off the troops. i want you to find chakotay
and have him convince his soldiers to pull out of the city.
"aye, captain."
turanj
order our hunters to end the fighting.
this is madness. we're winning this battle.
our civilisation depends on this agreement.
"acknowledged. you heard him, release the captives. i'll tell the others. order all units to withdraw to these positions"
i have always thought highly of you.
have you?
"yes. but the kommandant is a fool. he doesn't understand. he's never embraced the fuhrer or his vision. one does not cooperate with decadent forms of life. one hunts them down and eliminates them. the kommandant speaks of civilisation. the ancient romans were civilised. the jews are civilised. but in all its moral decay, rome fell to the spears of our ancestors, as the jews are falling now. look at our destiny.  the field of red, the purity of german blood. the blazing white circle of the sun that sanctified that blood. no one can deny us, no power on earth or beyond. not the christian saviour, not the god of the jews. we are driven by the very force that gives life to the universe itself. we must countermand the kommandant's orders, stay and fight. we must be faithful to who we are."
"you two, follow me."
"all units, clear the valley. return to your previous positions. we're calling a ceasefire. repeat, cease fire. well, the word is out."
whether it will be acted upon is another question.
"oh, they'll follow orders. i'm their commanding officer, remember?"
keep it moving! keep it moving! get the lead out of your pants!
mid-twentieth century american slang.
"you got a problem with that, sister?"
"you're enjoying this simulation. i find that peculiar, given the circumstances."
"loosen up, baby doll, the war's almost over."
so much for the ceasefire.
fire! fire!
"i've been monitoring the other simulation, and the fighting's getting worse. the crew is taking heavy casualties."
how can we help?
i'll transfer my programme to holodeck one. you take the jefferies tube and meet me there.
there's only the two of us.
"nevertheless we have to try and. even half drunk, klingons are among the best warriors in the galaxy."
but they're already in the middle of a war with the house of whatever it is.
then you'll just have to convince them that there's a more important battle to be waged.
me?
you are their great warrior. lead them.
"pardon me, gentlemen. i wonder if i might have a word with you."
"they're klingons, not kittens."
you will listen!
these sensors indicate you've placed holo-emitters on decks five through twelve? no wonder the system breached. you've turned voyager into one big holodeck.
can you shut it down?
"yes, but i'm going to have to initiate an overload. we'll worry about making repairs later. right now we've got to put an end to those simulations. janeway to ensign kim."
"yes, captain."
"harry, i'm going to need your help overloading the holo-emitter network."
i'm transferring optical processor control to you now. start charging the secondary power relays.
we'll use them to trigger the overload.
i'm on it.
it's going to take some time. there are over eight hundred emitters that we have to
move away from the controls.
why haven't you ordered the ceasefire?
move away from the controls.
listen to me.
no!
what are you waiting for?
i am a hunter. you are my prey. run.
acknowledged. out. our holographic allies are losing ground. the german troops are surrounding the city.
i don't know how much longer we can hold them off. these weapons are pretty crude. they're not much help.
maybe we should fall back?
"where to? they're coming in from all sides. tuvok, any chance we can get through that breach in the hologrid."
unlikely. twenty more hirogen have taken up position near the opening. we are outnumbered.
how's it going?
i'm modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst. it will be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all holographic activity within twenty metres.
we'll try to buy you some time.
i'll be in sickbay.
schnell! schell!
they're closing in. seven!
surrender.
"verdamt. bring that one to me. i will spare your life for now, but only because you are carrying a german child."
please don't do this. i can be of use to you. i can help you repair the ship. don't kill me.
against the wall. your deaths will serve the glory of the reich. prepare to fire.
"fight on, warriors! this way!"
"qapla', gentlemen. qapla'!"
this hunt is over. tell your hunters to stand down. i'll use this if you force me to.
it's over. let's go.
what is this?
"an optronic datacore. you can use it to create holodeck technology on your own vessels. i made a promise with your leader before he died, that i would give this knowledge to the hirogen. take it."
his ideas were unconventional. i do not share them.
"was he any more unconventional than you are? calling a ceasefire with your prey? only a few days ago, the thought of speaking with us on equal terms would've been inconceivable, but here we are. accept this trophy. you can use it to create a new future for your people. at the very least, you can hang it on your bulkhead."
"ow! ow! what do you think you're doing, doc?"
an impromptu auditory exam.
did i pass?
"with flying colours, which leads me to believe you did hear me when i requested you meet me this morning."
you're right. i forgot.
"i see. i realise your sickbay training is purely voluntary, but you haven't spent any time there in several weeks. and when i try to find you, you're always in the holodeck."
"correct me if i'm wrong, doc, but we haven't been treating anything more serious than an ingrown toenail."
that's beside the point. if an emergency were to happen you must be prepared. you're too far behind in your medical texts to be wasting your time in the holodeck.
"if it's any consolation, i have spent most of the morning immersed in a complicated surgical procedure."
really.
"a classic case of atrophied shocks. they needed to be extracted to prevent chrome abrasion. it was touch and go for a while, but the prognosis is excellent."
you'll be ready for neurosurgery in no time.
"take a look at this, doc. this is a fully stock 1969 chevy camaro, one of the earliest muscle cars ever made."
"imagine, northern california, late twentieth century. you're cruising up highway one, the woofers are pounding, the wind is whipping through your hair."
"medieval safety constraints, internal combustion system producing lethal levels of carbon monoxide. hmm. i stand corrected. this may be just what you need to get you back to sickbay."
i guess i should have known this wouldn't interest you. it's too much fun.
"this isn't about fun, mister paris. serving in sickbay is a privilege. i'd expect you to realise that."
"oh, i do. i'll be there. soon."
"lieutenant paris, report to the bridge immediately."
i'm on my way.
somebody call for a driver?
"take your station, tom. anything on scans, harry?"
i'm picking up another spatial disturbance two thousand kilometres away.
source?
i have no idea. it looks like space is folding in on itself.
shields to full.
"it's an alien vessel, one occupant aboard."
"captain, it looks like that ship is being powered by a coaxial warp drive."
coaxial what?
"it's a hypothetical propulsion system. starfleet engineers have been dreaming about it for years. in theory, it can literally fold the fabric of space allowing a ship to travel instantaneously across huge distances."
the alien warp drive is overloading.
"in theory, a coaxial drive explosion could collapse space within a radius of a billion kilometres. in theory."
let's keep theory from becoming reality. red alert!
scan the vessel. can we beam the pilot out?
too much interference.
"that ship's about had it, captain. the coaxial core is breaching."
we should vacant this area of space at once.
we can't just leave him like this.
try one more hail.
nothing. maybe he's ignoring us.
or maybe he's unconscious. we've got to do something.
suggestions?
a symmetric warp field. that should contain any instabilities in his space-folding core.
how can you be sure?
"advanced subspace geometry. it's the one course at the academy where i actually paid attention. we'll tractor him in to kill his momentum, generate a warp field around his ship."
his flightpath is erratic. we'd be risking collision.
"captain, i can make this work."
do it.
passing through the residual folds in space. steady. got him!
i've extended our warp field around his vessel. his core is powering down.
"nice flying, tom."
my pleasure.
we're finally receiving a hail.
open a channel.
"captain janeway, of the federation starship voyager. do you need medical attention?"
"i'm fine, captain. unfortunately my ship is not."
"if you need to make repairs, we might be able to help."
that's very generous.
we'll beam you aboard in a few minutes. stand by.
thank you.
tuvok.
energise.
welcome.
"captain, i know you put yourselves in danger to rescue me. i want to thank you."
i'm glad we could help.
"i was so eager to test my new engine, i pushed it beyond it's limits."
coaxial warp doesn't seem to be the smoothest way to travel.
"it's a violent procedure, but it allows a ship to travel through space at incredible speeds."
"considering the dangers, this method of travel hardly seems logical."
"that's probably true, but if i were worrying about danger i wouldn't have become a test pilot."
where are you from?
the fourth planet of the benthan system. that's about twenty light years from here.
"i'll speak to my engineers about helping you with repairs. without your coaxial drive, it's a long way home."
come in.
i'd like to ask you a favour. i need a change of pace. i'd like to help steth repair his ship.
this isn't a good time to ask.
what do you mean?
i've been reading a report from the doctor. you didn't show up today.
"i was a little busy this morning. saving someone's life, as i recall."
"is there something wrong, tom? anything bothering you?"
nothing is wrong. since when is not wanting to spend time with the doctor a capital offence? you'd have to throw the whole crew in the brig for that one.
"maybe. i was wondering if there's something on your mind. you're showing up for your duty shifts, you do what's required, but your heart doesn't seem to be in it. you seem preoccupied."
"like i said, i think i need a change of pace."
"you're a different man from the one that came on board four years ago. you've taken charge of your life, turned yourself around. i'd hate to see you ruin it."
"i won't. with your permission, i'll report to sickbay."
permission denied. report to steth's ship instead. assist in the repairs. we need our best man on the job.
"and on my way back, i made the mistake of flying the prototype through restricted entaban territory."
and?
and the entabans weren't too pleased to see me. i limped back to the engineers on benthos with phaser holes through their brand new extanium fuselage. i think they would have been happy to see phaser holes through me.
"when i was sixteen, i followed an ancient human custom. i took my father's shuttle out for a joy ride, and proceeded to fry all the relays."
i'm guessing he wasn't happy about getting it back.
"actually he didn't. as far as i know, it's still at the bottom of lake tahoe."
"here it is, the coaxial induction drive. it draws in subatomic particles and reconfigures their internal geometries."
and this is what makes folding space possible?
"at least in spurts. unfortunately, particle instabilities keep overloading my engines. but i'm going to make it work. i have to keep in motion. i don't like the thought of settling down. too many new ships to drive. too many intriguing women."
"yeah, i guess so."
when i get this ship back i'm going to be doing the first test on a new mithran class flyer. i'm told it's more advanced than any warship in the quadrant. why don't you come with me? we'd have a great time. you could meet up with voyager afterwards.
i'd love to do that. it sounds very exciting. but i have responsibilities here. people who count on me. b'elanna would be furious. b'elanna. i have to go.
"so, you started without me."
i finished without you. you're a little late.
sorry. i was helping steth repair his ship.
how's it going?
pretty slow. we're both stuck on how to prevent the particle overloads in his propulsion system.
have you tried an isokinetic containment field?
"yeah, that's the first thing we tried."
how long do you think repairs are going to take?
i don't know.
i was just hoping that maybe you could help me recalibrate the plasma manifolds tonight.
"ah. i, er, i probably should go help steth."
"tom, is there something wrong?"
why are you interrogating me?
i didn't think i was.
it sounds more like you want me to account for every minute that i'm not with you.
that's ridiculous.
can't i have some time to myself? can't i do what i want without having to report every detail of it to you?
"tom, you can do whatever you want. i just wanted to know if there was something wrong. i mean, lately you've been cancelling dates. you hide out for hours in the holodeck."
i am not hiding anything. that is ridiculous.
is it? you haven't even told me what holodeck programme this is that has you so fascinated.
"the dancing girls of ninipia prime. it's very entertaining,"
very funny.
you're overreacting.
i am not overreacting. there's obviously something going on and you're refusing to admit it.
"good evening, lieutenants. i see you don't have your dinner yet, tom. can i get you something?"
i'm really not hungry.
"excuse me. are you going to talk about this? because if you're not, i don't want to sit here anymore."
if you can carry on an adult conversation without all the histrionics
"good night, tom."
"computer, run a dna stability analysis. how long before my genome reverts to it's previous form?"
time to reversion three hours thirteen minutes. complete genome recovery is imminent.
so i was lying in bed last night when it hit me. what you need is a carburettor.
a carburettor?
yes. it's a device that's hundreds of years old. i can't believe i didn't think of it yesterday.
wait. hundreds of years old? surely that couldn't be of any use to us now.
"it all goes back to basics. you would be surprised at how often i find solutions to twenty fourth century problems in twentieth century technology. computer, access paris programme alpha one, grease monkey."
grease monkey?
mechanic lingo.
"a car's engine can't run on pure fuel, so the carburettor supplies it with a mixture of vaporised fuel and air."
and you think we need a device like that to dilute the particle stream as it enters the coaxial drive.
exactly! and a spare polaric modulator from voyager's impulse drive should do the trick.
subatomic dilution! it never would have occurred to me. i think you've solved it.
"well, we can run a few simulations on the holodeck before we actually try it."
i owe you a lot.
you can thank my lucky toolbox. it's gotten me out of hot water more than once.
"you're lucky to be stationed on a ship like this. replicators to feed and clothe you, holotechnology to cater to every whim. hallways filled with women."
yeah. it's great.
you don't sound convinced. aren't you happy here?
"of course i'm happy. i'm very happy. i mean, i pilot one of the most advanced ships in starfleet, i have a beautiful girlfriend, i'm respected. i have everything that i've ever wanted."
"you're lucky, you're part of a family, part of a structure. you have rules to guide you. you don't have to worry about making a lot of choices. i usually go to bed at night not knowing what the next day has in store, what trouble i might get into. you don't have to worry about those things. you're very settled."
"i remember those days. i used to be a lot like you. going anywhere, doing whatever i wanted, making my own rules."
"well, then there's hope for me yet, maybe someday i'll settle down too. but for now i prefer to stay on the move."
sometimes i wish that's what i was doing.
things'll turn around for you. i've always found that change is inevitable. it comes when you least expect it.
"yeah, i suppose."
"now, are we ready to try this carburettor idea on my ship?"
just give me five more minutes to finish up here and i'll be right with you.
"five minutes. and tom? don't dismiss the suggestion i made, about coming with me to fly the new ship. it might be fun to escape the shackles for a while."
hmm.
"computer, access all files pertaining to lieutenant tom paris. download into memory core alpha."
please enter authorisation code.
access granted. commencing download.
"hello. i'm steth, a guest of your captain."
i have been appraised of your presence on voyager. you are not authorised to access the ship's computers.
you must be seven of nine.
that is correct.
tom mentioned you. he thinks you're extremely intelligent.
lieutenant paris' opinion of me is irrelevant to your being in this room.
"well, er, tom felt we needed some files for polaric modulators, but he was called away before we could access them. i thought i'd find them myself and help out."
you were mistaken. he must be present to download these files.
"oh, i'm about to meet him at the holodeck. we can find the files there."
voyager's hierarchy is complex. see that you familiarise yourself with it.
good advice. i'll do that.
everything here looks good. just give me one more second to check the flow field parameters.
go ahead.
it's my box wrench. i've been looking all over for this.
"i know i should have asked you, tom, but i needed it for an experiment."
to check your new carburettor?
not quite. you're the first humans i've met and that wrench had enough cellular residue on it for me to check your dna. i have good news. we're compatible.
"consider this a favour. i know how unhappy you've been with this dreary, settled life so i'm taking it off your hands. i'm betting there's still some fun to be had here. voyager is a great ship, tom. i'll take good care of it."
sorry i'm late.
we were beginning to wonder if you were ever coming back.
his ship is powering engines.
"something wrong, tom?"
it's nothing.
i'm just really going to miss that guy.
mind if i join you?
not at all. commander.
"chakotay will do, tom. you don't carry this rules thing too far. i've been discussing your engineering report with the captain. she was wondering if we could implement some of steth's technology here on voyager."
really?
we thought maybe you could start on a shuttle. do you think you can do it?
i'm sure i can.
great. you can start right after you finish with the doctor.
the doctor.
he needs your help in sickbay. i told him you'd be there.
of course.
lieutenant.
hi.
"i know you've been avoiding the doctor, but don't tell me you've forgotten where sickbay is?"
oh! not yet. i was just trying to figure out if there's a more efficient route between sickbay and my quarters.
"i didn't realise you were that eager to get there. so tell me, are they ready yet?"
"ah, not yet. but they will be, soon."
"great. hey, let me know if you have any problems. polyduranide can be tough to replicate."
"oh, sure can be."
i can't wait to get my hands around one of those clubs. ensign kaplan won't know what hit her.
what?
"we're going to play golf with her. we scheduled a rematch, remember?"
"oh, of course. i can't wait."
have you been working on your putting? you missed both those two-footers last time.
i won't let it happen again.
all right. give the doc my best.
i will.
if i ever find him.
"you're early, mister paris. i see some good came from my report to commander chakotay. let's put these extra few minutes to good use. begin with a thorough biobed diagnostic. i want you to recalibrate each physiosensor, making sure to enter each metabolic referent precisely."
okay.
"when you're through with that, run a protein structure analysis and then continue your review of the thirty seven steps of a cardiopulmonary reconstruction procedure. i'll leave you to your biobeds."
did you forget to disengage the scan emitters?
sorry.
mister paris.
i don't know what's wrong.
"i realise it's complicated, but you must try again."
"actually, i'm not feeling so well."
how fortunate you're already in sickbay. i'll run a few scans.
"no, no, doc, that's all right. to be perfectly honest with you. this is so frustrating for me. i usually pick things up a lot faster than this."
"you're here to learn, mister paris. it will get easier with time."
that's easy for you to say.
excuse me?
"well, no offence, doctor, but you were programmed to be a medical genius. things always come easy to you. me, i'm just a pilot. a grease monkey. and as hard as i might try to become a better assistant, it's clear to me now that i'll never be half the healer that you are."
do you mean to tell me you've been trying to live up to my standards?
i'm afraid i have.
"it all makes sense now. the misplaced aggression, the shirking of responsibilities. all classic signs of an inferiority complex. i had no idea my superior abilities were affecting your psyche so strongly. take the rest of the day off. reflect on your strengths. realise your worth."
"i'll do that, doctor. thank you."
b'elanna.
what do you think you're doing?
putting.
in my quarters?
i can't putt in your quarters?
no.
since when?
tom. what is this?
that is a sand wedge. it's used for getting out of traps.
why is it here?
i replicated it for you. i thought we could play a little game of golf on the holodeck before dinner.
"so this is your idea of an adult conversation? i don't know what you are trying to accomplish with this little stunt, but let me assure you, it is not working. i am sorry if you are bored because steth is gone, but that doesn't mean that you can just walk in here and pretend like you haven't been shutting me out."
"you're being a little hard on steth. if it wasn't for him, i wouldn't be here right now."
really?
"i mentioned to him we were having some problems and he urged me to come and talk to you. to try to work things out. to admit i was wrong. i made a mistake, b'elanna, and i'm sorry. i won't shut you out anymore. in fact, i went to the doctor and begged to be excused from my duties. i realise it's only a few extra hours, but they're hours i want to spend with you."
steth turned out to be a positive influence on you.
"computer, wh"
"computer, where are we?"
navigation matrix one seven one one. the kotaba expanse. coaxial leap complete.
"how far are we from voyager? computer, lock in voyager's last known coordinates and activate differential induction drive."
unable to execute command.
why not?
the differential induction drive has been secured. the security access code is required to implement the coaxial leap.
this is commander avek of the benthan guard. we're taking you into custody. prepare to surrender the vessel to us at once.
"benthan? i need a second to explain, commander. i'm not who you think"
we do not negotiate with thieves.
"no, you don't understand. i, i need the ship to get back to voyager."
surrender the vessel peacefully or we will use force.
why is everybody trying to shoot me today?
you know what i'm here for.
i don't know what you're talking about. who are you?
i'm steth.
what?
look at me. you did wear this body for nearly a year before you switched it with mine. that's my body you're in now. i want it back.
bear with me for a second. we have more in common than you might think.
"this better be good, tom. i left vorik right in the middle of an eps recalibration."
you can thank me later.
"so, what's my big surprise?"
what would you say to twenty four glorious hours on the famed fourth planet of the kendren system?
you mean the planet where neelix is gathering food samples?
i ran a few scans and found the most incredible beach on one of the smaller continents. i replicated a picnic lunch for us. voyager isn't leaving orbit until tomorrow. we'd have an entire day.
"only a day? oh, i think that we would need at least a week."
i wish we could. we've only got a day.
"you're serious, aren't you."
completely.
do you know how much trouble we would be in?
"what could janeway do, execute us?"
"tom, i am swamped. i can't get away for an hour, let alone twenty four."
b'elanna.
i have responsibilities here. we both do.
responsibilities? i don't care!
"tom, you're hurting me."
"you're a real disappointment to me, do you know that? i don't know what i ever saw in you."
"seven, what brings you here at this hour?"
we were supposed to meet in the shuttlebay at twenty one hundred hours. did you forget?
i did. i got so caught up with my reading i guess it slipped my mind. sorry.
"the capillaries in your eyes are swollen, lieutenant, and i see signs of vascular congestion in your cheeks. are you intoxicated?"
"no, not at all. i was just exploring the replicator, trying some alien beverages. only a few were alcoholic."
you are not officially off-duty for another seventy eight minutes.
i'm on break. would you like to join me? i could replicate another trakian ale for you.
that will not be necessary.
"relax, seven. you're not on the borg cube any more. we could finish our work on the shuttle tomorrow."
that would be an inefficient use of our time. i will complete the work myself.
fine.
"before i leave, i would like to know why you were reading the captain's personal logs?"
i wasn't.
i saw the padd. it was unmistakably the captain's logs.
you're wrong. you're confused. you couldn't possibly have seen anything.
you know i possess an eidetic memory. i require only seconds to commit what i see to memory. would you like me to quote the passage you were reading?
"i'm warning you, stay out of my way! don't interfere in things that don't concern you. if you bother me again, i will make things very unpleasant for you."
remove your hand from my arm.
don't be foolish. you'll regret it.
enter.
"you wanted to see me, captain?"
yes. i received a rather disturbing report from seven of nine regarding your conduct last night. she claims you were drinking on duty.
"she's mistaken, captain."
"don't lie to me, tom. i checked the computers. you replicated five alcoholic beverages in the mess hall. she also said you threatened her."
"i'm sorry, captain. b'elanna and i had an argument. i was upset."
and is that why you were reading my personal logs?
i wasn't!
"seven recited a passage which i'd written, word for word."
"she probably accessed those files herself. captain, you can't take the word of a borg over mine."
"this has to stop, tom. your conduct lately has been bizarre, and i've heard far too many complaints from far too many people to dismiss it. chakotay, the doctor, seven of nine. they're all worried about you. and so am i."
"you're right, captain. i need some rest. i'll go right to my quarters."
"tom! as your captain and as your friend, i want you to report to sickbay for some tests. we have to find out if there's something physical that's causing this behaviour."
this is crazy. i don't need any help.
that's an order.
"security, i need you in the ready room, now!"
"are you hurt, captain?"
no. take him to sickbay. keep security with him.
the coaxial drive will be online in a few minutes.
"good. i've just about overridden all the lock-out commands. no offence, but i'd like to get out of your body as soon as possible."
the alien seems capable of some sort of selective dna exchange. he absorbs new dna while depositing his current genetic material into his victims. let's hope he can reverse that process.
that's the last lock-out command. we're set for coaxial warp. let's find voyager.
"neurological scans yielded very little, but i did find something very interesting in his blood analysis. there are traces of a second dna pattern in his nucleotide structure. possibly the result of a genetic virus."
could this be the cause of his recent behaviour?
"i don't know, but i'm running more scans to see how this might have affected his neurological functions."
"captain, a vessel just emerged from coaxial space off our starboard bow."
"keep me informed, doctor."
hail them.
captain janeway.
"welcome back, mister steth."
"i know this sounds crazy, captain, but i'm not steth. i'm tom paris."
i beg your pardon.
"we're dealing with an alien who's some sort of identity thief. he traded places with me. please, beam us aboard."
maintain your position while we consider your request. end transmission. hold them in a tractor beam until you hear from me.
"aye, captain."
i have a feeling steth and his new friend are behind whatever's happened to tom.
captain?
no time to explain. i'll be in sickbay.
captain?
"commander, i'm reading an unauthorised shuttle launch. it's the captain. she's in the shuttle tom's been working on."
try hailing her.
she's not responding.
"hail steth's ship. look, i don't know who you are, but i want to know what's happening here."
who's on that shuttle?
captain janeway.
"no. i'm betting the alien switched my body, er, tom's body for hers. you've got to let us out of this tractor beam. we can catch her with this ship. chakotay, it's me."
how do i know that?
"the other day, in your office, you told me i'd turned my life around. well, give me the chance to prove it. let me go after the shuttle. it is the only way we can get everybody back into the right body."
"harry, disengage the tractor beam."
twenty thousand kilometres and closing.
has he detected us yet?
i'd say he has.
"gentlemen, i'd advise you to reconsider this pursuit. killing me will only keep you trapped in those bodies."
he's right. we can't risk killing him.
"yeah, but nothing's keeping him from killing us. damn! the ship's not nearly as manoeuverable as a shuttle."
shields are down.
i'm surprised you're so eager to
"reclaim your life on voyager, tom. i was just as disappointed with it as you were."
then i guess we were both wrong.
"it's time to move on again. oh, tom? be sure to send my best regards to b'elanna, hmm?"
he's charging the coaxial drive.
set the sensors to track him.
i can't. he's blocking us. we won't be able to follow him once he goes into coaxial warp. we're losing him.
"the carburettor! we added a polaric modulator to the coaxial drive. if i can target the modulator, hit it with a chromoelectric pulse, that'll disrupt his engines. here goes."
i hope you still have my box wrench. faulty carburettors can be a pain to fix.
"doctor, i can't thank you enough. you've given me my life back."
all in a day's work.
there were times when i thought i would be stuck in that body forever.
"believe me, i'm just as happy to be back to the old tom paris."
what do you plan to do now?
i'm going to take her back to bentha. i hope to find the person who belongs to that body.
but who knows if that's the end of it? we have no idea how long she or he has been switching identities.
"it may take a while, but i will do whatever i can to find everyone you've violated."
a security team will escort you to your ship and erect a forcefield to contain her.
so this is where you've been hiding? a garage.
it's more than just a garage. this is a monument to hundreds and hundreds of hours that i probably should have spent with you.
probably?
definitely.
"it's a lovely garage, tom, but i still don't understand why you brought me here."
"well, consider it a symbolic gesture. it's my less than subtle attempt to let you in."
i see. to make it clear that i mean almost as much to you as a cam-a-ro.
"it's a mint condition 1969 camaro. and yes, you mean a lot more to me."
oh six hundred hours. regeneration cycle complete.
"daily log, seven of nine, stardate15781.2. today, ensign kim and  		i will conduct a comprehensive diagnostic of the aft  		sensor array. i have allocated three hours twenty minutes for the task,  		and an additional seventeen minutes for ensign kim's usual  		conversational digressions. i am scheduled to take a nutritional  		supplement at fifteen hundred hours, engage in one hour of  		cardiovascular activity, then i intend to review a text the doctor  		recommended entitled a christmas carol. he believes it will have educational value. end 		log."
i'll get this. don't give me any hints.
i have no intention of doing so.
ensign.
"hi, seven."
are you ready to begin our sensor diagnostic?
is it oh six hundred already? we've been playing all night.
vulcan kal-toh.
"for a game of logic, you'd be surprised at how addictive it is. give  		me a few more minutes to figure this out."
"you should attend to your duties, ensign. i'll accept your forfeit."
no way. this is the closest i've ever come to beating you. i'm not giving up now.
impressive.
elementary spatial harmonics. are you ready now?
"yeah, sure. i would've gotten that."
is there anything you don't know?
i was borg.
i was borg. that's what you always say but what does it mean? you've got the  		knowledge of ten thousand species in your head?
not exactly. each drone's experiences are processed by the collective.  		only useful information is retained.
"still, that probably makes you the most intelligent human being alive."
probably.
so what do you need the rest of us for? forget i asked.
what was that?
we just dropped out of warp.
what's the problem?
we were hit by some kind of shockwave.
source?
checking.
"hold on. i just lost all my sensor readings. the computer's  		bringing up some kind of message, but i can't access it. you'd better take a look at this."
i see it.
what is it?
i have no idea. my command codes aren't working. the computer says i have 		insufficient clearance to access the message. we can't function like this.  		i'm going to get harry up here to trace the source.
don't do anything. i'll take care of this.
"send all sensor data  		about the particle wave to my ready room. tom, disengage engines and hold position here."
"captain, what's going on?"
i can't explain right now. don't discuss any of this with the rest of the crew.  		i'll have further instructions for you soon.
"computer, seal the doors to this room. no entry without my authorisation."
doors are sealed.
access secured datafile omega one.
voiceprint confirmed. state clearance code.
janeway one one five three red. clearance level ten.
confirmed. sensors have detected the omega phenomenon within  		one point two light years of this vessel. implement the omega  		directive immediately. all other priorities have been rescinded.
display sensor data.
i've been informed this is a highly classified mission.  		information will be provided on a need-to-know basis. captain's orders.
classified? by who? we're sixty thousand light years from starfleet.
"like i said. need to know. b'elanna, she wants you to install multiphasic 		shielding around the warp core."
i've never seen this shield configuration. i'd like to run a couple of  		computer simulations to make sure it's stable.
no time. she needs this done by eleven hundred hours.
eleven hundred? i don't think that's possible.
make it possible.
are we attempting to protect the core from some form of subspace radiation?
i don't know any more than you do.
it will be difficult to complete the task without more data.
"the data you've got will have to do. tom, start modifying a  		shuttlecraft to withstand extreme thermal stress. twelve thousand kelvins, at least."
"aye, sir."
does all this have anything to do with that secret message the captain received?
what have you heard?
"rumours, mainly. janeway's been locked in her ready room for the  		past sixteen hours. something about an omega directive."
omega?
ring a bell?
"look, the speculation ends right here. now, i expect you to  		carry out your assignments with a minimum of gossip, understood?  		i know it's hard not to wonder. frankly, i'm curious myself, but  		the captain was very adamant about this. get going.  the captain wants to see you."
i thought she might.
come in. what do you know about the omega directive?
"everything you do, most likely."
i thought as much. the borg assimilated starfleet captains.  		you would possess all of their knowledge.
that's correct. do you intend to carry out the directive?
yes.
then sensors have detected the molecule.
so it would appear. but we have to confirm it.
we?
"you're going to help me carry out the directive. protocol  		forbids me from discussing this mission with any of my crew, but  		since you already know about it, my choice is to either work with  		you or confine you to quarters."
perhaps you should do the latter. i will not help you destroy omega. it should be harnessed.
that's impossible.
the borg believe otherwise.
explain.
"on one occasion, we were able to create a single omega molecule. we kept it  		stable for one trillionth of a nanosecond before it destabilised. we didn't  		have enough boronite ore left to synthesise more, but the knowledge we gained allowed us to  		refine our theories."
the borg have been waiting for the chance to test them out.
yes. but we never found another source of the ore. until now.
"sorry, but if someone out there is experimenting with omega, i'm under  		orders to stop them. otherwise, this entire quadrant would be at risk."
those orders were issued as a result of starfleet's ignorance and fear.  		i can alleviate your ignorance. as for your fear
"sometimes fear should be respected, seven. tell me, how many borg were sacrificed during this experiment?"
"twenty nine vessels, six hundred thousand drones. but that is irrelevant."
"not to me, not to my crew, and not to the people who live in this  		quadrant. i'm going to neutralise this threat, seven, with or without your help."
i will assist you.
you will?
i have waited many years to observe this molecule firsthand.  		i will not deny myself this experience.
"all right. go back to your cargo bay, assemble all the data you have about  		omega. i'll expect a report within the hour. i didn't realise you had such a strong scientific curiosity."
not curiosity. desire.
desire?
"omega is infinitely complex, yet harmonious.  		to the borg it represents perfection. i wish to understand that perfection."
the borg's holy grail.
captain?
never mind. i'll see you in an hour.
arithrazine? what for?
i'm going on an away mission.
"what are you planning to do, stroll through a supernova?"
something like that. twenty milligrams. when can you have it ready?
"captain, arithrazine is used for the most severe cases of theta radiation  		poisoning. a physician must be present to monitor the treatment."
that won't be possible.
then i'm afraid i can't accommodate you. i'd be in violation of  		starfleet medical protocols.
"well, i'm overriding those protocols."
"don't tell me. the omega directive, whatever that might be."
"the arithrazine, doctor."
it'll be ready in the morning.
have it sent to the shuttlebay.
"captain, i don't know what's going on here but i'd hate this  		to be the last time i ever see you. please be careful."
i will.
i've analysed the sensor logs using borg algorithms. the shockwave  		we detected indicates not one but possibly hundreds of omega molecules.
location?
within ten light years. i'm having difficulty isolating the exact star system.
hundreds of molecules? that changes everything.
a shuttle mission may be insufficient. we require the resources of this entire crew.
"we're going to need more firepower, more protection. transfer your data to the astrometrics lab.  		i'll work on it there."
calibration complete. phase modulator. detonator circuits?
on standby.
we're ready to load the gravimetric charge.
this looks like enough for a fifty isoton explosion.
"fifty four, to be exact."
"what are we planning to do, blow up a small planet?"
i don't know.
"this warhead isn't standard issue. who designed it, the captain?"
"mister kim, you ask too many questions. change of plans, gentlemen. increase the charge to eighty isotons."
"aye, captain."
"harry, when you're done here, give b'elanna a hand with the shuttlecraft.  		she's reinforcing the hull."
right.
ensign hickman thinks it's species eight four seven two.
pardon me?
"that's his theory. there's an opening in fluidic space, and captain janeway  		has to shut it down. want to know what i think?"
no.
"i think there's a type six protostar out there, and the captain's planning on detonating it and opening up a wormhole to the alpha quadrant. in theory, it's possible. and because she doesn't want to get our hopes up, she's not telling anybody."
then i wouldn't suggest getting your hopes up.
then what do you think it is?
i do not engage in idle speculation.
"oh, come on, tuvok. aren't you curious?"
"yes, but we have a task at hand. the phase modulator."
come in. status report?
everything's going according to schedule.
"good. the omega directive doesn't allow me to say much but i want  		you to know what to expect. at oh six hundred hours, i'll be leaving in a shuttle with seven of nine."
would it be out of line to ask where you're going?
"i can tell you this. one of two things is going to happen.  		either seven and i will succeed on our mission, and return within a few  		days, or your long range sensors will detect a large explosion in subspace.  		if that occurs, you'll have less than ten seconds to jump to warp  		and get the hell out of here. head for the alpha quadrant and don't look back, understood?"
"i always thought starfleet was run by duty-crazed bureaucrats, but  		i find it hard to believe that even they would order a captain to go on a suicide  		mission. this shuttle excursion is your idea, isn't it?"
"let's just say i've had to amend the directive, given the circumstances,  		but you have your orders and i expect you to follow them."
that's expecting a lot. you're asking me to abandon my captain and closest  		friend without even telling me why.
"if it were a simple matter of trust i wouldn't hesitate to tell you, but we've  		encountered situations where information was taken from us by force. i can't allow  		knowledge of omega to go beyond voyager."
"that's a reasonable argument, but you're not always a reasonable woman.  		you're determined to protect this crew, and this time you've taken it too far.  		a dangerous mission? fine, i'll acknowledge that, but isn't it more likely to  		succeed with everyone behind you, working together?"
"ordinarily, i'd agree. but this directive was issued many years ago,  		and starfleet didn't exactly have our predicament in mind. lost in the delta  		quadrant, with no backup. i can't ignore the orders, but i won't ask the crew to risk  		their lives because of my obligation."
"my obligation. that's where you're wrong. voyager may be alone out here,  		but you're not. let us help you. we'll keep classified information limited to the  		senior staff. we'll take every security precaution. just don't try to do this alone."
assemble the troops.
"if we were in the alpha quadrant right now, we wouldn't be having  		this conversation. i'd be in contact with starfleet  		command, and they'd send in a specialised team to deal with the crisis.  		in their absence, we're going to have to make do with the training i've received,  		and the knowledge seven of nine has retained from the borg. you've all  		seen this symbol. omega, the last letter of the greek alphabet.  		chosen by starfleet to represent a  		threat not only to the federation, but to the entire galaxy.  		only starship captains and federation flag officers have been  		briefed on the nature of this threat. what you're about to hear  		will not go beyond these bulkheads, is that clear? good."
this is omega.
a molecule?
"not just any molecule. the most powerful substance known to exist.  		a single omega molecule contains the same energy as a warp core.  		in theory, a small chain of them could sustain a civilisation. the  		molecule was first synthesised over a hundred years ago, by a starfleet  		physicist named ketteract. i think he was hoping to develop an inexhaustible power source."
or a weapon.
"ketteract managed to synthesise a single molecule particle of omega,  		but it only existed for a fraction of a second before it destabilised."
this was  		a classified research station in the lantaru sector. ketteract and one hundred  		twenty six of the federation's leading scientists were lost in the accident.  		rescue teams attempting to reach the site  		discovered an unexpected secondary effect. there were subspace  		ruptures extending out several light years.
the lantaru sector. it's impossible to create a stable warp field there.  		you can only fly through it at sublight speeds. i was always told that  		was a natural phenomenon. you're saying it was caused by a single molecule of this stuff?
"omega destroys subspace. a chain reaction involving a handful of molecules  		could devastate subspace throughout an entire quadrant. if that were to happen,  		warp travel would become impossible. space-faring civilisation as we know it would  		cease to exist. when starfleet realised omega's power, they suppressed all knowledge of it."
"have you detected omega here, in the delta quadrant?"
"i'm afraid so. i've been authorised to use whatever means necessary to destroy it. tom,  		i've calculated the location of the molecules. i'll transfer the coordinates  		to the helm. take us there at full impulse."
"aye, captain."
"i don't have to tell you what's at stake. if a large-scale omega  		explosion occurs, we will lose the ability to go to warp forever. we've got our work cut out for us."
status report?
this is a harmonic resonance chamber. the borg designed it to contain and stabilise omega.
i thought i asked you to work on the photon torpedo.
the torpedo may be insufficient. i can modify this chamber to emit an inverse frequency.  		it will be enough to dissolve omega's interatomic bonds.
"here's to borg ingenuity. this is excellent work, seven. we may need this."
the modifications require several complex calculations. assist me.
i guess i will. i'm curious. when did the borg discover omega?
two hundred twenty nine years ago.
assimilation?
"yes, of thirteen different species."
thirteen?
"it began with species two six two. they were primitive, but their  		oral history referred to a powerful substance which could burn the sky.  		the borg were intrigued, which led them to species two six three. they too  		were primitive, and believed it was a drop of blood from their creator."
fascinating.
"yes, but irrelevant. we followed this trail of myth for many years until  		finally assimilating a species with useful scientific data. we then created the molecule ourselves."
omega caused quite a stir among my own species. federation cosmologists  		had a theory that the molecule once existed in nature for an infinitesimal period  		of time at the exact moment of the big bang. some claimed omega was the primal source of  		energy for the explosion that began our universe.
a creation myth like any other.
perhaps. what is it the borg say? that omega is perfect?
yes.
is that a theory or a belief.
bridge to captain.
go ahead.
we're approaching the coordinates.
i'm on my way. i'm leaving this project in your hands. use whatever resources and personnel you need.
understood.
we've entered a planetary system.
inhabited?
there's a pre-warp civilisation on the outermost planet. the  		source of omega seems to be further in.
the damage to subspace in this region is extreme. we won't  		be able to go to warp.
we're encountering distortions.
track their origin.
an m class moon. we're in visual range.
on screen.
there's a subnucleonic reaction occurring in the upper atmosphere.  		it is apparently emanating from a structure on the moon's surface.
can your sensors penetrate the atmosphere?
stand by.
my god.
over three hundred thousand square kilometres destroyed.
scan the structure. are there any omega molecules remaining?
i can't tell. several sections of the outpost are still shielded.
i'm detecting lifesigns.
how many?
a few dozen maybe. it's hard to get a clear reading.
"harry, can we transport to the surface?"
"i can get you there, but conditions in the structure aren't good.  		there are high levels of radiation."
"tuvok, assemble a rescue team and have them report to sickbay for arithrazine  		inoculations. tell the doctor to prepare for casualties. tom, move voyager into a high orbit,  		and then join the away team. we'll need a field medic."
"yes, ma'am."
you're going with them?
"if omega's still down there, i have to find it. i'll keep an  		open comm. link with the ship. you have the bridge."
i'm picking up omega's resonance frequency. it's here but i can't pinpoint a  		location.
i need to ask you questions about the experiments you've been conducting here.
there was an accident. we lost containment.
the substance you were trying to create. did any of it survive the explosion?
yes.
where?
inside the primary test chamber. who are you?
captain janeway of the starship voyager. we're here to help you.  		away team to voyager. two to beam directly to sickbay.
"aye, captain."
"this door is solid duritanium, thirteen centimetres thick."
can we get it open?
the duritanium has melted into the door frame. we'll need to  		cut through the metal with phasers.
do it.
"captain, i'd be negligent if i didn't point out that we're  		about to violate the prime directive."
for the duration of this mission the prime directive has been  		rescinded. let's get this over with.
"crewman dell, i'm assigning you a task more suited to your abilities. 		calibrate the ionic pressure seals on the observation ports.  		your new designation is three of ten."
"yes, ma'am."
i've got more isolinear processors for you to install.
"thanks, but i need to get the power relays online first."
are you sure that's a good idea? ensign wildman was assigned to that.
this is ridiculous. i'm not going to waste time just because seven wants to  		turn this team into her own private collective.
she says it's more efficient.
maybe for a bunch of drones.
"six of ten, this is not your assignment."
"please, stop calling me that."
you are compromising our productivity. i'm reassigning you to  		chamber maintenance. your new designation is two of ten.
"wait a minute, you're demoting me? since when do the borg pull rank?"
a starfleet protocol i adapted. i find it most useful.
i'm glad you're not the captain.
how's it coming?
the crew can be quite efficient when properly organised.  		the harmonic chamber will be completed within the hour.
good. i'll let the captain know.
has she retrieved any new data from the surface?
not yet. they're still trying to access the primary test chamber.
were there survivors?
a few. the doctor's treating them in sickbay.
"commander. seven's taking this hive mentality just a little too far.  		designated functions, numbered drones. i wouldn't be surprised if she  		started plugging us into alcoves."
"when in the collective, harry, adapt."
which of them is the senior researcher?
this gentleman. why do you ask?
he has knowledge i require.
he also happens to be barely conscious. come back in an hour.
unacceptable.
unavoidable. this is my sickbay. the man needs to recover.
the captain left me in charge of our efforts on voyager. i would be negligent  		if i ignored a source of new information.
"our next social skills seminar is entitled adding diplomatic flair to  		future negotiations. how are you feeling, sir?"
"better, thank you."
are you comfortable enough to speak with this individual?
keep it brief.
how many of the molecules were you able to synthesise?
two hundred million? i'm not certain.
what is the isofrequency of your containment field?
one point six eight terahertz. we used the molecule's  		own resonance to calculate the field.
that should have been enough to stabilise them.
"obviously, it wasn't."
obviously. but your approach is innovative. perhaps i can adapt your  		technique and improve upon it. you will assist me.
"our equipment was destroyed. if you can transfer the molecules to your  		ship, maybe they can be saved."
i have no intention of saving them.
what?
my orders are to destroy the omega molecules.
this is my life's work. the salvation of my people!
will you assist me or not?
our resources are nearly gone. the future of my people depends on this discovery.
then your answer is no.
small-minded creatures. you destroy whatever you don't understand!  		rescue ships are on the way. they won't let you do it.
"please, try to be calm. seven, you'll have to leave."
"you don't realise what you're doing. you don't know what this is, what this means."
on the contrary. i understand perfectly.
we've disabled the locking mechanism.
narrow your phaser beams to cut through the inner seal.
inadvisable. we'd risk penetrating the containment field.
then we'll have to use some elbow grease. give me a hand. right.
there's enough here to wipe out subspace across half the quadrant.
i'll order the away teams back to voyager and target this  		facility with the gravimetric charge.
it won't be enough. we'll have to go with our borg option. ensign.
"yes, captain."
return to the ship. tell commander chakotay to help seven complete the harmonic chamber.  		we'll have to transport omega directly to the ship. that means finding  		a way to shut down this containment field.
it's unfortunate we can't study this phenomenon in more detail.  		we may not have the opportunity again.
let's hope we never do.
a curious statement from a woman of science.
"i'm also a woman who occasionally knows when to quit. take  		another look at your tricorder. omega's too dangerous. i won't risk half  		the quadrant to satisfy our curiosity. it's arrogant, and it's irresponsible.  		the final frontier has some boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, and we're looking at one."
"we don't need to destroy the molecules. i believe i've found a way to stabilise them.  		the alien in sickbay calibrated his containment field using omega's own resonance,  		an approach unknown to the borg. i have modified this chamber"
those weren't your orders. the captain wants omega eliminated.
"that is still an option, if she insists on yielding to her fear."
show me what you've done.
"this simulation shows the molecules in their free state, highly unstable.  		i've modified the chamber to emit a harmonic waveform that will dampen the molecules."
"looks great, in theory, but this is only a simulation. how are you going to test it?"
on omega.
"bad idea. one mistake, and no one will be around for a second try."
it will work.
"someday, maybe. hang on to your research. for now, we stick to the plan.  		stand by to transport the molecules into this chamber and neutralise them as ordered."
"i have been a member of this crew for nine months. in all of that time,  		i have never made a personal request. i am making one now. allow me to proceed. please."
why is this so important to you?
particle zero one zero. the borg designation for what you call omega.  		every drone is aware of its existence. we were instructed to assimilate it  		at all costs. it is perfection. the molecules exist in a flawless state.  		infinite parts functioning as one.
like the borg.
"precisely. i am no longer borg, but i still need to understand that  		perfection. without it, my existence will never be complete.  		commander, you are a spiritual man."
that's right.
"if you had the chance to see your god, your great spirit,  		what would you do?"
"i'd pursue it, with all my heart."
then you understand.
"i think i do. i'll inform thecaptain of your discovery.  		for now, her orders stand."
thank you.
set the confinement beam to its narrowest dispersion.
understood.
"we'll target this facility with the gravimetric torpedo.  		if anything goes wrong during transport, that'll be our only hope."
bridge to janeway. we've detected two ships on an intercept course.  		they're not responding to hails.
how long until they get here?
"less than four minutes, captain."
standby to transport the
molecules directly to the harmonic chamber.
understood. bridge to
cargo bay.
"yes, commander."
"seven, get ready."
we'll have to do this quickly.
that's not advisable.
we don't have a choice.
the alien ships are on their way.
then i recommend moving the ship within five thousand kilometres of the surface.
that'll take us right into the atmosphere.
"with our shields down, we won't withstand the thermal reaction for more than a few seconds."
then we'll only get one shot at this. take us in.
"aye, sir."
transporter status?
targeting scanners are locked.
"captain, are you ready?"
pattern enhancers are active.
do it.
"we're eleven thousand kilometres from the surface. if we get much closer, we'll incinerate."
we're losing structural integrity.
nine thousand kilometres.
we're close enough. energise.
initiating transport.
the omega molecules are stable.
transport was successful.
i've got the away team in transporter room two.
"get us out of here, maximum impulse."
already on it.
how far away are those ships?
they're right on our tail.
we're heading into an area of open space. no indications of life or  		any kind of technology. we can carry out the procedure with no risk to anyone else.
except those two ships behind us.
can we stay ahead of them?
not for long.
how soon can we clear the subspace ruptures and go to warp?
"ten, maybe fifteen minutes. but those ships will catch up to us before then."
well we have one advantage. we've got omega. they won't risk firing at us.  		at least not until they run out of options.  		that should give us a chance to neutralise the molecules.
"captain, we might have another problem."
seven of nine?
she's convinced she can stabilise omega.
i thought we'd settled that question.
"while you were on the surface, she showed me a pretty  		convincing simulation of how it could be done."
i should have known she wouldn't just let this go. i'll be in cargo bay two.
"seven, the procedure?"
it's working. eleven percent of the molecules have already been neutralised.
let's see if we can speed up the process a little.
did chakotay tell you about my idea?
yes.
then you will allow me to stabilise the remaining molecules.
you know i can't do that.
your starfleet directive is no longer relevant. i have found a way to control omega.
i don't care if you can make it sing and dance. we're getting rid of it.
a foolish decision.
"yes, but it's mine to make. now step aside."
"i could have done this without your permission, but i chose to  		follow your command structure. i should have made the attempt. i still can."
"but you won't. you know i'm not trying to stop you from finding  		perfection, but i can't risk the safety of this quadrant.  		omega must end here. we both know that. status?"
eighteen percent.
this could take hours. can you increase the harmonic resonance?
yes. but it would rupture the chamber.
how many molecules would we neutralise?
"forty, fifty percent at best."
that's good enough. our torpedo can take care of the rest. janeway to bridge.
chakotay here.
"chakotay, i want you to clear deck four. put emergency forcefields  		around this section. prepare to decompress cargo bay two on my command."
understood.
"tuvok, load the gravimetric torpedo. once we've jettisoned the chamber, fire."
"aye, captain."
harmonic resonance to maximum.
"commander, they're closing on us."
they're attempting to stop us with a tractor beam.
adjust shields to compensate.
they're hailing us.
on screen.
disengage your engines and prepare to be boarded.
i can't do that.
"you've stolen our technology, abducted our people."
your people are safe. they're receiving medical care.  		i'll be glad to get them back to you when this is over. but we're keeping the molecules.
i won't allow this substance to fall into enemy hands. i'll destroy it first.
they're charging weapons.
you'll destabilise the molecules. we'll both be destroyed.
then return our technology. now.
i'm sorry. that's not possible.
direct hit. shields down ten percent.
evasive manoeuvres. try to shake them off.
"harmonic resonance at maximum, captain."
the molecules?
eighty percent remaining.
we need to get that down to sixty.
any damage to our power grid could overload the chamber. omega would chain react.
the same thought crossed my mind. where are we now?
seventy two percent.
"that's close enough, bridge, start the decompression sequence."
acknowledged.
what's wrong? what's happening?
the molecules are stabilising.
what?
i've done nothing. it's occurring spontaneously.
that's impossible.
decompression in thirty seconds. decompression in twenty five seconds.
"seven, let's move."
decompression in twenty seconds.
seven!
decompression in fifteen seconds.
decompression in ten seconds.
"tom, are we clear of the subspace ruptures?"
almost.
i need maximum warp within ten seconds or we'll be stuck at ground zero.
"yes, sir."
decompression is complete. the harmonic chamber has been jettisoned.
fire!
we made it. we're at warp one.
the alien ships?
out of range.
tuvok?
sensors show no traces of omega molecules.
mission accomplished.
i wondered who was running my programme. master da vinci doesn't like visitors after midnight.
he protested. i deactivated him.
"what are you doing here, seven?"
this simulation contains many religious components. i was studying them to  		help me understand what i saw in cargo bay two.
"the data isn't clear why omega stabilised in the last few seconds.  		the chances are it was simply a chaotic anomaly, nothing more."
"for three point two seconds i saw perfection. when omega stabilised,  		i felt a curious sensation. as i was watching it, it seemed to be watching me.  		the borg have assimilated many species with mythologies to explain such moments of  		clarity. i've always dismissed them as trivial. perhaps i was wrong."
"if i didn't know you better, i'd say you just had your first spiritual experience."
"when the captain told us to start collecting deuterium, seven suggested a series of modifications to the bussard collectors. the problem is i didn't realise the extent of the modifications until after we'd begun the sweep. i mean, not that there was anything wrong with them, in fact efficiency is up twenty three percent"
"in a nutshell, harry."
"the collectors are almost full, but i can't tell exactly how full until i realign my sensors with seven's."
"why didn't you just say so? next time, work closer with her from the start."
closer. right.
"so, you're going to realign your sensors with seven's. sounds like fun."
very funny.
what was that?
are you getting feedback from seven's modifications?
negative.
report.
i am picking up proton surges just outside the ship. the first was off the port beam and the second two were off the starboard bow.
on screen. there's nothing out there.
"whatever it is, it's getting closer."
red alert. janeway to astrometrics.
"yes, captain."
use the astrometrics sensors to scan for the disturbance.
i'm detecting close range weapons fire.
source?
proton surges suggest two cloaked ships engaged in battle.
with us caught in the middle.
evasive manoeuvres.
"aye, sir."
"there's a massive power surge, like one of the ships is exploding."
"captain, there is one life sign aboard that vessel."
it is no longer on our sensors.
"we're being hailed, audio only."
let's hear it.
"chakotay, please, i need your help."
"chakotay, are you reading me? please answer."
this is commander chakotay. who are you?
"please, anyone on voyager, if you can hear me, i need help."
there has been an explosion on the vessel.
the hull is destabilising. life support is offline.
beam her directly to sickbay.
"targeting her coordinates. i've lost her. trying again. i don't understand, i get a clear lock, then it drops out."
"if we can get an away team over there, we could stabilise her ship and tractor it in."
do it.
"tom, tuvok, let's find out what's going on."
environmental systems are not functioning. oxygen levels are dangerously low.
"tom, try to get life support online."
no lifesigns.
see if you can stabilise the hull. i'll look for the pilot. hello? can you hear me?
"chakotay, is it you?"
yes. i'm going to get this bulkhead off you.
but the beam will fall.
"i'm going to pry the bulkhead off you. when i say now, get ready to roll out of there like your life depended on it."
all right.
ready?
yes.
now!
i knew you'd come.
"do i know you? chakotay to voyager, two to beam directly to sickbay."
how is she?
"i'm not certain. when i scan her, the readings won't stay in the database. luckily, i'm a master of visual diagnosis. she has a minor concussion and a compound tibular fracture. nothing life-threatening. i can repair the damage."
did you find out how she knows you?
not yet.
no. i can't.
she's coming around. don't be frightened. you're quite safe here.
"captain, please, i need asylum. you must let me stay on your ship, and we've got to get away from here. they'll be coming after me."
"slow down a minute. i have a few questions first. who are you, and how do you know my first officer?"
"it's a complicated story. i'm not, i'm not sure quite how to begin. but if you don't give me asylum, they're going to track me down and they're going to take me back. and i don't want to go."
we won't turn you over to anyone without knowing the whole story.
thank you.
chakotay. i want you to stay with her. she seems to trust you. maybe you'll be able to find out what this is all about.
i hope so.
keep me informed.
"once i've repaired the fracture, she'll need some bed rest."
will you stay with me?
of course.
then i'll be fine.
"there, that should do it. i'd ask you to monitor her vital signs, but since they aren't registering, i suppose there's no point. well, i have several days' worth of inoculation records to catalogue. i suppose i'll get to it."
is he gone?
yes.
then we're alone.
in a manner of speaking. can you start clearing up a few things now?
"i'll try. it's complicated. you see, we've met before."
"if that were true, i'm sure i'd remember."
"no, you wouldn't. you couldn't. you see, the memories of my people can't be held in the minds of other races. when we encounter others, which we do infrequently, they remember us for a few hours, but then the memories fade away. we're completely forgotten by the next day."
is this done through technology? telepathy?
"it's a factor of our biology. you see, our bodies produce a sort of pheromone which blocks the long-term memory engrams of others."
is that why the tricorder can't scan you? why we couldn't get a transporter lock?
we're impervious to those sort of devices.
your ships are cloaked as well.
"when you live a covert existence, you develop technology to enhance it."
but you say we've met before.
about a month ago. i spent several weeks here.
several weeks?
"you and i worked closely together. you helped me a great deal. then i left, knowing that you would forget everything about me."
then why did you come back? why the battle? why ask us for asylum?
i know you want everything in a nutshell. that's the way you work. but i have to tell you the whole story before it will make sense.
fine. i'm listening.
i came back because i fell in love with you.
"she comes from ramura. it's a closed society that won't tolerate anybody trying to leave. apparently, she was disenchanted with that and wanted out. they're trying to bring her back. that's why she's asking for asylum."
but you say that she claims she was on voyager before this.
"about a month ago. she says she's a tracer, a kind of bounty hunter who tracks down people who try to leave their world. she found a runaway hiding on voyager."
"she was here, but nobody remembers it?"
"that's what she says, but i think we have to find a way to verify her story."
i was looking at her ship. it uses a sophisticated polarisation technique that causes our sensor scans to pass right through it. she could have been shadowing us for quite a while.
and learnt enough about us to convince us she's been here before.
"but why? why go to that trouble? and what about the battle with that other cloaked ship? she put herself in danger, when it would have been a lot easier simply to ask for asylum."
"i agree. but i think we have to make sure she doesn't have some hidden agenda. if she was here there should be some evidence of it. she said a computer virus was planted to wipe all references to her being here, but i have to believe we can at least turn up some evidence of tampering. harry, tuvok, tom. do the same with her ship. see if the navigational logs support what she's saying."
"gentlemen. i agree we should take precautions, but you seem very suspicious of her."
i want to make sure we're not being manipulated.
"i agree. if we grant her asylum, we'll be in the position of having to protect her. if we're going to commit to that, we should certainly find out if she's telling the truth. i'd appreciate your thoughts on that."
"aye, captain."
i have successfully downloaded the navigational logs from your vessel.
good. now compare them with your own logs over the last two months.
display voyager's route towards the alpha quadrant.
"now overlay my route. there, you see. our ships travelled together for at least two weeks."
you could have falsified your navigational logs.
there's no proof that you ever came aboard voyager.
"that's what i always liked about you two. such unyielding logic, such refreshing scepticism. run a diagnostic on my logs. you'll find they haven't been altered."
how's it going?
"her story seems to be legitimate, but there are further steps to take."
"then take them. i thought you might like to get something to eat, unless your memories of our mess hall aren't good."
"as a matter of fact, i was quite fond of neelix's food."
now that's something that's hard to believe.
commander chakotay's face became flushed as he spoke with her. what does that signify?
i'd rather not engage in speculation. it is a dangerous pastime.
"i think our guest will enjoy this, commander. fried soy meal, buttered carrots, and a delightful almond pudding."
sounds wonderful.
"very nice. thanks, neelix."
you were very diplomatic.
why do you say that?
"you hate carrots, fried food upsets your stomach, and you refuse to eat pudding because you think it's slimy. right?"
"i'm curious. when you were here before you said we worked together, but you also said you were here to retrieve a runaway. how was i involved?"
aren't you more curious to hear about how we fell in love?
we? you said you were in love with me. you didn't say i felt the same way.
"if you hadn't returned the feelings, do you really think i would have taken such a terrible risk to get back to you?"
let's take it one step at a time. how did you get on our ship?
that was easy. the hard part was looking for the runaway without anyone finding me. i managed two days on the ship before i triggered an intruder alert and lost my cloak.
and then what happened?
and then i met you.
wrong direction.
i don't want to hurt you. put your weapon down.
"on my ship, i give the orders. put yours down."
i don't mean you any harm. you have a stowaway on board. i'll retrieve him and we'll be on our way.
that's not the way we do things here. chakotay to tuvok. i'm in cargo bay two. i have our intruder.
"understood, commander."
"you're about to find yourself outnumbered. if you want to give me your weapon and explain what's going on, i'll listen."
"i felt an attraction right away, but i couldn't afford to get distracted. i had work to do. and i didn't know if you felt it, too."
what happened next?
"you took me to captain janeway. i explained the situation. she didn't like the idea of a stowaway on her ship, so she told you and tuvok to work with me to flush him out."
and did we?
you keep trying to jump to the end. you're skipping all the parts about us.
"and you keep trying to talk about your feelings. i'd rather you stick to the events, not the emotions surrounding them."
why? does it make you uncomfortable?
"i don't want to play this game. i've been assigned to talk to you, to figure out whether or not you're telling the truth. even if you are, i have no memory of meeting you, and i certainly have no memory of feeling anything for you. you might remember a relationship between us, but as far as i'm concerned, it didn't exist."
i see.
i'm sorry. i just want to make it clear how i feel.
of course.
is there anything i can do for you?
can i have your pudding?
gladly.
then you're forgiven.
"chakotay and kellin, report to the bridge immediately."
it's the tracers. they've found me.
we don't detect any ships. i'm assuming these are your people in cloaked vessels.
they've come to take me back.
"harry, hail them."
they won't answer.
"she's right, captain. no response. their weapons are going through our shields as if they weren't there."
match shields to the frequency of their particle beams.
no effect.
shield strength down to twenty nine percent.
"they'll keep firing until you surrender, or until i contact them and agree to come back."
do you still want to stay with us?
yes.
"all right. tom, get us our of here."
that last volley damaged our propulsion systems. we have thrusters only.
"captain, if you'll let me have access to your sensor systems, i can modify then to detect the ships."
"do it. this is the moment, chakotay. either we give her up or we fire back. which one is it?"
fire.
"i think you might be able to detect them now, but only for a minute or two."
harry.
affirmative. two heavily armed ships off the port bow.
can we get them on screen?
that's the best i can do.
"tuvok, target their weapons systems."
firing.
"well done. stand down red alert. well, it seems we've granted you asylum. now you'll have to give some thought to what you want to do."
i'd prefer to remain on board.
"consider that carefully. we're headed for the alpha quadrant. before long, we will be so far from your world that if you change your mind, you wouldn't be able to get back."
i won't change my mind. but i must warn you. the tracers won't give up that easily. your ship is still at risk.
nothing we haven't faced before.
"i was only able to make a temporary modification to your sensors. if you let me access your astrometrics processors, i could make that modification permanent."
you'll need a command officer with you to override the security lock-outs.
"i can do that, captain."
"go ahead. tom, coordinate with engineering to get the propulsion systems back online."
"i'm on it, captain."
we'll have to climb up to deck ten. is something wrong?
"i can't relax until we're far enough away that they realise they can't get me back. and to my knowledge, that's never happened before."
there's always a first time.
i have a high security clearance. they'll be afraid i'm going to do exactly what i'm about to do. show you how to detect them.
"look at it this way. if they do figure out we can spot them, they might realise they aren't going to be able to take you back."
"you're such a kind person. that's what i remembered most. it's what made me turn around and come back. and sometime, you might be interested in hearing about our last night together."
"evening, commander. craving a late night snack?"
no. something to help me sleep. got any ideas?
"i know humans think warm milk will do it. frankly, i find it repulsive."
i agree. what's available in the tea area?
"herbal is best. i have several terran varieties, as well as some more exotic blends."
just mix me up whatever you think is the most relaxing.
problems? forgive me. i wasn't trying to pry.
i know that. i'm just not sure how to answer you.
how's our guest adapting to life on voyager?
"quite well, i think."
she must be happy to be here.
i'm sure she is.
"forgive me, commander, but sometimes it's best to be straightforward. it's obvious how she feels about you, to me at least. i see how she looks at you. might that be the source of your consternation?"
"she says she, or rather we, fell in love when she was here before. since i can't remember any of that, i don't know if it's true. but somehow, it's hard to believe."
why is that?
i don't know. it just doesn't seem like me. i'm still suspicious of her. i don't know if she's using me in some way just for her own purposes.
you don't trust her.
not really.
"may i suggest that maybe it's yourself you don't trust, your own feelings that you're afraid of. sweet dreams."
"i couldn't sleep. i need to talk to you. may i come in? i was just wondering if you still had doubts about me, or if you believe what i told you about us?"
your story seems to have been verified. i believe you're telling the truth.
"and the rest of it? what about us? i'm not one to hold back, as you may have noticed, so i'll get to the point. i came here because of you. i knew you wouldn't remember me, but i was sure we could regain the feelings we had before. they were there. they were real. but now i'm not so sure. my being here puts this ship at risk. it's better for everyone if i go back to ramura. so please be honest. if you feel nothing for me, just tell me, and i'll leave."
don't go.
it's called ice cream?
i'm surprised you didn't have any the last time you were here.
i could eat this every day.
then you should.
"voyager's a very powerful ship, and very fast."
"we've met people with ships that are faster and more powerful, but voyager's always managed to be a match for the best of them."
ramuran vessels are fast. they could stay up with this ship.
"kellin, we'll keep you safe. that's a promise."
"a tracer never goes home empty-handed. the disgrace would be too great. when i was here before, i'd been tracking that man for almost a year."
but you know all the tricks. you can use them against anyone who tries to come after you. you said you were going to tell me about our last night together.
"let me show you. you were sitting here, in this chair, and i was here. and we were drinking something with bubbles."
champagne?
"yes, i wanted to celebrate. i'd caught my runaway that day with your help."
how was that?
you came up with the idea of using a magneton sweep to disrupt his polarisation cloak. we knew he'd be watching me closely so we tricked him.
i'm sorry you didn't get your fugitive.
he must have jumped to another ship while voyager was in orbit of mikah last week. i'll find him eventually.
"if you think we can be of any more help, let me know."
"thank you, commander. this is my problem. i'll handle it from now on. just beam me back to my ship and i'll backtrack to mikah. goodbye, and thank you again."
ready to energise.
"hello, resket. you were a real challenge."
i haven't had the chance to welcome you to voyager. too bad you'll be leaving so soon.
"we put him in the brig. once i used the neurolytic emitter on him, he was only too happy to be going home again."
neurolytic emitter?
we use it on runaways. it wipes their memories of the outside world.
so we were celebrating?
"you'd become much more than a friend to me, but i knew i had to go home, and you'd forget about me within hours. so i took the initiative."
more than usual?
"oh, yes. i moved closer to you. i thanked you profusely for all your help, told you that i couldn't have done it without you, and i touched you. i told you i, i cared very much for you and that i wanted something to remember you by. and then i did this."
"that's when i knew you felt the same way, but it didn't matter because i still had to go."
but now you don't.
"if kellin's going to be with us, the captain wants her to serve a function, to contribute in some way."
a reasonable expectation. what are her skills?
"basically, she was a security operative for her people. she's a trained expert in weaponry, surveillance, fighting skills. any idea where she might fit in?"
mister neelix could use an assistant in the mess hall.
"tuvok, that was a joke. don't deny it. you were trying to be funny."
"if you choose to interpret my remark as humorous, that is your decision."
"i do, and it was."
it's perfectly logical. all the qualities you mentioned would help in defending neelix against the periodic wrath of the crew.
"maybe so, but don't you think she'd be better off as a member of your security detail?"
perhaps. i'll assign her to a team and let her observe for a week. at the end of that time i'll evaluate her situation.
good enough.
"commander, i've been giving some thought to the fact that the ramuran ships might be in pursuit and could attack us again."
i've given that some thought myself.
"their proton weapons were particularly effective against us. if kellin would work with seven and ensign kim, perhaps we could devise a strategy to defend ourselves."
i'm sure she'll be happy to do that.
have her report to astrometrics at thirteen hundred hours.
i've downloaded data from our tactical logs. you can access it from this console.
"our weapons are proton based particle beams, very tightly focused."
it's like being hit with thousands of needles.
they can penetrate any shield even if the modulations are changed.
very clever.
no defence has ever stopped these weapons.
then maybe we're about to make history.
you've found a way to counteract them?
"i think so. the trick is to scatter those beams a little, make it harder for them to penetrate the shields. i think we could do that by tying the baryon sensors into deflector control. here's what i have in mind. why don't you look this over and let me know what you think?"
i'll do it right away.
"by the way, i hear chakotay recommended you to tuvok to serve on a security detail."
i want to help out in some way.
a word of advice. volunteer for beta squad. they're the best team. you'll learn a lot from them.
i will. thank you.
"when you mentioned commander chakotay's name, she flushed. he did the same when he saw her."
what are you saying?
i suspect the commander and kellin are engaged in a courtship ritual. it seems an unnecessary and complicated precursor to the act of procreation.
"i know you think so, but trust me, some people need those rituals."
explain.
"it's, it's usually considered a good idea if two people get to know each other a little before they become intimate."
why is that?
"because it's more comfortable. you spend some time together, you laugh, you talk. that makes it easier to, to get closer."
"but the end result is the same, is it not?"
"well, i guess so."
then i fail to see what is accomplished by all the talk.
"seven, if you don't get it, then i can't explain it to you."
obviously.
i should have known. they must have gotten somebody on board during the battle.
you're jumping to conclusions.
no. there's a tracer. he's here. he's come for me. that broken vase was a warning.
we'll protect you. i'm not going to let anything happen to you.
it's too late.
no. we can use the same magneton sweep we used to flush out resket. we'll find this one and send him on his way.
i'm afraid i can't let that happen.
"curneth, don't."
"chakotay to security. intruder alert, my quarters."
"please, i beg you, don't do this."
"you know better than to ask that, kellin."
no!
drop it. drop it!
you're too late. she's already beginning to forget everything that's happened here.
the doctor says there's nothing he can do. your recent memories have already begun to fade.
"don't let this happen, please. don't let this happen."
do you have any idea how we can reverse the effect?
"promise me. if i forget why i'm here, if i forget you, do what i did and you tell me all about us, and you'll help me to remember."
"i will, but i'm going to try to do more than that."
can the effects of the neurolytic emitter be reversed?
"reversed? i have no idea. as far as i know, no one's ever tried."
then i'll be the first. tell me how the emitter works. how it affects the memory centres.
"you sound desperate, commander. does kellin mean that much to you?"
what you're doing is wrong. she wants to stay here.
"this is futile. even if i knew how the emitter works, i wouldn't tell you."
you have no right to do this.
i have every right. the laws on our world are very specific about that. no one may leave. no one may reveal anything about us to the outside world. kellin has violated both of those edicts. returning her will serve as a deterrent to others who might think of leaving.
did it ever occur to you that the fact that so many people want to leave might mean that there's something wrong with your society?
we have a strong and cohesive society because of our efforts to keep it that way. a few runaways among millions hardly indicates a problem.
"if there are so few, why not let them go?"
that would suggest that we don't care about them. what a terrible message.
"you may have wiped her memory, but kellin's not going back."
maybe we should wait and see if that's what happens.
she made it clear to me that she wants to stay here. so maybe you should start practising what you're going to tell your superiors.
yes?
the doctor told me he'd released you. how are you feeling?
i'm fine. do i know you?
"yes. at least, you did."
"you'll have to forgive me but, i don't remember how i got here or anything else that's happened in at least the past few weeks."
i know.
i hope i wasn't throwing things in a fit of rage.
no.
i assume a tracer is here to take me back?
"that's right, but. what i'm going to say will sound strange, but it's what you asked me to do before you lost your memories. you came here about a month ago, looking for a runaway. after you left with him, you decided to come back."
"but if i finished my assignment, why would i come back here?"
because you'd fallen in love with me.
"forgive me. you're certainly attractive, but what you're telling me seems very unlikely."
"but it's what happened. we started to work together and i began to realise how unique you are. before long, i couldn't get you out of my mind."
are you saying that you fell in love with me as well?
"yes. and then we realisedthe tracer was on board. after he used the emitter on you, you made me promise to tell you all of this, so you would know what happened between us."
this is a little unsettling. what is it you want from me?
"kellin, don't go back with the tracer. stay here for a while, at least for a few days. we can get to know each other again."
i honestly can't imagine what would be served by that. i have to go home.
"if you stayed, you might change your mind."
"then that's all the more reason that i should leave now. i've violated one of our most important edicts, and i wouldn't want to make that mistake again. i wish, i wish we had met under different circumstances."
your ship's ready.
"thank you, commander."
"i've implanted a computer virus to eliminate any reference to our being here. by tomorrow afternoon, you'll have forgotten everything. it will be as though we never existed. it's better that way."
you're such a kind person. i won't forget that.
i wish you both the best.
energise.
"more coffee, commander?"
"no, thanks. i'm almost done."
strange to see you using those ancient writing implements.
it's the only way i could get a permanent record of what's happened in the last few days. i want to get it down before i forget it all.
i'm sorry things didn't work out for you.
"i've been trying to make sense of it. i fell in love with her twice. i thought she could do the same. we were the same two people on the same ship. why didn't it happen again? i keep going over and over our last conversation, trying to think if there was something i could have said, could have done, but nothing comes to mind."
"commander, i don't think you can analyse love. it's the greatest mystery of all. no one knows why it happens or doesn't. love is a chance combination of elements. any one thing might be enough to keep it from igniting. a mood, a glance, a remark. and if we could define love, predict it, it would probably lose its power. i'll let you finish."
good night.
then our philosophies are in agreement. will you help us?
i'm asking you to intimidate the kyrians with your technology. help me capture their leader. this ship has superior firepower. he won't risk a conflict with you.
a way home.
your reputation in this quadrant precedes you. that's why we sought you out.
"there's a cyclic wormhole five days journey from here. we know where it is, and we can help you stabilise it."
how far do you have to go? sixty thousand light years?
you'll have it within the hour.
what do you suggest?
"our conflict is with tedran himself, not his people. they're innocent."
captain
"the warship voyager. one of the most powerful vessels of its time. armed with photonic torpedoes and particle weapons, this ship of destruction could wipe out an entire civilisation within hours. on this particular day in history, we were lucky. the death toll could have been much worse. by the time voyager targeted our major cities, tedran had already begun an evacuation. thousands of lives were saved. unfortunately, it was only the beginning of captain janeway's onslaught. as you'll see, her actions would have a lasting effect on our world. even today, seven hundred years later, we are still feeling the impact of the voyager encounter. before we continue the simulation, i'd like to answer any questions you might have."
i'm curious about voyager itself. how many people were on board?
we believe they had a complement of over three hundred soldiers.
did they attack other worlds as well?
"well, we aren't certain. records of voyager's travels through our quadrant are incomplete, but it's safe to assume that they interfered with many other cultures, yes."
tell us more about the borg drones they kept on the ship.
"voyager had many weapons at their disposal, including species they'd assimilated along the way. borg, talaxian, kazon. they were captured and made to work as part of voyager's fighting force. let's resume the simulation, and you can see for yourself. it's a few hours after the initial bombardment. janeway and her squadron are on the bridge mounting their assault. now, what you are about to see is graphic and unsettling."
"captain, don't you think that's excessive?"
"i want them defeated but, but this is genocide!"
this wasn't our agreement.
sequence in progress.
i appreciate your hospitality. are all your guests treated so well?
state your demands.
"i understand what the vaskans want. more of our territory, more resources. but what do you want, captain? why are you doing this to us?"
"to reach your home, you would destroy ours?"
"no, i would not."
"you have shamed us all. we could've ended this on our own, peacefully, without her."
no.
we will prevail.
"the ensuing conflict was brief but brutal. two million kyrians slaughtered within days. the warship voyager continued on its way, leaving the kyrian dynasty in ruins. the vaskan leaders proceeded to occupy our lands, forcing my people into subservience. it took centuries for us to undo the damage that captain janeway had done, and the kyrian struggle for equality is far from over. this simulation and this museum are a testament to that struggle. i hope you found your experience here worthwhile. if you'd like to learn more about voyager and its role in the history of our planet, i suggest you explore the rest of this exhibit. thank you for your time."
"please, feel free to test the simulators. i wouldn't touch that if i were you. one of the voyager's torpedoes. twenty five isoton yield. it could destroy an entire city within seconds. it's been inactive for centuries but you never know. i'm only teasing, but please be careful. if we damage any of these relics they can never be replaced. the history of our people should be respected."
i have a question about that history.
please.
how can you prove that it's true?
take a closer look. the evidence is all around you.
some musty fossils and a recreation? that doesn't prove anything.
i disagree.
"you're trying to blame the vaskans for all your troubles the way you always do. i don't have a problem with your species. i have kyrian friends. but i don't appreciate seeing my people being portrayed as villains in your little simulation, and i certainly don't want your history taught to my children."
"you'd better get used to the idea, because we've just uncovered an artefact that's going to confirm everything you've seen here. three weeks ago our research team found a data storage device buried nine metres beneath the ruins at kesef. i've confirmed that it came from voyager."
another fossil.
"the device contains active data. possibly crew logs, even captain janeway's personal almanac. in the next few days, we could be hearing voyager's version of these events in their own words."
and what if those words tell a different story? what then?
we will change our views accordingly.
i'm sure you will.
"i apologise. please, enjoy the rest of your visit."
"activate recreation, the voyager encounter. display engine room."
"begin dictation. i'm resuming work on artefact two seven one, the voyager data storage device. i've decided to try using period tools from the simulation itself. with any luck, they'll be more compatible. hmm. there's far more data here than i expected. seems more like a programme of some sort. yes. yes, it's an optronic datastream. a hologram."
please state the nature of the medical emergency. please state the nature of the medical emergency.
i recognise you. you're voyager's doctor.
what am i doing in engineering? where's my mobile emitter?
you're not an android.
"of course not. what are you talking about? a kyrian. doctor to the bridge, intruder alert. security to engineering."
you won't have much luck with that. nothing in here is real. it's a simulation.
a holodeck?
no. you're in the museum of kyrian heritage.
you've stolen my programme. how?
"please, let me try to explain."
try quickly.
you are a hologram.
that i know.
i just discovered your programme inside this data storage device.
that's the emh backup module. one of your attack parties must have taken it from sickbay.
"actually, we found it at the ruins at kesef. i know this will be difficult for you to accept, but a great deal of time has passed since voyager encountered the kyrians."
how much time?
"seven hundred years, give or take a decade. we're not certain."
i don't believe you.
"think about it. when your programme is inactive, a moment or a millennium are the same to you."
seven hundred years? what about my ship? what happened to my crew?
no one knows. it's safe to say they're long dead.
and i'm some sort of fossil?
"no, not a fossil. a witness. a living witness to history. there's so much we don't know about what happened. but you saw it, you lived through those times. you helped to shape them. doctor, you could be the most important discovery of all time."
no. this is impossible.
doctor.
i don't believe you!
doctor!
what's going to happen to me now? will you put me on display? the holographic rip van winkle?
i'm not sure.
"i want to try to contact starfleet, if there still is a starfleet."
that will have to wait.
wait for what?
there are other issues to be resolved.
what kind of issues?
"you're the voyager doctor. a lot of people are going to have questions. on our world, artificial lifeforms are considered sentient and responsible for their actions. you might have to face charges."
charges?
for your crimes. you designed the bio-weapons that killed eight million kyrians.
i did nothing of the sort.
all of our evidence shows that you were a war criminal.
"evidence? what evidence? like this, for example? triple-armoured hull? thirty torpedo tubes? twenty five phaser banks? this isn't what our ship looked like."
"we reconstructed it from a partial schematic found in the cyrik ocean, which was badly damaged by corrosion. we were bound to get a few details wrong."
voyager wasn't a warship. we were explorers.
"yes, i know. trying to get home, to mars."
"earth! you see, you couldn't even get that right. this is a nightmare. what if i'm found guilty? what's going to happen to me?"
"that's up to the arbiters, but i imagine the penalty would be severe. your programme could be de-compiled."
"you've got to believe me. to you, this may be ancient history. to me, it's yesterday. you called me a living witness. well, at least give me the chance to set the record straight. i want to see your version of what happened."
pure fiction. this is absurd.
halt recreation. this is a reasonable extrapolation from historic record. but if you'd like to point out any inconsistencies.
"inconsistencies? i don't know where to begin. granted, this looks like the briefing room but these aren't the people i knew. no one behaved like this. well, aside from mister paris. we weren't at each other's throats. we didn't talk about how to destroy planets. we helped people. we were an enlightened crew."
are you denying these events took place?
yes.
are you saying you never got involved with the conflict between my people and the vaskans?
"yes! well, no, we did get involved, but it was nothing like this."
elaborate.
"there was a meeting in this room, but it wasn't about battle tactics. it was about a dilemma we were facing. we had negotiated a trade agreement with the vaskans. we were dealing with a representative, ambassador"
ambassador daleth.
"daleth. exactly. everything was going according to plan until we were attacked. by your people, the kyrians. they'd picked that moment to start a war and we were caught in the middle."
"the kyrians were the aggressors? no, no. that can't be right."
"captain janeway called this meeting to figure out how we could extricate ourselves from the conflict and still maintain the trade agreement with the vaskans. but we weren't on their side, and we certainly never attacked you."
save your objections until you see the entire recreation. let's continue.
"somewhere, halfway across the galaxy i hope, captain janeway is spinning in her grave. you've portrayed us as monsters. the captain's a cold-blooded killer, the crew's a gang of thugs and i'm a mass murderer."
calm yourself.
why should i? i'm about to be hanged for crimes i didn't commit!
tell me your version of events.
i remember this man.
tedran. he was a martyr to our people.
some martyr. he led the kyrian attack against voyager.
you're lying.
i was there.
you're trying to protect yourself.
"and so are you. from the truth. isn't it a coincidence that the kyrians are being portrayed in the best possible light? martyrs, heroes, saviours. obviously, events have been reinterpreted to make your people feel better about themselves. revisionist history. it's such a comfort."
"we were not the aggressors in the great war, we were the victims. the proof can be found anywhere on this world. the kyrian people are being oppressed to this day."
the problems in your society are none of my business. i'm just telling you what i saw seven hundred years ago.
"i don't believe you, and neither will anyone else."
what are you doing?
shutting down your programme.
"wait, please. i can prove to you i'm right. the medical tricorder, the artefact you have on display. if you just let me"
lies.
"begin dictation. i've re-examined the data module. from what i can tell, the doctor was telling the truth, at least about one thing. he is a hologram. a backup programme. we always knew he was an artificial lifeform but, we thought he was an android. if we were mistaken about that, i wonder if we might also be wrong about voyager itself. another question. why would a hologram designed for medical purposes be programmed to lie so readily? from the moment i activated him, this doctor has insisted that he's innocent. at first i didn't believe him. end dictation."
"activate recreation, the voyager encounter. display medical chamber."
"please state the nature of the medical. oh, it's you."
you've given me a lot to think about.
really? i thought you'd heard enough of my lies.
i judged you too quickly. i'm sorry.
what changed your mind?
time to think.
"for your information, i don't appreciate being deactivated in the middle of a sentence. it brings back unpleasant memories."
it won't happen again.
"good, because if you don't stop treating me like a second-class hologram, i won't cooperate with your investigation. i'm perfectly happy to lie dormant in that module for a few eons."
i didn't come here to argue.
then what do you want?
"i don't know. to talk, i guess, about what really happened seven hundred years ago."
are you sure you're willing to listen to a mass-murderer like me?
"i'm willing to keep an open mind. that's the most i can promise. try to understand my point of view. all my life, i thought i knew the truth. there was never any doubt."
"i never meant to throw your beliefs into doubt, but i can't deny what i know to be true."
"i realise that now, and i want to know the truth. and i want the arbiters to know it, too."
"well, the stage is certainly set, but i'll have to rewrite the characters and revise the plot a little. i'm quite adept in the art of holographic programming. if you'll give me access to your technology, maybe i can create a simulation of own. show you what happened."
"then we agree. in exchange, we'll provide you with as much dilithium as you need."
i'll transport the canisters immediately. it would be in your best interest to make this exchange quickly.
"we've been conflict with a neighbouring species, the kyrians. they've been threatening to attack us. war could break out any day. we've tried every diplomatic option, but the kyrians are a violent, stubborn people."
i wish i could make you one of our diplomats. you might have better luck resolving this situation.
the kyrians.
"i'd advise you to retreat, captain."
take as much of their technology as you can.
back away.
how typical of the kyrians.
they fight the same way they live. deviously.
"your crew is heroic, captain."
"tedran, this is between us. leave these people out of it."
i know what you're doing. an alliance with these aliens.
you expect me to believe that? you plan to use this ship to destroy us.
we wouldn't need help if we wanted to destroy you.
"computer, freeze programme. a tragic, needless death, but as you can see, voyager was not responsible. after tedran was killed, voyager was attacked by nine kyrian ships. my programme was disabled, most likely when they stole my backup module. the next thing i knew, i was standing next to this gentleman seven centuries later."
very entertaining.
i'll admit your holotechnology is new to me. i had to extrapolate in a few places. but i assure you this is an accurate recreation.
perhaps. or perhaps it's the fabrication of a war criminal who's afraid for his life.
do you have any evidence to support your explanation?
"in fact, i do. i've confirmed that this is the same tricorder i used to scan tedran at the moment of his death. if i can access the bio-readings inside, i can prove he was killed by a vaskan weapon, not by captain janeway."
can this be done?
"i've been trying to decipher the instrument for years, but, with the doctor's help"
"i fail to see what this would prove. tedran died on voyager, a victim of a conspiracy to oppress my people. the weapon used, who fired it, this is all beside the point."
"was there a conspiracy? did voyager really help my ancestors to start the great war? or were kyrians the aggressors as my people have always believed? now, this casts doubt on everything."
"but it doesn't change the fact my children can't attend the same academies as yours, or that we are forced to live outside of the city centre."
today's problems are not at issue here. this is about history.
"look, i don't know who started your war. all i'm saying is that voyager wasn't responsible."
i can't believe that you would cooperate with this murderer. you of all people. you built this museum.
the facts are turning out to be more complex than i expected.
we shouldn't be listening to this hologram. i want him arrested and charged for the crimes we know he committed.
that's not your decision to make.
"no, it's not, is it? i'm only on this commission because you needed a token kyrian."
please. this isn't about race.
it's always about race. you seize every opportunity to keep yourselves in power.
i'm sorry you see it that way. i think we are obligated to hear what the doctor has to say. proceed with your investigation.
"yes, arbiter."
you'll pay for your crimes.
seven hundred years and i'm still caught in the middle of your little dispute. one might have hoped for a bit of social progress in the interim.
change never comes easily for us.
hmm. that's an understatement.
i've entered the specifications that you gave me.
let's give it a try.  hmm. close enough. this diagnostic tool should help me get past the initial encryption sequences. too bad we can't re-create b'elanna torres.
torres. the chief transporter operator.
chief engineer. you might want to make the correction in your history books.
"what was she like, torres? i suppose we've gotten her personality wrong too."
"starting to believe me, are you?"
"well, let's just say i'm trying to keep an open mind."
"b'elanna torres. intelligent, beautiful and with a chip on her shoulder the size of the horsehead nebula. she also had a kind of vulnerability that made her quite endearing."
"you miss her, and the others."
"from my perspective, i saw them all only a few days ago. but in fact, it's been centuries, and i'll never see them again. did they ever reach home? i wonder."
"i've always wondered that too, from as far back as i can remember."
really?
"ever since i was a small child, the first time i heard the name voyager, it conjured up my imagination."
even though we were the bad guys?
"that didn't matter. i was too young to understand the implications. the fact you were so far from home, travelling across the stars. ah, i found it all very heroic. i suppose voyager is what made me fall in love with history."
"if it means anything to you, you would have made a fine member of our crew."
i hope that's part of the simulation.
"no, it isn't."
everything goes! the days of lies are over! destroy it all!
no! stop this!
we know about the hologram. this museum's filled with lies.
stop! listen to me!
we've listened long enough!
they're using photon grenades. we've got to take cover. this way.
what's happening? i've been hearing weapons.
"it's getting worse. protests, vandalism. two people have been killed. don't worry, they've cordoned off the museum. we're safe for now."
"that's not what i'm concerned about. two deaths, a race riot, all because of me?"
you were only the catalyst. the pressure's been building for years. it was only a matter of time before something set it off. have you found the tricorder?
not yet.
"it's crucial that we do. the kyrians are demanding you be punished for your crimes, but the vaskans want to hear your version of events again. they want to continue the investigation."
what's going to happen?
"i don't know. the vaskans are more powerful, but the kyrians are very angry. they're talking about another war."
then there's only one solution. delete my programme. i've become a kind of symbol for this conflict. as long as i'm around your people are going to keep on fighting. i'll show you how to decompile my programme. you can say i was damaged in the attack last night. no one will hold you responsible.
i can't do that to you.
then i'll do it myself.
no!
"i'm a medical hologram, programmed to do no harm. but i'm doing harm on a global scale. ever since you reactivated me, i've been concerned with clearing voyager's good name. but that's not important now. there's more at stake."
"a few days ago i might have agreed with you, but what about the facts?"
"facts be damned! names, dates, places, it's all open to interpretation. who's to say what really happened? and ultimately, what difference does it make? what matters is today and the future of your people."
"doctor, you were there. you can't deny what happened."
"i can, and i will. tedran was a martyr for your people, a hero. a symbol of your struggle for freedom. who am i to wander in seven hundred years later and take that away from you?"
"history has been abused. we keep blaming each other for what happened in the past. if you don't help us now, it could be another seven hundred years."
let's find that tricorder.
"it was a pivotal moment in our history. as a result of the doctor's testimony, a dialogue was opened between our peoples. eventually, we found a new respect for our divergent cultures and traditions. the efforts of people like quarren and the doctor paved the way for unity. quarren died six years later, but he lived long enough to witness the dawn of harmony."
and the doctor?
"well, he served as our surgical chancellor for many years until he decided to leave. he took a small craft and set a course for the alpha quadrant, attempting to trace the path of voyager. he said he had a longing for home. this way."
"the ship is grey, captain. we've cut power to decks four through nine. replicators, holodecks and all other nonessentials are offline. remaining systems are operating at twenty percent capacity."
"tom, how long can you keep us flying?"
with the deuterium supply this low? even at one quarter impulse we'll be out of gas inside a week.
"everyone redouble your efforts. keep your eyes open for new sources of deuterium. tuvok, chakotay, i want recommendations for further methods of conservation. harry, you and i will give them a hand in geophysics. see if we can't synthesise a substitute fuel. in the meantime, we stay in grey mode. if anybody's got any other ideas, i'm listening."
"we could set up a bicycle in the mess hall, attach a generator, pedal home."
now why didn't i think of that?
and i volunteer harry to take the first shift.
living space will be extremely limited. take only those personal items which are absolutely essential.
"hello, there."
"what, may i ask, is this?"
"that, mister vulcan, is the selected works of jirex."
"only essential items, mister neelix."
"oh, jirex is essential. he's the greatest writer in the talaxian canon. i never go to sleep without reading at least one of his parables."
a habit you will have to break until we're able to restore power to crew quarters.
i suppose i can try.
and these?
i get terrible neck pains without them.
i suggest you ask the doctor to prescribe an anti-inflammatory.
fine. i don't mind roughing it.
mister neelix. the blankets.
"no, no, that's where i draw the line. my mother knitted these herself. i've slept with them since i was a child."
you'll have to make do with standard issue bedding.
those starfleet blankets give me a rash.
i suggest you ask the doctor
"for some anti-itch cream. i might as well sleep in sickbay. thank you, mister vulcan. you've just given me an idea."
what's going on here?
i'm working.
"you were ordered to shut down astrometrics an hour ago. we can't afford the power. seven, it's inefficient."
"efficiency is relative, commander. if i shut down astrometrics, i won't be able to scan for new fuel sources."
"i appreciate your efforts, but we'll have to use conventional scanners until"
conventional scanners would not have found this.
what?
highly concentrated deuterium.
where?
"computer, display source. a planetoid point four light-years from our present position. there are dense pockets of deuterium just beneath the surface."
"maybe so, but that's a demon class planet."
demon class?
that's what starfleet calls it. also known as class y. it's got a toxic atmosphere filled with thermionic radiation. surface temperatures are in excess of five hundred kelvins. just entering a standard orbit would be suicide.
our situation is desperate.
true.
"when faced with desperate circumstances, we must adapt."
"narrow the annular confinement beam to point four seven terahertz. ready here, captain."
"stand by. harry, shunt whatever additional power you can to the containment field. i don't want any of those atmospheric gasses seeping in."
"aye, captain."
a thermionic discharge has struck the forward shields. they're holding.
"let's get this over with before you tell me otherwise. seven, do it."
energise. transport in progress.
shields are weakening.
i'm reading an overload in the pattern buffers.
abort transport.
controls not responding.
get out of there now.
"computer, seal off the transporter room and erect a level ten containment field."
containment field established.
"the good news is nozawa and seven of nine have both been treated and released from sickbay, and the planetary gases have been expelled from the transporter room."
and the bad news?
the transporters are offline. it'll take days before they're back again.
great. we use valuable energy on a course change and all we get for our trouble is another downed system. can we send a probe to collect the deuterium?
it would incinerate within seconds of entering the upper atmosphere.
"then i don't see any other options. tom, put us back on our original course, one quarter impulse."
"captain, maybe i can help."
"harry, the bicycle thing was just a joke."
"i've been thinking. with tuvok's shield modifications and a few tweaks to an environmental suit, i could take a shuttle to the surface and mine the deuterium from there."
"need i remind you, ensign, that there is no environment less hospitable to humanoid life than a class y."
"actually, tuvok, no, you needn't remind me. what's the alternative? resume course? creep along at quarter impulse hoping we find fuel before we end up dead in the water? we've got deuterium within arm's reach. we can't let the opportunity slip away without at least trying."
he's got a point.
"you wouldn't be able to communicate with us if you got in trouble, and until we get transporters back we couldn't beam you out."
"even with modifications, it wouldn't be long before your suit began to corrode. exposure to that atmosphere could kill you within minutes."
i know the risks.
"even if i agreed, i'd never let you go alone."
of course not. that's why i'm volunteering my good buddy tom here to go with me.
you were pretty forceful in there.
so?
so? i don't think i've ever seen you that assertive in a staff meeting before. you must be bucking for a promotion.
"i had an idea and i spoke up, that's all."
"oh, no, no, no. it was more than that. you put tuvok in his place right in front of everybody."
he was stating the obvious again. talking down to me like i didn't know anything about demon class planets.
"i am not criticising you. believe me, nobody enjoys seeing the vulcan master put down a peg more than i do. i was just surprised, that's all."
why?
it didn't seem like you.
good.
cargo bay two.
you trying to change your squeaky clean image or something?
not exactly.
"what, then."
"how do i explain this? when i first came on board voyager i was pretty green, right?"
"a deep, almost fluorescent green, if i remember correctly."
"i was young, inexperienced, and i acted like it. nervous about giving my opinion, hesitant to make suggestions, so i usually just kept my mouth shut. and i behaved that way for so long it became a habit. but, in the last four years, a lot has happened. i've fought the borg, been transformed into an alien, helped defeat the hirogen. hell, i've even come back from the dead."
it's been a wild ride.
"i woke up the other morning and it suddenly hit me. i've got a lot of experience now, so why should i be afraid to take the initiative or voice my ideas?"
"good for you, harry."
"but do me a favour. the next time you try to assert yourself, leave me out of it. i hate hot weather."
"don't worry. we can cut some holes in the environmental suits, get some ventilation going."
"harry, while you're busy improving yourself, you might try working on your sense of humour."
my sense of humour? what about that stupid gag about the bicycle?
"oh, ho, ho. that was funny."
"no, that was not funny."
"i can't thank you enough for getting me in on this mission, harry."
don't mention it.
remind me to volunteer you to help the next time i have to clean the warp plasma manifolds.
"really, tom, you don't owe me anything."
"oh, but i do. we've lost attitude control."
time to show off your piloting skills. think you can handle it?
watch me.
"oh, i'll be watching you, all right. switching to manual control."
"just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride."
we're entering the lower atmosphere. approaching the landing coordinates.
all right. i'm going to set us down. on my mark.
mark.
"you did that on purpose, didn't you."
it's almost five hundred degrees kelvin.
don't worry. the suits can handle it.
"if not, we'll be human barbecue."
i'm picking up traces of deuterium. fifty metres that way. let's move.
no sweat.
lame.
it's coming from inside here.
what is it?
"some kind of metallic compound. highly viscous, and if these readings are right, its temperature is only twelve degrees?"
in this environment?
whatever this stuff is it's packed with liquefied deuterium.
jackpot!
there's another pool twenty metres that way. why don't you go check it out while i collect a few samples here.
"right. i don't know, harry. a couple of lounge chairs, a big beach umbrella, maybe some dermalplast to counteract the chemical burns and i think we've found ourselves a new vacation spot. oh, come on. that was a little funny. let me hear you do better. harry. harry?"
"oh, my god."
"i know it's hot out, harry, but you picked a lousy time to go for a swim."
i don't know what happened. i leaned over to collect a sample and it was like i was pulled in.
"warning, ensign kim. an environmental seal has been compromised. oxygen depletion in thirty seconds."
"hang in there, buddy, and i'll get you back to the shuttle. have you put on weight?"
you're just out of shape.
warning. oxygen depletion in fifteen seconds.
i'll make you a deal. you hold your breath till we get back to the shuttle and i promise i'll start exercising every day.
maybe you should start with the bicycle.
i thought i told you to hold your breath.
warning. oxygen depletion in five seconds.
"hang in there, harry. we'll make it."
"warning, lieutenant paris. an environmental seal has been compromised. oxygen depletion in thirty seconds."
"you've got to be kidding me. we're in the same boat now, buddy, but i'll get us out of this."
warning. oxygen depletion in fifteen seconds.
you're right. i definitely need to get back in shape.
warning. oxygen depletion in five seconds.
out of the question.
"be reasonable, doctor."
take it up with commander chakotay. he's on his way here right now.
but it's only for a couple of days. just until we get power back in the crew quarters.
i suggest you set up camp in the mess hall.
the mess hall is full. where are we supposed to sleep?
"anywhere but here. this is a sickbay, not a dormitory."
but you have four empty beds.
"biobeds, reserved for patients."
you don't have any patients.
i may have one in a moment if you and your fellow squatters don't go elsewhere.
"you wanted to see me, doctor?"
"oh, it's about time. mister neelix is attempting to turn my sickbay into a flophouse."
we are short on beds right now. we've got to adapt.
ah ha!
"but, what if there's a medical emergency?"
then neelix and the others will get out of the way.
absolutely.
"but, this isn't just sickbay, it's my residence."
and we promise to be the most perfect houseguests.
what more can you ask for.
"but, i have a routine. i'm a night owl. what if one of them should snore while i'm listening to puccini?"
"well, if you feel that strongly about it, doc, i suppose we'll have to consider other options."
"thank you, commander."
"for example, we could shut down your programme until you're needed. the captain asked me to look for ways to conserve power, and it would spare you from having to listen to them snore."
commander chakotay to the bridge.
on my way.
but
make yourselves at home.
try scanning for infrared signatures.
there's too much interference.
what's up?
tom and harry still aren't back.
you want me to take another shuttle down and look for them?
"and risk losing you, too? either we keep waiting until we run out of deuterium and we get trapped in orbit, or"
or?
we land the ship.
"as you know, captain, the landing procedure requires a significant output of energy. with shield strength as low as it is, we can't even be certain the ship will survive the descent."
"what's the alternative? we're up here, the deuterium's down there, and we're stuck without it. we've come this far. janeway to engineering. vent all plasma from the nacelles. transfer any available power to atmospheric thrusters and stand by to commence landing sequence."
"acknowledged, captain."
"commander chakotay, take the conn."
tom's going to be sorry he missed this.
code blue.
commander tuvok to all hands. go to blue alert and report to code blue stations.
atmospheric controls at standby. landing struts online. inertial dampers at maximum.
all operative decks report condition blue.
"let us down easy, commander."
we're on a declining glide trajectory. altitude one hundred and fifty kilometres.
a thermionic discharge. shields down to eighty one percent. shields at forty three percent.
chakotay.
i think we're through the worst of it. almost.
shields at twenty two percent and falling.
can you shore them up?
negative. there's no more available power.
engaging landing struts. brace for impact!
status?
"i could give you a litany of damaged systems, captain, but suffice it to say, now that we're down, we won't go up again soon."
"start organising repair crews. that was very good, commander. take an away team and find harry and tom."
"chakotay, you're going out to look for them, aren't you?"
that's right.
take me with you.
"i can't do that, b'elanna. you're needed here to complete repairs."
i've already handed out assignments. vorik's on top of it. i want to help you find them.
"look, i know you're concerned about tom and harry. we all are. i'll have them back safe and sound in no time."
don't patronise me. we both know how dangerous that environment is. they could be in serious trouble.
you're right. i don't know what we're going to find. that's why i need cool heads.
you think i can't control myself?
i think you're a little too close to this.
"you're damn right i am. if someone you loved was missing on this planet you would be the first one out that door, and you know it."
"b'elanna, the clock is ticking. go back to engineering, do your job and let me do mine."
do me a favour.
what?
take seven of nine with you.
you're recommending her?
"you said you needed cool heads, didn't you? nobody's head is cooler than hers."
all right.
and bring them back safe.
i will.
"excuse me, doctor."
"yes, mister neelix?"
"we'd like to sleep now, if you don't mind."
not at all. make yourselves comfortable.
but you seem busy.
"oh, don't mind me. just going about my routine. sleep away."
what about the lights?
what about them?
could we turn them off?
"you don't expect me to work in the dark, do you?"
"well, no, but i'll never be able to fall asleep."
"that's not my problem, is it?"
"i've got a very, very busy day tomorrow and my next shift is just four hours away."
perhaps you should have thought of that when choosing your accommodations.
"well, if we can't sleep, i guess we'll just have to find some other way to pass the time. how about a sing-along? i could teach you all some talaxian rondos and i know a vulcan funeral dirge, not to mention the classics of klingon opera."
"very well, mister neelix. you win. pleasant dreams."
"computer, lights off."
"you're a little jumpy, aren't you?"
i thought i heard something.
now you know why they call it demon class.
demon implies a presence. this planetoid is unoccupied.
i'm picking up the shuttlecraft.
nobody home.
it's unlikely their environmental suits were able to survive the elements for this long.
i hope you're wrong.
looks like they went this way.
my tricorder isn't picking up any lifesigns. how did you reach that conclusion?
footprints. i guess you never assimilated any indian scouts.
high concentrations of deuterium coming from this fluid. i'll collect a sample.
let's find tom and harry first. we'll collect the deuterium later
as you wish.
maybe they found some shelter inside.
commander!
"good to see you guys. welcome to the demon planet. our suits were corroding, our lungs were burning. we were suffocating. you know what they say about your life passing before your eyes? well, it's true. i was finally getting past puberty when suddenly, i lost consciousness. i don't know how long i was out but, the next thing i knew, i was awake and i was breathing normally. and i looked over at harry. he was breathing normally too, with his helmet off. and, and we just looked at each other, and we just started laughing. i know it sounds crazy, but it was an exhilarating experience."
his vital signs are normal. apparently he has adapted.
"just the same, we'd better let the doctor take a look at you. chakotay to voyager."
i've already tried that. the comm. signal can't get out of the caves.
then we'll call again when we get back outside.
"i'm telling you, chakotay. it was an amazing experience. it, it's like when you're a kid who's afraid of the water and you suddenly realise that you can swim. go ahead, take your helmets off. try it."
"i'm glad you're feeling all right, but none of us should be taking any risks until we know exactly what's going on."
"don't tell me that a big, tough guy like you is afraid of a little poisoned atmosphere?"
where's harry?
he's further inside the cave. we found a huge cache of deuterium.
let's find him and get you two back to the ship.
"whatever you say, boss, but i'm telling you. we could breathe this air forever."
lieutenant.
yes?
we should have transporters back online within the hour.
"well, that's great. but right now i'm more concerned with little things like, oh, i don't know, say, life support?"
"indeed. according to my calculations, environmental systems will cease to function in two hours."
you say that like you're giving me the weather report.
"i agree the situation is dire, but losing our cool will not help matters."
losing our cool? where did you pick up that expression?
mister paris.
"well, there's hope for you yet. now, how about giving me a hand."
harry.
commander. isn't it incredible?
that's what i've been trying to tell them.
"are you feeling okay, harry?"
"never better. if we could get mobile transporters down here, we could mine enough deuterium to get us all the way to the alpha quadrant and back again."
tom tells me you've already picked up twenty kilos. that should be enough to get the main systems back online. let's get back to the ship. have the doctor take a look at you.
"i'd rather stay here and keep working, if it's all the same to you."
it's not.
"really, commander, i'm fine. you should send some more personnel out to help. they won't even need environmental suits."
"i appreciate your enthusiasm, but we're going back to voyager. now."
"it's all right, harry. once the doc takes a look at us and sees we're fine, we'll get right back to work."
"status, mister tuvok?"
i've shut down life support everywhere but decks one and five. it should provide us with an extra hour of breathable air.
chakotay to voyager.
janeway here.
we've found tom and harry.
first good news i've had all day. what about the deuterium?
we've got
a few kilos. we're on our way back to voyager now.
what's your position?
about two kilometres from the ship.
captain.
"transporters are coming back online. we should be able to beam you back from that distance, but it may take a few minutes."
have the doctor standing by. i think he's going to want to look at tom and harry.
"computer, lights. maximum illumination. everybody up! rise and shine, mister neelix."
what's going on?
it's checkout time.
it's the middle of the night.
medicine knows no time clock. i've got patients on the way and there's no more room at the inn.
patients. is somebody sick?
"i can't answer that until i've examined them, now can i?"
examine who?
ensign kim and lieutenant paris.
is there anything i can do to help?
yes. you and your friends can vacate the premises.
"right, move! you heard the doctor. this is an emergency evacuation. move! move! move! doctor."
yes?
"thanks for your hospitality. and if you ever need a place to stay, my door's always open."
energising.
beam tom and harry to sickbay.
what happened to them?
as soon as we beamed aboard they started suffocating.
"computer, erect a level seven forcefield around biobeds one and two."
forcefield established.
what are you doing?
"filling the area inside the forcefield with the atmospheric gases from the planet. try to breathe normally now. easy, or you'll hyperventilate. slowly. in and out. in and out."
that stuff is in our blood?
"i'm afraid so. from what i can tell, you've been bioformed."
bioformed?
"think of it as the opposite of terraforming. in the same way we adapt the environment of a planet to suit our needs, this planet has adapted you."
how is that possible?
"this fluid somehow entered your bloodstream and began altering your physiology at the cellular level. i haven't had the time to analyse this substance, but i hope to have answers soon."
"i'd like to run a few tests of my own, if you don't mind."
of course.
"so, what's our prognosis, doc?"
"well, you'll be fine. as long as you keep breathing the planet's gases."
you mean we have to stay inside this forcefield?
i'm afraid it's worse than that. the atmosphere of this planet can't be replicated safely.
"which means if we leave, we'll have nothing to breathe."
"exactly. either we find a way to treat your condition, or you'll have to be left behind."
can the bioforming process be reversed?
"as it stands, i don't know enough about the phenomenon to undo it."
i'll send chakotay and seven back to the surface. they'll gather as much information as they can. b'elanna and i will start running tests on this.
"let me go with the away team, captain. i know the terrain. i can help."
doctor?
right now they're better off out there than they are in here. but one of you will have to remain so i can monitor your condition.
no problem. i volunteer tom to stay here and play guinea pig.
each square kilometre of this planetoid is less appealing than the last.
i think it's breathtaking.
breathtaking?
yes.
perhaps your recent experience has impaired your perceptions.
"no, i don't think so. i wasn't really seeing it before."
seeing what?
the beauty.
would you care to point out an example?
look over there. what do you see?
"i see monochromatic geological formations, dust, haze."
"what do you see, harry?"
"to me, those geological formations are a dozen shades of red and gold. that dust, it's glowing. and the haze, it seems to intensify the colours. i'm sorry. i know it's weird, but i feel connected to this place."
connected how?
i'm picking up humanoid lifesigns.
location?
one hundred metres this way.
"magnify. factor ten. deuterium, hydrogen sulphate, dichromates."
add a little sodium chloride and it would probably taste a lot like neelix's soup.
"we should be so lucky. oh, what's this? magnify. factor twenty."
captain? that's a protein molecule.
this fluid has organic properties. let me see the sample that's been treated with the reagents.
captain.
let's get you to sickbay.
wait. that might not be necessary.
commander!
janeway to bridge. report.
"a large pool of the metallic compound is forming beneath the ship. we are sinking, captain."
on my way. get down to engineering. get thrusters online. we're getting off this planet.
"i'm not sure how, but they're still alive."
just barely.
tuvok to chakotay.
go ahead.
the captain has ordered an emergency ascent.
we must bring you back to the ship.
understood. i've got five to beam back.
five?
we found another paris and kim.
i can't explain it.
i think i can. prepare for transport.
beam us directly to sickbay.
no. i don't want to go back.
transporters are still acting up. we can't get individual locks. we're going to have to grab you in a wide beam and bring you in as a group.
acknowledged.
i belong here.
"maybe so. but until we know what's going on, you've got to come back with us to the ship. harry, no!"
"four of the away team are in sickbay, captain. i'm trying to get a lock on the fifth. it is ensign kim or rather, one of the ensigns kim. the ship is continuing to sink."
then there's no time. we've got to get back into orbit. we'll worry about harry or whoever he is once we're up. bring antigrav thrusters online.
thrusters enabled.
inertial dampers to flight configuration.
dampers reconfigured. all stations report ready.
initiating ascent. i need power to the thrusters.
we are being restrained by an electromagnetic force.
compensate.
no effect. decks fourteen and fifteen are submerged. the ship is continuing to sink.
report.
"thrusters are offline due to an overload. decks thirteen through fifteen are submerged. if we don't lift off soon, the hull will begin to corrode."
bridge to engineering.
ensign vorik here.
i need thrusters back online.
lieutenant torres has already sent a team to the thruster control junction.
how long?
at least a half an hour.
"even if thrusters are repaired, they won't be of much use if we sink any deeper."
there must be some way to disperse it. try a nadion burst from the phaser emitters. it may weaken the electromagnetic properties of the fluid.
"aye, captain."
i'm on my way to sickbay to check on harry and tom. you've got the bridge.
how are they?
"lucky. the backup systems in their environmental suits kept their vital functions going. it'll take time, but they'll recover."
and him?
"aside from his ability to breathe the rarified air on this planet, he's the exact duplicate of mister paris. he even seems to share his memories, not to mention his winning personality."
"b'elanna and i discovered that the fluid has mimetic properties. somehow, it reads the dna of whatever it comes in contact with and re-creates it."
fascinating.
can you tell me who you are?
"please, just let me go back."
not until i find out why two of my crew have been duplicated.
"captain, you have to believe me. i don't know any more than you do about this. until he showed up, i thought i was tom paris. a little changed by my experience on the planet maybe, but now i don't know who or what i am. all i know is that i have to get off this ship and go back down to the surface."
"we're ready to try the nadion burst, captain."
do it.
ow. what are you doing?
"captain, we're receiving an urgent hail. it's from ensign kim. the one on the surface."
put him through.
"captain, please. stop what you're doing."
"if you really do have harry kim's memories, you know that i'm going to do whatever it takes to get this ship back in orbit."
you can't do that!
why not?
"i, i'm not sure i understand it myself."
"well then, you're going to have to help me figure it out. mister tuvok, i'm on my way to transporter room one. erect a level seven forcefield around the platform. fill it with atmosphere from the planet and then beam mister kim, or rather his duplicate, aboard."
"aye, captain."
do you have a lock on him?
"yes, ma'am."
energise.
release my vessel.
we can't do that.
we?
"the planet and i, we're connected somehow. i can't explain it, captain. i only know that you've got to stop."
"and i'm willing to stop. but i'll say it again, release the ship."
no. we need you.
janeway to tuvok. fire.
what are you?
stop. no.
i'll fire again.
you're killing us!
you leave me no choice.
it's not fair. it's wrong!
janeway to tuvok.
"no! no, no, no. please. no more."
"hold your fire, tuvok."
"captain, we are continuing to submerge."
hold your fire.
acknowledged.
i want some answers.
i'm trying to understand. this is hard for me as well.
you said you have a connection to this planet. you talk about it like it's alive.
"alive. yes, but not the planet. the silver blood."
"the compound that sampled harry's dna, and created you."
"yes. but it's never been conscious, never sentient before now. before me and the other."
tom paris.
"we're the first. don't you see? you came here. you showed us. when the compound came in contact with tom and harry, it experienced awareness for the first time. before, it was only instinct, sound and light and heat. but those two showed us thought."
"i'm beginning to understand. this silver blood experienced sentience, and now you want more. you want to duplicate the rest of this crew and populate this planet."
"you're trying so hard to reach home, but this can be home."
"not for me, and not for my people. do you understand why we can't stay here?"
i think so.
"well then, release us."
we'd rather die than be alone. we deserve life.
"this silver blood that created you. it duplicated harry without killing him. so you don't need our bodies, only samples ofdna. release voyager and i'll speak to my crew. and if they're willing, i'll let you duplicate the rest of us."
"bridge to janeway. we've stopped, captain. we're no longer submerging."
"understood. we're getting out of here, tuvok, but first assemble the crew in cargo bay one"
and have the doctor meet me there.
captain?
i'll explain later.
it's time to meet your new family.
all stations report ready for lift off.
code blue status confirmed.
"take us up, mister paris."
"aye, captain."
"lieutenant, ensign."
"hey, seven."
have some dinner. the potato salad isn't half bad.
i do not require nutrition at this time. i would like to talk with you.
okay.
"ensign kim, what is your place of origin?"
"you mean, where am i from? well, i was born in south carolina, but i grew up in"
"lieutenant torres, explain why you became a member of the maquis."
"it was through chakotay. i met him. well, actually, he saved my life"
list the sports you play.
"i've dabbled in quite a few. tennis, pareses squares, but my favourite is volleyball."
specify the foods you find enjoyable.
"seven, what is this?"
describe the nature of your sexual relationship with lieutenant paris.
"okay, that's it."
"computer, freeze programme. would you care to explain what you're doing?"
i'm doing exactly what you instructed me to do.
"i hardly think so. i created this programme to help you become more comfortable in social situations, not to practice alienating people."
you made recommendations about how to carry on a conversation.
that's true.
you said it's helpful if people feel you're interested in them.
correct.
and that drawing them out by asking them about themselves is one way to demonstrate that interest.
"that doesn't mean subjecting them to an interrogation. you have to let them answer, listen to what they're saying. ask another question on the same subject. take your time. shall we try again?"
i believe i am overdue for my weekly medical maintenance. we should go.
"seven, you've never volunteered for a check-up before."
it is preferable to remaining here.
what have we got here?
"looks like a mutara class nebula with a few trace constituents that aren't in our database, but they're showing up in minute quantities."
"the nebula is vast, captain. it extends beyond the reach of our sensors."
"oh, then i guess we won't try to go around it. tom, take us in at one half impulse."
"yes, ma'am."
"i'm detecting a slight radioactive field. it's oh, oh."
harry?
nothing. it's just a headache coming on.
maybe you should go to sickbay.
"yeah, maybe so."
captain!
"oh, god."
"tom, turn us around. get us out of here."
janeway to sickbay.
"yes, captain."
we need help.
what happened?
i'm being inundated with calls.
hurry.
"seven, go to the bridge. use the dermal regenerator to treat the burns."
course laid in.
we've cleared the nebula.
all stop.
he's dead.
the nebula extends for at least one hundred ten light years. possibly more.
"at the least, it would take us well over a month to get through it, and more than a year to get around it."
the crew was unable to tolerate the nebula for even a few minutes. they certainly could not survive a month.
"we've come fifteen thousand light years. we haven't been stopped by temporal anomalies, warp core breaches, or hostile aliens. and i am damned if i'm going to be stopped by a nebula. i'll be in sickbay."
i've analysed a sample of the gases from the nebula. i think the damage came from subnucleonic radiation. even the briefest exposure is devastating to organic tissue.
can you give us any protection against the effects?
yes. stasis chambers. independent life support for each unit.
are you suggesting that the entire crew be put in suspended animation?
"yes. i, of course, would stay online in order to monitor everyone."
"this is a drastic step, doctor. are there any other options? adjusting the shields? inoculations?"
"i assure you, i've considered all possibilities. this is the only way."
there's more to getting through the nebula than monitoring the crew. who would regulate ship's systems? make course adjustments?
i think i've demonstrated that i have a command of the rudimentary aspects of piloting.
"of course you have, and i know you could do it. but you'll need back-up. we have no idea what effect the nebular radiation might have on your holomatrix. what if you went offline?"
there was only one crewmember besides myself that seemed unaffected by the nebula.
i want you to understand the seriousness of this responsibility. the lives of the entire crew will be on your shoulders.
you doubt my ability to fulfil this task?
"ordinarily not at all, but this is an unusual situation. after being in the collective, it wasn't easy for you to adjust to a ship with only a hundred and fifty people on it, was it, seven? how would you feel with only the doctor for company?"
i will adapt.
most humans don't react particularly well to long periods of isolation. borg drones have even more difficulty.
"as you pointed out, i am neither borg nor human. i can do this, captain."
all right. i'll work with the senior staff to draw up a list of duties. but let me make it clear. the doctor will be in command. you will follow his instructions just as you would follow mine.
follow the orders of a hologram?
"he's our chief medical officer, and he is thoroughly grounded in starfleet protocols. you will report to him."
i understand.
the doctor's preparing the stasis units now. they should be ready by seventeen hundred hours.
and how long will this be for?
"we don't know for certain. at least a month. maybe longer, if the nebula is larger than we estimate."
i've never been in long term stasis. are there any side effects?
"the doctor assures me it'll be just like taking a nap. we'll go into the units, our cardiopulmonary systems will be slowed, neural activity suspended, and we'll wake up feeling as though we'd had a good night's sleep."
"there are things that can go wrong. at least, that's what i've read."
"we will be carefully monitored by seven and the doctor, who will check our vital signs four times a day, and take care of any other problems."
i assume that we've explored all the alternatives?
"i think we're all feeling uneasy about this, and i'd be lying if i said i don't have concerns myself. and i think it's about loss of control. we always feel better if we think we're in charge of our own circumstances. in stasis, we're giving up that control, and no starfleet officer likes to do that. but crews have been in stasis much longer than a month. i think we can handle this. all right. you're free until seventeen hundred hours. i'll make a ship-wide announcement when the doctor's ready. dismissed."
something else?
i want you to tell me that this isn't a mistake.
your turn to get reassurance?
maybe. but my concern isn't about going into stasis. it's about who you're leaving in charge.
you're worried about seven.
maybe you need to step outside yourself for a minute. look at the fact that here's someone who's butted horns with you from the moment she came on board. who disregards authority and actively disobeys orders when she doesn't agree with them.
and this is the person i'm giving responsibility for the lives of this entire crew. i suppose you want me to tell you i'm not crazy?
"in a nutshell. i know your bond with seven is unique, different from everyone else's. from the beginning, you've seen things in her that no one else could. but maybe you could help me understand some of those things."
"i don't know if i can. it's just instinct. there's something inside me that says she can be redeemed. in spite of her insolent attitude, i honestly believe she wants to do well by us."
that's good enough for me.
see you at seventeen hundred hours.
"if i have to take a nap for a month, i really would rather do it in my quarters."
everyone's being relocated here to deck fourteen so we can monitor you more easily. hop in.
"come on, tom. sleepy time."
what if we had to get out in a hurry?
"you can unlock the unit from inside, tom."
"do i detect a hint of claustrophobia, lieutenant."
why do they have to design these things like coffins?
should we replicate you a teddy bear?
sleep tight.
"have no worries, captain. you'll go to sleep and the next thing you know i'll be standing over you, telling you we're through the nebula."
i'm leaving the ship in good hands. i have every confidence in both of you. see you in a month.
it's just the two of us now.
nutritional supplement fourteen beta seven.
"computer, adjust heading by point three four seven degrees starboard."
course adjusted.
seven of nine to the doctor.
go ahead.
lieutenant paris has left his stasis unit and is unconscious.
i'll be right there.
apparently he's more claustrophobic than i thought. but he doesn't seem to have suffered any ill effects.
is this likely to happen again?
it's not unheard of for people to come out of stasis and start wandering. leave it to mister paris to be just as much trouble now as when he's awake.
you knew this might happen. why complain about it?
"if you had even the slightest sense of humour, you'd realise i was making a small joke."
very small.
"give me his vital signs, please."
"pulse, forty two. body temperature, ninety seven point six. blood pressure one hundred over fifty."
good.
i will continue on my rounds.
i think not. we're paying a visit to the holodeck.
i have no time for frivolous pursuits.
this isn't frivolous. it's essential. you've been getting more irritable and short-tempered with each passing day.
so have you.
only because i'm having to put up with you. i think you need a little brush-up course in getting along with people.
there is no one here to get along with.
i'm here. this isn't a suggestion and it's not a request. it's an order.
"try one, commander."
"thank you, neelix."
captain?
"ooo, what have we here? delicious!"
"join the party, seven. it's no fun to stand there by yourself."
i have no desire to have fun.
no?
i am attempting to recalibrate the warp field in order to resist the nebula's radiation. i understand you have some knowledge of warp field theory. perhaps you could assist me.
"i'd be happy to give it a try. let's see, the subspace field matrix looks right."
captain.
excuse me.
perhaps you could help as well. we're attempting to find a stronger warp field calibration.
"how interesting. maybe if we vary the em stress parameters, the warp field dynamic would increase."
"excellent idea, captain. and if the warp coils were re-phased, it would increase power to the nacelles."
there is an additional problem. we must compensate for a subspace induction drag on the engines.
"pardon me, captain, mister neelix. computer, freeze programme. you're completely missing the point of this exercise. you're supposed to be mixing and mingling, not working on engineering problems."
you ordered me to participate in this programme. you did not specify topics of conversation.
you're splitting hairs. you know very well what purpose this programme is supposed to serve.
i find that it serves no purpose whatsoever.
because you're being intentionally perverse.
"holodecks are a pointless endeavour, fulfilling some human need to fantasise. i have no such need."
what you need is some editorial skill in your self-expression. between impulse and action there is a realm of good taste begging for your acquaintance.
i find your self-expression ponderous.
and i can't put up with this for another month.
we can arrange to avoid one another.
"i wish it were that simple. unfortunately, you have to report to me four times a day to keep me informed about the crew."
we can minimise those reports.
warning. emergency procedures in effect.
"computer, what is the nature of the emergency?"
the antimatterstorage tanks are failing.
"a cascade effect is in progress. the warp field coils are compromised, primary deuterium tank is rupturing, and plasma conduits are ready to breach."
this is awful.
we have to eject the antimatter tanks.
"we've got to coordinate the effort. you go to engineering, i'll go to the bridge."
doctor to seven.
"yes, doctor?"
it's worse than we thought.
engineering is flooded with plasma. you'll never get in.
i believe i can survive long enough to eject the assembly.
it's too late.
sensors show plasma conduits rupturing on decks seven and thirteen.
i can do it.
seven. there's been another plasma discharge in engineering. the hull is breaching. get out!
"seven, do you hear me?"
"it's all right, doctor. false alarm."
"look here. i think i've found the problem. there are malfunctions in a number of neural gel packs. as a result, false readings were fed to the sensors which detected an emergency when there was none."
we must repair them.
they seem to be in sequence six theta nine. we'll need replacement packs and a repair
repair kit.
these tubes certainly weren't designed with creature comfort in mind. it seems to me the shipbuilders should've created a space in which one can walk upright.
but they did not. it doesn't help to complain about it now.
i'll complain if i want to. it's comforting.
we can access sequence six theta nine from this junction.
odd. i've never seen this kind of neural activity in the gel packs.
in what sense?
the neurodes are discharging in random bursts. i would imagine the nebula activity is causing it. i'll this back to sickbay for further study.
i will reroute the command processors to bypass this series.
this journey certainly hasn't lacked excitement. i can't complain about being bored.
"since you find it comforting, you'll undoubtedly find something else to complain about."
no doubt. you really should try it.
what's happening?
my programme is degrading.
the mobile emitter?
i don't know. i have to get back to sickbay. hurry.
i am hurrying.
"if the mobile emitter goes offline while i'm out of sickbay, my programme may be irretrievable."
don't panic. it's counterproductive.
that's easy for you to say. you're not facing cybernetic oblivion.
doctor?
"if that happens again, i'm a goner."
ah! home sweet sickbay. i never thought i'd be so glad to see these walls.
give me the emitter. the electro-optic modulator is damaged.
"you're right, it's worthless. there's no way i can risk using it now. i'm stuck here."
the nebula is having a deleterious effect on all the ship's technology.
and we still have weeks to go. it's up to you to keep the ship running. we can't afford to break down in this nebula.
i won't disappoint you.
oh six hundred hours. regeneration sequence complete.
"personal log, seven of nine, stardate 51932.4. the twenty ninth day in the mutara nebula. i believe i'm beginning to feel the effects of this prolonged isolation. my dreams have been disturbing. but i'm determined to fulfil my responsibilities. with the doctor confined to sickbay, i have taken on increasing duties. ship's systems are beginning to require constant maintenance in order to avert disaster. this morning i must purge the auxiliary plasma vents. end log."
"computer, trim heading by point three one degrees port. computer, respond. computer, trim heading by point three one degrees port."

"six days, five hours."
six days.
seven. help.
proximity alert. vessel approaching. the vessel is hailing.
open a channel.
channel open.
this is the federation starship voyager. state your identity.
i'm trajis lo-tarik. i'm in need of a microfusion chamber. would you consider a trade?
why are you in this nebula?
"trying to get through it, as i imagine you are."
do you have liquid helium?
you're fortunate. i have an ample supply.
i'll beam you directly to our cargo bay.
seven of nine. that's an unusual name. how did you get it?
it was my borg designation.
borg? never heard of them. are you alone on this ship?
"no. the entire crew is here in stasis, and our doctor is in sickbay."
"i'm both pilot and crew on my ship. fortunately, i happen to be resistant to the effects of the nebula."
what about your technology? the radiation is causing damage to ours.
"i've had to rebuild my engines twice already. if you've been in the nebula for three weeks, you're doing well."
i am hopeful our propulsion system will remain operational for the next six days.
i'll admit i was surprised to find another ship headed toward me. no one has ever managed to cross the nebula.
"if it weren't necessary, we wouldn't be attempting it."
"i'm here by choice. i'm determined to be the first to get through. i've tried five times before and failed, but this time i'm sure i'll make it. i want to see what's on the other side."
it is nothing remarkable.
"but i'll be the first of my kind to see it. tell me, how are you handling the loneliness?"
what do you mean?
"you know what i mean. no matter what you say, you're all alone here."
the microfusion chamber you requested.
i've heard that drones can't stand being alone. they're too used to the collective.
how could you know that?
"it's true, isn't it?"
you said you'd never heard of the borg.
don't be offended. i've got no grudge with them.
you have what you asked for. now leave.
i thought we could keep each other company for a while. maybe have something to eat.
no.
and if i want to stay longer?
you will not be accommodated.
"there's no need for this, you know. i mean you no harm. i think maybe you're a little paranoid. that's what loneliness can do to you. you'd be a lot better off to spend some time with me. we could get to know each other."
quiet.
"seven, help me, seven."
seven of nine to the doctor. we have an intruder on board.
"he must have a cloaking device. sensors show no alien lifesigns and no evidence of a ship. i've been working on my mobile emitter. i think i'm making progress, but i still can't leave sickbay. you'll have to try to track him down. arm yourself and use extreme caution."
warning. deuterium tank levels are fluctuating beyond acceptable tolerances.
the computer sounds like it needs a stimulant.
it has been experiencing relay failures. i have not been performing my maintenance duties.
"do what you have to, but keep an eye out for the alien. we have to assume he's up to no good. seven? are you frightened?"
i am borg.
who's there?
"seven. help me, seven."
"i'm dying, seven. don't let me die."
the lives of the crew are on your shoulders.
"seven, help me."
"help, seven, i need help."
"we need you, seven."
assist us.
"i'm dying, seven."
"seven of nine. that's an unusual name. how did you get it? don't want to answer me? that's all right, i don't mind. i know you're not yourself today. but you might be interested in what i'm doing now. i know your sensors can't detect me. so if you want to know where i am, you'll have to ask. playing stubborn? that's a mistake. it could lead to an unfortunate accident. just to prove i'm willing to give you a fair chance, i'll ask you. what would happen if the structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed? you wouldn't have much time to keep them from rupturing."
i couldn't bring myself to destroy your ship. i hope you're not afraid of the dark.
where are you?
finally. i'm glad you're responding. it's going to be much more interesting if we play this game together.
your location.
"a long way from you. on the bridge. command centre of your ship, i believe. i can do just about anything from here."
"seven, help."
seven to trajis. are you still there?
of course. do you think i'd leave now?
i'm enjoying this game. what's next?
"that's better. well, let's just imagine that one of the photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected."
i would have to get to the torpedo bay quickly.
even then you might be too late. but of course you have to try.
let's play another game. let's imagine that the oxygen on the bridge has been depleted.
what?
"what do you suppose the results might be? computer, seal the bridge with a level three forcefield."
bridge sealed.
seven of nine to the doctor.
i'm here.
i have incapacitated the alien. he will not trouble us again.
good work. i have my mobile emitter back online.
where are you now?
in engineering.
i'll be right there. i have interesting news about the neural gel packs.
acknowledged.
in your heart you knew you'd see me again.
you can't defeat me. you're too weak.
don't come any closer.
"you couldn't stand being alone, could you? you felt vulnerable, afraid. because you know what you are."
stop.
"at first you thought you could become human, but now you know that's impossible, don't you? you're borg. that's what you were meant to be."
one of many. but your days of power are gone. you're alone now. weak. pathetic.
don't come any closer or i'll kill you.
seven?
"be careful, doctor, he's dangerous."
who are you talking to?
where did he go?
there's no one else here.
he was. he was right here.
"seven, you're hallucinating."
no. i saw him.
there was no one else in this room.
you mean i imagined him?
yes.
i heard lieutenant paris call for help. i saw him and the others. did i imagine them as well?
"i believe so. when i studied the gel pack, i discovered the radiation was producing a degradation in the synaptic relays. i'm guessing there's been a similar effect on your borg implants. the radiation could be altering the neurotransmitter levels in your sensory nodes. that would explain why you're hearing voices, seeing images."
they seemed real.
hallucinations usually are. that's what makes them so frightening.
"once, when i was a drone, i was separated from the collective for two hours. i experienced panic and apprehension. i am feeling that way now."
"i'll do everything i can to help you. we'll get you to sickbay. an antipsychotic may help, at least until i determine just what neural functions are being affected."
what was that?
warning. primary eps conduits are overloading.
i tied my mobile emitter into the eps conduits.
"computer, access the eps conduits."
unable to comply.
my programme's going offline.
no.
warning. primary eps conduits overloading. secondary systems are failing.
"seven, you've got to hang on. repair the eps conduits. everything depends on you now."
i cannot function alone.
you have to. you're the way we can survive
no!
display voyager's current position within the nebula.
it doesn't matter. you won't make it.
"computer, how long until voyager is out of the nebula?"
"seventeen hours, eleven minutes."
that's an eternity.
go away.
"you can try to shut me out, but it won't work."
warning. propulsion system failure in progress.
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. you have left the collective. it was a foolish decision. now you are alone. you have lost the many. you are only one. you have become human. weak. pathetic."
humans do not have our strength. they are imperfect. now you are imperfect as well.
no.
you will not survive. you cannot survive without the collective.
i will adapt.
by becoming weaker. less perfect.
i will adapt as an individual.
one. one alone. a borg cannot be one.
i will become stronger.
"a borg cannot be one. she will die as one. weak, detached, isolated, one borg cannot survive."
i am an individual. i will survive alone.
no. you are weak. you will die alone.
"he's right. you're in pain, seven. i can help you."
bridge.
you don't have to beg me. you don't even have to ask. all you have to do is make a choice.
i can survive alone.
that's home. that's where you belong.
no.
end your pain. just walk through that door and you'll never be alone again.
it's not real.
seven of nine. resistance is futile.
bridge.
seven of nine. you look a little worse for wear.
i didn't know she was still on board.
i never wanted her here in the first place.
she won't be here long. she can't survive alone.
i'm taking bets on how long she'll last.
she'll fall apart before we leave the nebula.
and then everybody will die.
"well, blame me. i put my trust in her. i should have known better."
warning. propulsion system failure in progress.
what is she doing now?
she's trying to keep the engines online.
place your bets. anyone think she can do it?
i'll lay odds she can't.
"computer, how long until the ship is out of the nebula?"
forty one minutes.
too long. she won't make it.
that's an eternity.
"computer, reroute available power from weapons, sensors and environmental controls to the engines."
warning. propulsion system failure in progress.
reroute all available power to the engines.
propulsion systems have failed. all engines are offline.
she's got herself a real problem now.
i'll say. she's taken power from every available system and it's still not enough.
"but if she fails to get this ship moving, everyone on board will die."
what do you think she'll do?
"i know what she's thinking. she's thinking if she could take power from the stasis units on deck fourteen, she might be able to get those engines back online."
but that would mean sacrificing some of the crew.
i don't think that would bother her too much.
"what matters to seven is efficiency. sacrificing a few to save many, would be an efficient plan."
she's already killed millions. would a few more matter?
"computer, divert power from stasis units one through ten and reroute to the propulsion systems."
engines are back online.
resume course.
look at that. she did it.
but those people she disconnected are going to die.
i win. i knew she didn't care about them.
come to watch them die?
warning. power to stasis units has failed.
"computer, how long to complete passage through the nebula?"
eleven minutes.
"they won't last that long. what do you do now, seven? it's all up to you."
"computer, cut life support to all decks and reroute available power to the stasis units."
"that will keep them alive, but what about you? no oxygen, no heat. goodbye, seven."
"i am seven of nine. i am alone, but i will adapt. i will"
she's coming to.
not so fast. get your bearings first.
the crew?
"we came through the nebula in fine shape, thanks to you."
"you were the one we almost lost. when the ship cleared the nebula, the doctor came back online and found you unconscious. he reinitiated life support and woke the crew."
he tells us you've had quite an adventure.
it was interesting.
"well, when you're rested, i'd like to hear about it."
"i'm proud of you, seven. you performed admirably."
i am glad i was able to help.
"neelix, this soup is great. what is it?"
it's my secret recipe. i've never told anyone what's in it.
why does that make me nervous?
"oh, come on, tom. where's your spirit of adventure?"
not in my stomach. food and mystery don't go together. i like to know what i'm eating.
coward.
lieutenants paris and torres. ensign kim.
seven. i'm surprised to see you here.
may i join you?
sure. have a seat.
have some soup. it's actually edible.
i don't require nourishment at this time. i felt the need for companionship.
"well, after a month with only the doc for company, i can understand it."
"yeah. what was that like, anyway, just the two of you?"
the doctor was quite helpful. i cannot fault him.
"well, we all owe you."
"yeah, just think, we could've died in those coffins."
"i suspect you would've found a way out before that, lieutenant."
what do you mean?
"lieutenant paris refused to stay confined. on four separate occasions, the doctor and i had to put him back into his stasis unit."
were you locked in dark closets or something as a child?
i just don't like closed places. i never have. i don't know why.
perhaps you dislike being alone.
full impact. final round to janeway. winner janeway.
good game.
for you.
"oh, come on, seven. you won four out of ten rounds. nothing to be ashamed of."
on the contrary. i have superior visual acuity and stamina. i should have won every round.
"well, velocity is more than a test of stamina. it's a game of wits."
"you are a frustrating opponent. during the final round, after you dropped your phaser, you did not look at the disk, and yet you were able to acquire the target."
intuition.
intuition is a human fallacy. the belief that you can predict random events.
"oh, belief had nothing to do with it. at some level, conscious or otherwise, i was aware of several factors. the trajectory of the disk after i hit the wall, the sound it made on its return, and the shadow it cast on the hologrid."
intriguing but implausible.
"i won, didn't i? thanks for the match."
i wish to play again.
not today.
you are fatigued and concerned that i will defeat you.
tired? yes. concerned? no.
"computer, begin first round."
"belay that command. seven, try to be a sport. game's over."
good morning.
what time is it?
oh five hundred.
"oh. well then, good morning."
i just heard from tom and neelix. they're about to leave the trading colony.
any luck?
"according to tom, the shuttle's so loaded down with supplies, he won't make half impulse. neelix is asking permission to bring one of the locals on board. he's been very helpful, and neelix wants to repay him by giving him passage to the next system."
permission granted.
you might want to grab some sleep. we've got a big day ahead.
i will in a while.
still hunting for buried treasure?
"we've found the treasure, i just can't pick the lock. i've tried over fifty decryption algorithms. every time i piece together a datablock, ten more come unravelled. what did starfleet send us? a map? the location of a wormhole? if i could decode this today, chakotay, we could be home tomorrow. then again, it could be admiral chapman's recipe for the perfect pound cake. i've been pinning our hopes on this message, but i'm starting to wonder."
"one way or another, we've got to find out. i'll talk to b'elanna. you could enlist seven of nine."
she should have a few borg algorithms up her sleeve. if she's in the mood.
problems?
"i don't know if she's getting restless or if it's just me, but we're butting heads more than usual lately. she seems to challenge everything i say."
she's learned a lot from you over the last year. maybe the pupil thinks she's outgrowing the mentor.
"maybe. well, this mentor would like another cup of coffee. will you join me?"
love to.
this goes to engineering. sickbay. storage.
i hope that's not going to the mess hall.
i don't remember what this is. neelix!
"captain, this man is a genius. i was trying to negotiate with a xenon-based lifeform when the universal translator went offline. arturis here stepped in and acted as a perfect go-between, and he'd never heard either of our languages."
"oh, they were simple. no insult intended."
neelix!
on my way. if you two will excuse me.
"well, welcome to voyager. we may be a linguistically simple folk but we're happy to give you a ride. let's see if we can find you some quarters."
neelix was right. voyager is a welcoming place.
"well, we do our best."
i can't say i've ever met a living universal translator.
my people have a way with languages. i myself know over four thousand.
and to think i still struggle with basic klingon. you couldn't have heard neelix say more than a few phrases.
it was all i needed. it was enough to grasp the grammar and syntax.
impressive.
"not really. it's a natural ability. some species are born with great physical prowess. others, like yours, with a generosity of spirit. my people can see patterns where others see only confusion. is something wrong?"
"no. tell me, how are you at computational languages? algorithms, trinary syntax?"
it's all the same to me.
i was wondering if you might do us another favour.
"you weren't exaggerating, captain. this datastream is badly damaged. i'd like to see the entire transmission again. are you borg?"
yes.
you're much more attractive than the average drone.
i am no longer part of the collective.
"i see, i see. i think i see the problem. may i?"
please.
have you encountered his people before?
species one one six.
is that what you call us?
yes. the borg has never been able to assimilate them. not yet.
seven.
"oh, it's all right, captain. the borg collective is like a force of nature. you don't feel anger toward a storm on the horizon, you just avoid it. ah. here it is. it's a simple matter of extracting the iconometric elements, and triaxilating a recursion matrix."
now why didn't i think of that?
"there's a great deal of information here, captain. i think it might be useful to utilise the other monitors."
you've done it.
"almost. i've reconstructed over sixty eight kiloquads of information, but a lot of it is still garbled."
what about that datablock. fourteen beta?
that part of the message is too degraded to recover.
"captain, i've found a spatial grid."
they've marked a set of coordinates. it's less than ten light years from here.
maybe starfleet wants us to proceed to that location.
maybe. there's only one way to find out.
we're approaching the coordinates.
take us out of warp. scan the vicinity.
i am picking up a vessel.
on screen.
identify.
"unless i am mistaken, captain, the warp signature is starfleet."
i'll be damned. they came through.
tuvok.
hailing them. no response.
lifesigns?
there is no organic matter of any kind.
no sign of damage to the outer hull. primary systems are online including life support. something must have happened to the crew.
the answer is somewhere in that starfleet transmission. we need to finish decoding it. may i call on your talents again?
of course.
take an away team. secure the vessel.
tom. tuvok.
"captain. i won't pretend to know you well, but i am surprised you're not more encouraged by this discovery."
"i've learned to walk the line between hope and caution. we've had other opportunities that didn't work out. but i will admit, i'm leaning toward hope this time."
wow.
wow indeed.
i've never seen this kind of hull geometry. looks like they've taken a whole new approach to starship design.
uss dauntless. registry nx-01a. launch date 51472.
sixty thousand light years in three months?
i'm trying to access the crew logs but there are none.
i don't think there was a crew. this helm was set for auto-navigation to these coordinates.
it appears that starfleet has provided us with a new ship.
let's not pack our bags just yet. i'd like to know how they
"i'm reading power fluctuations in the warp core, if you can call it a warp core. i don't recognise this engine configuration."
let's go take a look.
i think we've found our engine core.
some kind of new warp drive?
"it's not antimatter, it's, i don't know what it is."
they call this thing a quantum slipstream drive.
quantum slipstream.
i've never seen that in the engineering manuals.
the ship's powering up. auto-navigation is kicking in.
bridge to janeway. the vessel's moving away at high impulse.
i can't raise the away team.
"pursuit course, ensign."
i can't shut down the drive.
"computer, disable propulsion."
unable to comply.
hang on.
bridge to janeway. they're gone.
look at this. energy from the quantum drive is being routed through the main deflector.
is that what's creating the slipstream?
it looks that way.
fascinating. can you make it stop?
i'll try accessing helm controls. we're back in normal space.
scan for voyager.
"no sign of them. commander, we've travelled over fifteen light years."
"slipstream technology is experimental and high risk, but it's come a long way in the past year. we've conducted forty seven trial runs, all of them successful. but each flight lasted only five days. in order to reach earth, you'd have to remain at slipstream velocities for a full three months. can your crew survive that long? we believe they can, and we encourage you to try. everything you'll need is on the dauntless. power cells, supplies, living quarters. safe journey. we hope to see you soon."
"admiral hayes. good man, fine officer, bit of a windbag. let's talk about the risk. doctor?"
i've examined the away team for signs of cell damage or physiological stress. nothing. their little joyride didn't harm them in the slightest.
long term effects?
"i'm running medical projections right now. so far, the results are encouraging."
and the dauntless itself?
"i'd say it's in pretty good shape, considering."
"i've been looking over the primary systems. helm, ops, tactical, they're comparable to voyager's. but it's a lean ship, captain. no shuttlecraft, only one transporter, no holodecks, no replicators."
"well, mister neelix, you may have your work cut out for you."
"ready and willing, captain."
so what are we waiting for?
your enthusiasm is premature. voyager is a proven vessel. it would be reckless to abandon it so quickly.
"come on, where's that borg spirit? we'll adapt."
my borg spirit gives me an objectivity you lack.
she has a point. this would mean leaving voyager behind.
is there any way we could modify voyager to create a slipstream?
"in theory, but i don't think the ship would hold up very long under the quantum stresses."
"try to make the modifications. if there's a way we can bring voyager along for the ride, i'm all for it. harry, b'elanna, i want you to take an engineering team down to the dauntless. start working on a way to shut down the slipstream drive at a moment's notice."
"aye, captain."
"once we have that safeguard in place, we can start making the test flights. i want this entire crew to familiarise themselves with that ship. see to it. dismissed. tuvok. big day."
indeed.
a way home. we'vewaited for this moment for years. why don't i feel more enthusiastic?
perhaps my mental discipline is rubbing off on you.
perhaps. what do you think about this little miracle of ours?
i share your concern about the crew's safety. we must take every precaution.
somehow i don't think standard diagnostics and security protocols are going to make me feel any better.
captain?
all of this is just a little too perfect. the alien genius with the answers to all our problems. a message from starfleet telling us everything we want to hear. a starship delivered right to our doorstep. what more could we ask for? they even turned down the beds. the only thing missing was chocolates on the pillows.
it does seem convenient.
"i can't put my finger on it, but from the moment this all started i sensed something was wrong."
it started when arturis boarded voyager.
"exactly. we'll proceed as planned, but i want you to investigate that ship from stem to stern. keep an eye on our guest. see if you can find out more about him."
understood.
let's hope we're just suffering from some good old-fashioned paranoia. keep me posted.
initiate emergency shutdown on my mark. now.
quantum field strength down to ninety percent. eighty percent. it's levelling off at seventyfive.
we need to dampen the field by at least fifty percent.
try reversing the quantum field polarities.
seventy percent. fifty five. forty nine percent.
we did it. we've got our safety net.
one step closer to home.
tuvok wants us to run a metallurgical analysis of the bulkheads to look for anything unusual.
thank you. you two run the analysis. i'll be on the bridge with arturis. our resident genius said he'd help me figure out how to use the control sequencers.
"lieutenant, you seem eager to return to earth."
eager? i wouldn't go that far.
you were a member of the maquis. starfleet command will no doubt hold you responsible for a multitude of crimes. you will find nothing on earth but adversity.
that's looking on the bright side. let's put it this way. i'd rather face the music back home than spend the rest of my life in the delta quadrant. what about you? looking forward to seeing earth?
no.
"i'm not surprised. you think people are going to resent an ex-maquis? what about an ex-drone? we'll be outcasts together. i'm kidding, seven. it's a joke. work on that sense of humour. it'll help you make friends on earth."
"seven, can you give me a hand down here? i'm picking up an anomalous energy surge."
there are no power conduits running through this section.
"believe me, seven, one look at that big blue marble, and you'll fall in love. it's got just about every ecosystem you can think of, and hundreds of different humanoid species live there. bolians, vulcans, ktarians. if you like ktarians. and there are several other planets to choose from."
"if you will excuse me, ensign, i must speak to the captain."
"seven. for what's it worth, it won't be the same without you."
kim to tuvok.
tuvok here.
"i'm on the dauntless, in the engine room, andi've found something"
that qualifies as unusual.
i'll be right there.
"computer, display datablock fourteen beta, auxiliary display."
"seven, i could use your help. i'm trying to reconstruct the last fragment of the starfleet message."
arturis said it was irreparably damaged.
"i know, but i think he gave up too easily."
intuition?
it's intuition if i'm right. i've designed a new decryption algorithm. let's give it a try.
captain. i will not be going with you to the alpha quadrant.
i can understand your reluctance. it's been hard enough dealing with a crew of a hundred and fifty individual humans. the prospect of an entire planet must be overwhelming.
i am not overwhelmed. i simply do not wish to live among humans.
"well, whether you like it or not, you're one of us. you've come a long way from that drone who stepped out of a borg alcove nine months ago. don't turn your back on humanity now. not when you're about to take your biggest step. earth. your home."
"i may have come a long way, but not in the direction you think. you've attempted to influence my development. you exposed me to your culture, you ideals. you hoped to shape me in your own image. but you have failed. you may have noticed our tendency to disagree."
"oh, i've noticed."
then you must also recognise that i do not share your values. your desire to explore space is inefficient. your need for familial connections is a weakness. your infatuation with this planet is irrational.
"i won't argue that you've turned out differently than i expected, and that we often have conflicting points of view. but right now, the stakes are higher. this crew needs your expertise. abandon them and you diminish their chances of getting home."
irrelevant.
"no, it's not. we've given you a lot, seven. it's time you gave something in return."
"i have, on many occasions. now i refuse."
"what would you do, go back to the collective?"
i don't know.
then what exactly do you have in mind?
i don't know.
that's my point. you're asking me to cast you adrift in the delta quadrant alone and without support. i wouldn't grant that request to any member of this crew because it's too dangerous.
i will survive.
"on what, borg perfection?"
precisely.
i don't buy it. this isn't about your independence or your superiority. this is about your fear. you're not making this choice because you've outgrown humanity. i think you're afraid to go back to earth.
"the algorithm's working. it's reconstructing the datablock. that's strange, i thought we already recovered this part of the message."
perhaps it is an addendum from the admiral. you did designate him a windbag.
"oh, i don't think so. the data index doesn't match. this is a completely different message."
"apologies from everyone at starfleet command. we've had our best people working around the clock, trying to find a wormhole, a new means of propulsion, anything to get you home. but despite our best efforts. i know it's not what you were hoping, but we've sent you all the data we've collected on the delta quadrant. with any luck, you'll find at least some part of it useful. maybe enough to shave a few years off your journey. safe journey. we hope to see you soon."
your intuition was correct.
unfortunately.
arturis must have created a false message.
it sure as hell looks that way. janeway to tuvok.
"yes, captain."
my suspicions have been confirmed.
arturis tampered with starfleet's message.
the dauntless isn't what it appears to be.
i agree. we've discovered alien technologybehind a bulkhead
in engineering. i can't identify it.
where's arturis now?
"on the dauntless bridge, working with lieutenant torres."
"go to the bridge, but don't tip our hand."
i'll be there with a full security team within minutes.
understood.
let's get weapons.
don't touch that! you almost kicked us into slipstream drive.
oh. i wouldn't want to do that. kucha merah.
no problem. you speak klingon.
i do now. your captain was kind enough to let me review your linguistic database.
i only know speak a few phrases myself.
"oh, shame. it's a robust language."
a little too robust for me.
evacuate the repair teams.
captain?
do it. explain yourself.
i don't know what you're talking about.
you fabricated the message from starfleet. i recovered the real transmission. the one you said was irreparably damaged.
that's absurd.
starfleet didn't send us this vessel and you're not here to help. is this your ship?
"please, stay calm, there must be an explanation."
"i tried to ignore my gut feelings, because i got carried away by the excitement of getting home. but you preyed on that, didn't you? you took advantage of our hopes and now i want to know why."
"i believe that there is a threat here, captain, but not from me. i didn't feel it was my place to make accusations, but i saw her reconfigure several key algorithms two days ago in your astrometrics lab, and it seemed obvious. she must have been tampering with the starfleet message."
you are lying.
"she's been sabotaging your every effort to reach earth. you don't have to believe me, captain. you can find all the evidence you need in her personal database."
evidence you undoubtedly put there yourself just in case you got caught. take him to voyager. throw him the brig.
janeway to voyager. beam us out of here.
he's trying to deflect our transporters. stand by.
i've got everyone but seven and the captain. he's found a way to block their transport.
the ship's going into slipstream mode.
pursuit course.
"we lost them, commander."
"tom, bring the warp core modifications online. we're going after them."
"sir, we haven't even had a trial run yet."
there's no time like the present.
where are you taking us?
home.
how'd you create the starfleet bridge? holograms?
particle synthesis. beyond your understanding.
is this what your people do? prey on innocent ships?
innocent? typical of captain janeway. self-righteous.
"if i've offended you or your people in some way, please tell me."
"diplomacy, captain? your diplomacy destroyed my world."
what? what are you saying?
"you negotiated an agreement with the borg collective. safe passage through their space. and in return, you helped them defeat one of their enemies."
species eight four seven two.
"in your colourful language, yes. species eight four seven two. did it ever occur to you that there were those of us in the delta quadrant who had a vested interest in that war? victory would have meant the annihilation of the borg, but you couldn't see beyond the bow of your own ship!"
"in my estimation, species eight four seven two posed a greater threat than the borg."
who are you to make that decision? a stranger to this quadrant.
there wasn't exactly time to take a poll. i had to act quickly.
"my people managed to elude the borg for centuries. outwitting them, always one step ahead. but in recent years, the borg began to weaken our defences. they were closing in and species eight four seven two was our last hope to defeat them. you took that away from us! the outer colonies were the first to fall. twenty three in a matter of hours. our sentry vessels tossed aside, no defence against the storm. by the time they'd surrounded our star system, hundreds of cubes, we had already surrendered to our own terror. a few of us managed to survive. ten, twenty thousand. i was fortunate. i escaped with a vessel. alone, but alive. i don't blame them. they were just drones, acting with their collective instinct. you, you had a choice!"
"i'm sorry for what happened to your people, but try to understand. i couldn't have known."
"it took me months to find you. i watched and waited for my opportunity to make you pay for what you'd done. then the starfleet message, and i knew that your selfish desire to get home would surface again. that i could lure you to this vessel. that i could see to it that you'd all be assimilated and spend the rest of eternity as borg. i was hoping to get your entire crew, but i'll settle for the two of you. in a matter of hours, this ship will return to my homeworld. inside borg space."
"when that happens, you will be assimilated as well."
"that's irrelevant. this is what you wanted all along, isn't it? to go back to your collective? you should thank me."
report.
"we're at full impulse, but we're not breaking through the quantum barrier."
i'm having trouble controlling the field parameters. i need more power to the deflector.
bridge to torres.
"i'm already on it, commander."
stand by. reroute auxiliary power to deflector control. make sure that quantum warp field is stable.
"aye, lieutenant."
deflector at maximum. i'm focusing the quantum field.
make it quick. hull temperature's at critical.
we're at slipstream velocity.
structural integrity's down by nine percent. we've got less than an hour before the hull starts to buckle.
i've located their slipstream. i'm aligning ours to match. we're right behind them.
how far behind?
just a few minutes.
is there any way to increase our speed?
none. we're at maximum.
"maintain course. if i know the captain, she's already got a plan."
any ideas?
not presently.
"we'd better think of something. we come face to face with your former family in less than an hour, and that's one reunion i'd like to miss. unless of course, you're looking forward to rejoining the collective?"
i do not believe i am.
"not the ringing opposition i was hoping for, but i'll take it. a drone could walk through this forcefield like it was thin air. is there enough borg technology left in your body to let it adapt?"
"if i activate the appropriate nanoprobes, i could alter my bio-electric field. however, i would need to adjust my cranial implant."
would a micro-filament do the trick?
it might.
"then let's get you one. once you get outside, access that control panel and disable the forcefield. then we'll try to reach the engine room."
and employ the emergency shutdown procedure.
sufficient. you will need to cross-link the third and sixth nodules.
déjà-vu.
captain?
"as i recall, this is where our relationship began. in a brig, nine months ago. i severed you from the collective and you weren't exactly happy about it."
"no, i was not."
"in case i never get a chance to say this, i realise that i've been hard on you at times. but it was never out of anger, or regret that i brought you on board. i'm your captain. that means i can't always be your friend. understand?"
"no. however, if we are assimilated, our thoughts will become one, and i'm sure i will understand perfectly. a joke, captain. you yourself have encouraged me to use my sense of humour."
it's nice to know you've taken some of my advice to heart.
"you were correct. my desire to remain in the delta quadrant was based on fear. i am no longer borg, but the prospect of becoming human is unsettling. i don't know where i belong."
you belong with us.
the adaptations are complete.
we're in business.
i can't initiate the emergency shutdown.
our commands are being blocked from the bridge. he's detected us.
"the ship's velocity has just increased. at our present speed, we will enter borg space in less than twelve minutes."
do we still have access to the power distribution grid?
yes.
"if we can't throw on the brakes, let's swerve the wheel. send a power surge into the starboard thrusters."
the torsional stress at these speeds could tear the ship apart.
"it's either that or join the hive. do it. if we're still in one piece, try to gain control of navigation. i'll be on the bridge. we have a game of velocity scheduled for tomorrow, holodeck one. i expect you to keep the appointment."
"aye, captain."
sorry about the bumpy ride.
"you can slow this ship down, but you can't stop it. in four minutes, captain janeway will be gone and a new drone will be born."
"don't count on it. seven of nine has accessed your navigational systems. you taught us how to use this ship a little too well. i can't begin to imagine your loss, but try to see beyond your desire for revenge."
revenge is all i have left.
"no. as long you're alive there's hope. your people's accomplishments, their knowledge, their dignity, can survive in you. end this."
i've just destroyed the navigational controls. no one can stop this ship now. not even me. two minutes to borg space.
direct hit. the vessel's shields are down. transporters standing by.
get a lock on our people.
voyager.
come with me. it's not too late.
it is for you.
"i've got them, commander, transporter room two."
alter our slipstream. hard starboard. take us back the way we came.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
"full impact. final round to janeway. winner, janeway."
nice play. you almost had me.
almost.
go again?
i must report to the astrometrics lab. there is work to be done.
"work? i gave the crew strict orders to take some r and r over the next few days, and that includes you."
there are more pressing needs. i am attempting to design another method of travelling at slipstream velocities without damaging voyager.
i thought that was impossible.
impossible is a word that humans use far too often. i wish to continue my efforts.
"a few days ago you were ready to abandon ship, and here you are, practically laying in a course to earth."
as we approached borg space i began to re-evaluate my future. the prospect of becoming a drone was unappealing.
sometimes you've got to look back in order to move forward. sounds to me like you're starting to embrace your humanity.
"no. but as i said, nothing is impossible."
computer. one more game.
"citizens of earth! your destiny is in my hands. those of you who acquiesce to my demands will be treated fairly. oppose me, and you face a dire fate indeed as my slaves in the mines of mercury! you have one hour."
you'll never get away with this.
"oh, but i shall. your once proud country will fall to its knees. how ironic that i am using your rocket ship to lead my space force into battle!."
"you're wrong, chaotica. before you came on board, someone pushed the self-destruct button. in three minutes, we'll all be dead."
no!
"the jig is up, your majesty."
captain proton.
"spaceman first class, protector of earth, scourge of intergalactic evil, at your service."
but i saw you fall into the fiery mouth of that volcano.
"it takes more than a little lava to stop captain proton. now, i want you to call off your invasion and give me back my rocket ship."
there is one force in this universe that even you cannot defeat.
the same to you.
doc.
mister paris. i should have known it was you monopolising the holodeck.
who is this insolent fool?
"he's one of our men. computer, adjust the doctor's spectral frequency."
i have no interest in your frivolous fantasy. i'm here to rehearse a duet from don carlo and you've already gone three minutes into my scheduled
"enough! robot, attack!"
destroy them. start with him.
"computer, freeze programme."
"doc, this is the final chapter. satan's robot conquers the world. we can't stop now."
does the phrase to be continued mean anything to you?
your opera can wait.
this programme is a waste of photonic energy.
"oh, really. take a look around you. this is how the twentieth century saw the future. we are studying sociology."
perhaps you can teach a course at starfleet academy. satan's robot - an historical overview.
bridge to holodeck one. what's going on down there?
"oh, nothing, commander. just a little power surge."
says here the hologrid just blew out.
"we're fixing it now, sir."
"well, make it quick. the last thing we need is a broken holodeck."
"seven, i want good news. that's an order."
then i must disobey. i have no good news to report. i've completed an astrometric scan of the entire region. there are no star systems within twenty five hundred light years.
nothing?
nothing.
why can't we see stars beyond that?
there are heavy concentrations of theta radiation. it has occluded our sensors.
any other ships out there?
none. we are alone.
every sailor's nightmare.
commander.?
it's like being becalmed in the middle of the ocean. if it weren't for sensors we wouldn't even know we were at warp. we've only been crossing this expanse for two months and we're already feeling the strain. how do we last another two years?
we will adapt.
easier said than done.
shall i inform the captain of my findings?
no. i'll tell her.
this won't be much of a briefing. there's nothing new to report.
humour me.
"all right, let's see. warp core's at peak efficiency, just like last week, and the week before that. and my engineering staff is going stir crazy."
thanks. ensign.
nada.
can you be more specific?
all systems are operating within normal parameters.
anything new on sensors?
i've detected a sudden increase in theta radiation in the vicinity.
source?
unknown.
could be worth a look.
finally some excitement. radiation.
next piece of business. crew morale.
"deteriorating, obviously."
i have a few suggestions that might boost people's spirits.
please.
rotate crew assignments. add variety to the daily routine. i myself wouldn't mind squeezing in a little tactical training.
noted.
and the holodecks have been in high demand. i was thinking we could install a few emitters in cargo bay two. turn it into a third holodeck.
"hear, hear."
"see to it, harry."
"one other item, sir. a point of er, concern among some of the crew. it's, well, it's the captain. she's been a bit elusive lately."
what's your point?
"people take comfort in talking to her. when they see that the captain's happy, they're happy."
rumour has it she never leaves her quarters.
captain's privilege. she'll come to the bridge if and when she's needed.
"spare us the protocol, chakotay. it's pretty odd, you've got to admit it."
it's her choice. she can run this ship from wherever the hell she wants to. understood?
yeah. sure.
"we're all feeling the pressure, including me."
"listen, maybe we've got the wrong attitude. let's think of this as a two year vacation."
dismissed.
"that's a great idea, harry."
"wow, harry. you're a real genius. how do you come up with these brilliant ideas?"
you're such an optimistic guy.
"computer, lights! maximum level! bergamot tea, hot. first thing in the morning i replicate some curtains."
predictable. the novokavich gambit. you always use that opening move.
that's because you always fall for it.
i feel like we've played this match a hundred times.
derada is a game of subtlety.
too subtle for me.
hmm. i'll bet.
what's that supposed to mean?
"well, if it doesn't involve klingon pain sticks."
good night.
"there you go, just when i'm winning. who's predictable?"
you don't want to start a fight with me now. not at three a.m.
"three in the morning, four in the afternoon. what's the difference? you're angry twenty four hours a day."
everything is a joke to you.
good evening. or should i say good morning? guess you couldn't sleep either.
"oh, why sleep when we're having so much fun."
"he's joking, neelix. we're all supposed to laugh."
"i certainly am laughing, on the inside. smiling, anyway. let's start a new game. cards? maybe a little snack?"
"no. i have a better idea. why don't we make a schedule. a fight rotation. we can optimise our resources. i can start one, then you can start one."
please.
i am really tired of these games.
"well then, don't play them."
stop! you are senior officers! you are you are supposed to be setting an example for the rest. the rest of the crew.
neelix?
paris to sickbay.
some morale officer i turned out to be.
"i've given you a mild sedative. it should control the urge to hyperventilate, and alleviate some of your anxiety."
anxiety? anxiety's what i feel when i burn a pot roast. this. this is more like.
dizziness? nausea? unspeakable dread?
yes.
"nihiliphobia. the fear of nothingness. or in layman's terms, the fear of nothingness. if it's any consolation, i can relate to it. i go into a void every time i'm deactivated. emptiness, complete and utter oblivion. i'll admit it was unsettling at first. the existential horror of it all."
"you're not helping, doctor."
"sorry. my point is, you'll get used to it."
i hope so.
commander. am i disturbing you.
no.
is the astrometrics lab designated for recreational use?
"i come here to meditate. needless to say, the view from my quarters has been less than stellar lately."
astronomical phenomena help you to focus your mind.
yes. i imagine that each star represents a single thought.
meditation. it rejuvenates you?
indeed it does.
i suggest you try borg regeneration. it's much more efficient. a simple cortical implant would be required.
"another time, perhaps."
what is it?
long range sensors are detecting more theta radiation. dangerously high levels.
source?
unknown.
it's probably nothing. just background theta radiation. but it could mean there's someone nearby.
distance?
approximately twenty five light years.
"it's a long shot, but alter course."
"yes, ma'am."
"if that's all, commander."
"actually, i'd like to make a request. i've been saving up my holodeck rations and i've got three full hours coming. any chance i might persuade you to join me for a few rounds of velocity? it'll help clear your mind."
my mind is perfectly clear.
and what if i told you i'm not leaving until you join me?
"i'd say, have a seat, it'll be a while."
"then i'll be blunt. you've picked a bad time to isolate yourself from the crew. this ship needs a captain, especially now."
"would you be satisfied with i'm just catching up on some reading? i'm not sure i understand it myself. it started when we entered this, what does the crew call it?"
the void.
"charming. oh, what i wouldn't give for a few borg cubes about now. anything for a little distraction. strange as it sounds, i almost long for the days when we were under constant attack. no time to stop and think about how we got stranded in the delta quadrant. how did we end up here, chakotay? answer me."
"we were faced with a difficult choice. we had the means to get home but using it would've put an innocent people at risk, so we decided to stay."
"no. no, no. i decided to stay. i made that choice for everyone."
"we're alive and well, and we've gathered enough data about this quadrant to keep starfleet scientists busy for decades. our mission's been a success."
"the very same words i've been telling myself for the past four years. but then we hit this void, and i started to realise how empty those words sound."
kathryn.
"i made an error in judgment, chakotay. it was short-sighted and it was selfish, and now all of us are paying for my mistake. so if you don't mind, commander, i'll pass on that little game. and i'll leave shipboard morale in your capable hands. if the crew asks for me, tell them the captain sends her regards."
sir.
"relax, ensign. anything to report?"
not even a stray electron. but i did finish writing my concerto. i call it 'echoes of the void.' got a minute?
"too many, in fact."
tell me what you think.
"now, when we last saw our heroes, they had just retaken their rocket ship. doctor chaotica had escaped, but he left behind his trusty robot to foil captain proton."
my designation?
"ah, right. you're constance goodheart. you're my secretary."
secretary.
"yeah, you tag along on all the missions. now, i want you to keep the robot occupied while i save earth. computer, run programme."
"citizen of earth, surrender! do not resist!"
i am borg.
surrender.
the robot has been neutralised. may i leave now?
"come on, seven. give it a chance. the galaxy's at stake."
we've dropped out of warp. we're losing power.
switch to auxiliary.
no effect.
"i was hoping for a change of pace, but a blackout isn't exactly what i had in mind. i'll try tapping into the energy reserves."
double check the radio relays.
get inside those plasma injectors. infuse them manually if you have to.
lieutenant.
just a second. i'm not sure how to work this thing.
"captain protein to the rescue! it's not exactly starfleet issue. a ship-wide power loss? everything's offline, main power, auxiliary."
"independent subsystems are operational. environmental controls, holodecks. reroute power from this holodeck to the emergency relays."
"yes, ma'am. no luck. the hologrid is frozen."
neelix.
don't mind me.
there's been a power loss. nothing to worry about.
who's worried?
come on. take deep breaths nice and slow. that's it.
bingo. we've got partial sensors. i've found the cause of our power drain. it's some kind of dampening field. the source is off the port bow. that's about all i can tell you.
on screen. do we have the power to launch a photon torpedo?
"maybe one, why?"
perhaps we could shed some light on our predicament. i'm reconfiguring the torpedo to emit a sustained polyluminous burst.
a warp flare.
precisely.
i need something to pry open this hatch.
"computer, disengage safety protocols!"
"i saw something, over there. i'm telling you, i saw something. i may be nihiliphobic but my eyes work just fine. i can hear breathing."
follow me.
"yes, ma'am."
torpedo reconfigured. away.
i can barely see the injector ports. how about a little light over here?
we can do better than that. this power cell should be enough to get emergency power back online.
up here. we'll hook it up directly to the eps manifold.
emergency power just came back. we've got tactical.
raising shields.
the warp core's online.
"janeway to bridge, report."
"the dampening field has been blocked, captain. we are surrounded by three alien vessels."
seventeen intruders are on board.
the ships aren't responding to hails.
we do have weapons online.
"tuvok, target the ship off our port bow. fire a few warning shots."
shields down to sixty four percent.
do we have propulsion?
not yet.
he was attacked by an intruder.
these burns are severe.
i disabled the alien. it may still be alive.
bring it to sickbay.
shields are down.
they're reinitialising the dampening field. we're losing power.
not again.
they've stopped their attack. they're beaming off the ship.
there's another vessel approaching.
we're being hailed.
on screen. i'm lieutenant commander tuvok of the federation.
i had to fire thirteen spatial charges to drive those ships off. i expect to be compensated.
of course.
"now tell me, what are you doing in the middle of nowhere?"
the biofilters are detecting high levels of theta radiation.
compensate. welcome aboard. i'm afraid we'll have to talk here. you appear to be leaking.
"yes, yes, my isolation suit. don't be alarmed."
"we prefer to be on the safe side, mister?"
"emck. controller emck. malon export vessel, eleventh gradient."
"it's a pleasure to meet you, and a relief."
"i'd advise you to turn around immediately. there are more of those creatures ahead, thousands of vessels. they're almost impossible to detect. you won't survive another attack."
we can't go back. we're crossing this expanse to reach our home.
"then, er, it appears you'll be coming with me."
what do you mean?
there's a spatial vortex a few light years from here. it leads directly to the other side of the expanse. we've been using it for years.
"that would get us out of the void, and cut two years off our journey home."
"well, thank you again. i'm curious, mister emck. what are you doing here, besides rescuing starships in distress?"
"ah, i'm on a transport mission. my sensors tell me that one of the creatures is still aboard your ship."
it was injured during the attack. our doctor's treating it.
why?
enough questions. give me the creature and i'll take you to the vortex.
"oh, my apologies, mister emck, but i'd like to know what's going on here. are you at war with these beings?"
none of your concern.
"your vessel seems to be leaking large amounts of theta radiation. what kind of transport mission are you on, exactly?"
my ship will depart in two hours. cooperate or stay behind. i won't be coming to your rescue when the creatures return. i'm finished here.
i think it's time we heard the other side of the story.
"watch your step, i've had to lower the lights. my patient is extremely photosensitive."
that could explain why they dampened our power.
my feelings exactly. from what i can tell this life form may be indigenous to the void. his physiology has evolved to survive in complete darkness.
his condition?
"minor injuries. phaser wounds to the chest and neck. but that's the least of his problems. he's dying, captain. every organ is degrading at the cellular level."
theta radiation poisoning.
the final stages. my guess is he's been exposed to it over a long period. there's nothing i can do.
"i'd like a word with him. i'm kathryn janeway, captain of this vessel."
you are allied with the malon.
no. we're simply trying to cross this region. we never met the malon before today.
they will want me.
"well, i have no intention of giving you to them. you're not a captive here. doctor. are you at war with the malon?"
their ships are poison.
the theta radiation.
they're killing us.
why? what do they want from you?
nothing.
this will help alleviate the pain.
i don't understand.
we were ignorant. we attacked you. forgive us.
of course. but i need to understand. you say the malon are killing your people. there must be a reason.
they're poisoning our space. we don't know why.
he's in respiratory distress. we need to get him back to his people. they might know how to treat him.
i will show you how.
"i need a workstation. route it to the helm. if you enter the coordinates, my pilot will set a course."
i am grateful.
take the bridge. i'll stay here.
we still don't have a defence against their dampening field. if they decide to attach again.
"i'm confident they won't. finally, something to put in my logbook."
tuvok.
i need your advice.
a first.
"look, i realise we're not exactly best friends. from day one, we've kept each other at arm's length. but i've always respected your judgment and right now, i could use a little vulcan clarity."
proceed.
"it's the captain. as you may have noticed, she's isolated herself from the crew."
she believes that she made an error in judgment four years ago. that she's responsible for stranding voyager in the delta quadrant.
she told you?
no. i've been observing her behaviour for the past four years. guilt has been her constant companion.
you've known her longer than anyone. have you ever seen her like this?
only once. it was during her first year as a commander on the uss billings. she sent an away team to survey a volcanic moon. their shuttle was damaged by a magma eruption and three crew members were severely injured. the next day she returned to the moon alone to complete the survey. she wanted the crew to know that their suffering had not been in vain. she could have been killed.
seeking redemption.
"precisely. captain janeway's methods are unorthodox. it is her strength as a leader, but unfortunately, it is also her greatest weakness."
stubborn as a klingon.
to put it mildly.
if she tries something like that again i want to be ready and i'm going to need your support.
we're at the coordinates.
all stop. shields up. tuvok.
nothing on sensors.
bridge to captain.
we've arrived.
stand by.
"they're here, but i must tell them you are a friend. your communications system?"
i'm picking up photonic surges. they're all around us.
"captain, we've got company. eight ships, twelve more approaching."
let's run a full bioscan.
"we have lived here for millions of years, undisturbed until the malon came."
"captain, every one of them seems to be suffering from theta radiation exposure."
we tell them they are killing us. they won't listen. we tried to stop them. they're too strong!
"what about the vortex? can you close it, keep them out?"
"we don't know how. your ship is powerful, your people resourceful. we need your help."
bridge to captain. they're locking onto the alien in sickbay.
lower the shields.
will you help us?
poison.
the vessel is ejecting massive quantities of contaminated antimatter.
their cargo holds are loaded with it. over ninety million isotons.
hail them.
captain. you've decided to join us. send the creature to my
that won't be possible. we've returned him to his people. you wanted the lifeform because you were afraid we'd uncover your transport mission.
i said this was none of your concern.
"well, it is now. you're using their space as a dumping ground for your antimatter waste. why?"
my civilisation produces over six billion isotons of industrial by-product every day. this region is a perfect disposal site.
"how convenient, for you. a spatial vortex to the middle of nowhere, far away from your own system. out of sight, out of mind. problem is, somebody lives here."
one species.
one's enough. we didn't come here to debate the issue. we came here to offer a peaceful solution.
what kind of solution?
"my people use anti-matter as well, but we've found ways to purify the reactants so there's no toxic waste. we'll show you."
"guide us through the vortex. we can meet with your scientists on the other side, exchange information."
show me now.
"stand by for transport. commander, take our guest to engineering. give him a demonstration. let's turn our sensors on that vortex. i want to know exactly how it works, just in case diplomacy fails."
do you intend to destroy it?
"the residual anti-matter is then processed in the transkinetic chamber, where it's broken down on the subatomic level."
what about the theta radiation?
"oh, it's absorbed by a series of radiometric converters. we recycle the energy, use it to power everything from life support to replicators."
we don't have this kind of conversion technology.
our scans of your freighter show that you have plasma manifolds. the engineering principles are the same.
"we're not saying this won't take some effort. you're looking at several months of retrofitting, depending on the size of your fleet. all the schematics are here, and we'd be willing to work with you, get you started. we can even provide you with some converters."
"ingenious design. our engineers would be pleased. this would solve a lot of problems on my world. unfortunately, it would also put me out of business."
sorry?
"your technology would throw the waste export industry into chaos. before long, i'd be obsolete. i came here hoping your claims were exaggerated, but i can see they're not. you can keep your solution."
you lying
b'elanna.
we went through this whole song and dance and he never had any intention of working with us.
"that's not important. what matters is that we're talking now. we're proposing changes, some of them difficult, but progress can also bring new opportunities. given time, this could turn to your advantage."
i already have the advantage. the vortex. no one knows about it except me and my crew. by ejecting my cargo here i cut expenses in half. i won't sacrifice that.
i guess mass murder doesn't factor into your profit margin.
"you care so much about these creatures, stay."
"i'm sorry you won't listen to reason, but don't expect us to walk away from this."
you've scanned my vessel. you've seen my fire power. you wouldn't survive ten seconds in a conflict with me.
get him out of here.
pah!
options?
we fight our way past them. navigate the vortex on our own. once we're on the other side we contact the malon authorities and blow the whistle on emck.
"we give them the reclamation technology, and continue on our way home."
exactly.
"even if we did get through the vortex, there's no guarantee the malon will do the right thing, if mister emck is any indication. as long as this vortex exists, the inhabitants of this region are at risk."
any chance we could destroy it?
"i believe so, but there's a catch. we'll have to collapse it from this end, where it's dimensional radius is weakest. we'd be closing our short-cut out of here."
two more years in the void. i can live with that.
but i'm not sure i can. four years ago i destroyed the caretaker's array to protect the ocampa. that act of compassion stranded this crew in the delta quadrant. i'm not about to give that order again.
this situation is a little different.
it's close enough. i'm asking this crew to make too big a sacrifice. i won't make that same mistake.
"if you have another option, i'm listening."
"chakotay, there's no one i trust more than you. you're a fine first officer. are you ready to captain this ship?"
yes.
assemble the crew.
captain on the bridge.
"at ease. harry, how've you been?"
"just find, ma'am."
good.
"we've missed you, captain."
"likewise. i'll make this brief. your orders are to proceed to the vortex. use whatever means necessary to fight your way past the malon freighter. i'll stay behind in a shuttlecraft and destroy the vortex. tuvok, i'll need a class two shuttle armed with photon torpedoes. tom, set a course for"
forget it. we're not going to let you die out here.
"have a little faith, b'elanna. i'll have a shuttle, plenty of rations. i'll survive."
"alone in the delta quadrant? no offence, but"
i've made my decision.
what about us? don't we have a say?
"he's right, captain. i'd be willing to brave this void if it meant keeping you with us."
"tom, set a course."
"lieutenant, i gave you an order."
"i can't follow that order, ma'am."
"harry, take the helm."
"i'm sorry, captain."
i will not comply.
what's a hologram to do?
"as you can see, you're not the only one who's had time to evaluate the past."
"yes, i can see that. you realise you could all be hanged for mutiny.? looks like we need another option."
"we fire torpedoes the instant we cross the threshold. as the vortex begins to collapse, we jump into high warp."
there'll be a massive shock wave on our tail.
i'll reinforce the aft shielding.
there's still one obstacle. the malon.
antimatter waste has weakened the bulkhead surrounding their cargo hold. a direct phaser strike should disable them.
poetic justice.
indeed.
you realise it will reduce our chance of getting through.
chance is irrelevant. we will succeed.
a vote of borg confidence. who could argue with that?
all right. back to your stations. let's do it.
red alert. set a course to the vortex. all hands to battle stations.
you told them. they knew coming in.
let's just say i wouldn't be a fine first officer if i hadn't.
return fire. hit them with everything we've got.
their shields are holding.
open a channel. this is voyager. stand down your weapons and fall back.  i'll take that as a no.
the vortex.
two million kilometres dead ahead.
"bridge to engineering, we're approaching the vortex."
bring the aft shielding online.
acknowledged. see you on the other side.
status.
the port nacelle's been ruptured. we're venting plasma.
"can you get us out of here on one engine, tom?"
i think so.
torpedoes armed and ready.
"on my order, tuvok. we'll only get one shot at this."
they're firing spatial charges.
evade them.
captain proton to the rescue.
i'll explain later.
the vortex is in visual range.
time to intercept?
forty seven seconds.
steady as she goes. keep laying down fire.
"direct hit, starboard nacelle."
both engines are offline. we're running on inertia. one more hit and we're dead in the water.
without warp drive we'll never outrun the shockwave.
"tuvok, can you reinforce the aft shields with our main deflector?"
i believe so.
do it. we're going to ride that shockwave out of here. let it push us to the other side.
adjusting shield harmonics.
captain. they intend to block our path.
twenty seconds.
prepare to fire.
that may not be necessary.
the freighter is moving to combat the aliens.
"they're trying to distract the malon, give us the upper hand."
ten seconds!
the freighter's shields are weakening.
target their cargo hold. time to take out the garbage.
we're crossing the threshold.
torpedoes.
shockwave approaching. six hundred metres. five hundred. four.
aft shields at maximum.
"all hands, brace for impact!"
pressure is building on the outer hull. shields weakening.
we're clear.
the vortex has been destroyed.
are we out of the void?
not yet. that little manoeuvre brought us up a bit short. we're still two hundred thousand kilometres from the boundary.
on screen. maintain course.
there.
what?
i saw something. a star.
remind me to check your eyesight.
"harry, what do you see out there?"
i see a densely packed region with thousands of star systems. it looks pretty lively.
full speed ahead.
seven of nine. how's my favourite borg today?
annoyed. in the future you will announce your presence before entering this room.
sorry. i guess i should have knocked first.
are we ready to leave?
"yes. according to sensors, spatial conditions are ripe. a spontaneous protonebula could emerge within the next twenty minutes. mister paris is expecting us."
hmm. not a bad looking hologram.
"this should be exciting, don't you think?"
"it's an astronomical survey, nothing more. what is your function on this mission?"
my function is to study the nebula's effects on the crew. we may be dealing with new forms of radiation. i can't wait to see one of these clouds take shape. i hear they're quite beautiful. i brought along a holo-imaging device to take a few snapshots.
this isn't shore leave. there will be no time for recreational activities.
"the borg, party poopers of the galaxy. tomorrow we'll start you on a new social exercise. developing your joie de vivre."
sorry about that. just a little spatial turbulence. nothing to worry about.
hello there.
"i don't know about you, but i've got a case of class two claustrophobia."
"ah, i remember it well."
lieutenant?
"oh, that's what starfleet cadets used to call these class two shuttles. fast, manoeuvrable, but not built for comfort."
they used to shoehorn half a dozen cadets into one of these things for weeks at a time. you did not want to be around when they opened up that airlock.
"perhaps you should design a new shuttle. larger, more efficient."
not a bad idea.
i'm reading plasma surges off the port bow.
all stop. keep our distance.
"seven, move over by the helm. i want to get a group shot."
i'm busy.
"and smile, like i know you can."
what was that?
another plasma surge.
"it's massive! tom, back us off. we're caught in the gravimetric shear!"
engines are down.
we're receiving a distress call from the away team.
they've been engulfed in the shearline of the nebula.
full impulse. bridge to transporter room one. standby for emergency beamout.
"i've got a partial lock on them, but unless the shuttle clears that nebula."
it won't. they've lost propulsion.
then it's going to be a rough transport.
energise.
i'm having trouble separating their patterns.
reset the pattern buffers.
the signals are clearing.
is everyone all right?
my emitter. it's been damaged.
i'll transfer your programme back to sickbay. hang on.
sickbay to transporter room one. report.
it looks like some of your emitter circuits were fused during transport.
can you repair it?
most likely?
"relax, doctor. i'll keep you posted. mulchaey."
"computer, run diagnostic routine alpha three six."
diagnostic in progress.
"first thing in the morning, i want you to check the results."
i'll be here bright and early.
"rise and shine, lieutenant. it's oh six hundred hours. early bird gets the gagh!"
what do you want?
"good morning would be nice, but i'd settle for my mobile emitter. do we have an eta on those repairs?"
go away.
can't you at least give me a prognosis?
the one day i get to sleep in.
you're worried about a few more seconds of unconsciousness? my freedom is at stake!
"computer, activate sonic shower."
"one more thing, lieutenant. i was thinking"
hey!
"i'm a doctor, not a peeping tom. it's nothing i haven't seen before. i was thinking"
if you brought the emitter to sickbay we could work on it together. i've prepared a. hello? b'elanna?
regeneration cycle incomplete.
commander. how'd you sleep?
well enough. what's new?
that nebula's expanding at a rate of eight thousand cubic kilometres per hour. i've had to adjust course eleven times.
sounds like you're enjoying the big chair.
it's not a bad way to spend the night.
i hear you've been doing a fine job. the crew's impressed. is it true you make them call you captain kim?
sir?
good morning.
that remains to be seen.
problem?
the proximity transceiver in my cranial implant has been activated. that could indicate a borg presence nearby.
harry?
i've been running sensor sweeps all night. i haven't seen anything.
perhaps the nebula is masking a vessel.
"no, not a chance. a ship wouldn't last ten seconds in there. not even a borg cube."
maybe it's a false alarm. your transceiver could be malfunctioning.
it is possible.
"why don't you pay a visit to sickbay. in the meantime we'll redouble our scans, just to be sure."
very well.
i'll get the scans underway.
if you don't mind being an ensign again.
seven?
my proximity transceiver activated again.
looks like someone's rerouting power from the warp conduits.
to where?
"deck eight, section twenty two. the science lab."
"bridge to science lab. ensign mulchaey, respond. harry."
"sensors are being deflected by some kind of forcefield. commander, the forcefield has a borg signature."
"red alert. captain to the bridge. tuvok, take a security team to the science lab. chakotay to seven of nine, looks like you were right."
"we've detected borg on the ship. deck eight, science lab."
how many drones?
"unknown, tuvok's headed there now."
i will join him.
the science lab? my mobile emitter's in there.
"this technology resembles a borg maturation chamber, but many of the components are unfamiliar."
commander.
he was punctured by an extraction tubule. it removed a tissue sample. there are residual nanoprobes surrounding the wound. their encoding sequences are identical to my own.
your nanoprobes? how?
i don't know.
take him to sickbay.
what are you doing?
i will be recognised as borg.
"a drone, but unlike any i've ever seen."
it appears to be in the foetal stage.
i don't understand. the borg assimilate. they do not reproduce in this fashion.
where did it come from?
i believe it was created here in the science lab. when the away team beamed back to voyager there was a transporter malfunction. our patterns merged briefly. it is possible that some of my nanoprobes infected the doctor's mobile emitter.
they began to assimilate?
yes.
"nanoprobes are encoded to utilize any technology they encounter. once it assimilated the emitter, it began to transform this diagnostic station. when ensign mulchaey entered the room, they sampled his dna."
using his genetic code as a template to create a lifeform.
the drone has increased in mass by seventeen percent.
its maturation rate is twenty five times that of a conventional borg.
"tuvok, erect a level ten forcefield around this section. post round the clock security."
you intend to let it mature?
"the alternative is to pull the plug, and i'm not prepared to do that. not unless i have to. resume your analysis. i want to know exactly what we're dealing with here. or should i say whom?"
"yes, captain."
i've adapted the astrometrics sensors to penetrate the borg forcefield.
i thought you said this thing was a foetus.
"an hour ago it was. the drone has entered the fourth phase of gestation. in human terms, it is a child of six years."
"you mean a boy of six years. from what i can tell the drone is male. seven, route your sensor data to sickbay. i want to run a few medical scans."
stand by.
"well, he appears to be human for the most part. borg implants comprise approximately"
twenty seven percent of his body.
curious. his body plating is composed of polydeutonic alloy
just like my mobile emitter.
the nanoprobes must have extrapolated that technology. it could explain his unique design.
wait a minute. the doctor's emitter came from the twenty ninth century. it's five hundred years more advanced that anything we've got.
it is logical to assume this drone will be equally advanced.
a twenty ninth century borg.
in essence.
i've located my mobile emitter. it's embedded in his cerebral cortex.
the emitter has been adapted to serve as part of his central nervous system. it controls all autonomic functions.
that means we can't remove it. not without killing the drone.
has it contacted the borg collective?
no. i have dampened it's proximity transceiver.
for now. what about when it grows up?
reactive body armour? multidimensional adaptability? internal transporter nodes?
"the drone possesses superior technology. it will fully mature in less than two hours. however, its borg shielding is not yet active. we can still terminate it, but we must act quickly."
"hold on a minute, seven. i want some answers first. what normally happens when a drone disengages from the maturation chamber?"
it awaits instructions from the collective.
"so without those instructions, it has no designation, right? no purpose."
correct.
"if we can keep him from interfacing with the collective, maybe we can give him a purpose."
captain.
"this is the most advanced drone ever to exist. we could teach him our values, seven. we could show him what it means to be an individual."
"if we fail, if the drone were to be assimilated the collective would become far more powerful."
"what i'm proposing is the only defence we have against that possibility, short of murder, and that's an order i'd prefer not to give. as i recall, seven, there were a few crew members who had similar doubts about you."
the situation is different.
"is it? a borg, disconnected from the collective, unsure of its identity? a potential threat, but we succeeded. we're going to pull the same trick again, only this time you're going to be the teacher."
i am to instruct the drone in the ways of humanity.
"think of it as first contact, and you are our ambassador."
maturation cycle is complete.
we are borg. state our designation.
designation is irrelevant. you are not part of the collective. you are an individual. you will receive your instructions from me.
insufficient.
you must comply.
insufficient. we are borg.
"my designation is seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. you may call me seven of nine."
seven of nine.
you will comply with my commands.
seven of nine.
yes. we are not borg. we are individuals. do you understand?
state our designation.
apparently not.
the drone's responses are programmed. it doesn't understand what i'm saying. i must initiate a direct neural interface.
are you sure that's wise?
there is no other way for me to communicate with it.
proceed.
you will not be harmed. resistance is futile.
i am providing it with instructions. it understands.
the drone is probing my neural pathways. it is trying to assimilate all of my knowledge. i cannot disengage the link.
terminate interface! you must comply. you are hurting me.
i will comply.
special delivery. two borg datanodes.
"more? link them to the dataport. how many borg hitchhikers are we going to pick up on this trip? maybe this is the collective's new strategy. they don't assimilate anymore, they just show up and look helpless."
"now, b'elanna."
we don't know what this drone will turn into. it's gone from infant to adult in one day.
it will become what we help it to become.
how starfleet of you.
seven of nine to neelix.
neelix here.
report to the science lab immediately. bring the first datanode.
on my way.
we are borg. state our designation.
we've complied information into this datanode for you to assimilate.
we do not understand.
"you will, but first you must assimilate this data. come here. comply! give me your arm. inject the datanode with an assimilation tubule. this access port."
we do not understand.
your designation is seven of nine.
yes.
"your designation is neelix, talaxian."
that's me.
this is a laboratory on a vessel.
the starship voyager.
i am travelling through interstellar space.
yes.
why?
this is a ship of exploration.
i am an explorer.
we all are.
we are borg.
"well, no."
you are a unique individual. one of many on voyager. this is not a borg collective. do you understand?
individual. my thoughts are my own.
precisely.
i wish to assimilate more information.
not yet. your neural pathways require time to process the information. you will need to regenerate soon. i will adapt one of the alcoves in our cargo bay to your technology. take the drone to the doctor for medical analysis. go with him.
"all members of this crew must report to the sickbay for evaluation. when i am finished here, i will join you."
duranium hull. plasma based power distribution. tricylic life support systems. artificial gravity plating.
right on all counts. systems analysis appears to be your forte. you should think about a future in starship operations.
"human, female."
very good.
she was frightened by me.
why do you say that?
i detected an elevation in her pheromonal response.
"well, you're new around here. an unfamiliar face takes some getting used to. i remember when i first came aboard voyager. i provoked a few strange reactions myself. i still do from time to time. i mean, just look at me. whiskers and spots."
were people afraid of you as well?
"well, no."
do they fear me because i am borg?
sometimes borg can be a little intimidating. don't take it personally.
i want to know more about the collective.
"you do? well, of course you do."
tell me about the borg.
"oh, what's to tell? you've seen one cybernetically enhanced species, you've seen them all. you'll have plenty of time to learn all about them but first, you have to give yourself a chance to adapt to life here on voyager. now mister, gosh, i'm sorry. in all the excitement, i forgot your name."
i do not have a name.
"every individual needs a name. we can't just run around calling you the drone. that's not very interesting, is it?"
seven of nine tells me my designation is irrelevant.
"i disagree. you should choose a name for yourself. something that defines who you are. after all, there's only one of you."
one.
"oh, here we are. sickbay."
good morning.
you are the emergency medical hologram.
"and you are very observant. step this way, please."
i have to get back to the mess hall. there's nothing to worry about. the doctor is going to do a few scans. you'll be finished before you know it.
i will comply.
it's a non-invasive biomedical scan. you won't feel a thing. your central nervous system is functioning normally but i'm picking up some degradation in your neural pathways. you'll need to regenerate soon.
my central nervous system is regulated by your mobile emitter.
that's right.
your mobile emitter is more advanced than these diagnostic tools.
"far more advanced. it's technology that came from the twenty ninth century, four hundred years in the future."
i am an advanced form of life.
yes.
i am unique.
mmm hmm.
describe my origins.
"oh, it's a long story."
i wish to hear it.
another time.
i wish to hear the story. now.
"in a nutshell, there was a transporter malfunction. my emitter fused with several of seven of nine's nanoprobes."
i was an accident.
call it a random convergence of technologies.
am i unwelcome here?
"on the contrary. our primary mission is to explore new forms of life. you may have been unexpected but, given time, i am sure you'll make a fine addition to the crew. after all, you've got my mobile emitter driving your neocortex, so you're bound to make a dazzling impression. that's called a joke."
joke. a verbal comment or gesture designed to provoke laughter.
i see you've got your mother's sense of humour.
"deck eleven, section thirty two, main engineering. that is the"
"warp core. fuelled by a matter - antimatter reaction which produces a maximum output of four thousand terradynes per second, providing power for faster than light propulsion."
correct.
"this isn't a classroom, seven."
"lieutenant b'elanna torres, chief engineer. klingon human hybrid. she possesses extensive knowledge of this vessel's systems as well as a volatile temperament."
volatile. english adjective meaning readily vaporisable at low temperature. easily aroused. tending to violent eruption.
very good. you get a gold star.
our presence here is authorised. the captain asked me to familiarise the drone with voyager.
"well, how about familiarising him with the airponics bay. i have got one hour to come up with a way to predict the expansion rate of this protonebula or janeway's going to pull the plug on the entire survey. do you mind?"
if you apply a multispatial algorithm it will accurately predict the rate of expansion. i can demonstrate.
all right.
amazing.
"greetings. our designation, my designation is one. how are you today?"
"i'm just fine, thank you. one?"
he requested a designation. one seemed appropriate.
"and how are you today, one?"
"well. thank you, captain janeway."
adapting to life on voyager?
"yes. to date i've assimilated forty seven billion terraquads of information on a vast variety of subjects, including particle physics, comparative humanoid anatomy, warp field theory, and the culinary delights of the delta quadrant."
mister neelix. they've been spending time together.
is your assessment of me complete? am i sufficient?
"why, yes. more than sufficient. in fact, i'd say you were making excellent progress. and this isn't an assessment, one. i simply wanted to meet you."
"with your permission, i would like to be excused. i've agreed to assist lieutenant torres. she wishes to increase the efficiency of the bussard collectors."
permission granted.
you've done a remarkable job.
thank you.
"not only has he absorbed an incredible amount of knowledge in a matter of days, but he seems to be fitting in with the crew and developing a distinct personality."
he is adapting quickly.
then why do i get the feeling something's bothering you.
he's been expressing curiosity about the borg.
ah. and you're worried that if he learns about them he may be drawn to the collective.
yes.
maybe we should tell him what he wants to know. i'd rather he learned about the borg from us than the collective.
"the lure of perfection is powerful, captain. he may be tempted to seek out the borg. that would pose a grave tactical risk."
"well, we can delay telling him for now, but keep in mind the drone is becoming an individual. seven, he has the right to know. sooner or later, we'll have to answer his questions."
"deck eight, section four. cargo bay two. used for the storage of spare components and surplus materials."
it is also where i regenerate. you will reside here with me.
i wish to assimilate more information.
you have assimilated enough for one day. you've also provided invaluable assistance to the voyager crew. you have exceeded expectations.
then expectations were insufficient.
a simple thank you would suffice.
thank you?
a customary expression of gratitude. i paid you a compliment. we must regenerate.
this technology does not conform with starfleet parameters.
correct.
i am borg. this technology is borg.
we must regenerate.
i wish to assimilate all available data pertaining to the borg.
"step into the alcove. no, you must face outward. computer, activate regeneration cycle. alcoves beta and gamma."
seven of nine.
yes.
thank you.
we must regenerate.
"a borg proximity signal has been detected. origin, unimatrix three two five, grid zero zero six. alter course to intercept."
captain?
the drone transmitted a borg proximity signal. wake him.
you contacted the collective.
no.
check his transceiver.
you deactivated my transceiver two days ago.
it appears your cranial implants have adapted and created a secondary transceiver.
a borg fail-safe device.
precisely. have you detected any vessels?
long range sensors picked up a transwarp conduit. a ship is approaching.
time to intercept?
approximately three hours.
the borg?
yes.
i wish to meet them.
seven. i think it's time we showed our drone what the borg are all about.
the borg have assimilated thousands of species.
correct.
what becomes of those species?
"their neural pathways are restructured and linked to a single collective mind, the hive. their bodies are augmented with cybernetic technology. they become drones."
i wish to experience the hive mind.
"if you did that, you'd no longer be unique. the borg would destroy your individuality."
and that is undesirable?
very. the borg are the most destructive force we've ever encountered. they've assimilated billions of individuals against their will.
you were assimilated.
my link to the collective was severed.
when you were in the collective you assimilated others.
yes.
you call the borg destructive. seven of nine is not.
"that's because she's regained her individuality. if the borg had the chance, they'd take it away from her again. they'd assimilate everyone on voyager. with your advanced technology, the collective would become even more destructive. we have to prevent that from happening but we can't do it without you. we need your abilities to enhance our defences, shields, weapons. will you help us resist them?"
"seven of nine, do you wish to rejoin the collective?"
voyager is my collective.
i will need time to assimilate this information.
all hands to battle stations. a borg vessel is approaching.
we just ran out of time.
"seven of nine, i'm detecting irregularities in my autonomic nervous system. cardiovascular excitation, vaeso-constriction."
you are experiencing an emotion. anxiety. it is only temporary.
anxiety. a state of apprehension caused by fear.
the borg usually elicit this response in others.
are you experiencing anxiety as well?
"yes, along with every crew member on voyager."
because they fear assimilation?
correct. we are needed on the bridge.
deck one.
seven of nine.
yes.
what will happen now?
we will engage the borg.
will voyager be destroyed?
"the borg are powerful, but captain janeway is a resourceful leader. we will resist."
resistance is futile.
perhaps.
the borg vessel's moving into range.
on screen.
long-range tactical vessel. transwarp capability. ablative hull armour.
we're being scanned.
they're preparing to attack. you must help us enhance our shields. this station will give you access to the shield generators.
they are hailing us.
open a channel.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
i can hear them in my mind.
they've locked on a tractor beam.
the collective is calling to me.
i hear it too. billions of voices speaking as one. we must resist that voice. the crew of voyager will be destroyed if we don't.
our shields are remodulating.
we've broken free.
can you enhance our phasers?
yes.
"do it. when he's finished, target their propulsion system. be prepared to jump to warp, mister paris."
enhancements complete. you may fire.
what happened?
they inverted our phaser beam with a feedback pulse.
they just took out our warp drive.
your technology is limited. i cannot enhance it further. i must interface with the collective. i can disrupt their vessel from within.
they will try to assimilate you.
they will fail.
"harry, lock on to the drone."
that won't be necessary.
he's inside the sphere.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated.
my technology is superior. stop your attack or i will destroy you.
your technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. resistance is futile.
shields down to twenty nine percent!
he's accessing their navigational controls.
it's heading directly for the nebula.
"if they get too close, their hull will collapse."
terminate your interface.
"stand down red alert. tuvok, secure all stations. organise damage control teams, chakotay."
"captain, i'm reading a lifesign in the debris. it's the drone. he survived."
"he's erected a multispatial force field around his body, but it is weakening."
get a lock on him. beam him to sickbay.
damage?
"several of his implants were fused in the explosion, but they're regenerating. his biological systems are a different story. severe trauma to the cerebral cortex, internal bleeding. he needs immediate surgery."
the sphere?
destroyed. you were successful.
"while i was linked to the borg i could hear their thoughts, their objectives. they are aware of my existence. they will pursue me."
irrelevant. they will fail.
i need to get started.
no. i should not exist. i was an accident. a random convergence of technologies.
you are unique.
"i was never meant to be. as long as i exist, you are in danger. all life on voyager is in danger."
we can talk about this later.
allow the doctor to proceed. lower the forcefield!
his synapses are failing.
you must comply.
i will not.
you must comply. please. you are hurting me.
you will adapt.
i'm sorry.
higher.
"lieutenant, we're already at two hundred thousand metres. you could thermalise at this altitude."
i said higher.
we're at three hundred thousand metres.
"level us off. computer, disengage safety protocols."
warning. disengaging safety protocols presents extreme risk of injury.
override.
acknowledged. safety protocols have been disengaged.
drop the forcefield on my mark.
aye.
mark.
bridge to torres.
i don't believe it.
report to engineering on the double.
"computer, end programme."
i was not aware that protective attire was required for this mission.
"i was on the holodeck, orbital skydiving."
"leaping from a spacecraft at exospheric altitudes, a curious form of recreation. the probe is ready for launch, however there is still a problem with the telemetry link. lieutenant. is something wrong?"
"actually, i'm not feeling so well. can you handle the launch without me?"
you are putting me in charge?
problem?
no. just unexpected. shall i inform the doctor you're ill?
no. don't.
"captain, someone's locked onto our probe with a tractor beam."
it looks like a malon freighter.
i had a feeling we hadn't seen the last of them.
open a channel.
"aye, captain."
starship voyager to the malon vessel. that probe belongs to us. release it immediately.
no response.
"tom, how fast can you get us there?"
two hours at least.
they'll be long gone.
if we instruct the probe to emit a polaron burst it could disrupt the tractor beam.
do it.
the beam has been disabled.
"harry, redirect the probe's course."
the malon are in pursuit.
that probe can't outrun them.
"no, but we might be able to hide it from them."
captain?
the probe surveyed a class six gas giant this morning. i think we should send it back for a closer look.
you're going to steer the probe into a gas giant.
"captain, the atmospheric pressure will crush it."
not if the borg shielding does its job. hail them again.
no response.
voyager to malon vessel. break off your pursuit.
"the probe is entering the giant's upper atmosphere, and the malon vessel is following it in."
the probe's stuck in a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and methane about ten thousand kilometres below the outer atmosphere. it's not responding to commands.
any good news?
"it's still intact. it can be repaired,"
if we can get it out of there.
sorry i'm late.
we were just discussing how to retrieve the probe. is there any possibility of transporting it out?
no.
just no.
i don't see how we could get close enough.
is there any way to boost transporter range?
not in that kind of atmosphere.
"well, if we can't transport it out, we'll just have to fly in and grab it."
perhaps you weren't paying attention when the malon freighter imploded.
"we won't be going in a malon freighter, tuvok. we'll be going in our new shuttlecraft."
here we go again.
"let's face it, class-two shuttles just don't cut it in the delta quadrant. we've needed something bigger and better since we got here. it's time we built it!"
"tom, we've been through this i don't know how many times. we all appreciate your enthusiasm."
"speak for yourself, commander."
"bottom line, we don't have time to design and build a ship from scratch."
i knew you were going to say that so i've given us a head start.
"behold the delta flyer. ultra-aerodynamic contours, retractable nacelles, parametallic hull plating, unimatrix shielding based on tuvok's brilliant design for the multispatial probe, and a borg-inspired weapons system."
basic design elements are adequate.
high praise.
"if we used isomagnetic eps conduits in the plasma manifold, we could maximise the power distribution."
"that's the spirit, harry."
my shield designs could be successfully applied to a vessel of this size.
"big of you to admit it, tuvok."
and you think it'll be able to withstand the gas giant's atmosphere.
the probe did.
"i'm impressed, but how quickly can it be built?"
"we could replicate the alloys and the new design components, use spare parts from storage. if we worked around the clock we could have it up and running inside a week."
i'm willing to put in as much overtime as it takes.
i will forego regeneration for the duration of the project.
"what about you, b'elanna? building a new vessel from scratch, that's an engineer's dream come true."
"what do you say, captain?"
why are you all standing around?
"computer, add dynametric tail fins to the nacelles."
"computer, delete dynametric tail fins."
what'd you do that for?
"we are not designing a hot rod, lieutenant."
"that is exactly what we're designing. a twenty fourth century, warp-powered, ultra-responsive hot rod."
your embellishments are purely decorative. they serve no practical purpose.
"i beg to differ. if we make this thing look mean enough, other ships are going to think twice before taking us on."
i suggest we return our attention to the matter of structural integrity.
agreed.
lieutenant torres' hull design is flawed. we should be using tetraburnium alloys instead of titanium.
"er, b'elanna?"
sounds fine to me. i'm going to finish up the thruster specs.
it's open.
hey.
thruster specs.
thanks. where're you running off to?
my quarters.
"stay a while. i'll replicate some dinner, a bottle of burgundy. we deserve a break, don't you think?"
not tonight.
"b'elanna, what's going on?"
nothing.
"well, then how come it's impossible to have a conversation with you?"
i'm sorry.
i don't want an apology. i want an explanation.
"tom, i'm tired."
"asleep is more like it. you hardly said three words in that last meeting. and then when seven changed your design you acted like, like you didn't care."
i guess i didn't.
i don't get it. how many times have we talked about how great it would be to do what we're doing now? to really collaborate my piloting skills and your engineering expertise. we finally get the chance to create something together from the ground up and you're not the slightest bit enthusiastic?
"i'm doing my job, aren't i? i delivered the thruster specs on schedule."
"b'elanna, i'm not your boss. i'm not questioning your productivity or keeping tabs on how many hours you put in. i just want to know what's going on."
i have to go.
"computer, activate holodeck programme torres two one six."
the programme is active.
disengage safety protocols.
warning. disengaging safety protocols presents extreme risk of injury.
override.
acknowledged. safety protocols have been disengaged.
"ensign, put us into a high orbit. i want to stay well above that ionospheric turbulence."
"aye, ma'am."
"there's the probe. ten thousand kilometres beneath all that methane, but still intact."
we're not alone. i'm reading massive theta radiation. it's being dumped by a malon freighter approaching from the far side of the planet. they're hailing.
they're more talkative than the last ones. open a channel.
"aye, sir."
leave orbit of this planet now.
i don't believe we've been introduced. i'm captain janeway.
i know exactly who you are. you are the person responsible for the destruction of one of our freighters and the deaths of nine malon citizens.
"i'm very sorry that lives were lost, but you're leaving out an important detail. your people were trying to steal a probe from us. we warned them to stay away from the gas giant but they didn't listen."
i'm taking your probe as compensation for our losses.
that's going to be a little difficult. it's stuck beneath the atmosphere of the same gas giant that crushed your other ship.
my people are expert at salvage operations.
"well, mister."
vrelk. controller vrelk.
"vrelk. we have a little expertise of our own. we're a very determined crew. so my suggestion is that you leave orbit and in the future, if you come across anything that bears the insignia of the u.s.s. voyager, head in the other direction."
you are making a serious error.
end transmission. why would people in the business of toxic waste disposal be so anxious to get hold of a probe?
it's not just any probe. it's multispatial technology. maybe they think it'll help them find new places to dump their garbage.
b'elanna! what a nice surprise. i was just getting ready to close. business has been slow with so many people busy on the new shuttle.
oh. i was just hoping we could catch up.
you want to catch up? with me?
if you have the time.
are you kidding? yeah. can i get you something? name your poison.
oh. er.
"come on, b'elanna! i handed that one to you on a silver platter."
huh?
name your poison? i was expecting one of those scathing but affectionate insults you always make about my cooking.
sorry.
"you'll feel wittier on a full stomach. so, what'll it be?"
"actually, i was hoping for banana pancakes."
i don't think i ever heard of banana pancakes before.
my grandmother used to make them for me when i was a kid. it's always put a smile on my face.
"well then, one smile coming right up."
"computer, one stack of banana pancakes. smells delicious."
thanks. so how have you been?
"oh, just great. my security training is going really well. tuvok told me the other day that i'm, er, not completely inept. aren't you going to try them?"
sure.
well?
delicious. i have to get back to work.
what are they still doing here?
"apparently, they're not willing to give up on the probe so easily."
"the question is, how do they expect to get their hands on it?"
"it's reasonable to assume they're waiting for us to retrieve the probe, at which time they'll attempt to steal it again."
"maybe, but they have to know we're prepared for that. if they were planning to fight you'd think they'd call in reinforcements, try to out-gun us."
sensors don't show any other malon ships in the area.
seven of nine to the captain.
janeway here.
report to the astrometrics lab. i have important information regarding the malon
vessel.
tuvok.
what have you got?
i've been using coherent neutrino beams to document activity aboard the malon freighter.
"in other words, you've been spying on them."
i've made a troubling discovery. this is a polythermal image of an interior section of the alien ship. the shaded figures you see are malon crew members.
that appears to be a small ship.
correct. the malon are constructing a spacecraft composed of tetraburnium alloys.
"theoretically, such a ship would be capable of withstanding extreme atmospheric pressures."
i'll be damned. they're going after the probe themselves.
"that's not all, captain. according to my projections, they will finish construction of their vessel at least thirty six hours before we finish ours."
"well then, i'd say we've got an old-fashioned space race on our hands."
"i keep telling you, we've got to reinforce the hull with kellinite. that's all there is to it."
"proposing the same flawed strategy over and over again will not me it more effective, ensign."
"well, we've got to come up with something or we'll never get this thing off the ground."
"vorik, turn that damn thing off. i can't hear myself think."
"sorry, sir."
"look, we could spend weeks trying to solve this, but we've got a ticking clock. engines are working, weapons systems are online. i say we launch now and hope for the best."
"mister paris, that is perhaps the most illogical statement you've ever made. unless we find a way to reconfigure the structural integrity field the hull will incur microfractures during descent."
"microfractures, tuvok. doesn't necessarily mean we'll have a hull breach."
"and if we do, i suppose these useless design elements from your captain proton scenario will compensate for the problem."
"hey, every one of these knobs and levers is fully functional."
and completely superfluous.
"maybe to you. i am tired of tapping panels. for once, i want controls that let me actually feel the ship i'm piloting."
where are you going?
holodeck.
what for?
to find out if this microfracture problem is a fatal flaw.
"computer, activate immersion shielding."
immersion shielding activated.
commence descent sequence.
"range to probe, thirty thousand kilometres. twenty five thousand. warning. atmospheric pressure is exceeding tolerance levels. rapid ascent recommended."
continue descent.
"acknowledged. range to probe, ten thousand kilometres."
disengage safety protocols.
warning. disengaging safety protocols presents extreme risk of injury.
override.
acknowledged. safety protocols have been disengaged. warning. atmospheric pressure is exceeding tolerance levels.
reroute power from secondary systems to structural integrity.
acknowledged. microfractures are present in zones one and four.
the malon are venting a theta radiation cloud. our shields are down to eighty nine percent.
"ensign, back us off."
vrelk is hailing.
on screen.
"that was rude, wasn't it, but we still have quite a bit of antimatter waste to expel. i hope we didn't damage your shields,"
our shields are fine.
"mmm. well, we only ejected a small amount of waste this time. we still have much, much more to get rid of. your shields may not be able to stand even higher levels of theta radiation."
i've already told you we're not going anywhere.
"let's stop playing these games, captain. you've scanned my ship, i've scanned yours. we each know the other is building a vessel to retrieve the probe. what you don't know is that my vessel will be ready to launch in less than two days. you're too far behind."
"well, if you're so far ahead, why bother trying to scare us away?"
just trying to save you the embarrassment of losing.
think they're really two days away?
he's probably bluffing but we're not going to take any chances. we've got to speed up construction somehow.
we'd also better find a way to shore up our shields in case vrelk decides to do anymore venting.
"good idea. janeway to lieutenant torres. computer, locate lieutenant torres."
lieutenant torres is in holodeck one.
get down there.
"warning. hull microfractures are present in zones one, two, three and four. hull breach is imminent. repeat. hull microfracture are present in zones one, two, three and four. hull breach is imminent."
"computer, freeze programme! b'elanna. chakotay to sickbay. medical emergency."
what am i doing here?
you had an accident on the holodeck.
how long was i out?
almost twelve hours.
i'd better get back to work.
not just yet.
why?
the captain's asked me to keep you here.
but i feel fine.
"would you excuse us please, doctor."
"captain, what's going on?"
"when the doctor examined you he found evidence of internal bleeding, fractured vertebrae, contusions, cranial trauma."
i guess the accident was pretty serious.
"the injuries i'm talking about didn't happen recently. some of them are weeks, even months old."
"well, i'm an engineer. i've had my share of bumps and bruises."
but you didn't seek treatment for any of these.
i don't run to sickbay every time i stub my toe.
"some of these injuries were life-threatening, b'elanna."
do i look like i'm dying?
the doctor says many of the wounds were treated by someone with the medical expertise of a first-year nursing student.
"oh, that's ridiculous."
is it? we investigated today's accident. you turned off the safety protocols during the holo-simulation. why?
"we have a microfracture problem. with the safety protocols on, there's no way to be sure what would happen during a real flight."
"you don't really expect me to believe that, do you?"
are you calling me a liar?
"according to the holodeck logs, you've been spending a lot of time there over the last few months. if i were to check, would i find that you've been running other programmes without safety protocols?"
would you like to look at my personal logs as well?
"b'elanna, i'm worried about you. if there's something wrong, i want to help."
nothing's wrong. okay?
no. it's not okay. and until you decide to be more forthcoming you'll remain under the doctor's supervision. which means you're off the shuttle project. i'm sorry.
i'm not.
now i know there's something wrong.
"engines are operating at close to ninety percent efficiency, seven's got her new weapons system online. and if we can just solve that microfracture problem, we'll be ready to go."
"keep on it. now, let's talk about b'elanna. tom, you had no idea about these injuries or how she got them?"
"she never complained about being hurt, but then again she's barely speaking to me lately."
it's almost as if she's been intentionally trying to hurt herself.
you think all these injuries have been happening on the holodeck?
"well, where else? if they'd happened while she was working, as she claims, somebody would've filed an injury report."
any idea what sort of programmes she's been running?
are you thinking the same thing i am?
"i hate to go digging around in someone's personal holodeck programmes, but if she won't tell us what's going on i don't think we have much choice."
"tom, what do you think?"
he's right.
start digging.
i'm sleeping!
oh.
hi.
"hi. i, i thought you were the doctor making a house call."
"he let you out of the cell block, huh?"
he thinks familiar surroundings will help speed my recovery.
recovery from what?
that's what i said. he thinks i'm suffering from clinical depression.
are you depressed?
"what are you, the new ship's counsellor?"
no. just a friend.
"this whole thing is so ridiculous. i don't report a few scrapes and suddenly janeway thinks there's something wrong with me. typical starfleet, huh?"
you have been running holodeck programmes without safety protocols.
"a few, but i haven't put anybody else at risk, and it's nothing that i can't handle."
tell you what. what do you say you and i pay a little visit to the holodeck? you can show me some of the programmes you've been running.
right now?
"sure. maybe if i see what you've been up to, i can convince the captain there's nothing to worry about."
she's taken away my holodeck privileges.
consider them restored.
"computer, activate holo-programme torres zeta one."
programme activated.
what are you doing?
"computer, freeze programme."
"computer, belay that command."
turn it off!
not until you tell me what it is!
you know what it is.
who's this?
li-paz. don't you recognise him?
"oh, i recognise them all. meyer. nelson. sahreen. you created a programme to watch all our maquis friends get slaughtered. what i want to know is why?"
i thought we came down here to talk about safety protocols. this has nothing to do with that.
"i'm not so sure. the logs show you only ran this programme for forty seven seconds the day after i gave you the news about the massacre. then you shut it down and started running the most dangerous programmes you could find, with the safeties off. why?!"
this is ridiculous. i'm leaving.
"computer, seal the doors."
you can't do this!
"the hell i can't. you're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. b'elanna, why are you intentionally trying to hurt yourself?"
i don't know.
are you trying to commit suicide?
no.
then why?
"because. because if i sprain my ankle, at least i feel something."
what do you mean?
i'm not trying to kill myself. i'm trying to see if i'm still alive.
i don't understand.
"when you look at those corpses, how do you feel?"
sad. angry. maybe a little guilty that i wasn't there to die with them.
not me. i don't feel anything at all.
"b'elanna, the maquis were like our adopted family. i can understand you trying to block out that kind of pain."
"you don't understand. it's not just the pain. i don't feel anything. not about my dead friends, not about tom, you, my job."
"maybe you're afraid if you let yourself start to feel something, you might not be able to stop. you can't just shut off your emotions, b'elanna. sooner or later you're going to have to let yourself grieve."
why? just so i can go through it all over again?
what are you talking about?
"when i was six, my father walked out on me. when i was nineteen, i got kicked out of starfleet. a few years later, i got separated from the maquis. and just when i start to feel safe, you tell me that all of our old friends have been slaughtered. the way i figure it, i've lost every family i've ever had."
"b'elanna, you have a new family now, here on voyager. you're not going to lose us. you're stuck with us."
you can't promise me that.
"no, i suppose i can't. losing people's inevitable, and sometimes it happens sooner than we expect. but i can promise you that the people on this ship aren't about to let you stop living your life or break your neck on the holodeck. you're going to have to find another way to deal with this."
i don't know how.
then we'll figure it out. together.
"commander chakotay, we're under attack. report to the bridge immediately."
you'd better go.
why are they suddenly picking a fight?
"i believe they're attempting to distract us, commander, while they launch their new shuttlecraft."
"the malon vessel is forty two thousand kilometres from the probe, and closing."
we can still catch them.
bridge to lieutenant paris.
paris here.
we've got to launch now if we're going to get to the probe first. are you ready?
yes ma'am. i'll begin the prelaunch sequence.
what about the microfracture problem?
"we're keeping an eye on it, but we sure could use an extra hand."
chakotay's on his way.
"chakotay, let me go."
"b'elanna, i'm in a hurry."
i am not out to get myself hurt if that's what you're thinking. i just want to do my job.
i thought you weren't interested in your job anymore.
"if that hull breaches, i should be there. i'm still the best engineer we've got."
not lately.
i can do this. i need to do this.
forty seconds to launch.
powering impulse engines.
stand by to bring aft thrusters online.
b'elanna.
i heard you might need some help keeping this thing from falling apart.
welcome aboard.
"vorik, you're in my seat."
"excuse me, lieutenant."
twenty seconds to launch.
get that hatch closed.
hatch sealed.
give me aft thrusters.
aft thrusters enabled.
ten seconds.
"alright, let's see what this baby can do."
five. four. three. two. one.
"the delta flyer is away, captain."
how long till they overtake the malon shuttle?
"at present velocity, approximately three minutes."
we're in.
structural integrity's at ninety two percent.
there's the malon shuttle. two hundred kilometres off the port bow and three thousand kilometres from the probe.
"we'll catch them. b'elanna, how's the hull?"
structural integrity's down about twelve percent.
they're launching spatial charges. shields holding.
they want to play dirty. let's show them what a little borg-inspired weaponry can do.
acknowledged. loading photonic missiles.
we've lost power to secondary systems.
fire.
three direct hits.
they're losing attitude control. they're pulling up.
"nice shooting, seven. i'm taking us down to the target. harry, get ready to grab the probe."
still out of transport range.
"we're losing integrity. fifty percent, forty."
if you can hold us together for another half a minute we'll be within range of the target.
we still need to survive the ascent.
one thing at a time.
we're losing structural integrity. it's down to twenty five percent.
"harry, prepare to lock on."
"we've got microfractures forming. aft starboard hull, zone two."
i've got a lock. beaming the probe into the cargo hold. got it!
initiating rapid ascent.
"harry, i need those secondary systems back online."
i can't. they're fried.
"lieutenant, what are you doing?"
patching a hole before it opens.
that'll never hold.
"it'll hold a minute or two, and with any luck that's all we need. seven, take over here. i need an eps relay."
"er, there's one in the transporter control circuitry."
the panel is sealed.
good. get away from it.
i need a phaser.
watch out. i don't know if this is going to work.
glad you decided to come along.
the delta flyer has docked.
and the malon?
they're a little preoccupied. seems their shuttlecraft's having a problem climbing out of the gas giant's atmosphere.
"get us out of here, ensign. warp two."
"aye, captain."
"b'elanna. i heard you did a hell of a job. so, how are you?"
you mean am i back to my old charming self? i don't know.
give it time.
"chakotay. what you did down in the holodeck today. thanks. but if you ever do anything like that again, i'll break your neck."
"computer, one stack of banana pancakes with maple syrup."
"welcome to earth. i am admiral bullock, and i will be your commanding officer for the next six months. questions, comments, bring them to me. problems, talk to lieutenant kinis. larsen, you're assigned to the federation council, deputy liaison officer. young and raskin, report to orbital flight control. you'll be monitoring incoming vessels from the bolian sector."
"i can save you some time there, son. they're bamboo."
"i know that. unfortunately, my tricorder's reading them as maple trees. i think the isodyne relays must be malfunctioning."
why don't you pay a visit to logistical support? maybe they'll issue you a new one.
good idea.
i'm going that way myself. mind some company?
not at all.
"so, what's your assignment here?"
i don't know. i haven't received my orders yet. i just arrived.
from where?
a three year tour on the intrepid.
is that a fact? i thought the intrepid was patrolling the neutral zone.
it is. i caught a transport vessel at deep space seven.
ah. got tired of wrestling with the romulans.
"let's just say it's good to be back. what about yourself? how long have you been posted here, mister?"
boothby. boothby's the name.
boothby. i've heard of you.
"i should hope so. i've been tending these grounds for fifty four years, give or take a few months."
and beautiful grounds they are.
"mmm hmm. logistical support. straight through the main complex, second door on your right."
thank you.
"commander, logistics is a secure area. they won't let you in with that holo-imaging device. fresh from the neutral zone? you're not a romulan double agent, are you, son?"
"actually, i was just recording a few images for my friends back home. would you mind posing for a shot?"
me? you want a picture of me?
the one and only boothby. my friends would be impressed.
"well, when you put it that way. cadet, take our picture, will you?"
"don't cut off our heads. i expect a copy of that, young man."
"you're in my seat. and you're reading my book. do you want my drink, too?"
depends. what is it?
"klingon martini. vermouth, gin, with a dash of bloodwine."
bloodwine? never touch the stuff.
what do you like?
excuse me. i was waiting for a friend.
valerie archer.
hayek. jason hayek.
nice tattoo. i bet there's a story behind it.
a long one. a cave beyond logic: vulcan perspectives on platonic thought. sounds fascinating.
you can borrow it if you like.
thanks anyway. i can only take small doses of vulcan philosophy.
stationed here?
temporarily.
where do you call home?
you first. where are you from?
everywhere. my parents were starship officers. by the time i was ten i'd seen half the quadrant.
starfleet brat.
bratty as they come.
can i ask you a question. have you ever reverted?
reverted? not yet.
"ensign o'halloran, this is his third time this week. if it happens again, they'll pull him out of training."
what about you. any trouble?
"oh, i can keep my human form. it's the little things that bother me."
little things?
"breathing oxygen, bipedal locomotion, and sleeping. the concept of being unconscious for eight hours a night, it's so alien."
i know what you mean.
"that's why i started reading their books. for some reason it helps me relax. but we shouldn't be talking about this. think human, talk human, be human. remember?"
how could i forget?
"so, had a chance to take a look around?"
not yet.
"headquarters has a lot more to offer than conference rooms and consoles, if you have the right guide."
is that an invitation?
i get off duty at nineteen hundred hours.
commander.
speak of the devil.
we were just discussing vulcan philosophy.
join us.
"another time, perhaps. we have work to do."
"oh, can't it wait?"
i'm afraid not.
what about tonight? do we have a date? nineteen hundred hours. meet you right here.
i'll do my best.
live long and prosper.
a date?
"relax, tuvok. i plan on standing her up."
we agreed to limit our investigation to surveillance.
it was worth the risk. she talked about training. these are some kind of aliens learning to pose as humans.
for what purpose?
i don't know. i didn't get that far.
we're due back at the transporter coordinates.
"excuse me, gentlemen. you've entered a restricted area. captains and above."
sorry. we didn't realise.
i'm going to have to ask you to come with me.
why?
all unauthorised personnel are to be debriefed by starfleet intelligence. direct orders from admiral bullock.
"listen, ensign, we're late for a meeting with starfleet command. the debriefing will have to wait."
"i'm sorry, commander."
very well.
"when he regains consciousness, he'll no doubt want to report this incident."
"chakotay to paris, three to beam up."
three?
i'll explain later.
who's that?
one of starfleet's finest. take us to voyager.
what did you find down there?
earth.
welcome aboard.
where am i?
on a starship.
what starship? why have you brought me here? i'll be reporting this incident to the admiral.
you can drop the charade. we know you're not human.
who are you?
"gentry, david. rank, ensign. starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight. planet of origin, earth."
we're not interested in your knowledge of human culture. we're not part of your re-creation. i'm captain janeway of the federation starship voyager. i'm from earth. you're not.
"gentry, david. rank, ensign. starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight."
doctor.
what are you doing?
i need a sample of your dna.
why?
"since you won't tell us who you are, we have no choice but to find out for ourselves."
you won't be harmed.
gentry to headquarters. security alert!
we've disabled your comm. badge.
no! don't touch me. disease! humans!
it appears he's released a cellular toxin into his bloodstream. he's dead.
"federation council, astrophysics, starfleet medical complex. they even re-created the officers' club, the quantum café."
"computer, return to time index 4228. that's boothby."
captain?
"the head groundskeeper at starfleet academy. when i was a cadet, he used to give me fresh roses for my quarters."
it's safe to assume this individual is not boothby.
"whoever they are, they've gathered incredibly accurate information about starfleet headquarters."
perhaps they had access to a federation database.
or they've been to san francisco.
"the habitat's population consists of humans, vulcans, bolian, ferengi. all alpha quadrant species."
"what do we know about this artificial environment, seven?"
"i've used the tricorder data, holo-images and astrometric scans to extrapolate a cross-section of the interior. i believe they used a combination of holographic projection and particle synthesis."
power source?
there are thirteen thermionic generators beneath the city. i can't identify the energy signatures.
the habitat's heavily fortified. they are well prepared to defend against an attack.
sickbay to captain.
go ahead.
i've completed my post-mortem analysis. you'd better get down here.
"on my way. if this is a training ground, it could mean they're planning an invasion of the federation. we should prepare for the worst. see if you can find a way to penetrate their defences."
"he may look human, he may sound human, he may even smell human, but there's no question, he's alien."
was he genetically altered?
"on a highly sophisticated level. if it weren't for microcellular scans i wouldn't be able to distinguish him from the genuine article. i've managed to isolate the alien dna. fortunately, most of his cells are still chemically active. if i use a cytokinetic injection i should be able to trigger a genetic reversion."
do it.
talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing.
"species 8472. the question is, why are they training to pose as human beings?"
"back in the twentieth century, the soviets used to build american towns to train their agents to infiltrate the united states. species 8472 could be doing the same thing."
they're going to infiltrate the alpha quadrant.
maybe they already have.
tom's right. how else could they have gathered their information about us?
perhaps they've acquired it from the borg.
it doesn't matter how they got their data. we need to find out what they intend to do with it.
"if our previous experience is any indication, they will try to destroy earth."
a logical assumption. they did threaten to purge our galaxy of all life.
"tuvok, keep working on a way to target their habitat's power source. we're going to need nanoprobe warheads and plenty of them. seven, see to it."
"yes, captain."
"in the meantime, i've got a date to keep. i made contact with one of them, commander valerie archer. maybe i can capitalise on the relationship. get a better idea of what they're planning."
"tom, harry, take him back in the delta flyer. keep a constant transporter lock on him. if species 8472 attacks earth, the federation won't have any defences against them, and i don't need to remind you that we have no way to warn starfleet command. voyager may be the last defense against an all-out invasion of earth."
last minute preparations?
just planning my big night out.
i can recommend a nice japanese replimat on the embarcadero.
i was never very good with chopsticks.
"starfleet headquarters. brings back memories, even if it is just a re-creation. i remember my last visit there. i was given my general orders for voyager's first mission. proceed to the badlands and find the maquis."
the orders that brought us together.
what about you? when was the last time you were at headquarters?
"before today? march 3rd, 2368. the day i resigned my commission. i can still remember the look on the admiral's face."
which one?
nimembeh.
"he taught at the academy, didn't he?"
that's right.
"interspecies ethics, wasn't it?"
tactical analysis.
of course.
"kathryn, you think i might be one of them. you're testing me."
you and tuvok were in the alien habitat for nearly three hours. anything could have happened down there.
true. why don't you have tuvok meet us in sickbay. the doctor can perform a microcellular analysis.
tuvok's already there.
you could have just asked me to report to sickbay.
"given ensign gentry's reaction, i thought i'd be a little more tactful."
"not taking any chances, are you?"
don't feel singled out. i've asked the doctor to examine the entire crew. there's no telling how 8472 got their information about starfleet. from the borg? earth? for all we know there's been an impostor on board.
"cell morphology normal, all of your nucleotide sequences are accounted for. you're a hundred percent human."
that's a relief. and tuvok?
"green blooded vulcan through and through. well, two down, one hundred and twenty five to go."
you'd better get going.
right. i don't want to be late.
just be home before midnight.
"yes, ma'am."
i've enhanced this tricorder with a transoptic datalink. it should help you access some of their systems. type one phaser modified to fire borg nanoprobes.
right.
do you always arm yourself before a first date?
you've never had a date with species 8472.
"personally, i don't go out with girls from other galaxies."
"you're a true explorer, chakotay."
is she cute?
"in her human form, anyway."
i've always wondered what it would be like to date an alien.
i'll take notes.
we're making our approach.
all stop. shields up.
feisty little fellows. you've increased their cellular motility by over two hundred percent.
i thought it would be prudent to maximize their efficiency.
"seven, the last time we used nanoprobes we sent 8472 scurrying back to fluidic space. you can't get more efficient than that."
the species is highly adaptive. it's been over a year since our first encounter. they may have developed a defence against our technology.
"there's one way to find out. we can test the nanoprobes on our corpse. you'll find the body in morgue chamber three. beam it to the surgical bay. the creature's only been dead for a few hours, there should still be plenty of cellular activity."
"initiate a bio-scan, full spectrum. don't worry. it's an autonomic reflex. the creature still has residual bioelectric activity in its nervous system."
something's wrong. the nanoprobes should have taken effect by now.
hmm.
what is it?
the creature's nucleotides are still intact. it looks like your concerns were warranted. we'll have to inform the captain. we may have to
doctor.
false alarm.
i will replicate more nanoprobes.
"i don't mind telling you, seven, i'm still holding out for a diplomatic solution."
improbable. species 8472 will not respond to diplomacy.
"funny. we used to say the same thing about the borg. my point is, anything's possible if you keep an open mind. optimism, seven. try to look on the bright side."
it is difficult to be optimistic when we are preparing for battle.
"have you ever heard the phrase, the best defence is a good offence?"
no.
throughout human history weapons of mass destruction were often designed in the hopes that they'd never be used.
"and yet, in earth's third world war, nuclear weapons accounted for six hundred million casualties. were they looking on the bright side?"
an unfortunate exception.
we were just talking about you.
oh?
she didn't think you were going to show up.
boothby!
"i've known archer since she was a first year cadet. she's not easily impressed. i didn't think you were her type. oh, er, if you'll excuse me, i've got some midnight orchids that need my attention. think about what i said, young lady. you'll be fine."
"thank you, boothby."
problems?
i was offered a field commission this morning. first officer of the starship horcha.
congratulations.
it's a klingon vessel.
oh. so what did boothby say?
ducha me gagh roh. smile when you eat the gagh.
wise words.
yeah.
do you always seek advice from the groundskeeper?
"half the captains in starfleet wouldn't be where they are today if it weren't for boothby. lopez, picard, richardson, just to name a few. closing time."
you offered to be my guide. where's our next stop?
can you dance?
i've been accused of trying.
it's pon farr night at the vulcan nightclub.
vulcan?
it's just around the corner.
"take it easy, harry. we didn't build the delta flyer to withstand such extensive pacing."
he should have contacted us by now.
give him time.
four hours?
"it's a date. these things can't be rushed. they probably just finished dinner, a couple of drinks, and now they are moving past the polite stage."
polite stage? the last 8472 i met tried to dissolve me from the inside out.
"it was only trying to get to know you better, harry. you can't fault a person for that. look, chakotay can take care of himself. and if he can't, who better than us to come to the rescue?"
turns out the transporter malfunctioned. my uniform ended up in the pattern buffer.
you're kidding. you were naked?
not entirely. i had my commbadge.
"i hope it was well-placed. computer, lights."
so this is where they're putting up officers nowadays. not bad.
can i get you something to drink?
water's fine.
i'm beginning to think you're a teetotaller.
i like to stay in control.
"always at yellow alert, huh?"
something like that.
find anything interesting?
"beyond the galactic edge, humanity's quest for infinity. this is a 21st century edition of hesterman, isn't it?"
replicated. good book though.
never read it.
"you should. human beings, they're quite a paradox."
oh? how so.
"at first glance, they're so primitive. genetic impurities, no telepathy, violent and yet they've created so many beautiful ways to communicate their ideas. literature, art, music. at times, i've actually enjoyed being in this form. you must think i'm crazy."
not at all.
i wonder what they think about us?
hard to say.
i'll tell you what i think. they despise us. they'll attack any species that's not part of their federation. mmm. speaking of being in human form. i could use an isomorphic injection. you need one?
i'm fine.
make yourself at home.
commander. how do you like the view?
lovely.
looks like a full moon. you can see the entire bay on a night like this.
i should have brought my holo-imager. you make a pretty picture.
"mmm, feel that? salinated oxygen molecules, stimulating the epidermal and neural receptors. non-fluidic space has its charms."
no argument there.
planet earth. the simulation will be real soon enough.
how soon do you think?
"weeks, days. as soon as they think we're ready."
can i be honest with you?
please.
i'm starting to wonder if all this is worth the effort.
what do you mean?
"this simulation, our mission. are we certain the humans pose a threat?"
they were allies with the borg. they invaded our realm.
that was one incident. that doesn't mean the entire federation is planning a war against us.
we can't trust them. we have to prepare for the worst.
i'm not so sure.
i think you've been human a little too long.
"before you know it, i'll be sending my resume to the real starfleet."
alien from distant galaxy seeks employment. references available upon request.
"well, it's getting late. i'd better go."
already?
i have a tactical report to finish before morning.
"aren't we forgetting something? i'm no expert at human dating rituals, but i think it's customary to kiss good night. you've never done this before."
actually.
"me, neither. just think of it as part of our training."
report.
i analysed his dna. your suspicions were correct.
how much does he know?
it's difficult to say. he'll have to be interrogated.
where is he?
by now he should be in the main quad. i recommend we go to daylight. he'll be easier to track.
"chakotay to paris. delta flyer, respond! (he shoots a man who is running towards him, then runs himself. but soon he is surrounded by humanoid 8472, who grab him and take him away."
yes. come in.
the borg modifications are complete. nineteen standard photon torpedoes and three class tens armed with high-yield warheads.
more.
we ha've depleted our supply of nanoprobes.
replicate a new supply.
that is not possible.
"have the doctor extract them from your bloodstream. grow them in a petrie dish. whatever it takes. if we do engage 8472 i don't intend to run out of firepower mid-battle. you of all people should understand that. they killed, what, four million drones? directive zero one zero. before engaging alien species in battle, any and all attempts to make first contact and achieve non-military resolution must be made. in this case, we made first contact over a year ago and we barely got out of it alive. it seems to me a battle is inevitable, maybe even war. so why can't i get that directive out of my mind?"
this species intends to purge our galaxy of all life. it's time you resisted your starfleet philosophy.
captain to the bridge.
the away team is hailing us.
tom.
"chakotay's in trouble. he tried to contact us ten minutes ago, but his signal was cut off."
has your vessel been detected?
"i don't think so. at least, no one's tried to take a shot at us yet."
hold your position. keep trying to locate him. we're on our way.
"yes, ma'am."
bring those borg weapons online. red alert. all hands to battle stations. take us out of orbit.
i thought you had a tactical report to finish.
"what'll you have, son? i'm a single malt man, myself. aged two hundred years. been saving it for a special occasion, and i'd say this is special enough. a toast. to earth. chakotay. rank, commander. starfleet service number forty seven alpha six one two. first officer, uss voyager."
"species 8472. origin, fluidic space."
"well, now that we've been formally introduced, how many ships? cat got your tongue? i asked you a question. how many vessels do you have in the delta quadrant?"
one.
how did you find us?
we detected what looked like a federation subspace transmission. it took us weeks to track it here.
"we wanted this simulation to be accurate to the last detail. we obviously went a little too far. now that you know about our re-creation, you've no doubt alerted the federation. your fleet will be on its way."
you've got it wrong. we're not planning a war against you.
"is that why you were here to spy on us, because you're curious?"
"sir, a starship is approaching. it's voyager."
"raise our shields. stand by, all weapons."
captain janeway is not here to launch an attack. she's here to find me.
we've got the real mccoy here. we might as well take advantage of it. perform a genetic extraction. it may help us find a better way to maintain these human forms.
"yes, sir."
we are approaching the habitat.
"shields to maximum. charge weapons. all hands, this is the bridge. tactical alert. report to your posts and stand by to engage the enemy."
i have a visual. we're being scanned.
let them take a look.
the delta flyer is heading up from the habitat.
"open a channel. tom, status?"
"they've taken a couple of pot-shots at us, captain. we've lost our shields. mind if we join you?"
you're clear to dock. shuttlebay two. any word from chakotay?
i'm afraid not.
bring us within range. target their weapons array.
"captain, we should target their power systems as well."
"no, i don't want to risk shutting down their life support. if we can end this without casualties, so much the better."
this species does not deserve our compassion.
you picked a lousy time for an ethical debate. the weapons array. now.
we're entering weapons range. thirty eight hundred kilometres. thirty five hundred. thirty two hundred.
valerie.
that's not my name.
"then what is it? you're afraid of us, aren't you. you think we're violent, that we're planning to destroy your species, but none of that's true. if you would take the time to speak to us directly, we could prove it to you. there are no secrets except the secrets that keep themselves."
shaw.
george bernard shaw. i saw a copy of his collected works on your bookshelf.
"he had a complex mind, for a human."
"and he had a point. as long as we keep spying on each other, making assumptions, we probably will go to war."
voyager.
they're charging weapons.
do the same.
we're being hailed.
mister boothby.
captain janeway.
good to see you after all these years. enjoying the delta quadrant?
"don't get sassy with me, young lady. this re-creation may be starfleet but our weapons are far more sophisticated. i can destroy your vessel with a single command. run along now."
"i'm not going anywhere. not until you return my first officer and give me a damn good explanation for what you're doing in our galaxy. i've targeted your re-creation with borg nanoprobes, and we're willing to use them if you force us to."
don't try to rattle my cage. i'll disable your tactical systems before you can
"the last time our species engaged in battle, you suffered heavy casualties. are you willing to take that chance again? an armed conflict isn't going to solve our problems. we could go on making threats, spying on each other, risking a war between our species. or we could try a more direct approach."
what do you have in mind?
how about a class reunion?
"targ manure! united federation of planets, tolerance for all species, the prime directive. targ manure, every word of it."
"your metaphor is colourful, but inaccurate."
vulcan logic. add that to the list.
"obviously, you've studied a starfleet database. you must have learned something about our history. we adhere to our directives."
"high-minded ideals are one thing, but your actions tell a very different story. you infiltrated our re-creation, captured and killed one of our people."
"i told you, he took his own life."
you created biological weapons to infect our species. you are allies with the borg.
"there's a drone sitting at this very table. look at her, all gussied up to look like a human being."
i am no longer part of the collective.
"once a borg, always a borg."
seven of nine is a member of this crew.
the borg are irrelevant. it's the humans that pose a threat.
they think the federation is a hostile invasion force out to destroy their species.
i see. so you're planning a pre-emptive strike against earth.
maybe i am.
you realise i can't let that happen.
"go ahead, fire your damn nanoprobes. blow our re-creation to high heavens. there are a dozen more scattered throughout the quadrant. you'll never find them all."
what if i told you that starfleet isn't planning an invasion? that no one on earth has even heard of you?
i'd say you're lying.
have another look at that federation database of yours. you'll see there's no mention of your realm.
immaterial. any information regarding our species has no doubt been classified by starfleet intelligence.
"good point. you know, we could keep this paranoid debate going all day. you have no reason to trust us and we have no reason to trust you."
"hear, hear. i knew this reunion would be a fiasco. admiral."
"seven, disarm the warheads do it,"
captain?
do it.
"what are you trying to prove, young lady?"
one of us has to take our finger off the trigger. it might as well be me.
their weapons are offline.
it's a trick.
"our defences are down. what will you do now? blow voyager to high heavens, or do we keep talking?"
"humans. you've got a flair for the dramatic, i'll give you that. you want to keep talking? fine by me, but no more beating around the bush. now, what do you want from us? the truth, captain."
voyager is alone in the delta quadrant. we haven't been in contact with earth for over four years.
"explain why you attacked our realm, hand in hand with the borg."
"at the time, we didn't realise the borg had started the war against you. we forged a temporary alliance with them because we thought you were the threat."
your galaxy will be purged. sound familiar?
we were only trying to defend ourselves.
"if that's true, why are you still in our galaxy? your conflict with the borg ended over a year ago."
"why re-create starfleet, masquerade as humans? it looks to me like you're the ones planning an invasion. the truth."
don't answer her. she's manipulating us.
"if you won't answer, i will."
commander.
"our mission is to infiltrate your home world, to place operatives in the highest levels of starfleet, monitor your military installations. it's a reconnaissance mission, nothing more."
"we should listen to her, captain. they're being driven by fear just like we are. unless everything you said on our date was just part of an act."
it wasn't.
enough! we must not negotiate with these creatures.
"sit down, admiral."
sir.
"i said sit down, or i'll knock you right on your human butt."
"you've been seduced by them, both of you."
"i've had a chance to see through human eyes and i'm beginning to wonder, are they really so violent? what if we're wrong?"
we can't risk trusting them.
you'd rather risk another war?
"keep talking, son."
"archer's right. we've got to set aside our preconceptions about each other. granted, our species didn't meet under the best of circumstances, but maybe we can make first contact again. maybe this time we'll get it right."
you believe in this fellow?
yes.
there would have to be a few ground rules.
name them.
"first off, i want to take a look at that nanoprobe technology. it scares the hell out of me."
"all right, but i'll need some tactical information in return. your genetic alteration techniques for a start."
"i'm sure something can be arranged. you on board, admiral? good enough for me."
the design schematic for our nanoprobe weapons as requested.
this could go a long way toward allaying their fears.
perhaps.
"have a little faith, seven."
it's difficult to have faith in an idea which may prove tactically unsound.
tactically unsound? perhaps. it could also be the first step toward peace. it's a risk i'm willing to take. are you sure you won't join us? it would be your first chance to see earth.
i prefer to remain aboard voyager. if problems arise while you're in the habitat
"there won't be any problems. nothing tactical, at any rate. we're entering a stage of diplomacy where most of the problems will be cultural. how do you shake hands with an 8472? we'll be fine."
"when you ordered me to disarm the warhead during the negotiation, i anticipated an immediate attack. i believed they would take advantage of your human weakness. i was wrong. if i had been in your position, we would most likely be engaged in a battle with 8472 at this moment. how did you know?"
i didn't. like i said.
faith.
"welcome to terrasphere eight, starfleet command re-creation. i am admiral bullock and i'll be acquainting you with our facility. questions, comments bring them to me. problems talk to lieutenant kinis. commander tuvok, you wanted to examine our thermionic generators."
yes.
i'll take you there personally. ambassador nelix?
"it's neelix, sir."
neelix. you'll be joining the lieutenant. he'll familiarise you with our environmental control technology.
wonderful. i look forward to hearing your perspective on vulcans.
"you didn't happen to re-create a little coffee shop on market street, the night owl?"
afraid not. you're welcome to stay. put your feet up. we won't be returning to fluidic space for another day or two.
"thank you, but the real earth is a long way from here. i'd like to get back on the road. what are the chances they'll listen to you?"
"i can't promise you the moon, captain. my superiors aren't as forward thinking. peace with humans? wow. they're going to hit the roof. but i'll tell them what happened here today, and with a pinch of luck a few of them might see the light."
"well, you've got voyager's comm. frequency. you know how to contact us. i hope we can keep this process alive."
"don't call us, we'll call you. oh, i almost forgot. ahh."
"genetically synthesised, but they smell just as lovely."
oh.
looking forward to going home?
at least i can finally get out of this form.
no more insomnia.
"no more sleeping, period."
"for what it's worth, you made a terrific human."
shame.
hmm?
"it's too bad our species are so different, otherwise i'd ask you for a second date."
you did offer to be my guide. how about a tour of your realm sometime?
i'd like that.
"well, i'm due back on voyager. we leave at oh four hundred."
i'll never get a chance to do this again.
any better this time?
you're a quick study.
ouch!
wake up.
who's there?
naomi.
come back later.
you know what i think? i think you're scared of the tree monster.
"i'm not scared of any tree monster, miss wildman, but, as you know, i need my beauty sleep."
"sorry i woke you, but we have a mission."
"you and your missions. lucky for you, your old pal flotter has everything ready. follow me. i've laid a trap. when he climbs this tree, he'll trip the alarm. tree monsters are terrified of high-pitched noises."
i never heard that.
"oh, it's a well known fact. the bell will scare him high into those branches where counterweights will bend the treetop till it springs back, catapulting him pond-ward and, splash! he'll sink like a log."
"but flotter, logs float."
"details, details."
that is a terrible plan.
it's him!
the name's trevis. and you are?
flotter. flotter t. water iii.
"well, of course you are, drippy. you."
"naomi wildman, but my friends call me naomi."
i don't recognise your element. you're not earth or water or plasma.
i'm human.
where do you live?
in space.
nobody lives in space.
she does. on a starship called voyager.
i'm an explorer.
really? an explorer. timber.  what's that like?
"well, you know, space battles with aliens, strange anomalies."
may i visit your starship?
"well, i'll have to ask my mom."
"you know, for a monster, you're very polite."
that's because i'm not a monster.
you see that? i'm not scared one bit. my bark is worse than my bite.
maybe we jumped to conclusions about him.
"well, he may not be a monster, but he is stealing my water with his roots."
"stealing? absurd. why, i ought to dry you up."
and i ought to chop you down!
you want a piece of me?
"excuse me! it sounds like you two need each other. i mean, think about it. flotter, your water helps his trees grow, and trevis, your branches shade his pond from the sun. it's a well-known fact that the sun makes water evaporate."
she's got a point.
the girl's a thinker.
"now, shake hands and make up."
urgh. moist palms.
"urgh, sappy fingers."
neelix to holodeck two.
naomi here.
it's bedtime.
can't i stay a little longer?
you know the rules.
"besides, someone special wants to say good night."
"mom! computer, end programme."
and how's flotter?
"grouchy as ever, but we made a new friend today named trevis. i'll introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home."
"i'm afraid the away mission may take a few more days, sweetheart."
days?
"yes, but i'm bringing you back some beautiful sillinite crystals and lots of holo-pictures for your data album. now be a good girl and get ready for bed while i talk to neelix."
all right.
sweet dreams.
samantha?
we ran into an ion storm.
how bad is it?
"we took a real beating. we're trying to make repairs, but there's another storm on the way. better go. say goodnight for me"
i've lost the comm. signal.
a level seven ionic front is closing aft at thirty three thousand kph.
i need more power to the thrusters if i'm going to outrun it.
i'll see what i can do.
the leading edge is approaching.
"i've given you all the power i can spare, tom."
it's not enough. i can't keep ahead of this thing. brace for impact!
"mayday, mayday. delta flyer to voyager. need assistance. warp drive is. impulse power is down. thrusters only. the ion storms damaged the primary systems. life support is failing. searching for an emergency landing site. require immediate assistance."
that was their last transmission. we haven't been able to raise them since.
"if they're looking for a place to land, they must be in pretty bad shape."
anything on long range sensors?
"we lost their signature when the second ion storm hit, but we've triangulated the co-ordinates of the distress call. they've entered a planetary system about point six light years from here."
"the problem is there's another ion storm, a level five, blocking our path."
level five? we've been through worse. let's just batten down the hatches and reinforce the shields. we're not going to let a little bad weather stand in our way.
what about naomi?
i guess somebody's going to have to explain why her mother's not back.
maybe we shouldn't tell her anything.
why not?
"she's a very sensitive girl. i don't want to alarm her unnecessarily. with any luck, we'll have her mother back before she starts to worry."
"well, you're closer to her than anyone. i'm inclined to let you take the lead on this."
"thanks, captain."
all right. consider it your mission to keep her occupied.
"aye, captain."
dismissed.
i was thinking.
oh?
it's time i carried my weight around here.
ah. they could use a hand in the airponics bay.
i was thinking more of the bridge.
captain's assistant.
would i get to fly the ship?
"well, we'd have to take it up with the captain."
need to check the internal sensors.
"neelix, don't move."
what's wrong?
the borg lady.
"she has a name, you know."
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. don't look! she'll assimilate you."
"naomi, seven is a nice person, and she's a valuable member of this crew."
i don't want to be in her collective.
i don't think there's much danger of that.
"hey, neelix. hey, naomi. neelix, can i talk with you?"
yes. i'll be right back.
sickbay's running short on emergency medkits. we're going to need a few more if we send another away team after the shuttle.
i've got half a dozen stockpiled in cargo bay two.
how is she?
"on the naomi anxiety scale of one to ten, where one is a touch of insomnia and ten is a panic attack? about five."
is this chair occupied? yes or no would suffice.
"no. i mean, yes."
explain.
you can't sit here. somebody else is sitting here.
very well.
"so, i thought we'd pay another visit to sickbay. the doctor says he has time to give you a botany lesson. what's wrong?"
i am borg.
"no, you're not."
can we go to the holodeck first? i want to play another flotter story.
"well, the doctor's expecting you."
i don't like sickbay.
why not?
it's full of creepy things. alien organs and hyposprays.
"well, that's not true."
and the doctor talks too much.
"well, that's his way."
can't you reprogramme him or something?
"oh, i don't think he'd like that very much. come on."
rumour has it there's a planetoid around here.
"sorry, tom. the storm is throwing off my readings. there's definitely a big rock nearby, i just can't find it."
the wave front is accelerating.
how long till it hits us?
less than two minutes.
"gives me thirty seconds to land this thing. samantha, i don't mean to rush you."
"got it. class m atmosphere, nickel-iron core, bemonite mantle."
"bemonite. i want to land this shuttle, not bury it."
"seventy three thousand kilometres, bearing zero mark four."
we've entered the upper atmosphere.
"nothing but impact craters, volcanoes. we can't land here."
the storm is closing. increasing shields to maximum.
just keep us away from the volcanoes and we'll be okay.
"i've got a big meteor crater, five hundred kilometres across, three point seven deep."
i'll take it.
starboard thrusters are down.
"tuvok, if you don't have something positive to say."
we're coming in too fast!
hang on!
the flyer has landed.
she needs immediate medical assistance.
what happened?
we made it.
delta flyer's first landing. where?
about three kilometres beneath the surface. at least our primary hull's still in one piece.
wish i felt the same.
"you'll be all right. minor concussion, a few fractures. nothing i can't handle."
"you're a great nurse, but you're a lousy liar."
"you've got a punctured kidney, and you're bleeding internally. you need surgery."
voyager?
i've transmitted another distress call. no response.
it's all this rock.
i've got to talk to naomi. let her know we're okay.
"conserve your strength, ensign. mister paris and i have the situation under control."
"nice bedside manner, tuvok. sam, i'm going to give you a mild sedative and something for the pain. any chance we could abandon the shuttle, make our way on foot?"
"unlikely. not only are we buried under several kilotons of rock, but the atmosphere in this cavern is flooded with fluorine gas."
nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the view.
i'm detecting a residual impulse signature in the upper atmosphere.
try to pinpoint their location.
how's our littlest crew member?
"she misses her mother, but i don't think she suspects anything. i was just about to take her to the holodeck for some more storytelling."
"call me an optimist, neelix, but i'm still counting on a happy ending."
"me, too."
got it. the impulse wake leads to the northern hemisphere. coordinates one twenty one mark sixteen.
any sign of them?
"plasma fires, hull fragments. either they vaporised on impact or they're buried beneath the surface."
any life signs? maybe they beamed out before the crash.
"harry, anything?"
nothing.
"we built the delta flyer to take a lot of punishment. i'm betting it held together. commander, take rescue teams down to that crater. if sensors can't find them, we'll have to do it the hard way."
harry.
"now, see the organelle just over there? the one that looks like a little bitty potato?"
the mitochondria?
yes.
mitochondria. the warp core of the cell.
"exactly. now what if i told you that this fellow was invited to dinner, but never got around to leaving?"
what do you mean?
"well, turn back the clock a few billion years to when cells first evolved. these early cells had no mitochondria. they struggled along without them, making do with whatever energy sources they could find. then, one day a mitochondrial ancestor arrived, broke though the cell wall, and made himself at home."
they became friends?
the correct term is symbiosis.
friends.
friends.
my mom says cooperation is more important than competition.
mmm hmm.
she was supposed to call me today.
"well, she's probably just a little busy. now, let's have a look at the cell wall. it looks simple enough, but believe you me there's more here than meets the eye."
can we try to call her?
"neelix, what a pleasure to see you!"
how was school today?
good.
"there's a time for school, and there's a time for"
flotter!
aren't you forgetting something?
"oh. thank you, doctor."
"you're quite welcome, miss wildman."
in the blink of an eye there was trevis above us.
then what happened?
he turned out to be very nice. his bark was worse than his bite.
where did you learn to make such silly puns?
you.
oh.
"neelix, did you have a favourite holodeck programme when you were growing up?"
"well, we didn't have holodecks on rinax, but it didn't matter because we had a great big forest right behind my house."
really?
and my sisters and i would go exploring every day. we'd make up our own stories.
imagination.
exactly.
"deck six, section nine. where are your sisters now?"
"oh, they're far away from here. i haven't seen them in a very long time."
how long?
many years.
but you haven't been on voyager for that long.
"true, but before that, my work as a trader kept me away from home."
that's too bad.
do your sisters ever call you like my mom does when she's on an away mission?
no.
i bet you miss them.
"i do, very much. here we are. computer, display chapter headings, the adventures of flotter. let's see. ah, flotter and the tree monster?"
played that one yesterday.
okay. trevis and the terribly twisted trunk.
i promised i'd save that one for mom. it's her favourite.
"flotter, trevis and the ogre of fire."
"yeah, that one."
it sounds a little scary.
it's okay. i won't be scared if you're with me.
"once upon a time in the forest of forever, flotter and trevis encountered a strange element they'd never seen before."
"trevis, you're on fire!"
"i told him not to touch it, but this blockhead never listens."
stop complaining and help him.
me?
water puts out fire.
"oh, thank you!"
"hey, it worked! watch this."
"good thinking, naomi."
who's the furball?
the name's neelix.
what caused the fire?
it came from up there.
in a flash.
lightning. but the sky is clear. doesn't look like a thunderstorm.
"what's your theory, naomi?"
there's only one other explanation. the ogre of fire.
the ogre?
of fire.
who's he?
"he is me, and i'm going to burn this forest to the ground!"
flotter!
"maybe, maybe we should play another programme."
"no, we have to find flotter. hello, is anyone there?"
over here.
"trevis, are you all right?"
ah hah. a little hot under the bark maybe.
what about flotter? is he dead? neelix?
"well, i, i don't know."
he can't be dead. flotter!
i think it's your bedtime.
but i want to find flotter.
"now, don't argue with your godfather. come on, now."
take this to lieutenant torres. you'll find the phaser drills in cargo bay three.
"aye, sir."
are you sure you have time for this? i know you're busy.
no problem. glad to be of service.
maybe a shade bluer. and the head's a little disproportionate don't you think?
"we're not shooting for an exact replica, neelix. artistic license."
sorry. guess i shouldn't barge into your kitchen and tell you how to cook.
flotter. now there's a name i haven't heard in a while. i used to be nuts about those holostories when i was a kid. did you see the one where flotter suspects trevis to be a rubber tree?
not yet.
"he keeps trying to trip him to see if he'll bounce. yeah, those two were a lot of fun."
"actually, the last scenario that naomi chose was pretty frightening. no fun at all."
kids love to be scared.
not naomi.
"computer, transfer the design parameters to the replicator. how's she holding up?"
fine. right now she's busy with her homework.
"neelix, what's wrong?"
"everything. everything's wrong! ion storms, crash landings, alien attacks. a starship's no place for a child."
i don't know. i'd say naomi's pretty lucky to be growing up on voyager.
lucky?
"think about it. think about all the things she's experienced, stars being born, supernovas, lifeforms no one from the alpha quadrant has seen before. when i was a kid i would have given anything for a chance like this. well, here goes."
"hi, neelix. did you miss me? you know, i forgot how ugly this guy was."
"thanks, ensign."
naomi. guess who i found in the replicator?
"thanks, but that's not really flotter."
flotter's not really flotter. he's just a holodeck character. what are you working on?
i'm researching the evaporation of water.
why?
"well, i've been thinking. water doesn't just disappear when it's heated. it turns into invisible gas. so, if we could get the forest to cool down enough, flotter might re-liquefy."
clever.
i miss mom.
i know you do.
when's she coming back?
soon.
why hasn't she called?
"she must be very busy, cataloguing all the geological specimens she's collected."
has anybody talked to her?
"well, not in a day or two, but."
starfleet regulation four seven six dash nine. all away teams must report to the bridge at least once every twenty four hours.
you really are going to make an excellent captain's assistant.
has something bad happened to them?
"i'm sure everything's fine. come on, now. bed."
promise to wake me up if mommy calls?
promise.
even if it's oh two hundred hours?
even if it's oh two hundred hours. sweet dreams.
neelix?
"computer, access personal database, neelix. file index two nine one. hello, alixia. i'm sorry it's been so many weeks since i've thought about you, but we've been very busy here on voyager. i miss you. my goddaughter, naomi, she's in trouble. we're in trouble. she may lose her mother. alixia, you always knew the right thing to do, the right thing to say. i wish you were here to help me."
come on! hurry! we're under attack!
get up! the metreon cascade! run!
"computer, switch to polythermal imaging and enhance resolution. neelix, do you require assistance?"
"no. no, i was just passing by. i thought i'd pay you a visit, see how things were going. how are things going?"
i'm mapping the caverns surrounding the crash site.
how far do they extend?
approximately thirty seven kilometres.
what about the search? anything new?
"every scan reveals something new, but as yet little of relevance."
"seven. your family, your human family, do you ever think about them?"
infrequently. i was only six years old when i was assimilated.
not much older than naomi is now. do you miss your parents?
i barely remember them.
maybe that's a blessing.
rescue team alpha to seven of nine.
"yes, commander."
we need that data.
i will meet you at the transporter site. i adapted. the child naomi will adapt as well.
borg wisdom.
"lieutenant, get me an update from beta team. they haven't checking in for over an hour."
"coffee, anyone? captain?"
"no thanks, i've had enough. one more cup and i'll jump to warp."
any new?
i'm afraid not.
no debris? no lifesigns?
"we've got three teams beneath the surface. so far, nothing."
so much for that happy ending.
"we'll turn that planetoid inside out if we have to, but i think we have to be prepared for the worst. maybe it's time you told naomi."
"no, not yet."
she's an astute girl. she must be aware that something's wrong by now.
she's been asking a lot of tough questions. why hasn't her mother filed a status report? what if she's in trouble? but i've got a big day planned for her tomorrow. plenty of distractions. she won't have time to be worried.
"your mission was to keep her occupied, not to lie to her. first thing in the morning, i want you to explain the situation."
i don't think that's such a good idea.
why not?
"like i told you, she's sensitive."
all the more reason to answer her questions.
"with all due respect, captain, i'm her godfather. i know what's best for her."
neelix.
"i realise you care about naomi and you are only trying to protect her, but you've got to tell her the truth."
"good morning, naomi. would you like some papalla juice with your cereal? and, oh, by the way, your mother is buried under thirty kilotons of rock."
neelix.
"when we know something for sure. when we find her mother, alive or dead, i'll, i'll tell her then. not before."
"if you can't do it, i will."
"you don't have the right. you don't understand what's at stake here! when you were her age you were safe and sound on earth with two healthy parents to take care of you. you never had to worry about the possibility of being alone! you take it from me, you wouldn't have liked it."
"oh, i know. you must identify with naomi's situation."
"when my family was killed, i lost everything. i still have nightmares. it hasn't been easy. i don't want naomi to go through what i did."
i understand. and you're right. but this situation is different.
how so?
"naomi has you. neelix, she has to be told. but i know she'll be better off having you here to help her through it."
first thing in the morning.
"we've got a few hours until then. why don't you come back on the bridge, give us a hand."
"ready, tuvok?"
ready.
cross your fingers.
the magnetic relays have overloaded.
"well, we'd better find another way to polarise this hull, or their sensors won't be able to pick us up."
we're never getting out of here.
"do not give up hope. the probability of our being rescued is low, but not statistically impossible."
comforting.
who's going to look after naomi?
you should not concern yourself with that now.
how can you say that?
"my youngest child has been without a father for four years, yet i am certain of her well-being, that i conveyed my values to her before leaving. and i have confidence in the integrity of those around her. you have been an exemplary mother to naomi, and she is in the hands of people you trust. she will survive and prosper, no matter what becomes of us."
"thanks, tuvok."
"mom! neelix? computer, locate neelix."
neelix is on the bridge.
thanks.
"strickler, we need three more phaser drills. you two, pattern enhancers and medkits."
"aye, sir."
we're going to have to recalibrate these tricorders.
put us with the alpha team.
setting coordinates.
energise.
deck one bridge.
chakotay to voyager. we've found what looks like a piece of the starboard nacelle.
any sign of the shuttle itself?
not yet.
"captain, the cavern has collapsed ahead of us. however, i am reading a hull signature behind the debris."
the flyer?
i'll need to take a closer reading.
do it. i want alpha and beta teams to search for survivors. tell sickbay to stand by for heavy casualties.
naomi. naomi?
"naomi! computer, locate naomi wildman."
naomi wildman is in her quarters.
clever.
"computer, resume programme, flotter, trevis and the ogre of fire."
programme activated.
"commander, i'm reading duranium alloys. i believe it is the shuttle. approximately eighty metres beneath this rubble."
lifesigns?
"none. commander, without lifesigns to lock onto we cannot beam the crew out."
maybe we can transport the entire ship to the shuttle bay.
through fifty kilotons of bemonite?
chakotay to voyager.
janeway here.
"we think we've found the shuttle, but we need to dig it out."
have all teams rendezvous at my coordinates.
acknowledged.
phaser drills here and here.
"but hey, b'elanna, look on the bright side. no more day-old pizza laying around, and you'll never have to watch another chapter of captain proton again."
warning. life support has fallen to critical levels.
don't mind the computer. she's just jealous that i'm spending my last few minutes talking to you. so long.
"sam, it's your turn."
"i haven't thought what to say yet. tuvok, why don't you go next?"
i prefer to make my farewells in written form.
"computer, begin recording. encode message for delivery to naomi wildman."
acknowledged.
"hi, honey. i know you're feeling sad right now but, i want you to listen to me very carefully, okay? first of all, i love you. second, i want you to know that i'm proud of you. how smart you are, how funny, how kind you are to other people, and i know that you are going to grow up to do extraordinary things. last, and i know this is a hard one, try not to be scared."
warning. oxygen depletion in ten minutes.
"listen to neelix. he'll be taking care of you now. bye, honey."
naomi?
go away!
where is she?
she doesn't want to talk to you.
you lied.
i thought you vaporised.
naomi re-liquefied me. now leave.
"computer, delete characters."
unable to comply. holodeck controls have been encoded.
delete us?
i wonder if this liar can swim?
we can always hang him from one of my branches.
"naomi, please let me talk to you."
it's okay.
you be nice.
no more lying.
hey there.
is my mother dead?
we don't know.
what happened?
the away team was trying to avoid an ion storm. they had to land on a planet.
i saw that crater. something was burning.
"plasma fires, pieces of debris, but not the hull. until we know for sure what's happened, no one's giving up on the rescue attempt."
you really think they might find her?
yes.
how do i know you're telling me the truth this time?
"i never told you this before, but when i was much younger i lost my mom in a terrible war. my father and my sisters too. it was the worst thing that ever happened to me. always wondering, how did they die? were they worried about me? could they still be alive? i thought if i could just keep you from wondering, you wouldn't have to feel what i did."
you were pretending that nothing was wrong. that nothing bad happened. do you ever pretend that nothing bad happened to your family?
sometimes.
does it help?
not really.
"don't be sad, neelix."
all hands to emergency stations. we've got a level eight ion storm approaching.
ion storm? what's that?
ogre of fire! he's attacking us again.
you'd better get back to your quarters.
"naomi, don't leave us."
"i'll be back, i promise."
voyager to chakotay.
go ahead.
"we've got another ion storm approaching. when it hits the planetoid, your entire cavern is going to destabilise."
just a few more metres and we'll be close enough to beam out the shuttle. how long before the storm hits?
six minutes.
make the most of it. it's all you've got.
the storm's moving in. shields down to eighty six percent.
"keep the transporter lock on the away team. give them to the last second. helm, lay in a course out of here. stand by to engage at warp two."
"aye, sir."
warning. oxygen depletion in two minutes.
i never thought it would come down to this. suffocating beneath kilotons of rock on some nameless planetoid.
did you envision a more heroic death?
i didn't envision dying at all.
"in accepting the inevitable, one finds peace."
"if that's another vulcan saying, tuvok, i'll stick with live long and prosper."
we're here. we're here!
chakotay to voyager.
"yes, commander."
pattern enhancers are in place. we're ready to transport the flyer.
locking on. they're in the shuttlebay.
"helm, engage."
thank you.
"and how are you today, mister trevis?"
"feeling a little stiff, my slippery friend. and you?"
"now that you mention it, i'm feeling a little washed out."
"well, it's about time you showed up. the tea is getting cold."
samantha? is it really you?
long time no see.
you're all grown up.
i'm an ensign now.
i've missed you.
likewise.
"well, now that you're all reacquainted, i think you're all eager for a new adventure."
"now that you mention it, there is a castle that i've been meaning to explore."
castle?
i hear a giant beetle lives there.
"come on, neelix."
you go ahead.
see you later.
here's to happy endings.
captain!
just checking on my future captain's assistant.
"right now, she's off to conquer a giant beetle."
"oh, sounds like a dangerous mission."
she can handle it.
"she's a courageous girl. did i ever tell you about the time i flooded this entire forest? i was six years old. flotter claimed we were in for a dry spell so i came up with the obvious solution. why not just divert the river? this entire forest was a swamp by the time we were done. at which point, stinger was born."
stinger?
the biggest mosquito.
we're here!
the glacier fractures are stable.
we're clear to beam inside.
acknowledged.
not exactly the way i remember it.
power grid's been destroyed. neural gel packs frozen solid. decks nine through fourteen are now deck ten. they've been compacted.
looks like they hit the ice at full impulse. the emh?
i'm trying to access sickbay. the relays aren't responding. i'm losing the interface. reset the power cell. come on!
let's get moving. keep an open comm. link.
chakotay to tessa.
go ahead.
i've found her. lock on to the
transporter relay and beam her to the lab.
stand by.
make it quick. this isn't exactly a happy reunion.
i've got a lock.
please state the nature of
long time no see.
ensign.
i go by harry now. it's a long story. where's your mobile emitter?
what's happened to the ship? the crew?
no time. the emitter.
"it's in here, but"
here. slap it on. ket's go.
wait! i demand an explanation.
i'll give you one. we're here to change history.
"ladies and gentlemen, please. may i introduce the next generation of instellar propulsion, the quantum slipstream drive. four years, two months, eleven days. that's precisely how long voyager's been in the delta quadrant. during that time we've advanced the frontiers of exploration, and more importantly, we've survived. now it's time to go home. enjoy the celebration but keep in mind we've still got a lot of work to do before tomorrow's flight. go easy on that champagne, lieutenant."
"quantum matrix, benamite crystals, borg technology. can you imagine what starfleet is going to say?"
i don't think we'll hear any complaints. the federation's first slipstream drive. they'll probably nominate us for the cochrane medal of honour.
i'll start working on my acceptance speech.
i'd like to thank the borg collective.
dinner plans?
nothing special. date with a replicator.
"cancel it, that's an order."
"aye, captain."
lieutenant. lieutenant! excuse me. my contribution to the slipstream drive.
thanks. what is it?
"a talaxian fur fly. an old spacefaring tradition among my people. if one of these creatures stowed away on your ship, it was a sign of good fortune. i had this little fellow preserved. he hung in my engine room for six years."
cute.
"mister neelix, you are an unending source of astonishment."
"why, thank you, mister vulcan."
seven?
my visual processors and motor cortex. they are malfunctioning.
sounds like a problem with your cortical implant. we'd better have a look. hold still.
i cannot comply.
you're intoxicated.
impossible.
your blood synthehol level is point zero five percent. how many glasses of champagne did you consume?
one.
obviously the borg can't hold their liquor. come to sickbay. i'll give you some inaprovaline to counteract the effects.
i was simply trying to perfect my social skills as you instructed me to do.
and you're doing a fine job.
"you have always been of enormous assistance to me, doctor. you are my mentor."
yes.
we are as one. we are as one.
did you see that?
hmm?
"i think our drone did a little too much celebrating. speaking of which, when are you going to join the party?"
in a minute.
you're running a warp core diagnostic now?
"harry, i think we built an edsel."
a what?
a lemon. a disaster waiting to happen! i ran a simulation last night and i discovered a point four two phase variance in the slipstream threshold.
point four two? so it'll be a bumpy ride. we've flown through worse.
if we get knocked out of that slipstream mid-flight it could overload the quantum matrix.
did you tell the captain?
not yet. didn't want to spoil the festivities until i was sure.
"tom, if it'll make you feel better, we'll go to the holodeck right now, run a few more simulations. it's probably just a sensor glitch."
we're at full impulse.
"engaging slipstream drive. quantum field is stable, deflector at maximum."
"slipstream velocity in four, three, two. power output is steady. quantum field is holding."
shields down to seventy three percent.
looking good. keep that deflector aligned and we should be
"we've got a phase variance. point one, point two."
remodulate the deflector.
no effect. point four.
i'm shutting down the drive.
"no, wait. i want to try to invert the quantum field."
"it's no use, the slipstream is collapsing. inertial dampers are offline."
warning. hull breach on deck ten.
we're losing structural integrity.
"computer, freeze programme!"
one more time. i think if we reroute emergency power to the deflector a little earlier
it won't help.
"computer, restart simulation at time index"
"computer, belay that order. it's no use, harry."
we can't just give up.
"twenty three simulations, twenty three catastrophes. this is no sensor glitch. we've got to tell them."
that can't be right. we tested this engine molecule by molecule.
"i'm sorry, b'elanna."
i wish to examine the results of the simulation.
"holodeck two. run them for yourself. that is, if you don't mind being vaporised a few dozen times."
"i looked at their findings, captain. if we try to take that flight in the morning, we'll be in escape pods by afternoon."
it would appear we have no choice but to cancel it.
"either that or, we can try it harry's way."
ensign?
"i've got an idea. it's tricky, but i think it could work. the trouble begins about seventeen seconds into the flight. the phase variance kicks in and the slipstream becomes unstable. what we need is someone in a shuttle to ride the rapids in front of voyager."
"yes. they could map the threshold of the slipstream as it's forming and send the phase corrections back to us. that is a great idea, harry."
"now, here's the tricky part. the shuttle will only be a couple of seconds ahead of voyager. that doesn't give auto-navigation much time to compensate."
tom?
couple of seconds?
"we can do this, captain. put me on that shuttle. i'll get voyager through the slipstream. what choice do we have? take the drive offline? months of work for nothing?"
we built a highly experimental piece of technology. there were bound to be setbacks.
"the benamite crystals at the heart of this engine have already started to decay. it could take years to synthesise more. i don't know about the rest of you, but i didn't do all this work just to be stopped by a point four two phase variance. no offence, captain."
"none taken. all right, mister kim. you've convinced me. prepare a flight plan and have it on my desk within the hour."
"yes, ma'am."
i'll let you know what i decide.
"come in. commander, i hope you've got an appetite."
"famished, but i assumed you called me here to talk about the slipstream flight."
no reason to cancel our dinner plans. i've programmed a dish my grandmother used to make back on earth. vegetable biryani.
sounds delicious. i didn't know you could cook.
"normally, i draw the line at a pot of coffee, but tonight is a special occasion."
oh?
our last night in the delta quadrant. i'd say that's special enough.
you've made your decision.
we launch tomorrow at oh eight hundred. you and harry will take the delta flyer. voyager will be right behind you.
the crew will be pleased.
"you can give them the news yourself, after dessert. what about you, chakotay? what do you think about my decision?"
"i've analysed harry's flight plan. the theory is sound, but there are just too many variables. if something goes wrong in that slipstream"
it could be our only chance to use the quantum drive.
"true, but if you showed this data to any starfleet engineer, they'd think we were out of our minds. we can find another way home. we've waited this long."
"long enough. we've waited long enough. i know it's a risk, probably our biggest one yet, but i'm willing to take it. are you with me?"
always.
speaking of risks. are you ready to try some home cooking?
i'll alert sickbay.
fifteen years?
give or take a few weeks.
where are we?
"in the takara sector, just outside the alpha quadrant."
the crew?
"except for us, dead."
we think captain janeway tried to make an emergency landing on this planet. the ship must have been too heavily damaged. they were all killed on impact.
they've been buried inside a glacier for the past fifteen years.
"you two were here, on the delta flyer, ahead of voyager. you made it."
"all the way back to earth. we got home, doc, and all it took was killing everyone we cared about."
harry!
starfleet certainly took their time finding us.
starfleet. starfleet gave up their search for voyager over nine years ago. we had to find you on our own.
"well, i don't know what to say except thank you. i suppose i'd have stayed in that deep freeze forever."
we're not here to salvage your programme. we're here to prevent this disaster from ever happening.
"you see doc, fifteen years ago, i miscalculated the slipstream threshold and transmitted the wrong phase corrections to voyager. boom! they were knocked out of the slipstream and sent to an icy death. thank you, ensign kim. but i've had a long time to rethink my mistake, and now i know how to fix it. so, we're going to send voyager a new set of phase corrections."
isn't it a little late for that?
"we've found a way to communicate with voyager, in the past, just before the accident."
better late than never.
a message back through time?
exactly.
how?
i don't understand.
one of her cranial implants is a transceiver designed to communicate with other drones.
that's right. it's called an interplexing beacon.
we want you to extract the beacon and determine its translink frequency.
that shouldn't be a problem. she looks reasonably well-preserved.
good. that'll tell us where to send the message. now the hard part. we need to know when to send it. can you access seven's chronometric node and pinpoint the exact moment her cybernetic implants disengaged from her organic systems?
her time of death?
"down to the millisecond, if possible."
i'll see what i can do.
i told you he'd come in handy.
you said you'd found a way to communicate with seven in the past. how?
behold. salvage component three six six nine eight. a borg temporal transmitter.
starfleet intelligence found it in the wreckage of a borg cube in the beta quadrant.
we stole it.
trouble. long range sensors are picking up a federation vessel.
how much time do we have?
"i entered a low orbit and remodulated our shields, but it won't be long before they find us. six hours if we're lucky."
let me get this straight. you're fugitives?
"the galaxy's most wanted. we stole the delta flyer too, right out of a federation shipyard. we're wanted on two counts of high treason and conspiracy to violate the temporal prime directive."
wonderful. out of the icebox and into the fire.
we don't have time for this. get started.
"aye, sir."
we still have to retrieve those sensor logs. get ready.
"hello, doctor."
do i know you?
"no, but i feel like we're old friends. tessa omond."
hello.
it's an honour to finally meet voyager's infamous emh.
infamous?
i've told her a few horror stories.
"actually, they've always spoken very highly of you."
ah ha. and how did you get involved with bonnie and clyde here?
"oh, i've had an interest in voyager for a long time."
they're having sex.
pardon?
"chakotay and tess. they're a couple, joined at the hip."
"the truth is, doctor, i didn't want chakotay or harry to have to face this alone. i thought i could help."
ready?
stay warm.
these controls are a little clumsy. i thought you said this ship was state of the art.
"it was, at the time."
"i've located the sensor logs but, the computer is denying me access."
my command codes should still carry some weight.
looks like there's an active file here.
"but should our luck run out, i'd like to say for the record that the crew voyager acted distinction and valour."
you okay?
"yes. it's just the last time i was in this chair, they were all here. alive."
we're here to get them back.
can i see that tricorder?
it's downloading. give it a minute.
i don't supposed we have time for a tour.
"afraid not. besides, i left my quarters a mess. in just a few hours, if all goes as planned, we'll have changed history. the past fifteen years erased. we don't have to do this."
now you tell me.
i'm serious.
"so am i, and i have no intentions of backing out. chakotay."
"look at me. last minute jitters, cold feet, i don't know what to call it. ridiculous, isn't it? after all these years working toward this moment, and when it finally comes, all i can think about is losing you."
"your heart has always been here, on voyager. that'll never change. this is where you belong. and who knows, maybe we'll meet someday."
but if we don't.
then i'll miss you all the same.
it means all of that has changed. you owe me one.
"mister kim, your assistance please."
got to go.
what was that all about?
"oh, nothing. letter to a friend. how's it look?"
"no damage to the infrastructure, but i'll need an isoprobe."
"way ahead of you, doc."
"so what was it like, your homecoming?"
"antimatter fireworks, long-winded dignitaries, a vulcan children's choir. oh, we got medals pinned to our tunics. chakotay gave a speech commemorating the voyager crew. brought a tear to everyone's eye. admiral mcintyre even wanted me to marry his daughter."
at least you weren't buried under twenty metres of ice.
you don't know how many times i wished i was.
"i suppose it must have been difficult, with all your friends and colleagues left behind."
"survivor guilt. yeah, i heard a lot about that from the counsellors back at headquarters. you must learn to accept the fact that you lived. embrace life, move forward. i signed on at the first deep space vessel i could find. we tried to calculate where voyager might have fallen out of the slipstream. four years of searching. we were close, i could feel it! then starfleet command said it was time to end the search. low probability of success. all those admirals who shook my hand at the homecoming. i went to see every last one of them, begged them to keep the search alive. pretty soon even admiral mcintyre stopped returning my calls. so i resigned from starfleet."
"for the record, seven's translink frequency is one zero eight point four four two three six zero zero zero."
could be our lucky number. i'm encoding it now.
when did you embark on your life of crime?
the second i heard about this little gem.
"mister kim, did you ever stop to think about what you're trying to do here? altering the timeline may make things worse. at least you and chakotay survived. why tempt fate?"
this timeline only exists because i made a mistake fifteen years ago. the crew trusted in me and i let them down.
"tactical alert. vessel approaching, bearing one eight four mark seven."
they've found us. chakotay.
go ahead.
starfleet's on an intercept course. it's now or never.
we're on our way.
"if you're having doubts let me know. i'll take your programme offline. but if you're with us, we tempt fate together."
"to aid an honourable thief, or to spend eternity in cybernetic oblivion. let's tempt fate."
shield generators?
online.
plasma flow?
stable.
comm. link?
secure.
lunch.
salami sandwiches.
"feel up to this, ensign?"
"yes, sir."
chakotay to voyager. we're ready.
"all hands, this is the captain. take your stations, secure all systems, and stand by for the jump to slipstream."
i've established a telemetry link with the shuttle.
match their course and speed.
they're gaining on us. two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. you call these evasive manoeuvres?
"i'm doing my best. harry, status!"
the borg transmitter's online but i'm still waiting for the doctor to give me the temporal coordinates.
just a few more minutes.
speed it up. we've got a galaxy class starship on our tail.
i'm working as fast as i can.
they're hailing us. you want to talk to them?
could buy us some time. open a channel.
this is captain la forge of the starship challenger. you seem to be in quite a hurry.
you could say that.
"why don't you shut down those impulse engines, drop your shields. let's talk about this face-to-face."
mind if i take a rain check?
"as a matter of fact, i do. we know what you're about to attempt and we can't let that happen, so the federation council is willing to make you an offer. hand over the borg transmitter, stand down your vessel, and the charges of conspiracy will be dropped."
"that's not much of an offer. if we succeed, those charges will never have existed in the first place."
"if you succeed, countless lives will be affected."
we're here to save one hundred and fifty lives. our crew.
"i understand and i might be doing the same thing if i were in your position, but i've got my own crew to protect, not to mention fifteen years of history. so, i'm asking you again. stand down, and return the transmitter."
you know i can't do that.
and you know i have to try to stop you.
"yes, i know. good luck."
same to you.
they're targeting our engines.
shields to full. stand by weapons.
voyager to chakotay.
"yes, ma'am."
prepare to enter the slipstream.
acknowledged.
engage.
"slipstream velocity in four, three, two."
shields down to sixty two percent.
return fire.
"direct hit. no effect on their shields. we're no match for them, chakotay."
keep trying.
"i don't mean to be a pest, but we're losing power back here!"
hold on.
we're switching to emergency back-up.
"thank you. doc, i need those temporal coordinates now!"
badgering me won't help.
"i'm detecting a phase variance. point one, point two."
helm?
still waiting for harry.
point three.
voyager to delta flyer. we need those corrections or we'll have to
shut down the drive.
"we're on it, captain."
the threshold is fluctuating.
"okay, i can do this. i'm compensating for the spatial gradients. deflector geometry stable. got it!"
i'm receiving the phase corrections.
the phase variance is decreasing.
shields are holding
looks like we're on our way.
phase variance is increasing. point three. point four.
"harry, what's happening?"
the phase variance is still increasing.
"i'm not sure, captain. it should be working."
"i need an answer, harry. we're running out of time."
let me try recalibrating the sensors.
i might be overcompensating for the variance in the
we've lost our comm. link.
telemetry's down too. the slipstream's destabilising.
shut down the drive!
i can't. there's some kind of overload in the quantum matrix. i've lost helm control.
"i have it. her cybernetic systems were terminated on stardate 52164.3. borg time index: 9.43852. you're encoding the transmitter for time index 9.40? that's less than four minutes before voyager was destroyed! cutting it a little close, aren't we?"
"this is no ordinary phone call, doc, we're talking to yesterday. timing is everything. i want to make sure seven of nine gets the information at just the right moment. there. i'm bringing up the new phase corrections. this was where i failed fifteen years ago, doc. this time will be different."
"captain, i am receiving a transmission."
i thought you said the comm. link was down.
it is.
the signal is being routed through one of my cranial implants. it contains a new set of phase corrections.
does harry know how to access your borg systems?
no.
he must have figured out a way. enter the corrections.
they're not compensating for the phase variance. the slipstream is collapsing.
full power to the deflector.
no effect.
our hull is buckling!
"shields at maximum. hold her steady, tom."
"it's no use, we're losing attitude control. inertial dampers offline!"
what about the delta flyer?
there is no sign of them. they must have remained in the slipstream.
voyager's been thrown into normal space.
alter our slipstream course. we've got to go back.
"we can't. even if they survived re-entry at this velocity, we wouldn't."
what are you saying? we've got to find them!
"ensign, there's no choice."
"captain, we're just a few parsecs from the alpha quadrant."
not exactly how i wanted to cross the finish line.
"hull breach on decks five through ten. we're losing life support. if we don't land the ship, we're risking structural collapse."
i'm reading a planet nine million kilometres ahead. it's class l.
"do it. we're coming in too fast! reverse thrusters. all hands, brace for impact!"
we're still here. why are we still here?
mister kim?
the new phase corrections didn't work.
are you certain?
"if voyager had gotten through safely, we wouldn't still be here trying to save them. the transmitter's functioning. seven must have received our message. chakotay, problems."
i can see that.
our engines are down. they're locking onto us with a tractor beam.
full thrusters.
no effect.
"do we have enough power to send a plasma surge through their tractor beam, break ourselves free?"
"i think so, but the eps relays have taken heavy damage. it could destabilise the warp core."
"if you want to beam over to that ship, i'll understand."
and let you have all the fun?
"harry, we just bought you a few more minutes."
acknowledged.
"i'm no time travel expert, but can't we just call voyager again? the past isn't going anywhere."
"that's not going to help if we don't know what to tell them. the slipstream kinetics look right. hyperdimensional progressions, perfect. maybe it's the deflector geometry."
we're free.
"the eps relays are overloading. harry, we're looking at a possible core breach in less than three minutes. how's it"
coming back there?
"great, just great! it took me ten years to make these corrections. i can't fix it in three minutes!"
you've got to try.
i can't! it's not working. why won't it work? i killed them!
control yourself!
"they trusted me, and i killed them!"
"mister kim! i didn't spend all those years in an ice bucket so i could listen to you berate yourself. if you want to wallow in self-pity, fine! do it on your own time."
"don't you see? history's repeating itself! i destroyed voyager once, and i'm doing it again!"
"somebody has got to knuckle down and change history, and that somebody is you."
"it can't be done, doc. i told you."
"no, you told me you can't correct their phase variance. all right, we have to accept that. but what about sending voyager a warning? is there a way to get them to abort the slipstream flight?"
yes. yes! i could send a phase correction which would disperse the slipstream entirely.
"if we can't get the crew home, at least we can save their lives."
warning. warp core breach in sixty seconds.
can you eject the core?
no. emergency systems are offline.
la forge to delta flyer. our sensors are reading an overload in your warp matrix. lower your shields. we'll beam you out of there.
"i appreciate the offer, captain, but the answer's no. i suggest you get to a safe distance."
warning. warp core breach in forty five seconds.
"harry, now would be a good time."
mister kim.
it's losing power.
warning. warp core breach in thirty seconds.
your emitter. it's got its own power source.
will it be enough?
"it's our only chance. glad you could join us, doc."
it's been a pleasure.
warning. warp core breach in fifteen seconds.
"chakotay, i'm giving this one more try."
"warning. warp core breach in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two."
yes!
"captain, i am receiving a transmission."
i thought you said the comm. link was down.
it is.
the signal is being routed through one of my cranial implants. it contains a new set of phase corrections.
does harry know how to access your borg systems?
no.
he must have figured out a way. enter the corrections.
"captain, the quantum drive just went offline! we're dropping to impulse."
"captain, we've lost the slipstream."
the slipstream collapsed. we were thrown out right along with voyager.
our comm. system's back up.
delta flyer to voyager. what happened?
"you miscalculated, harry. we entered the exact phase corrections you sent to seven of nine. they shut down the quantum drive."
"captain, i didn't send any corrections to seven of nine."
she received a message through one of her cranial implants. it wasn't you?
"no, ma'am."
at ease. am i interrupting?
no. i just came here to try to figure things out.
phase corrections.
"the corrections i sent you were wrong. if you had used them, voyager would have been heavily damaged, maybe even destroyed. what i can't figure out is who sent the other phase corrections to seven of nine."
looks like we've got a guardian angel.
"oh, i wish i could believe that."
believe it. his name is harry kim.
captain?
seven found a starfleet security code embedded in the transmission. yours.
"i'm telling you, i didn't send it."
"not yet. the transmission had a temporal displacement. we believe it originated from the future. ten, twenty years from now. we can't be sure."
"wait a second. if i sent a message from the future and changed the past, then that future would no longer exist, right? so, how could i have sent the message in the first place? am i making any sense?"
"my advice in making sense of temporal paradoxes is simple. don't even try. to me, all that matters is that somewhere, somehow, sometime, you come through for us. and if you won't take it from me, take it from you. seven found a log entry encoded in the telemetry. from harry kim, to harry kim."
"hello, harry. i don't have much time, so listen to me. fifteen years ago, i made a mistake and one hundred and fifty people died. i've spent every day since then regretting that mistake, but if you're watching this right now, that means all of that has changed. you owe me one."
"mister kim, your assistance please."
got to go.
regeneration cycle incomplete.
when i checked the overnight sensor logs this little surprise was waiting for me.
"maybe i'm not quite awake, but it looks like it's over one hundred kilometres wide."
"one hundred twenty. at first i thought it was an asteroid cluster, until i picked up a residual warp signature."
it was a borg vessel. there are tetryon particles in the debris consistent with the atmosphere inside a cube.
any idea what destroyed it?
we would need to run close range scans of the hull fragments.
"unless we alter course, we'll get our chance. the debris field's directly ahead."
then i suggest we cut a wide berth. chances are the borg will send more vessels to investigate. alter course to avoid the debris. if that's all.
"ah, one other piece of business, captain. it seems we had another incident in the mess hall last night."
return of the midnight snacker?
i'm afraid so.
casualties?
"a leg of kelaran wildebeest i'd prepared for ensign ryson's birthday. since commander tuvok has been unable to round up any suspects, i'd like to ask that stronger measures be taken."
perhaps an armed security detail.
i'd like to ask permission to replicate some locking mechanisms for the cabinet doors.
granted. dismissed.
"naomi wildman, subunit of ensign samantha wildman. state your intentions."
i
very well. you leave me no choice but to report your activities to the captain.
please don't. i was just observing you.
explain.
"well, neelix told me that the borg do a lot of things they do because they're trying to be perfect. and even though you're not really a drone anymore, you still try to be perfect. don't you?"
correct.
"well, if i can learn to be perfect, too, then captain janeway will have to make me her bridge assistant."
no such rank exists aboard this vessel.
not yet.
and you hope to achieve this goal by emulating me?
are you mad?
no. there are many on this crew that would benefit from your example.
so you'll teach me?
"your objective is admirable. however, your neocortical development is incomplete. you would require several months of accelerated growth in a borg maturation chamber."
"oh, i don't think i like the sound of that."
then i suggest that you
hey.
hi.
i'm bored. let's do something fun.
like what?
swimming?
"oh, i'm not allowed to go swimming without my mom."
do you like kadis-kot?
love it.
come on!
"i'll be bridge assistant for a while, then i'll be promoted to ensign. it'll be lieutenant after that, and by the time we reach the alpha quadrant, captain wildman. green, grid fourteen four."
kadis-kot! i win.
you're really good at this game.
you want a rematch?
sure.
"captains don't have much time to play, you know."
that's okay. i'll be pretty busy by then. want to hear the rules of first contact?
no.
how about the suborders of the prime directive? i know all forty seven of them.
"you study too much, naomi, just like my brother."
i didn't know you had a brother.
twelve of them.
twelve?
nine older and three younger. we play kadis-kot all the time.
"i only have my mom and neelix to play with, when they're not working."
you must get lonely.
a little. you get used to it. you adapt.
adapt?
"you know, like the borg."
borg. i hate borgs.
you do?
"yeah, they're mean."
torres to seven of nine. please report to engineering.
it's your move.
"seven, respond."
"i am on my way, lieutenant. naomi wildman."
yes?
what am i doing here?
we're playing kadis-kot. seven?
"take a look at this, will you? i'm picking up an energy signal in the lower subspace bands, and if i'm not mistaken it's got a borg modulation."
you are correct. it is borg. i believe it's a neural interlink frequency.
a what?
a frequency that integrates the minds of borg drones.
can you pinpoint the origin?
i will try.
"no offence, seven, but you look terrible."
i am not well. i experienced a brief lapse in memory and i am disoriented.
maybe you should get to sickbay.
no. this interlink frequency could explain my
do'raq merash.
i beg your pardon?
"i am the son of k'vok! and you, what house are you from?"
is this some kind of a joke?
you wear the uniform of a starfleet p'cha! what kind of a warrior are you?
"tom put you up to this, didn't he? well, it didn't work."
"come, warrior, let me look at you."
"enough, seven."
your blood is sweet!
torres to security. get somebody down here right now.
you are strong. you will make an excellent mate.
get the hell away from me!
you wish to prove yourself in battle.
report.
"seven of nine attacked b'elanna in engineering. she's on deck nine, section twenty three."
forcefields. don't tell me those two have actually come to blows.
"bridge to tuvok. seven's been contained. deck ten, section thirty two."
acknowledged. we're nearing her position.
seven?
somebody's hurt and he needs help. did i do something bad?
who are you?
my name's maryl. are you a vulcan?
"computer, deactivate forcefield. give me the phaser."
"you are not a physician, commander. the logical course of action would be to take him to the infirmary."
maryl?
"subaltern lorot, vulcan high command. may i be of assistance?"
yes. please accompany me to sickbay.
certainly. clearly he was attacked. i suggest we use caution.  petaq! you will drown in your own blood.
keep moving.
seven.
"captain, why am i here?"
you've been unconscious for nearly two hours. we believe you're experiencing a neurological disorder.
"voices, i hear voices. they are agitated, chaotic. too many voices."
too many voices.
the cortical inhibitor is destabilising. i'm increasing the neurotransmitter levels. it's working. do you still hear the voices?
they are fading. they are gone.
all right. let's see what we can do to keep them from coming back. what's the last thing you remember?
"i was in engineering, assisting lieutenant torres."
you have no recollection of a confrontation with b'elanna?
confrontation?
"i'm not sure why, but you seem to be manifesting personalities other than your own."
naomi wildman claims the two of you played together for nearly an hour this afternoon.
you also attacked lieutenant torres. she told us you called yourself son of k'vok and that you initiated a klingon mating ritual.
i have no memory of those events.
come look at this.
doctor.
"this is your neural pattern. the memory engrams and synaptic pathways that define you as an individual. unfortunately, you're not alone. thirteen new neural patterns have emerged in your cerebral cortex. klingon, vulcan, terrelian, human and several others i can't identify."
how?
"they're coming from within you. during your time with the borg, the collective assimilated hundreds of different species. all of those neural patterns were integrated into the hive mind."
of course.
"that means they're in your mind too, stored within your cortical implants. dormant until now."
"from what we can tell, the various neural patterns are surfacing randomly."
"in essence, you've developed the borg equivalent of multiple personality disorder."
can you correct the malfunction?
"the cortical inhibitor is suppressing the effect, but it's only a temporary measure."
lieutenant torres detected a borg interlink frequency. it could be causing my cortical implants to malfunction.
the signal appears to be emanating from the borg debris field we discovered this morning.
"maybe we should jump to warp, try to get out of range."
the signal permeates subspace. we cannot avoid it.
our only hope is to terminate the signal at its point of origin.
set a course for the debris field. when we arrive we may need your help. feel up to it?
"yes, captain."
"keep a close eye on her, doctor, in case she has any more unexpected visitors."
has any drone ever experienced symptoms like these before?
the collective does not tolerate imperfection. any drone with a malfunction as serious as mine would be destroyed immediately.
"lucky for you, this crew is a little more tolerant."
"oh, there you are. lieutenant torres tells me you're under the weather."
correct.
"well, is there anything your morale officer can do to help? assignments you need me to finish while you recuperate?"
no.
i have some wonderful medicinal teas. maybe i could prepare one for you?
talaxian homeopathy. i don't think we're quite that desperate yet.
how about if i make one of your favourite nutritional supplements?
your concern has been noted. the doctor will inform you when i am functional again.
"right. sorry. oh! ah, i almost forgot. it's from naomi wildman. it's a drawing of voyager, or maybe it's an asteroid belt. i'm not sure. naomi thought it might make you feel better."
tell her thank you.
"i suspected as much. there were several interruptions in your regeneration cycle. eighteen minutes, five minutes, one hour."
i don't recall them.
"let's examine your neural function logs. low serotonin levels during regeneration, that's normal. but look at these spikes in the pre-frontal synapses. they appear only seconds before you left the alcove. you were sleepwalking."
i don't remember entering this data file.
looks like we found the identity of the midnight snacker. i'm sure mister neelix will be relieved.
"personal log, ensign stone, stardate 52188.7. i just completed my first week of active duty. it was a nightmare. after four years at the academy i thought i was ready for anything, but captain blackwood runs a tight ship, and he seems to take special pleasure in tormenting new recruits. the first officer tells me not to take it personally, but it's hard to be objective when"
blackwood. captain of the federation starship tombaugh. the borg assimilated that vessel thirteen years ago.
the individual who made this recording must have been a member of the crew.
one of my victims.
here's another log entry. this one encoded for transmission.
"hi. guess who? i know i promised to write you every day but that's simply not enough. how about once in the morning when i resuscitate and once at night before i go into torpor, and i'll think about you non-stop in between. wait, i've got a better idea. why don't you leave your circle and visit the colony? you'd love it here, so"
anything familiar?
i helped to assimilate thousands of individuals. i do not remember each of their names.
"seven, you were a borg drone who's now becoming an individual. that's practically unheard of. there's bound to be rough spots along the way. we just have to get past them."
bridge to seven of nine. we're approaching the debris field.
acknowledged.
survivors?
none.
any sign of borg vessels?
"no, sir. we're the first ones here."
i'm picking up the source of the interlink frequency. bearing oh two seven mark three.
on screen. magnify.
it's a borg vinculum.
vinculum?
the processing device at the core of every borg vessel. it interconnects the minds of all the drones. it purges individual thoughts and disseminates information relevant to the collective.
it brings order to chaos.
precisely.
looks like this one has established a link to your cortical implant.
i believe it has identified me as an errant drone. it is attempting to reintegrate me into the collective. the vinculum is malfunctioning. it is sending me erratic commands.
bringing chaos to order.
yes.
can you sever the link?
not without risking permanent damage to my own systems. the vinculum must be taken offline. permission to beam it aboard for analysis. i have worked with this technology before. i may be able to disable it.
we're talking about the heart of a borg cube. i'd rather not take it inside my ship. can you disable it remotely?
"yes, but i would need several days. the borg may return by then. i recommend we take the vinculum and leave this region immediately."
"tuvok, prepare to beam it to engineering. erect a level ten forcefield and maintain constant surveillance. the moment it poses a threat, send it back into space. tom, as soon as it's aboard, get us out of here. warp nine."
"aye, captain."
"i understand what you're going through, and i want to help you in every way i can, but the safety of this crew is my first responsibility. we haven't had the best of luck with the borg."
nor have i.
"let's keep an eye on those antigrav struts. boylen, lock out all primary command consoles and reroute transporter controls to main engineering."
"yes, lieutenant."
seven?
the voices. i hear them.
it's your proximity to the vinculum. the link is stronger here. i'm adjusting your neurotransmitter levels. you'd better get started.
"don't worry, lieutenant. the son of k'vok will not be joining us."
glad to hear it. does this qualify as our second date?
just think of me as your chaperone.
"so, where's the off switch?"
the vinculum is equipped with many safeguards. i will need to access its transneural matrix and disable it directly.
i'm reading a power surge.
it's a normal response to my intrusion. don't be alarmed. curious. i'm detecting an organism within the vinculum. it appears to be a viral agent.
let's see it. it's a synthetic pathogen. the virus was originally a biological agent but it's mutated. it's attacking the vinculum's programmes as it would living cells.
an organism that attacks technology?
"the cube was infected three days ago, shortly after assimilating an alien shuttlecraft. species 6339. they were the last ones to come in contact with the cube."
looks like we found our typhoid mary.
"species 6339, humanoid. warp-capable. origin, grid one two four, octant twenty two theta. they first encountered the borg approximately four years ago. since that time, eleven billion individuals have been assimilated. three days ago, the collective detected one of their last surviving shuttlecraft. a cube was sent to intercept it."
"we believe the virus was carried within their bodies. once they were assimilated, it spread to the vinculum."
the drones aboard no doubt experienced symptoms similar to my own. it is no surprise they destroyed themselves.
i'd like to find species 6339. they may be able to help us treat you. begin long range astrometric scans. see if they have any more vessels in this region.
"yes, captain. i've already begun a spatial diagn.  my, my, my, look at the size of that thing. this viewscreen. it's got to be one of the biggest i've ever seen. i'll give you twenty bars of latinum for it."
"i think the inhibitor's gone offline. would you come here, please?"
"be quiet. can't you see i'm in the middle of a deal? name your price, captain?"
janeway. and you are?
daimon torrot.
you're ferengi.
of course i'm ferengi. is that some kind of insult about the size of my ears?
"no, not at all. i'd be happy to negotiate with you, but first we have to get you to sickbay."
sickbay? what for?
because you're ill.
i've never felt better.
doctor.
i'm afraid you've contracted a nasty strain of the ankaran flu. we've been treating you several days. remember?
no.
"short term memory loss. it's one of the symptoms. don't worry, it isn't life threatening, but we'll need to treat you. in sickbay."
what is this treatment going to cost me?
it's free of charge.
free?
yes.
"you know, i have been having a nagging pain in my lower left lobe, and while you're at it why don't you run a complete tricardial diagnostic. the ferengi health commission's trying to revoke my trading license."
"impressive vessel, captain. galaxy class?"
intrepid.
"ah. ah, and here we are in the much talked-about sickbay. not exactly state of the medical art now, is it?"
what do you mean?
"you're low on biobeds, terrible lighting, obsolete instruments. lucky for you, i know a medical supplier that can spruce this place up in a nanosecond, and i'll even drop my commission to a mere thirty percent?"
"how generous of you. computer, activate forcefield."
forcefield? you said i wasn't contagious.
it's for your own safety. i've set the cortical inhibitor to maximum but it is no longer suppressing the effects. these personalities are going to keep surfacing.
i've been kidnapped!
even more reason to shut down the vinculum as soon as we can.
"even if we do break the link, it may be too late. seven's own neural pattern is destabilising. it could be lost."
"please help me. i'm looking for my son gregory bergan, lieutenant bergan. have you seen him?"
"no, i'm afraid not."
from the starship melbourne.
melbourne?
"i was supposed to meet him at wolf 359, but starfleet sent out a warning that the borg were attacking that sector. it was too late for us to turn back. we were caught in a terrible battle. my ship was badly damaged. we had to leave on escape pods. i never found out what happened to gregory. please, i haven't heard from him in over three days. could you check with starfleet headquarters?"
i'll see what i can do.
"thank you, captain. if you do speak with him, could you tell him that his mother is all right and if he could pos... captain."
seven?
yes. the vinculum?
we're preparing to shut it down right away. i'll give the order as soon as torres is ready.
how long was i absent?
about twenty minutes.
how many?
"two. one of whom wanted to acquire half the items on the ship. daimon torrot, i believe."
"species 180, ferengi."
"yes. the other was a woman whose son was lost in a borg attack. you'll get through this, seven."
i do not share your optimism.
"when you took me from the borg and began to turn me into an individual, i found the silence of my own mind difficult to bear. i missed the voices of the collective. but now that i am an individual, those same voices frighten me. captain, i don't know if i can tolerate this condition much longer. my courage is insufficient."
your job is to keep trying to hold on even when you think you can't. leave the rest to me and the crew.
meet anyone interesting?
"just finished swapping jokes with a bolian manicurist. before that, i was debating the finer points of temporal physics with a krenim scientist. twelve new personalities have surfaced in the past hour alone. seven's having a rough time of it. the doctor had to sedate her."
how's the captain holding up?
"i've been better, chakotay. in fact, i'm starting to wonder if my first officer was right all along."
about what?
you always said that bringing seven into the fold might be impossible.
"you can take the borg out of the collective, but. i don't believe that. not anymore. i didn't think she'd last a day, much less a year. i'd say you've proven me wrong."
torres to bridge. we're ready to begin disabling the vinculum.
proceed.
"target the transneural matrix. stand by to initiate the dampening field on my mark. three, two, one, mark. its power output is dropping."
doctor to bridge. it seems to be working. her neural pattern is stabilising.
power output is down to seventy seven percent. seventy one percent. wait a second. it's increasing.
i'm refocusing the dampening field.
it's still increasing.
the vinculum is rerouting its internal circuitry. it's adapting.
engineering! her synaptic pathways are destabilising. abort the procedure!
help me!
abort!
"stand by, doctor. power output at ninety eight percent.  the forcefield is collapsing."
transfer emergency power.
"it won't work, lieutenant. we must abort. tuvok to bridge."
the procedure was unsuccessful. the vinculum has returned to full power.
"acknowledged. doctor, report."
"seven's neural pattern has disappeared, captain. it appears that the other patterns have taken over completely. we've lost her."
"i've managed to stabilise her primary cortical functions but the woman in sickbay is not seven of nine. not any more. new personalities are emerging every few seconds now. she can't finish a sentence before the next one rears its head. it's creating an incredible strain on her cerebral cortex. if we don't deactivate the vinculum soon, we may never get her back."
tuvok?
"lieutenant torres is taking measures to prevent the vinculum from adapting, but there's no guarantee she'll succeed."
"captain, i've exhausted every viable treatment in my database."
then logic dictates we go beyond medical science. i will attempt to mind meld with seven of nine.
a mind meld? you consider that a viable treatment?
"seven's neural pattern, her sense of self, is immersed in chaos. i will attempt to isolate her true self and guide it to the surface."
"it's dangerous enough to meld with one person, let alone hundreds of different personalities."
it's too risky.
the risk is mine to take.
"i'm aware of that, but is this our only option?"
"i believe it is, captain."
how long would you need to prepare?
"captain, you can't actually be considering this vulcan mumbo jumbo."
i will require two hours of meditation.
begin immediately. report to sickbay when you're ready.
you said it yourself. we've exhausted every medical treatment.
i just hope i don't find myself with a second patient.
captain to the bridge.
on my way.
commander?
it's them. species 6339.
"their vessel is well-armed, captain. i'm picking up twenty two phaser cannons on the aft section alone."
hail them.
they're responding.
on screen. i'm captain janeway of the federation starship voyager. we recently found a piece of borg technology. it's been infected with a viral agent we believe was transmitted by your
"the vinculum, you have it?"
yes.
"you've made a terrible mistake, captain."
a weapon?
"yes. since the borg decimated our world, we've been looking for ways to retaliate."
so you created a virus to infect their technology.
"thirteen of my people were injected with the virus. they allowed themselves to be assimilated so that the virus would spread to this vinculum. once another borg ship had retrieved it they would be infected as well. then another cube, and another. we had the opportunity to infect dozens, even hundreds of borg vessels until you interfered. why?"
your virus has had one unexpected casualty. a member of my crew.
it wasn't designed to infect other species.
she's borg.
we liberated her from the collective over a year ago. she's an individual now.
we were hoping you could help us treat her.
"we designed that virus to destroy borg, captain. we never considered a treatment. i'm afraid your drone won't survive. but we must return the vinculum to the debris field immediately. if the borg arrive first, we'll have lost our chance, and those thirteen people will have died in vain."
"all right. we'll return it to you, but first we need to try to save our crew member. we think we have a way to counteract the vinculum's effects. b'elanna?"
i'm going to try to remodulate our dampening field to compensate
"we don't have time for this. the vinculum, captain."
i can't give it to you. not yet.
"you scanned our vessel, you're aware of our firepower."
"you could undoubtedly do significant damage to voyager, and to the vinculum. is that what you want?"
the vinculum survived the destruction of one ship. what makes you so sure it won't survive another?
doctor.
seven. a necessary precaution. a few of your guests have been violent.
the vinculum.
it keeps adapting. we haven't been able to shut it down. your own neural pattern was nearly destroyed in the process. i wasn't sure i'd find you again.
i am damaged.
one of your personas didn't appreciate the restraints. she seemed intent on forcing her way to freedom.
i apologise.
it was hardly your fault. you're ill.
irrelevant. i am borg. i should be able to adapt.
surprise. you aren't invincible. i suppose that's something we'll have to tackle in our next social lesson. voices?
they're getting louder.
it won't be long before i lose you again. it's my duty as your physician to inform you of an alternative treatment.
what treatment?
commander tuvok has proposed a mind meld to help stabilise your neural pattern. i had a similar reaction. if you don't approve.
what is the probability of success?
i don't know. a mind meld is hardly a standard medical practice.
are there any risks to tuvok?
"he could suffer brain damage, but he's confident he'll be able to break the meld before that happens."
"even if we do shut down the vinculum, it may not be enough. if tuvok can do anything to help me."
i understand.
"doctor, you have shown a great deal of patience."
not at all.
inform the crew that i am also grateful for their efforts.
"you'll be able to tell them yourself, afterwards. seven?"
voices!
concentrate! focus on the sound of my voice!
"get them out, please! i can't, i can't! no!"
report.
the alien vessel is coming about.
they're charging weapons.
shields.
"as if the meld weren't dangerous enough, the aliens are trying to take the vinculum by force. commander chakotay is at tactical. the captain wants you here with seven. this will allow me to monitor your neural activity for the duration of the meld. at the first sign of trouble."
you will do nothing.
i beg your pardon?
there will undoubtedly be many signs of trouble. you must have faith in my ability to endure them.
i'll try. i just hope my faith doesn't leave the two of you brain damaged.
"your concerns have been noted, doctor."
"with all of these new personalities floating around, it's a shame we can't find one for you."
"computer, deactivate forcefield."
"why am i tied to this bed? please let me go. petaq! i'll rip out your throat, coward! name your price. ten bars of latinum? twenty? this isn't medicine, it's torture! i'll sue for malpractice. i fail to see the logic in this meld, commander."
my mind to your mind.
"you are but one mind, confronting thousands."
my thoughts to your thoughts.
you will not succeed.
your mind to my mind.
let me go. the borg are assimilating the ship! we've got to evacuate.
my thoughts to your thoughts.
listen to me! they're trying to assimilate the ship.
my mind to your mind.
let me go!
my thoughts to your thoughts.
mommy. mommy.
my mind to your mind.
mommy.
my thoughts to your thoughts.
seven? seven! seven.
seven. seven? seven? seven?
"i'm lost. somebody help me. please, i don't like it here.i want to go home. i can't find my"
"mommy. please, help me. please, i don't want to stay here, i want to go home. i don't like it here. please, help me. i want to go home. these people are scary. please don't go. please, why are youleaving me here? please! i don't like it here!"
sickbay to engineering.
how long until the vinculum's offline?
"two, maybe three minutes. provided voyager can stay in one piece for that long."
shields down to sixty percent.
evasive manoeuvres. target their weapons array.
targeting systems are malfunctioning.
we're losing power to main thrusters.
shields to thirty five percent.
"reroute all available power to shields. chakotay, initiate manual targeting."
torres to bridge.
the vinculum's stopped adapting. i think the new dampening field is working. we should have it disabled in the next sixty seconds.
warning. neurochemical synapses are destabilising.
"computer, increase power to the cortical inhibitors."
unable to comply. power transport systems are offline.
"tuvok, if you can hear me, we have to terminate the meld. tuvok. tuvok!"
commander. commander!
seven?
commander.
seven!
"power output's down to twenty nine percent. twenty two. seventeen. bridge, we just lost the field emitters."
we took a direct hit to the power grid. stand by. we're switching to emergency backup.
seven.
"bridge, the vinculum's powering up again."
the field emitters are back online. pull the plug.
it's working. power output down to nineteen percent. thirteen percent.
seven. seven.
tuvok.
seven.
"it's done, captain. the vinculum's offline."
seven?
yes.
"we have her back, captain."
hail the lead vessel. tell them we're surrendering the vinculum.
no response.
lock onto the damn thing. beam it into space.
transport complete. they're withdrawing.
"take us out of here, tom. warp nine."
"yes, ma'am."
"neuroprocessor, cortical receptors, all stable. she's fit to return to duty."
what about her other personalities? any sign of them?.
those neural patterns have returned to their dormant state.
the voices will not return?
"i suppose that depends on your perspective. you may not hear them, but i suspect they'll always be with you."
the members of this crew put themselves at risk to help me. i am unsure how to reciprocate.
"let's start with something small, like a recalibration of the eps manifolds. b'elanna's expecting you in engineering."
i will join her shortly. there is a crew member i must see first.
these are star charts for the next three systems voyager will pass through. familiarise yourself with them.
understood.
sociological data regarding one hundred and seventy three delta quadrant species. study it.
i will.
"as bridge assistant, you will find this information relevant."
consider it assimilated.
there is one more assignment. i require your assistance.
me?
i wish to participate in recreational activities.
great.
kadis-kot. instruct me how to play.
i will comply.
"and, since i was the only crewmember who could survive the corrosive atmosphere, it was up to me to retrieve the data module and save the day. ah, here i am, mission accomplished. then of course there was the perilous mission to lav'oti v. you remember that one, don't you mister paris?"
how could i forget.
here you are after your unfortunate slip into the fetid mud pits of palomar.
"hey, i was pushed."
of course you were.
"thank you, doctor. we've all enjoyed your holo-images enormously."
"oh, but i haven't finished yet."
there's more?
"the best is yet to come, lieutenant. i've created a fascinating twelve part holographic essay which i call 'under the skin'. humanoid anatomy as art. let's begin with this stunning magnification of the vulcan reproductive gland. note the composition, the subtle variations in colour."
"twenty one hundred hours, commander. all systems reporting normal."
acknowledged.
"like i said, it's twenty one hundred hours."
"i heard you the first time, harry."
they've been in there over an hour.
i'm aware of that.
didn't the captain ask you to rescue them after thirty minutes?
"harry, you and i were lucky enough to enjoy the doctor's scintillating exhibition for two full hours. would it really be fair of us to deny our friends the same unforgettable experience?"
"of course not, sir."
thank you. thank you for coming. we'll do it again soon. we've still got thousands of light years to while away. this could be a weekly event.
what happened to going to yellow alert after half an hour?
commander chakotay appears to have disobeyed a direct order.
definitely grounds for court martial.
"hey, neelix."
coffee?
"oh, i could use a whole pot."
let me guess. the doctor's photographic essay?
ha! one mind-numbing image after the next.
"oh, i don't know. i thought some of those pictures were pretty funny."
you mean like the one where tom slipped into a mud pit?
you're famous.
"then, of course, there's the one depicting a certain chief engineer with her foot stuck in a plasma injector."
what?
really? i seem to have missed that one.
the doctor must have taken it out of the exhibition.
"oh, i can't wait to get my hands on it. maybe i can distribute it to everyone's personal database."
"try it, and i'll kill you. right after i finish deleting the doctor's programme."
"what'd you put in this coffee, neelix?"
"i'm reading a massive energy wave nine hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow, heading right for us."
source?
unknown.
shields up. evasive manoeuvres.
the wave just changed course. it seems to be tracking us!
go to warp eight!
too late! engines are down.
everybody hang on!
all stop.
shields are holding. minor damage to the hull plating on deck fifteen.
no injuries.
stand down red alert.
"captain, when the wave hit our communications array received a download."
what sort of download?
"i'm not sure. lots of information. i can't decipher it, but there's an audio component."
let's hear it.
"harry, try all the standard decryption algorithms."
"it's strange. the wave followed us but it didn't cause any damage. instead, we get a download to our database. i'd say it's a pretty good bet somebody's trying to tell us something."
the wave left a residual ion trail. we might be able to locate its point of origin.
set a course.
looks like it's taken quite a beating.
lifesigns?
one. non-humanoid. it's very faint. probably injured.
beam it to sickbay.
"are you sure that's wise, captain?"
"i'm betting that message we received was some sort of distress call. and if we're going to help, i'd rather do it on voyager."
"the physiology is so unusual the tricorder can't make heads or tails of it. the creature's obviously injured, but i haven't a clue how to treat it or even diagnose it."
"my scans came up with something interesting, captain. the interfaces on the alien's vessel can only be activated chemically. i'm guessing that this lifeform somehow interfaces directly with the ship's systems using biochemical secretions to give commands."
that would explain how it can fly a ship.
i'm hoping this can also help us figure out
no! you'll hurt b'elanna!
get it off of me!
janeway to kim. beam the alien lifeform
back to it's vessel. now!
i'm having trouble getting a lock.
it's piercing her neck!
"her heart and lungs are seriously compromised, and her kidneys are failing. the creature's also secreting some kind of paralysing agent into her bloodstream."
how do we get it off her?
"i can't remove it surgically, not without doing irreparable harm to b'elanna's organs."
"can we get a lock on the creature, transport it off?"
not unless we want to beam b'elanna's cardiopulmonary system along with it.
we have to do something.
"no one is disputing that, mister paris. the question is what? if i'm to have any hope of devising a treatment i'll need to brush up on my exobiology."
"what do you mean, brush up? don't you have all this information in your database?"
"i may be a walking medical encyclopaedia, but even i don't know everything. my matrix simply isn't large enough."
maybe we can do better than giving you a crash course in exobiology. maybe we can provide you with a consultant.
"i'd be delighted, but how?"
by isolating the computer's exobiology data files and merging them into a an interactive matrix.
a hologram.
exactly.
"that may not be as simple as it sounds. it would need to be nearly as sophisticated as i am. tactile interfaces, personality subroutines."
harry could do it.
"search the database for the leading exobiologist. if you want to add a personality, it may as well be based on a real person. i'll have harry meet you in holodeck two."
stay with her and monitor her vital signs. call me if there's any change.
"i still have my doubts about this, doc. it's one thing to create a simple hologram, but you're trying to merge an extensive database with an interactive matrix."
"don't be a pessimist, mister kim. together we'll create a masterpiece of holographic art."
a subject for your next slide show?
perhaps.
can't wait.
what's the name of that exobiologist you chose?
crell moset.
here's the file.
let's start with the parameters for physical appearance.
"computer, display a holographic simulation of crell moset."
have you mentioned to anyone else that this guy's a cardassian?
what difference does it make?
maybe you haven't heard. they're not the friendliest folks in the galaxy.
"i don't care if he's the nastiest man who ever lived, as long as he can help us save b'elanna."
"good point. computer, transfer all reference medical files to the simulation."
transfer complete.
now install personality subroutines and voice approximation.
installation complete.
"doctor moset, i'd like to consult with you about an alien lifeform."
"i am crell moset, chief exobiology specialist cardassia prime certified to perform all surgical procedures."
this is going well. what's wrong?
some sort of overload in the interactive matrix.
can you clear it up?
"i'm trying. computer, install a recursive algorithm."
algorithm installed.
try it again.
doctor moset?
my friends call me crell.
"it's a pleasure to meet you, crell."
"and you, good man. what's your name?"
"actually, i'm in-between names at the moment. i'm an emergency medical hologram."
interesting.
but his friends call him doc.
ah-ha. may i presume?
certainly.
"so, doc, how can an old surgeon like me help a technological marvel such as yourself?"
"oh, well, i've got a patient with a rather unusual problem. she's become fused with a non-humanoid lifeform i know nothing about."
non-humanoid exobiology happens to be one of my specialties.
that's exactly why we've created your programme.
programme?
you're a hologram as well.
interesting. i'd like to see the patient right away.
"mister kim, would you do the honours please."
"no problem. listen, if he destabilises again, take him offline and call me."
understood.
lieutenant. may i present crell moset?
it's a pleasure.
she's been drifting in and out of consciousness.
"don't be rude, lieutenant."
"to him? no offence, doc, but he's just a"
"a brilliant scientist who's here to help us. this way, crell."
hmm. i can see why you're having difficulty.
it's physiology doesn't match any of the standard templates in our database.
my guess would be a cytoplasmic lifeform.
i agree. and from what i can tell it has co-opted her vital systems.
"she's klingon. no, the cranial ridges are less pronounced. klingon-human hybrid."
exactly. let's hope your instincts about the creature are equally insightful.
i'm afraid this one is going to require more than a visual assessment. you have an isomolecular scanner?
"no, just a standard issue starfleet tricorder."
no wonder you're having problems making an accurate diagnosis.
"i suggested an upgrade to the starfleet people at a joint medical conference, but they assumed i was just an arrogant cardassian trying to prove his superiority. or maybe they thought i was a spy."
i hope you weren't too offended.
"it's an unfortunate reality. sometimes even enlightened races can't find common ground. i may be able to recalibrate this thing. there, that should help."
amazing.
"well, someone from starfleet appreciates me."
i've instructed the computer to assign symbols to all the tones received in the transmission.
looks like there were over ten thousand separate sounds used in this section of the message.
it's going to be a tough code to crack.
maybe we can get a little help from the alien vessel's databanks.
good idea. janeway to seven of nine.
yes.
any chance of downloading the alien's databanks?
we're looking for anything that might help us understand their language. we don't know how much time b'elanna has left.
we must move quickly. the vessel is on the verge of a complete systems failure.
prepare to download the data.
i heard the captain.
is there a problem?
no. no problem.
you seem uncomfortable taking orders from me.
"it's just that i'm used to taking orders from b'elanna, that's all. and to tell you the truth, she doesn't"
"doesn't like me. yes, i am aware of that. however, the captain left me in charge during lieutenant torres' absence. her feelings about me are irrelevant. activate the interface transceiver. begin the download."
i'm picking up a fluctuation in the alien ship's power source.
it's disrupting the interface transceiver. re-initialise.
i'm working on it. it's systems are overloading.
red alert.
engineering to bridge. the alien vessel is destabilising. it's destruction is imminent.
can you download the information first?
we're trying.
"captain, it's going to explode."
"ensign, back us off."
what do we know so far?
"the lifeform has taken control of her body at the autonomic level, drawing proteins from her tissues, white blood cells from her arteries."
which can be interpreted in several ways.
a form of attack?
i find it odd that a species would evolve an attack mechanism that would leave it so vulnerable. why not do it's damage and retreat?
"a parasite, perhaps?"
"yes, i think so, but not any ordinary variety. it's unlikely it could sustain itself like this over the long term."
"its own systems are damaged. it's doing this as a stopgap measure, to keep itself alive."
"so the patient's heart, lungs, kidneys, they're all augmenting the alien's damaged system."
it's using b'elanna as a life preserver.
"but if it needs her to survive, it's not about to let go without a fight."
i'd like to think that's a fight you and i can win.
"we do work well together. i just wish we had access to my laboratory. it has all the instrumentation we would need. well, we'll just have to improvise."
not necessarily. we may be able to create a reasonable facsimile of your laboratory in our holodeck.
"providing of course, you can give an accurate description."
"oh, down to the smallest detail. it's more of a home to me than my home."
tom.
"hey, there."
i can't move.
"i know, but don't worry. we'll get this thing off you. just think, i could force you to listen to rock and roll all day and you wouldn't be able to do a thing about it."
who's that?
relax. he's just a hologram. a specialist in exobiology. the doc thinks he might be able to help you.
can't he find somebody else?
"apparently, this guy's the best. besides, he's just a walking database."
"hologram or not, he's cardassian. as far as i'm concerned, they're all cold-blooded killers."
"i understand how you feel. unfortunately, that cold-blooded killer may be the only one who can save your life."
impressive. is this where you did your work on the fostossa virus?
"no. actually, i was on bajor at the time, during the occupation. a sad chapter in cardassian history. we had no business being there, but try telling that to the politicians. when i think of the resources that were squandered, the lives that were lost."
"but from what i understand, you saved thousands of lives."
"in retrospect, i don't know how. the military had everything they needed but the civilian hospitals? no staff, the crudest equipment."
don't tell me. you were forced to improvise.
yes!
i know what that's like.
"i didn't have the resources to try traditional methods, so i experimented with procedures that, that never would have occurred to me under ordinary circumstances. the discovery of the cure was almost accidental, really."
"you're being modest, crell."
no.
you made medical history. you won the legate's crest of valour.
"awards aren't important, doc. it's the work that matters."
"of course. still, the recognition of your peers, your government. it must be very satisfying."
i'm sure you've made your share of breakthroughs.
"naturally. unfortunately, no one from starfleet ever hears about them. i toil in obscurity."
why don't you show me your patient records? at least i'll know about your accomplishments.
all right.
everything seems to be in order. shall we get to work?
"computer, create a holographic re-creation of the alien in sickbay."
"hand me that cortical stimulator, will you? yes, thank you."
"it was a distress call, right? so maybe if we retransmitted that message others of the species would realise we need their help."
we don't know where they are.
"we'll send it on all subspace bands. if they're out there, they'll hear it."
they might turn out to be unfriendly.
"the doctor's pretty sure the alien is simply trying to survive. i agree. it'll be a difficult first contact, but we might find a way to communicate."
it's worth a shot.
"tuvok, reroute auxiliary power to the deflector dish. retransmit the alien's message on all subspace bands."
"aye, captain. deflector at full capacity."
chakotay.
i'm sorry. my wife tells me i'm tone deaf.
not at all. you were right on key. if you enjoy music we can run some opera programmes after we're finished.
i'd like that. i think we're ready for a look inside. scalpel?
"forgive me for saying so, but this appears to be a rather crude instrument, especially when we have such advanced equipment at our disposal."
"i often find the simplest tool is the most effective. all of our elaborate scanners and laser scalpels, they remove us from our subjects. actually feeling the anatomy, the consistency of the internal organs. it can be very instructive. why don't you do the honours? make a vertical incision, say twelve centimetres, starting here."
we're hurting it.
"doctor, it's a hologram."
"of course. i guess as a hologram myself, i have a certain empathy."
keep going.
extraordinary. look at that series of nodes.
they appear to be clustered along the primary nerve.
"multiple neocortices, i'd say."
suggesting a highly intelligent species.
"yes, but also presenting us with a point of attack."
attack?
"if we induce a neurostatic shock in one of these nodes, i believe it will travel to the others. the creature will lose motor function and we'll be able to remove it."
the procedure will probably kill the creature.
probably.
i'd like to find a way to save them both.
"so would i, in an ideal situation. but we have to set priorities which, in this case, is your crew mate."
"this is a sentient lifeform. for all we know it could be this species' einstein, its picasso."
"or he could be a psychotic criminal. the point is, we don't know, and we have choices to make."
your programme's destabilising.
this is such poor timing.
"i'll have to take you offline. but don't worry, we'll have you up and running again in no time. computer, take medical consultant programme offline. doctor to ensign kim."
"go ahead, doc."
our new programme's destabilising.
"i'll meet you in sickbay. we'll try to reinitialise him there. tabor, i could use some help."
"yes, sir."
try again.
no luck.
would it be easier if we reduced the hologram's memory load?
"maybe, but i don't want to do that unless we absolutely have to."
what's going on?
my consultant's gone offline.
the cardassian? you can leave him off.
"i'm surprised by your attitude, lieutenant. i never took you for someone who would make generalisations based on race."
"when it comes to cardassians, i'm guilty as charged."
"i understand your experience with them was unpleasant, but if you give crell a chance, i think you'll find that he's a friendly, compassionate man. not to mention a genius who's trying to save your life."
i'll skip the introductions if it's all the same to you.
suit yourself. but you should know i plan on asking the captain to keep him on as a permanent consultant.
i'm not the only one who's going to have a problem with that.
"well, you'll just have to get used to it. who knows, you may even grow to like him."
don't hold your breath.
how's it coming?
we're close.
"actually, i think that should do it."
"good. computer, reactivate medical consultant programme beta one."
hello again.
my god.
what's wrong?
that's crell moset.
yes. do i know you?
"he killed my brother, my grandfather, hundreds of people. he's a mass murderer!"
you must be mistaken.
it's no mistake. moset performed experiments on living people. thousands of bajorans were killed in his so-called hospital.
is this true?
"no. no, he's. there must be some misunderstanding."
the liar!
"whoa. take it easy, tabor. whoa. he's just a hologram."
i'm upsetting him. i should go.
"i'm sorry about this. computer, transfer medical consultant programme to holodeck two."
i can still remember the sounds his instruments made. the screams of his patients. the smell. chemicals and dead flesh. he operated on my grandfather. exposed his internal organs to nadion radiation. it took six days for him to die. i promised myself i would never forget.
you were very young. is it possible your memory of these events is inaccurate?
my memory's just fine. he blinded people so he could study how they adapted. exposed them to polytrinic acid just to see how long it would take for their skin to heal.
"ensign, the man you're accusing cured the fostossa virus. he stopped an epidemic that killed thousands of bajorans."
"by infecting hundreds of people so that he could experiment with different treatments. old, helpless people like my grandfather, because he considered their lives worthless."
how do you know this?
everybody knew.
i remember some of the maquis under my command talking about an infamous cardassian doctor.
could these simply have been rumours spread by bajorans who hated the cardassians?
i was there.
i don't understand why this isn't in our database.
the cardassians didn't exactly publicise their wartime medical practices. i wouldn't be surprised if the real moset went on to live a normal life.
he's the chairman of exobiology at the university of culat.
"we may not be able to do anything about the real moset, commander, but the programme should be destroyed. every trace of that man's research should be deleted from the database."
i had a bad feeling about that hologram the second i saw him.
looks like your instinct was right.
i won't let him near me.
"you're kidding, right?"
"no, i am dead serious."
b'elanna.
"if i let that pig operate on me, i'll be benefiting from other people's suffering."
you're not being rational.
i won't do it.
what's happening?
her cytotoxin levels are going through the roof. pulse is rapid and irregular.
no doubt you've said something to upset her.
"what she's upset about, doc, is your cardassian buddy."
tell him.
tell me what?
she refuses to let him treat her.
"b'elanna, we're very close to a solution."
do it without him.
i don't know that i can.
find another way.
she's going into cytotoxic shock.
two milligrams of inaprovaline.
isolate datablock oh four five nine.
ensign? you wanted to see me?
we've been looking for evidence that might support tabor's accusations.
anything?
"actually, that's why we called you here. it's not looking good."
show me.
we've been reviewing data on the cardassian occupation of bajor. the alleged site of moset's crimes.
"strategic information, log entries kept in battle, sensor scans from starfleet vessels. this, for example. requisition records from one of crell moset's hospitals."
"he was purchasing biochemical agents, including every known strain of the fostossa virus."
of course he needed samples of the virus. that's how vaccines are developed.
take a look at the requisition orders.
moset didn't ask for any of the enzymes normally required for synthesizing a vaccine.
it gets worse. four days after he received the virus samples there was a minor outbreak of fostossa in the vicinity of his hospital.
prior to that date there had not been a single case in the entire province.
i have to report these findings to commander chakotay.
"it is curious. the borg are accused of assimilating information with no regard for life. this cardassian did the same, and yet his behaviour was tolerated."
"ah, there you are. i'm almost ready to perform the surgery."
lieutenant torres won't allow you to have anything to do with her treatment.
because of that bajoran?
we've gathered some corroborating evidence. it appears that he's telling the truth. you committed a series of atrocities during the cardassian war. thousands of bajorans died on your surgical tables.
"that's absurd. and even if it were true, i'm only a hologram, and i have no memory of those events. they're not part of my programming."
"but you are the holographic representation of crell moset. your programme, despite all its brilliance, is based on his work. he infected patients, exposed them to polytrinic acid, mutilated their living bodies, and now we're reaping the benefits of those experiments. medically, ethically, it's wrong."
what do you suggest we do about it?
i'm not sure. we may have to delete your programme.
delete me? what about our patient?
i suppose i'd have to try and treat her on my own.
"no offence but, you need me."
i realise that.
you're a physician. you know there's always a price to pay for the advancement of medical science.
sometimes that price is too high. torture?
"your word, not mine. i cured the fostossa virus, didn't i? so these experiments you say i conducted obviously helped me devise a treatment. imagine how many lives would have been lost if i hadn't eliminated this disease."
that doesn't justify using people in laboratory experiments.
"as i explained to you, during the occupation i was forced to improvise. i used what resources i had."
"and ethical considerations, they mean nothing to you?"
"ethics are arbitrary. how do you suppose your own database was developed? hmm? my god, half the medical knowledge acquired on earth came through experiments on lower animals."
but not people.
"it's convenient to draw a line between higher and lower species, isn't it?"
"this is the twenty fourth century, crell. your kind of barbarism ended a long time ago. or at least, it should have."
"what difference does it make how long ago the research occurred? what matters is that we can use it to help patients today. now, are you going to delete my programme and all of the research it contains, or are we going to use it to save b'elanna's life?"
come in.
commander.
this request of yours to be relieved of duty. i won't grant it.
i have the right to resign my commission.
for what reason?
moral objections to the ship's medical policy.
"i understand how difficult this is for you, but you've got to let go of the past. focus on today and today, b'elanna's life is in danger. everything else should be put aside."
you don't have the right to violate the memory of my family. as long as that cardassian hologram is online that's exactly what you're doing.
it's not that simple.
"it is to me. crell moset killed thousands of people in his hospitals. as long as we're willing to benefit from his research, we're no better than he is."
"if i had weeks, or even days, maybe i could come up with an alternative. but time is of the essence, and moset's idea will work."
then you've got to use it.
"even if the doctor could perform the surgery without moset's help, he'd still be using the man's research. that would be going against b'elanna's wishes."
we're talking about a woman who has alien tendrils sapping the life out of her. she's obviously not thinking straight.
on the contrary. her concerns are based in logic.
logic?
"if the doctor uses knowledge that moset gained through his experiments, we would be validating his methods, inviting further unethical research."
we'd be setting a terrible precedent.
we're in the middle of the delta quadrant. who would know?
we would know.
fine. let's just deactivate the evil hologram and let b'elanna die. at least we'd have our morals intact.
tom.
"and you, chakotay. since when do you care what starfleet thinks?"
this isn't about rules and regulations. this is about doing what's right.
"spoken like a true maquis. well, if you'd just set aside your hatred of the cardassians for one second"
"enough, lieutenant."
"all right, all right. the arguments have been made and we're running out of time. the fact is, you're both right, but when it comes down to it, the only issue i'm concerned about is the well-being of that crew member lying in sickbay. we'll wrestle with the morality of this situation later, after b'elanna is back on her feet. doctor, you have my authorisation to proceed, with moset's assistance."
"yes, captain."
any consequences of this decision will be my responsibility. dismissed.
thanks.
scalpel.
"ensign kim, do you hear something?"
hear what?
a series of high frequencies. they are getting louder.
must be those vulcan ears of yours.
i hear it too. anything on sensors?
it appears to be an alien comm. signal. triaxilating wavelengths.
origin.
unknown.
"captain, a vessel just dropped out of warp. approaching fast off the port bow."
on screen.
can we dampen it a little?
negative.
"harry, tell me that was just their way of saying hello."
i wish i could. the universal translator doesn't have a clue.
perhaps they are waiting for our response.
"well, then, let's give them one. open a channel, all subspace bands. this is captain janeway of the federation starship voyager. we cannot interpret your message but please try to understand. we are on a peaceful mission and we intend you no harm. we have one of your kind on board our ship. it's injured, and we're attempting to provide treatment. if you can understand this"
i'm ready to stimulate the primary neural pathways. cortical probe. i'm applying it to the primary neocortex. its motor control is weakening but not enough to release the patient. our little friend needs a bigger jolt. i'm increasing the pulse frequency.
the synapses are degenerating. you're killing it.
"don't lose your nerve, doctor. not when we're this close."
lower the pulse frequency.
if i do that the creature will regain control.
i don't care. lower the pulse.
doctor.
lower the pulse frequency or i'll take your programme offline.
you realise you're reducing our chances of saving her?
"not necessarily. give me the probe. the probe, doctor. if we apply the pulse to the secondary neocortex, we should be able to achieve the same results at a lower frequency."
"not particularly efficient, but it might prove interesting."
i'm reading an energy surge in their forward section.
shields!
doctor to bridge. the holodeck's going offline.
what's happening up there?
"stand by, doctor."
they've locked on to us with some sort of tractor beam. it's draining our power.
reroute emergency power to the holodeck. send an antimatter surge through the shield's matrix. see if that'll loosen their grip.
no effect. we do have weapons.
"no. if they wanted to destroy us, they wouldn't be using a tractor beam. they're trying to rescue their crew member."
captain.
"this isn't about logic, tuvok, it's about instinct. now i may not speak their language, but i have a gut feeling they don't want an armed conflict any more than we do. bridge to doctor. what's your status?"
the procedure's working.
"almost there, captain."
"it's losing motor control. the tendrils are withdrawing from her lungs, liver, kidneys. the alien's life signs are failing."
we need a substitute for the metabolic energy it was taking from b'elanna.
could we restore its own metabolism?
perhaps. give it forty milligrams of stenophyl. it's going into anaphylactic shock.
"all right, increasing the dosage to sixty milligrams."
we've lost power on decks seven through twelve.
"shields are failing, captain."
doctor?
"stand by, captain."
anaphylaxia is subsiding.
"its electrolytic reactions are increasing. its metabolism is stabilising on its own. bridge, beam the lifeform to its ship."
transport complete.
"the alien ship is withdrawing, captain."
you're welcome.
i've released b'elanna to her quarters.
her condition?
"stable, but her nervous system has suffered extreme trauma. she'll need time to recover. several days, at least."
good work.
"i should caution you, captain. when i told her that we'd used moset's programme she was unhappy, to put it mildly. i nearly had to sedate her."
it sounds like her klingon temper has fully recovered.
it practically qualifies as a chronic condition.
i'll speak to her.
there's one more topic of concern. should we delete the programme or keep moset in our database for future emergencies?
"i'm inclined to leave this up to you, doctor. you're the chief medical officer on this ship. as far as i'm concerned, there's no one more qualified than you to make that decision."
"thank you, captain."
but please make it quickly. i'm eager to resolve this matter. there's been enough moral controversy on this ship for one day.
come in.
at ease. interesting fragrance. i'm surprised it hasn't set off the environmental alarms.
it's a combination of mental relaxant and expeller of demons. it's an ancient klingon remedy.
feeling any better?
i'm alive.
"i hope you can understand why i went against your wishes, b'elanna. losing you was unacceptable. i know you're angry, but we need to put this behind us. understood?"
is that an order?
yes.
"you can't order someone to get rid of an emotion, captain."
and what emotion is that?
you had no right to make that decision for me!
"i'm the captain. you're my crewman. i did what i thought best. i get the feeling there are still a few demons in the air. let's hope this does the trick, huh?"
"doc, how's our patient?"
recuperating.
we did it.
"yes, we did."
"a celebration is in order. how about listening to that opera you promised me? oh, you're er, still wrestling with your ethical subroutines. take my advice. it's a waste of time. what's important is that we saved two lives today."
"i'm not concerned with today. it's tomorrow i'm worried about. captain janeway has left your future in my hands. she believes that, as voyager's chief medical officer, it's up to me to decide whether your programme remains in our database."
"personally, i predict a long and fruitful collaboration between us."
oh?
"think about what we accomplished in the last twenty four hours. our first case was a triumph. both patients are thriving, and we advanced the frontiers of medical science. i've already outlined a paper that you and i will one day present to the federation medical academy. total systemic invasion of a klingon-human hybrid by a cytoplasmic pseudoparasite. has a nice ring to it, don't you think?"
"are we also going to tell them where you honed your surgical techniques? a footnote, perhaps. for further details, see cardassian death camps."
those techniques were crucial this morning. where was your sarcasm then?
"i didn't come here to debate the issue with you, crell. i came here to inform you of my decision. it is my judgment that the medical consultant programme and all the algorithms contained therein shall be deleted from the database. in light of recent evidence i cannot in good conscience utilise research that was derived from such inhuman practices."
"in good conscience? what about the well-being of your crew? you're confronted by new forms of life every day, many of them dangerous. you need me. delete my programme and you violate the first oath you took as a physician. do no harm."
do no harm. you have no right to say those words. computer.
"you can erase my programme, doctor, but you can never change the fact that you've already used some of my research. where was your conscience when b'elanna was dying on that table? ethics? morality? conscience? funny how they all go out the airlock when we need something. are you and i really so different?"
"computer, delete medical consultant programme and all related files."
"lieutenant thomas eugene paris. i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign, and i sentence you to thirty days solitary confinement. take ensign paris to the brig."
i know the way.
brig.
"one, two, three"
"ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred."
staying in shape?
"oh, yeah. i do it every time i'm in jail."
"well, i hope all that exercise gave you an appetite."
leola root stew again? that's the third time this week. can't you just replicate me a pizza?
"sorry, tom. basic nutrition only. captain's orders."
"bread and water, huh? let's have it."
i got you the padd you asked for.
"oh, thanks. so, did you ask the warden about those holodeck privileges?"
"she said, and i quote, tell mister paris this is punishment, not shore leave."
it was worth a try.
"well, see you next meal."
"wait. leaving already? pull up a chair, stay a while."
sorry. no non-essential conversation with the prisoner.
"did the words cruel and unusual mean anything to her? i'm telling you, neelix, the inmates are getting restless. she's going to have a full-blown prison riot on her hands."
"begin letter. dear father. pause and erase. begin. to admiral paris. pause and erase. begin. hey, dad, long time no see. chances are you'll never receive this letter, but in case you do, there's a few things i wanted to say. first of all, bad news. er, i'm in jail again. wait, keep listening, don't turn this off. i want you to know how i ended up in here because it's not what you think. it all started on a morning i was doing something you would find a complete waste of time."
captain proton to buster kincaid. i've destroyed doctor chaotica's mind control machine and i'm on my way back to the spaceship.
"hello, proton."
who is this?
an old friend.
make that two old friends.
the twin mistresses of evil. i should have known.
i'm afraid your trusty sidekick is indisposed at the moment.
"don't worry about me, captain. i can handle myself."
we'll see about that. bring me the brain probe.
the what?
"the brain probe, you insolent fool."
"oh, right. your wish is my command. sorry, harry."
"no problem. torture me all you want, demonica, i'll never crack."
"oh, but you will."
by the time we're through with you you'll be begging to tell us everything you know.
you'll be our puppet.
"our slave,"
great. you're doing great.
"you're done for, demonica."
"malicia, she's demonica."
whatever. you two are going to jail for a very long time.
ooh.
ooh.
"move it, toots."
he's so brave.
it's a shame we'll have to kill him.
"i've got everything under control, proton, shouldn't you be getting back to headquarters?"
and leave you at the mercy of these two?
"come on, tom. i'm just getting to the good part."
senior officers report to the bridge.
i guess the good part'll have to wait.
any progress on those starcharts?
i'll have them to you by fourteen hundred.
fourteen hundred? you told me they'd be done yesterday.
"i'm sorry, tom. the sensor array went offline. seven of nine will have it up and running this morning. fourteen hundred, i promise."
you need some help? i'm not on duty again till tomorrow morning.
"no, i don't want to spoil your day off."
"oh, i don't mind."
thanks anyway.
see you lieutenant. buster.
bye.
i think jenny really likes you.
"yeah, i know."
i thought the feeling was mutual.
"how many times do i have to tell you? i like megan, but she won't give me the time of day."
what is the difference?
you can't be serious.
"they're the delaney sisters, harry. they're twins."
"are you kidding? they're nothing alike. jenny's aggressive and sometimes annoying. but megan, she's quiet, artistic, and she's got that cute little dimple in her right cheek."
jenny doesn't have the dimple?
no dimple.
bridge.
"well, you've done it again, harry."
what?
"fallen for the unattainable woman. first it was a hologram, then a borg, and now the wrong twin."
at least i'm consistent.
"sorry to interrupt your fun, gentlemen, but long range sensors have picked up something interesting."
a concentrated mass of oxygen and hydrogen. lots of animal and plant life.
an m-class planet?
"no, that's the interesting part."
we're entering visual range.
on screen.
what is it?
it's an ocean.
"according to these readings, it's bigger than the atlantic and pacific combined."
what's holding it together?
looks like there's some sort of containment field keeping it from dissipating.
"take us in closer, tom."
are those starships or submarines?
open a channel. this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. please identify yourselves.
they are powering weapons.
shields. red alert.
"shields holding, no damage. should i return fire?"
not yet. voyager to approaching vessels. we have no hostile intentions.
they're maintaining their course.
target the lead ship and take out their weapons.
direct hit.
they're hailing.
i guess we got their attention. on screen.
i'm deputy consul burkus of the monean maritime sovereignty. you've violated our space. withdraw or we'll resume firing.
"consul, we could have destroyed your ships, but we didn't. we have no interest in a fight."
then why are you here?
"because we're explorers, and we're fascinated by your ocean. and we'd like to learn more about it, and your people if you'd be willing."
and if we are not?
"we'll be disappointed, but we'll leave you alone."
your ship's impressive.
"well, i'd be happy to give you a tour."
"forgive our vigilance, captain. over the years, my government has had to protect our ocean from more than one hostile species."
i understand. we're also very protective of our own natural resources.
we're always interested in learning about other cultures. yours sounds particularly fascinating.
and this is voyager's command centre. feel free to have a look around.
"i'm curious, consul. have your people always lived here?"
our ancestors were nomadic. they only discovered the waters three hundred years ago.
i'll bet they were as stunned as we were to find this huge ball of water floating in space.
yes. mister?
paris. tom paris.
"my first officer, commander chakotay."
"they realised they could farm sea vegetation, extract oxygen from the ocean for their ships, create a permanent home."
what's your population?
more than eighty thousand.
and you all live underwater?
"lieutenant, we do have other business to attend to."
"mister tuvok, escort our guest to the briefing room. care to join us, mister paris?"
how could you tell?
do you still live aboard your ships?
"we've built an industrial infrastructure and undersea dwellings, but yes, most of our people still choose to live as our ancestors did."
"any idea how the ocean came into existence? in my experience, it's a unique phenomenon."
riga?
"there are several theories. our clerics teach that the ocean was a divine gift from the creators to protect and sustain us. but, in my opinion, the most plausible explanation is that the ocean formed naturally, much the same way that a gas giant does."
makes sense.
"unfortunately, our limited knowledge of the phenomenon has created a few problems."
what do you mean?
i'm not sure this is an appropriate topic.
but they might be able to help us.
we'll do anything we can.
the ocean's losing containment. hydro-volume has decreased more than seven percent in the last year alone.
any idea what's causing it?
no. to make a thorough study we'd need to explore the ocean centre where i believe the gravitational currents are fluctuating.
but that's more that six hundred kilometres deep.
our best research vessel can only go one hundred kilometres. beyond that the pressure's too great.
"well, we could take you there. captain?"
i had no idea you were such an old salt.
"when i saw that ocean today, it reminded me of the first time i read jules verne."
"20,000 leagues under the sea."
"i must have read it twenty thousand times. i was obsessed with stories about the ocean. all of my friends were busy with their holoprogrammes. i had my head buried in captains courageous, moby dick."
so your interest in history includes the nineteenth century as well?
"ancient sailing ships were always my first love. i had it all planned. finish high school, join the federation naval patrol. but my father had other ideas."
you'd think admiral paris might have understood his son's passion.
"as far as he was concerned, the only ship i was going to serve on had to have a starfleet insignia on it."
so now you have an opportunity to make up for lost time.
"captain, with a few simple thruster modifications to the delta flyer, she will be seaworthy in no time."
good. it'd take at least a week to make the necessary modifications to voyager.
then it's my mission?
bon voyage.
"and so, i thought to myself, who better than harry to be my first mate?"
first mate?
"oh, sailor talk. you'll get the hang of it.i'm telling you, harry, i have been dreaming about something like this for as long as i can remember."
"correct me if i'm wrong, but there is a mission involved here, right?"
"of course, but there's no law says we can't have a little fun along the way. ah, boatswain. ready to shove off?"
"what are you talking about, lieutenant?"
call me skipper.
sailor talk. you'll get used to it.
i think not. hull and thruster reinforcements are complete.
that's what i wanted to hear.
"oh, excuse me. am i in the right place?"
welcome aboard. i see you like to travel light.
"these are my instruments for measuring depth, pressure, currents."
we will not need them. this vessel is equipped with a complete sensor array.
oh.
it's okay. you can store your gear in the hold.
twenty thousand kilometres to the surface.
immersion shielding?
active.
anchors aweigh.
"those structures, what are they?"
it's our main oxygen refinery and desalination plant.
"corrosion resistant alloys, variable density ballast. an efficient design."
that means she's impressed.
we're very proud of what we've built here.
i can see why.
come in.
i'm afraid we have some disturbing news.
oh?
we've run a computer simulation to determine the rate of dissipation. it's worse than mister riga thought.
according to our estimates the ocean could experience a complete loss of containment in less than five years.
i'm sorry.
your calculations could be wrong.
"i know it sounds grim, but there may be some way to stop the process."
and if there isn't?
you might have to consider evacuating.
"i'm supposed to go back and explain this to forty seven regional sovereigns? they'll pass their first unanimous resolution, calling for my head."
"i can imagine how difficult this must be for you, but you will have to tell them."
"perhaps, but i'll wait until your delta flyer returns. maybe they'll find something tangible."
we're at a depth of five hundred and sixty kilometres.
what was that?
the hull contracting.
rerouting additional power to structural integrity. nothing to worry about.
i'm detecting multiphasic energy discharges bearing zero one two mark six. range twelve kilometres. a structure.
at this depth?
"adjusting course. i can't see anything. give me forward illumination, harry."
what is it?
it's generating massive amounts of artificial gravity. looks like some kind of field reactor.
if it's malfunctioning that would explain the loss of hydro-volume.
maybe it can be repaired. it looks ancient.
"well, if these readings are right, it's at least a hundred thousand years old."
we have no records of any previous inhabitants. who built it? where did they go?
looks like the reactor's controlled by a core computer. i'll try to upload the database and get some answers.
initiate the interface.
upload in progress
what's happening?
we've got a visitor.
what was it?
you're the one who lives here. you tell us.
no one's ever been this far down before. we don't know anything about marine life at these depths.
you are about to have the opportunity to make a detailed study.
the creature is emitting biothermic discharges.
it's like some kind of electric eel.
only a hell of a lot bigger.
and significantly more powerful. that last discharge exceeded five hundred thousand volts.
"the shields are fried, tom. you might want to think about getting us out of here."
thrusters are offline.
targeting forward phasers.
"no, you can't kill it."
i do not intend to. unfortunately the creature does not seem to be of a similar opinion.
how's that upload coming?
another couple of minutes.
firing phasers.
we only made him madder.
the creature is retreating.
we've got a breach.
i'm on it.
"six hundred kilometres underwater, propulsion offline, water pouring into the cabin. it was like something out of one of those jules verne stories you used to read me when i was a kid."
red alert. all hands to battle stations.
"hey, what about me? if we're in trouble we need our best pilot at the helm! you can't just leave me here!"
five ships? and they just opened fire without warning?
mmm hmm.
how did we get away?
"apparently, ensign culhane confused the enemy with a brilliant series of evasive manoeuvres. i hear captain janeway is considering him for chief conn. officer."
"oh, yeah? well, you just tell the captain that culhane's brilliant manoeuvres almost knocked me unconscious. you'd think he'd never flown a shuttle, much less a starship."
"there we are,"
that's it? aren't you going to run a neurological scan? maybe i should be granted a medical reprieve.
your injury was what naomi wildman refers to as a boo-boo.
"come on, doc, you don't understand what it's like being down here all day, every day. i'm going crazy."
"correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't that the idea?"
"no, seriously doc, you might want to take me down to sickbay for a full psychiatric evaluation. three or four days of observation at least."
see you in twenty days.
"doc! resume recording. okay, dad, where were we? ah, right. we had just sprung a leak."
nothing like a cold shower to wake up the senses.
"structural integrity is weakening. we've lost communications, shields, propulsion."
"we can reduce our density by venting plasma and transporting all non-essential equipment off the ship. it will take time, but we will eventually rise to the surface."
i think we should stay.
stay?
i'm not about to be scared off by a few damaged systems.
"tom, don't you think maybe you're carrying this captains courageous thing a little too far?"
"look, it's a good betthe reactor's malfunctioning. now we're only going to get one shot at fixing it. you want to leave? fine. give me an environmental suit and you can pick me up after you've repaired the flyer."
you're going for a swim? are you crazy?
you have a better idea?
"well, we already managed to interface with the reactor's computer. maybe we can make the repairs, maybe we can't, but i'm not leaving you down here alone."
what about you two?
i'll stay.
seven?
it is in my nature to comply with the collective.
i'm detecting a breach in the containment field.
any way we can seal it?
we might try reinforcing the field with a deflector beam.
do it. try hailing the delta flyer again.
nothing.
what do you think's happened?
they may be too deep to receive a transmission.
they may have had an accident.
it's possible.
"possible? captain, i'll need a better explanation than that. what am i supposed to tell the council?"
clarify something for me. are you more concerned about the lives of the people on that shuttle or your political career?
what's that?
a gravimetric discharge. the reactor's core is unstable.
you'd be unstable too if you were as old as this thing.
age has nothing to do with it. the reactor's diverting massive amounts of power to its structural integrity field. power normally reserved for oceanic containment.
that would explain why containment is weakening.
looks like the density of the water's been increasing over the past few years. it seems the reactor's just trying to keep itself from being crushed.
can we initiate a power transfer? stabilise the core?
"i believe so, but it would be a temporary solution."
that's better than nothing.
"captain, full containment has just been re-established."
the deflector beam?
negative. the ocean appears to have been stabilised from within.
it looks like our team has succeeded.
i'm picking up an object on a slow ascent. it's the flyer.
you've found something?
"i've been studying the generator's database. you're not going to believe this, but apparently, your ocean used to be part of a landmass."
really?
"as far as i can tell, it was part of a planetary ecosystem inhabited by a very advanced civilisation."
what happened to them?
that's a good question. all i know is they launched this reactor into orbit. they used some kind of elaborate kinetic transfer system to draw the water and everything in it up to the reactor.
extraordinary. why would anyone want to move an entire ocean?
"maybe there was some kind of disaster on the planet, or maybe it was just an experiment."
that must have been a massive undertaking.
took them almost two hundred years.
i wonder what they'd think if they knew we settled here and built another civilisation.
"actually, i think they'd be pretty concerned."
oh?
"this field reactor that they designed, it's a pretty amazing piece of technology. durable. i don't think it's responsible for the loss of containment."
"but as soon as we made the recalibration, the water stabilised. i don't see what else it could be."
"riga, your mining operations are destroying the ocean."
"you'll never get into starfleet academy by playing with toys. do your homework. are you listening to me, thomas?"
"thomas eugene paris, i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign and i sentence you to thirty years of solitary confinement"
"go to your room, young man. that's an order. stay there and think about what i've said."
tom?
"tom? tom, wake up. bad dream?"
"oh, you could say that."
"you know, you look like hell."
thanks. how'd you get past the guard?
the vulcan neck pinch.
come to spring me?
"well, the captain finally gave me permission to visit, but i've only got a few minutes."
that's big of her.
how are you doing?
"oh, thirty days? no problem. how's b'elanna?"
she misses you.
"yeah, i know the feeling."
"so, what have you been doing to pass the time?"
"thinking and, thinking. trying not to think. actually, i started recording a letter to my father."
really?
"yeah. for some reason i, i wanted to explain to him how i ended up in here. i didn't want him to think. well, anyway, i realised how ridiculous it was."
you should finish it.
give me one good reason.
maybe he'll hear it someday.
doubtful.
you'll feel better getting it off your chest?
"are you bucking for ship's counsellor, harry?"
"what are you going to do, delete the letter? that would be pointless."
at least i'm consistent.
tom.
"thanks for the visit, harry."
see you in fourteen.
what was it you once told me? that your father used to say you never finished anything.
"resume recording, so, we told consul burkus about the alien field reactor and how his oxygen refineries were destroying it. he took the news pretty well. at first."
"the council's very grateful for your help, captain. they've asked me to request the shield and thruster schematics for your delta flyer. we're hoping to design a probe that'll allow us to monitor the containment generator."
lieutenant torres will give you everything you need.
"i've also drawn up some designs for an oxygen replication system. it'll allow you to create free oxygen without extricating it from the water. it won't solve your problems overnight, but it's a start."
i'm sure it'll be very helpful.
"our oxygen extraction levels are still dangerously high. i'm going to recommend shutting down refineries four, five and six."
"we'll take it under advisement. well, captain, i wish you a safe journey."
"oh, we have a few more suggestions if you'd like to hear them."
please. pass them along to mister riga. he'll include them in his report.
i'm curious. who's going to read that report?
it will be given to the subcommittees on life support and agriculture.
"excuse me, consul. i'm not sure you understand the magnitude of the crisis. what you're suggesting could take months."
"thank you, mister riga."
"you should listen to him. if you don't make some serious changes around here soon, that ocean won't be here much longer."
"as i said, we understand his concerns."
do you? seems to me like you're just trying to sidestep the issue and send us on our way.
"with all due respect, who are you to tell us what to do with our ocean?"
"with all due respect, it's not your ocean."
lieutenant.
"it's all right, captain. i'd like to respond, but not as a diplomat, as a monean. you came here claiming you wanted to learn about our way of life and now, having spent three days here, you're suggesting we abandon it. we have an expression. brine in the veins. tell him what it means."
it's used to describe someone who has special connection to the waters.
"my family has lived here for ten generations. we protected this ocean, cultivated it, lived in harmony with the animals that inhabit it. can you say the same? i didn't think so. good day, captain."
we can't just let this go.
what do you want me to do?
of course. the almighty prime directive.
"would you please excuse us, lieutenant?"
see you later.
"i know you're upset, lieutenant, but when you're in a room with me you check that attitude at the door, understood?"
"captain, i'm sorry"
we can't expect an entire society to change because we think they should.
then you agree with me.
"yes, and we gave them the help they asked for. we told them what we know. now it's up to them to do what they think is appropriate."
you heard that consul. they're not going to do a damn thing.
"maybe not, but that's their prerogative."
captain.
"end of discussion, lieutenant. at fourteen hundred hours, we'll resume a course for the alpha quadrant. is that clear. is that clear?"
as a bell.
hey. here to stamp out intergalactic evil?
it's funny.
what?
"i went on this mission expecting to play out a childhood fantasy. but along the way, when i realised that ocean would just be gone one day, it started to matter to me. it sounds pretty stupid, huh?"
"no. no, it sounds like you've found yourself a cause."
i never thought of myself as a cause kind of guy.
"well, for what it's worth, i'm proud of you."
"thanks. but captain proton's not going to be able to save the day this time, is he?"
what about tom paris?
"council chamber, please."
"riga. you're dismissed, crewman."
i want you to tell me honestly. what do you think's going to happen now?
i think the bureaucracy isn't going to make more than token changes.
isn't there anything else you can do?
"i don't see how, other than taking the oxygen refineries offline."
"what would happen, hypothetically, if someone were to shut down the refineries?"
"well, i suppose they'd have to be rebuilt."
"yeah, and they'd probably be more willing to redesign them while they're at it. if nothing else, it would grab their attention."
are you suggesting
"i'm just asking questions, because i'm not supposed to get involved in the internal affairs of alien worlds. unless, of course, someone makes a direct request."
"if you can get me down there, i'd be willing to do it."
you'd be risking your life.
i know.
"captain, there has just been an unauthorised launch from shuttlebay one, the delta flyer."
tom.
hail him.
no response.
try a tractor beam.
we're out of range.
"we're being hailed, captain. it's consul burkus."
your shuttlecraft has violated our borders. i demand an explanation.
mister paris is acting without authorisation.
to what end?
"according to our scans, mister riga is with him. i have to assume they intend to take some sort of radical action to protect the ocean."
then i presume you intend to take radical action to stop them.
warning. hull pressure approaching critical.
we're going down too fast.
it's the only way we can outrun your ships.
janeway to paris. return to voyager immediately.
"sorry, captain. i can't do that."
"lieutenant, you are disobeying a direct order."
i know.
he cut us off.
what the hell are they up to?
looks like they're heading directly beneath the industrial complex.
can we reach them with phasers?
unadvisable. it would create a hydro-dynamic shock wave.
what about an old-fashioned depth charge?
it should be possible to modify a photon torpedo.
we could programme it to detonate once it's in proximity to the delta flyer.
do it.
"the torpedo is ready, captain. however, the delta flyer has submerged below our targeting range."
"consul burkus, hailing again."
on screen.
"our refinery workers have been given five minutes to clear the structure. was this the kind of evacuation you had in mind, captain?"
can you get them our in time?
"yes, but,"
do it. i'll find a way to protect your refinery. end transmission.
captain!
"he descended to avoid attack. if my calculations are correct, he will have to come back up to a depth of two thousand metres to strike his target."
"giving us a window of opportunity,"
precisely.
"captain, this is tom we're talking about. we're not going to open fire, are we?"
"as far as i'm concerned, he forfeited his status as a protected member of this crew the second he launched that shuttle."
how long till we reach our target?
thirty six seconds.
he's started his ascent.
hail him.
go ahead.
"lieutenant paris, this is your final warning."
he's not responding.
arm the torpedo.
twenty seconds to weapons range.
are you sure you want to go through with this?
do you?
i've taken you this far. we'd better arm that missile.
missile armed.
"stand down, mister paris."
or i will open fire.
still no answer.
time.
ten seconds. nine.
eight. seven. six.
five. four. three.
two. one.
fire.
fire!
the flyer has been disabled.
their missile?
deflected.
"lieutenant thomas eugene paris. you are guilty of insubordination, unauthorised use of a spacecraft, reckless endangerment, and conduct unbecoming an officer. do you have anything to say?"
riga needed my help.
"in doing so, you disobeyed my direct orders."
"yes, ma'am."
you violated the protocols that govern this crew.
"yes, ma'am."
"you nearly caused an armed conflict with the moneans. and frankly, you're lucky to be standing here right now. i would have destroyed your shuttle if necessary."
"yes, ma'am. permission to speak freely. riga's people weren't going to listen. they were going to ignore our warnings."
you don't know that.
"riga knew, and i was the only one who could help them."
"i understand your passion, but passion alone doesn't give you the right to take matters into your own hands. four years ago, i released you from prison and gave you a fresh start. until now, you've been a fine officer. your service on this ship has been exemplary. i really believed you were past this kind of conduct."
"i've never been very good at playing by the rules. that doesn't mean that serving under your command hasn't changed me, for the better. at least this time, i broke the rules for a reason. for something i believed in."
"i admire your principles, tom, but i can't ignore what you've done. i hereby reduce you to the rank of ensign, and i sentence you to thirty days solitary confinement. take ensign paris to the brig."
i know the way.
"rise and shine, ensign. your thirty days have been served. report for duty. you may want to shave first."
"yes, sir."
torres to paris.
go ahead.
rumour has it that you're free for dinner.
"gee, i don't know. are you sure you want to be seen associating with an ex-con?"
"my quarters, oh seven hundred. that's an order, ensign."
"yes, ma'am."
"resume recording. well, i'm out now and back to my duties. i honestly don't know if i'll ever understand you, or what went wrong between us, but i hope this letter helps you understand me a little better. computer, file letter in my personal database, and transmit when we're within range of earth."
the devore ships are assuming a tactical formation.
bridge to transporter room. status.
"all set here, captain. pattern cohesion looks stable."
"cargo bay one, report."
the bay is clear.
they're powering weapons.
why do they bother? they know we won't resist.
"protocol, mister paris."
they're hailing.
"gaharay vessel, prepare to be inspected. crew members are instructed to step away from their stations."
we know the drill.
sidearms and scanning equipment are to be set aside. deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated.
"all hands, this is the captain. prepare to be boarded by devore inspection teams. give them your full cooperation. let's get this over with."
"their soldiers have materialised on decks fifteen, eleven, four and one."
"captain janeway, report to your ready room."
"good morning, captain. i took the liberty of playing this music throughout your ship. i thought it might help your crew relax. sometimes these inspections can be stressful."
how thoughtful.
"i've replicated some coffee. black, as usual?"
black.
"prax here still refuses to try it but then, he's a man of few pleasures."
"captain, please, make yourself at home."
those cell cultures are extremely fragile. please
you've been routing power through your transporter system. why?
it's a routine diagnostic. we've been having trouble with our imaging scanners.
the problem is in the primary energising coils. focus your efforts there.
thanks for the tip.
contaminated antimatter. this material could interfere with our readings. a bionetic implant?
an interlink node. it permits communication with other borg drones.
you are not a telepath.
no.
remarkable. how old is this?
about six hundred years. my grandfather gave it to me when i was a child.
"it seems you have a long-standing obsession with exploration, captain. i, on the other hand, have much more in common with this ancient soldier."
he's from earth's classical period. it produced some of our greatest artists as well.
"your culture has many contradictions. violence and beauty, science and faith, all somehow mingled harmoniously. like the counterpoint of this music. mahler. symphony number one, am i correct?"
you're getting to know my musical database better than i do.
i've had time to review it since our last encounter.
"tell me, are all of your inspections this personal?"
"i'm just trying to get to know you, captain. there's no reason for us to be adversaries. i could be your friend, and right now you could certainly use one."
really? why is that?
"your predicament? i don't expect it's been easy. thousands of light years from home, navigating by strange stars, trespassing in other people's space, ignoring their laws."
"we're just trying to get back to earth, inspector."
through the devore imperium?
it's tough to avoid.
"still, most people make the effort. we don't exactly embrace outsiders."
gaharay?
"it means strangers. which brings me to a matter that could threaten our friendship. i've examined your crew manifest from our last inspection. commander tuvok, ensign vorik. vulcans. ensigns suder and jurot. betazoids. all telepaths, and yet for some reason you neglected to mention them."
"for a very simple reason. they're dead. tuvok, vorik, and jurot died in a shuttle crash about two months ago. suder was killed in a conflict with a species called the kazon."
"that's fortunate, for you i mean. if i'd known you were harbouring telepaths i would have had to arrest you for breaking our cardinal protocol."
"they were valued members of my crew, inspector, not criminals."
perhaps. captain do you trust me?
not for a second.
"exactly, and why should you? trust has to be earned. it's gradual. and yet it's the foundation of every relationship, professional and personal. it's also a concept alien to the telepathic races. why take someone at their word when you can simply read their mind?"
"we've completed our inspection. there are no telepaths aboard. however, their sensor logs indicate they deviated from their assigned course on two occasions."
"in both cases, to avoid ion storms."
"imperative thirty two, codicil six twenty six. all gaharay vehicles that deviate from prescribed flight vectors will be impounded, their crews detained and relocated."
"prax, it's clear the captain didn't intend to break protocol. i expect we can overlook these infractions."
"sir?  yes, sir."
"captain, i'm a reasonable man, and you've been cooperative, but consider this a reminder. you have a long trip through devore space and good friends can be an asset."
i'll keep it in mind.
the devore vessels are out of range.
bridge to transporter team. you're clear.
cargo bay one to ensign kim. pattern enhancers are in place.
initiating rematerialisation sequence.
harry?
i'm routing maximum power to the transporters.
got it. align the confinement beam to ten angstroms. energising.
"ensign kim, the confinement beam is unstable."
we're trying to correct it now.
what's the problem?
we are unable to consolidate their patterns. they've been in suspension too long.
"harry, increase power to the imaging scanners."
"aye, captain."
it's working.
"nice work, harry. all our guests are present and accounted for."
captain.
they're gone. for now.
back to your old self again?
"each time we do this, i feel as thought i've left a few molecules behind in your cargo bay."
"well, i'll have someone scan the room if it'll make you feel better. kir, we just received an encoded message from the transport vessel."
they've changed the rendezvous point again.
i'm afraid so.
did they send the new coordinates?
we're still waiting for them.
"captain, we may have another problem."
i've just treated tuvok and two of the refugees for acute cellular degradation. i've repaired most of the damage but unfortunately the effect is cumulative.
meaning?
"if we continue to go into transporter suspension, some of us may not survive."
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
we're receiving another transmission.
acknowledged.
"the new coordinates are here, within a mutara-class nebula two point three six light years from our current position."
"it's definitely out of the way. less chance of being discovered, but it'll take two more days to get there."
two days. that increases the chances that we'll run into another inspection.
"given the frequency of patrols in that area, it's likely we'll be stopped at least once."
"just what the doctor didn't order. tuvok, seven, i want you to lay in a course that'll attract as little attention as possible. avoid their colonies, space stations, tourist attractions, if they have any."
"the ogre of fire's castle hovered over the forest like a great black spaceship, turning day into night. flotter and trevis knew they had to find a way to keep the ogre from burning the forest down, but his castle, it was higher than the tallest tree. it seemed hopeless, until they discovered"
a door.
"a door. right, a mysterious door right in the middle of the"
the clearing.
"you know, it's, it's not nice to read people's thoughts when they're telling a story."
i'm sorry.
it's all right.
why don't you all go play by yourselves for a while. we'll finish the story later.
how are they doing?
"oh, fine, more or less. they don't understand what all the fuss is about, but they're telepaths, captain. if the parents are concerned or fearful the children feel it, too. you did the right thing. if we hadn't taken them off that freighter, they'd be in a detention centre by now."
"well, we're going to make sure that doesn't happen. is the kitchen still open or are you just serving stories?"
"for you, it's always open."
"i'm detecting a vessel, three hundred thousand kilometres and closing. the signature is devore."
red alert. shields up. bridge to captain.
"more company, commander?"
looks like it.
get our visitors to the cargo bay. stand by for transporter
suspension.
"aye, captain."
neelix.
"right away. come on now, we're going to go see your parents. let's go."
report.
"it's a scout ship. one pilot, no other crew."
the vessel hasn't raised shields or charged weapons.
"if this is another inspection, it's certainly a different approach."
we're being hailed.
open a channel.
captain.
inspector.
it's urgent that we speak.
you know the way to my ready room.
"it's all right, ensign. i submitted to your previous inspections because you outgunned me, but i don't see of your warships nearby. i have no intention of cooperating."
i'm not here to search voyager.
"then what do you want, inspector?"
"call me kashyk, please. i never liked that title. in fact, i've left it behind."
"did somebody offer you a promotion, or are you just having a bad day?"
"i'm defecting, and i need your help."
me?
i've come to ask asylum. safe passage out of devore space before i end up in a detention centre myself.
"now, why would i risk the safety of my crew by harbouring a defector?"
"because of what i'm about to tell you. if you continue on your present course, you'll be intercepted by a squadron of my warships. voyager will be seized, your crew imprisoned or worse. the nebula is a trap, captain, to catch vessels smuggling telepaths."
you've inspected my ship three times. you know we aren't smuggling telepaths or anyone else.
"what i know is that you have twelve refugees aboard right now. that you rescued them from a freighter three weeks ago, and that you've been concealing them in cargo bay one using your transporters. i could have exposed them at any time, but i wanted them to escape as much as you do. i can still protect them, but only if you take me with you. my people know about the wormhole. it's only a matter of time before they find it. you have no choice, captain. i'm your only hope."
"this is our rendezvous point, inside this nebula. unfortunately the transport vessel we're supposed to meet is no longer there. inspector."
a devore warship.
one of a dozen positioned throughout the nebula. all invisible to our sensors until kashyk showed me how to compensate for their refractive shielding.
your soldiers intercepted the transport ship?
over a week ago. we were the ones who changed the rendezvous coordinates. two vessels carrying refugees have already been seized. voyager would have been next.
"all right inspector, you helped us avoid this ambush. what now?"
"we'll have to get your passengers to the wormhole on our own. these are the schedules and routes of our patrols, along with tactical data on our shield and weapons configurations. enough to ensure that you avoid another inspection."
how long before you're missed?
"well, i took two weeks leave. enough time, i hope, to find the wormhole and get your passengers safely through it and myself, as well."
"your data is useful, but it doesn't guarantee our success."
"no, for that you'll need my guidance and some luck."
i'll have to take this up with the brenari. see what they think of their new benefactor. i'll let you know what they decide. i'll have to insist you remain under guard. no hard feelings.
no hard feelings.
"it's unusual, but not unheard of. there have been sympathisers before. kashyk may be telling the truth."
maybe you should just read his thoughts.
devore soldiers undergo years of mental training to prevent that.
"he might be telling the truth, but he also might be using us to find the wormhole."
"so what do we do, throw him in the brig?"
"no, we take him up on his offer to help, see how it plays out. but i want round the clock security. we need to watch his every movement. that leaves us with our next question. how do we find the wormhole?"
"i've given it some thought. there's a scientist named torat. he's from a nearby system. he's rumoured to know more about the wormhole than anyone. he might help us, for a price."
a price?
his species power their ships with a fluidic alloy that's difficult to find.
perhaps we can replicate it.
i have some data on it's composition.
"see what you can do. in the meantime we'll set a course for torat's planet, try to track him down."
nervous?
let's just say i'm not used to other people deciding my fate.
"until today, you were part of a government responsible for persecuting thousands of innocent people. why the sudden change of heart?"
there's nothing sudden about it. i've been looking for a way to escape for years. voyager was the perfect opportunity.
how so?
"well, what are you suggesting? i ask a brenari vessel for assistance? they'd throw me out an airlock. besides, you're something of a humanitarian, captain. i've read your database. i know all about starfleet philosophy. unless you left those ideals behind in the alpha quadrant?"
"i certainly don't grant asylum to every person i meet. especially ones who ransack my ship and terrorise my crew. you're asking me to believe you're someone else, and that's a leap of faith i'm not ready to make."
you're turning me away.
"no. no, i'm going to give you safe passage to the wormhole in return for your help in getting us there, but i'm also imposing some restrictions. you'll have your own quarters but limited access to voyager's systems and your whereabouts will be monitored at all times."
i'm used to being surrounded by armed guards. makes me feel secure.
only this time they answer to me. consider them a reminder that voyager is my ship.
i don't think anyone could doubt that.
he's trying to evade us.
hail him again.
mister torat doesn't seem too trusting. maybe he's been through one inspection too many.
no response. he's deactivated his communication system.
"i think i can tap into his computer, override the lockout."
do it.
go away!
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we have no hostile intent.
then why are you pursing me?
we'd just like to ask you
"federations, imperiums. why do you people feel such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organisations?"
i'd be glad to discuss that and any other philosophical issue you care to raise if you would just slow down and talk.
"sorry, can't do that. i'm late for a very important conference."
this is a waste of time. disable his ship.
"that's what we call overkill, inspector. ensign, can we transport at this range?"
absolutely. energising.
welcome aboard. your reputation precedes you.
"twenty centilitres of mercurium isochromate. no impurities, and this is just a sample. we've synthesised enough to power your ship for a year."
"it doesn't matter. i've never heard of this wormhole you're looking for, or these so-called refugees."
"well, they've heard of you."
"well, no doubt. my research is famous."
think of all the stars you could research once you've infused your propulsion system with this.
there's no point in bribing me.
he's right. he couldn't help us if he wanted to.
what do you mean by that?
i doubt you'd know a wormhole from a dark matter inversion.
"professor kashyk is another expert i've retained to help us with this matter. i'm afraid he's not as impressed with your work as i am. in fact, he discouraged me from seeking you out."
professor kashyk? never heard of you.
"not surprising, considering you toil in scientific obscurity."
obscurity! i've discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena!
not worth the sensors they were recorded on.
there's no need to insult the man. just because he doesn't know how to find an interspatial flexure.
"interspatial flexure? why didn't you say so in the first place? he said wormhole, a layman's term that that covers any number of phenomena. i am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorised as an interspatial flexure."
where is it?
"actually, a better question would be, where is it now? it's really quite interesting. the aperture of the phenomenon, which i prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. it manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. i can give you the last four locations. perhaps you can extrapolate the next one, if you're as accomplished a scientist as you claim to be."
think.
i'm thinking.
think harder. four wormhole appearances less than twenty light years apart. there's no pattern.
did you apply a fractal coefficient?
didn't work.
neutrino flux parameters? statistical algorithms?
every one i could find. this wormhole defies analysis. maybe torat was right. we're just out of our league.
it's not like you to give up. think harder.
how do you predict a random occurrence?
you follow your instincts. captain?
"counterpoint. it's in all great music. parallel melodies playing against one another. we've been looking at the obvious, frequency, location, timing, but each of those parameters could have a counterpoint in subspace."
"if we could run an algorithm based on subspace harmonics, it might reveal our pattern."
"computer, run a subspatial transkinetic analysis on the wormhole data."
analysis in progress.
this'll take a minute.
i'm going to miss this coffee of yours.
"well, i will give you the recipe."
thank you.
you don't sound too happy about leaving.
"the brenari aren't about to embrace a former inspector. i'll be feared, hated for what i represent."
"anxiety doesn't become you, inspector. try to relax a little."
i suppose you liked me better in uniform.
i haven't decided whether i like you at all.
we call them the kolyan kolyar. infinite spirals.
beautiful.
"as a boy, i spent years gazing at these lights. this is the last time i'll ever see them."
we have something similar back on earth. the aurora borealis.
"which you too may never see again. i suppose we're both refugees, in a way."
i'm still counting on getting this ship home.
are you sure you'll be welcome when you do? i came across something else in your database. the prime directive.
the federation's cardinal protocol.
it seems you violated it when you rescued these telepaths.
"well, let's just say i usually go with my instincts and sort it out later at the board of inquiry. those admirals and i were on a first name basis, you know. you're risking a lot, too. why?"
"three months ago my teams were inspecting a plasma refining vessel. we found a family of telepaths hiding in one of the extraction tanks. there was a child, very young. she'd been inside it for days, barely able to breathe. when i lifted her out and set her down on the deck, she thanked me. i sent her to a relocation centre with the others, knowing full well what would happen to her. after that, i could think of nothing else, and when i couldn't stand it any longer. you're my deliverance, captain."
analysis complete.
"it worked. it looks like it'll appear in about three days, less than eight light years from here."
the tehara system.
is that a problem?
there's an automated sensor array between here and tehara.
can we go around it?
we'd never make it in time. we'll have to find a way to avoid detection.
let's do it in the morning. we've done enough for tonight. are you saying goodbye? there will be other spirals.
they've just never looked quite so beautiful before. could be the company i'm keeping.
or the polarisation axis of the windows.
that must be it.
how often does this array emit a scanning pulse?
every forty seconds.
range?
ten light years. the pulse is designed to track warp fields and impulse signatures. if we lower our power output to beneath it's detection threshold
we could drift past undetected.
it's worth a try.
"well, good night."
"captain, why don't you join me? i've been looking forward to trying your replicator. well, i'm sure that i can come up with something to toast the evening. we've accomplished quite a bit today."
i'm afraid that won't be possible. i had your replicator taken offline.
in case i decided to replicate a weapon.
a safety precaution. you understand.
better than anyone.
sleep well.
and you.
as you were.
fifteen seconds.
our power output is below the detection threshold.
"ten seconds. five, four, three, two."
we weren't detected.
ten minutes and we'll be out of range.
"engineering to bridge, we've got a problem."
"that pulse triggered a variance in the antimatter stream. it's not much, but it'll light us up like a beacon when the next pulse hits."
options.
"i can't correct it in time, so that leaves shutting down the core."
do it.
the array has released another pulse.
time.
twenty eight seconds.
get down to the plasma injectors. grab a tricorder and monitor the antimatter flow.
"aye, sir."
twenty seconds.
b'elanna.
almost
"there, captain. i'm having a problem with the injectors."
"fifteen seconds. ten seconds. four, three two."
we've been detected. the array's transmitting an alert.
can we block it?
negative.
"stand down grey mode. b'elanna, fire up the core. we're getting out of here."
"warships will be on their way, but we can still reach the wormhole."
"if we can find it. tom, how long to the tehara system?"
eleven hours at maximum warp.
engines are back online.
engage.
"using the model you developed, we were able to narrow down the location of the wormhole's next appearance to a radius of two hundred thousand kilometres."
"we can't determine its exact position until we reach the system, but we know it will open in roughly six hours."
it will remain open for two minutes at most.
i've devised a new shield modulation which should protect us against their weapons.
you're not planning to fight your way to the wormhole?
if i have to.
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
long range sensors have picked up two devore warships heading right for us.
time to intercept.
six hours.
take the bridge. i'll be in engineering. kashyk.
"first we'll check those shield modifications, then we'll see if we can adjust our phasers to penetrate the devore shields. if torpedoes don't work i want an alternative."
"captain, we have to talk. but not here."
"i'm going back, to rejoin the warships. it's the only way i can guarantee your safety."
kashyk.
"i'm still a ranking officer. i can take command of the inspection teams, make sure the refugees aren't discovered."
you said yourself they're suspicious. return now and you risk being caught.
i can keep them off track long enough to get you through that wormhole.
it's too dangerous.
kathryn.
"you asked for safe passage and i agreed, under the condition that you follow my orders."
"you may stand a chance against one of our warships, but not against two. if i stay your best chance of escape will be lost."
i could confine you to quarters. i was planning on asking you to stay with us once we got through the wormhole. i wouldn't mind having someone around who appreciates a bit of tchaikovsky now and then.
"generous but, something tells me i wouldn't fit in any better on voyager."
"well, you wouldn't be the first wayward soul we've folded into our ranks. your shuttle will be ready for launch within the hour."
our course will put us just outside the teharan system by the time the warships arrive.
your inspection teams have to be off voyager before that wormhole opens.
"believe me, it will be the quickest inspection on record."
i'll be on the bridge. your efforts have been greatly appreciated.
my pleasure.
live long and prosper.
thank you.
begin pre-ignition sequence.
"i've made one adjustment to your plan. after the inspection, we're going to wait at the wormhole for as long as we can. until it begins to collapse."
i may not be able to join you this time.
try.
they're assuming a tactical formation. shields?
no. we follow protocol. bridge to transporter room.
status?
"ready, captain. pattern cohesion stable."
cargo bay one?
clear.
they're hailing.
on screen.
"gaharay vessel, prepare to be"
we've been through three inspections. please explain why another is necessary.
crew members are instructed to step away from their stations. side arms and scanning equipment are to be set aside. deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated.
"all hands, this is the captain. prepare to be boarded by devore inspections teams. give them your usual warm welcome."
"devore soldiers have materialised on decks fifteen, twelve, eight, four."
and one.
"captain janeway, report to your ready room."
captain. good to see you again.
likewise.
"tchaikovsky. of all the selections in your database, this remains my favourite."
"mine, too."
"i'm afraid prax isn't impressed. he's solely concerned with his work, aren't you, prax?"
"as you say, sir."
"yes, he's curious why you entered this sector. you're aware it's restricted."
we were planning to study a supernova remnant not far from here.
you strayed a full light year from your course in order to observe an astronomical phenomenon?
we're explorers.
"yes, i remember. i also remember warning you about going where you don't belong."
"exploring can sometimes be hard to resist, inspector."
"well, it's a romantic notion, captain, but one i can't allow you to indulge. i'm afraid i'll have to ask you to leave our space immediately. prax, why don't you check on our teams while i reiterate our protocols for captain janeway."
do they suspect anything?
"not yet, but our warships have been monitoring voyager's movements for the past few days, and mine as well. i don't think we have much time. the brenari?"
they're in transporter suspension.
and the wormhole?
we've found it. it's twenty thousand kilometres off our port bow. we've determined that a photon torpedo properly calibrated will force open the threshold long enough for voyager to get through.
"congratulations, captain. for a while, i wasn't sure if even you could find it. prax!"
go to cargo bay one. you'll find the transporter patterns for more than a dozen telepaths. rematerialise them.
"yes, sir."
impressive. you gave a masterful performance.
"i'm the one who's impressed, with your selflessness, your humanity. it made all this so much easier."
"oh, but what about your selflessness? that touching story about the little girl. was that a fabrication, too?"
"oh, that incident was real. what i didn't tell you was that after wrestling with my ethics, i realised that i'd done the right thing in order to protect my people from a very real threat. please. i insist."
captain.
"access their forward sensor array. you should find neutrino emissions at roughly twenty thousand kilometres off the port bow. on screen. target two photon torpedoes. when the first one detonates, the wormhole will open. use the second one to destabilise its subspace matrix. that will destroy it. prax, report!"
i've isolated the bio-patterns.
"fire! it should have detonated. those aren't neutrino emissions, they're antimatter residue signatures. there's no wormhole here. you created false readings."
"that is the theme for this evening, isn't it?"
"prax, do you have the telepaths?"
i have cargo containers.
filled with vegetables.
return to the bridge.
"computer, change music selection. mahler's symphony number one, second movement. maybe this will help you relax."
"inspector, we have completed our inventory of the vessel. two of their shuttlecraft are missing."
they couldn't have gone far. why didn't they appear on our long range scans? of course! adjust their scanners to compensate for refractive shielding.
"well, you gave us the specifications. seemed a shame to waste them."
"we've located the two shuttlecraft. range, twenty million kilometres."
order our ships to pursue. maximum speed!
we're approaching the coordinates. i'm firing the torpedo.
"kir, we're safe."
"the shuttles have disappeared from sensors. we've scanned for a wormhole. if there was one, it's gone. i'll order janeway and her crew removed. we'll confiscate the vessel, deliver them to the nearest detention centre."
you're dismissed.
"imperative twelve, codicil six requires"
"to hell with protocol, prax! do you think either of us will benefit from having this failure on our records? as far as you're concerned, this incident never occurred. make sure your teams share that understanding."
"well played, captain. it seems i never did earn your trust."
i had to take a few precautions. you understand.
better than anyone.
"i never lied to you. my offer to take you with us was genuine, and it would still stand if you'd kept your part of the bargain."
"for what it's worth, you made a tempting offer. the bridge is yours."
"turn ninety degrees to the left, please.  turn ninety degrees to the left, please.  turn ninety degrees to the right, please.  about face.  try to hold still, please."
is it going to hurt?
of course not. a few photons never hurt anybody.
we didn't do this last year.
that's because last year i didn't realise what an exciting tool my holo-imager could be in the pursuit of medical knowledge.
is something wrong with me?
your health is excellent. this is just another way to make sure that it stays excellent.
does my mother have to do this?
"your mother and everybody else on board. i made it part of the annual check-up. it's quite handy, really. by attuning the resonance spectrum along the subspace band i can take an image of my patients all the way down to the subatomic level."
subatomic level? i thought you said this wasn't going to hurt.
"i did, and it won't."
there. see? nothing to it.
"try to hold still, please."
are you making fun of me?
no.
"it'll only take a second to download your images into the medical database, if you'd like to stay for a moment and see what you look like from the inside out."
why not?
here we go.
handsome fellow.
"there's some scar tissue along the base of your lower skull. computer, isolate the occipital plexus, magnification five hundred. there. scarring along the dura mater."
from what?
"an operation. computer, isolate the cranial meninges, magnification one hundred. more scarring. no doubt about it. somebody performed neurosurgery. and that somebody was me.these microlinear incisions are a dead giveaway. i developed that procedure myself."
i don't understand. i don't remember having an operation.
"i'm a little confused as well, because i don't remember performing it."
who is it?
the doctor.
come in.
"i've finished giving the crew their annual physicals, but as usual the captain was a no-show."
let's get it over with.
specific complaints?
none. how's the crew?
"in good health, for the most part. i found a nascent alien retrovirus bouncing between personnel on decks ten and eleven, but managed to nip it in the bud. and there's been a little more wear and tear on seven of nine's cranial infrastructure. i'm going to double her maintenance routine. cytometabolism is normal. endocrine functions functioning."
that's a relief.
i'd like you to drop by sickbay at your earliest convenience. i've adjusted my holo-imager for deep body scans. you're the only member of the crew who hasn't posed for me yet.
maybe next week.
"it's a fine instrument, really. i've already discovered something of a mystery with it. apparently, i performed a complex neurosurgery on harry kim. according to the isotope decay around the scars, it was eighteen months ago."
i don't remember that.
"neither do i, and neither does the patient. i checked my medical entries for that period. there's no mention of surgery."
could your holo-imager have misinterpreted the scans?
possibly. the computer is double-checking the data now. i'd also like to run a complete diagnostic on my own programme and have a look at my memory files.
"b'elanna and harry are both busy with the plasma relay repairs. let's make sure you're next up on the list. thank you, doctor."
"hello, seven."
doctor.
i'm here to ask you a favour.
another time.
i beg your pardon?
"looks like i'm two for two. oh, the captain's acting like she's allergic to me, and now my prized pupil won't even give me the time of day."
state your request.
"a little mystery has cropped up. evidence that i performed surgery on ensign kim a year and a half ago, before you came aboard. the trouble is, i don't remember it. i wanted you to help me run a self-diagnostic."
"i will assist you, in one hour."
fair enough.
"computer, locate the emergency medical hologram."
the emh is inactive.
activate him.
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"i'm here to assist you, as i agreed. i've run a preliminary diagnostic of your programme. your suspicions were correct."
i never asked you to run a diagnostic. suspicions? what are you talking about?
you don't recall speaking to me in the astrometrics lab one hour ago.
"no. the last i remember, i was completing the yearly physicals."
you mentioned a neurosurgery you performed on ensign kim eighteen months ago.
"computer, locate the holoscans i took of ensign kim this morning. any operation would show"
unavailable. that file has been deleted.
let's have a look at my programme.
a deletion in your short term memory buffer.
"our chat in astrometrics never got filed. that's why i can't remember it. if i were given to paranoia, i'd say someone is trying to keep me from finding out what happened eighteen months ago. my photo album."
doctor?
i was quite a shutterbug back then. not a day went by when i didn't record an image for posterity. let's have a walk down memory lane. meet me on holodeck two.
"computer, display all holo-images taken on stardate 50979"
those holo-images have been deleted.
deleted? by whom?
unknown.
i'm detecting residual photons in the holo-buffer. it may be possible to partially reconstruct the images.
try.
i've restored five images. they are degraded but intact.
let's see them.
the mess hall.
do you remember this?
no. who is that? the ensign. it seems to be her birthday.
i've never seen her before.
"the ensign again. i never went on a shuttle mission with harry kim, and certainly not with her. and again."
i've isolated your memory files from stardate 50979.
they weren't deleted?
no.
then why can't i remember them?
the programme was rewritten to deny you access to those memories. i'm trying to restore them.
"hear, hear."
"hear, hear."
say cheese.
cheese.
what happened?
i was in the mess hall.
the files are difficult to localise. the memories will be out of sequence.
what was that?
our sensors are dead.
make a wish.
they've stopped.
one moment.
i'm going to kill you.
"ensign, i haven't seen you in months."
"price i pay for staying in good health, i guess."
"acetylcholine, twenty five microlitres. it's not helping. i'm getting massive synaptic failure."
that doesn't make any sense.
this is the last one.
say cheese.
cheese.
call the captain.
i don't recognise this species. seven?
they are unknown to the borg.
perhaps these images have been manipulated.
"no, they're real. the image buffer would have shown signs of tampering. i have a different theory. i believe there was an attack on voyager by this species and all our memories of the event were erased. this is the unknown crewman i told you about. ensign jetal. the question is, who was she? an alien intruder posing as a starfleet ensign? of course, it's impossible to tell from a photograph, but one thing is certain. we are in immediate danger."
how so?
"only a few hours ago, as i was beginning this investigation, someone shut down my programme and eliminated all my memories of the last twenty four hours."
an intruder may be on board.
run a deck by deck security sweep.
understood.
report to the astrometrics lab and recalibrate the sensors. see if you can detect any cloaked vessels nearby.
i'll review the medical records of the crew. ensign kim may not have been the only one who was injured during the attack.
"no, i want you to deactivate yourself for now. we'll erect a security field around the main computer and encrypt all pathways leading to your programme. if someone does try to tamper with you again, i want to be ready."
captain.
"it's for your own safety, doctor. thank you for bringing this to my attention."
you will keep me informed?
absolutely. dismissed.
"computer, transfer my programme from the mobile emitter to the sickbay systems."
transfer complete.
"computer, duplicate all of my memory files recorded within the last forty eight hours."
duplication complete.
"now, i'm going offline. if my programme is altered without my authorisation, reactivate me and restore the duplicate memory files. interface with the holo-imaging device. if anybody enters this room, commence imaging in five second intervals."
acknowledged.
"computer, deactivate emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency. hello?
restoring memory files. restoration complete.
"believe me, i was there."
so was i.
commander chakotay is correct.
oh? and how would you know?
"in my youth, i studied many forms of martial art, including the sumo of earth. i have followed the sport ever since."
it was the 77th emperor's cup. takashi forced kar-pek out of the circle in less than three seconds. i had a fifth row seat.
"then you must have been ordering sake, because takashi's knee broke the sand and the referee gave the match to kar-pek."
exactly.
"if this is another house call, it'll have to wait. as you can see, i've got a mutiny on my hands."
a mutiny? i suppose that's better than a conspiracy.
doctor?
"tell her, captain. describe how you tampered with my programme. how it was you all along."
"perhaps you should accompany me to sickbay, doctor."
"et tu, tuvok? you're conspiring against me, all of you. why?"
in my ready room.
you've been manipulating my programme. don't deny it.
i don't intend to.
"but, the alien ship, the intruder? did that attack actually happen?"
yes. you were damaged during the incident.
damaged?
it caused a conflict in your programming that couldn't be resolved.
what kind of conflict?
i had no choice but to deny you access to your memories of those events.
what kind of conflict?
"if i told you that, i might set the whole thing in motion again."
this conflict in my programming.
yes.
that's not good enough.
it'll have to be.
captain!
i've made a command decision for your own benefit and the welfare of this entire crew. i'm not willing to debate it.
how would you like it if i operated on you without your consent or without your knowledge?
if the operation saved my life? i could live with it.
i don't believe you. you'd feel as violated as i do right now.
whether you believe me or not is beside the point. a year and a half ago the only solution was to rewrite your programme. i have to perform that same procedure now.
that isn't fair.
"you're malfunctioning, and you need to be repaired. return to sickbay and wait for my orders."
doctor.
what's happening? what are you doing?
"lieutenant torres requires a copy of your most recent memory files, including the backups."
you're going to rewrite my programme.
"the captain thinks it's for the best. i'm sorry. b'elanna and seven are setting up the procedure right now. in the meantime, you're to brief mister paris about any experiments you're performing, any tests."
i'll be filling in while your programme's offline.
"okay, so, you're running some kind of cell analysis?"
yes.
"well, lets take a look."
what happened eighteen months ago?
doc.
why won't the captain tell me?
she has her reasons.
and you agree with her.
"i was there and yes, i agree with her."
come in. are you having a little trouble regenerating?
my alcove is functioning properly. i am having trouble with the nature of individuality.
there's a time and a place for philosophical discussion. two in the morning in my quarters isn't one of them. but i'll tell you what. meet me in the mess hall tomorrow.
tomorrow will be too late. we'll have already rewritten the doctor's programme by then.
and violated his rights as an individual.
precisely.
"if you've come to act as my conscience, you're a little late. i considered these issues eighteen months ago, as i did again this morning. i came to the same conclusion."
your conclusion is wrong.
"coffee, black.  lukewarm. now i've told that replicator a dozen times about the temperature of my coffee. it just doesn't seem to want to listen. almost as if it's got a mind of its own. but it doesn't. a replicator operates through a series of electronic pathways that allow it to receive instructions and take appropriate action, and there you go. a cup of coffee, a bowl of soup, a plasma conduit, whatever we tell it to do. as difficult as it is to accept, the doctor is more like that replicator than he is like us."
he would disagree.
"i'm sure he would, but i can't let that change my decision. i learned that the hard way when his programme almost self-destructed. i won't take that risk again."
the risk isn't yours to take.
"if one of my crew chose to put a phaser to his own head, should i let him?"
it would depend on the situation.
"it always depends on the situation, seven, but we can debate philosophy another time."
"when you separated me from the collective, i was an unknown risk to your crew, yet you kept me on board. you allowed me to evolve into an individual."
you're a human being. he's a hologram.
"and you allowed that hologram to evolve as well, to exceed his original programming. and yet now you choose to abandon him."
objection noted. good night.
"it is unsettling. you say that i am a human being and yet i am also borg. part of me not unlike your replicator. not unlike the doctor. will you one day choose to abandon me as well? i have always looked to you as my example, my guide to humanity. perhaps i've been mistaken. good night."
"i'd like to think i made my decision eighteen months ago for all the right reasons. the truth is, my own biases about what you are had just as much to do with it. at the very least, you deserve to know exactly what happened. if you're willing."
i'm ready.
you're standing on my foot.
i am not.
shush.
"if you ask me, they should have just locked the turbolift and thrown away."
"neelix, the power's down. jetal to torres."
"er, go ahead, ensign. or should i say."
surprise!
i'm going to kill you.
i want you to go along on a few of the shuttle surveys. if i can talk you into it.
another away mission? certainly! i'm flattered.
"i guess the birthday girl and i get the pleasure of your company, doc."
"you launch at nineteen hundred hours, shuttlebay one."
"hello, doctor."
ensign jetal. i haven't seen you in months.
the price i pay for staying in good health.
"so, keeping busy down on deck eleven?"
"too busy. we're modifying one of the shuttles, making it more manoeuvrable and more cool."
i see you've been working with mister paris. my condolences.
"i thought i picked up a slight distortion in subspace, but it's not there any more."
nothing on long range sensors but a few hydrogen atoms.
candid shot?
try to look natural.
"oh, at least it's my good side."
let's get one of the group.
this is the last one.
say cheese.
cheese.
"doctor, i have a shuttle to fly."
"ah, yes."
what was that?
our sensors are dead.
power's being drained. shields and weapons are offline.
how?
"doctor to voyager, mayday. we're under attack. i've got wounded. mayday!"
"acknowledged, doctor. set navigational controls to return to voyager."
"commander, can you hear me?"
"doctor, please respond."
"hello? computer, engage autonavigation. lay in a course for voyager, full impulse."
doctor.
stay calm. that weapon carried quite a punch.
is she okay?
she's unconscious.
voyager?
we've lost contact. i sent that alien back to his ship. you think they'd be grateful.
you should have beamed him into space.
"i'm not in the business of killing people, ensign. synaptic shock? but there was no neural damage. mister kim! i don't understand. no."
"doctor, stand by for transport."
beam us directly to sickbay.
prepare these people for surgery.
here. what happened?
we were fired on. there's something wrong with their nervous systems. we've got to stabilise their synapses. get me a choline compound.
which choline compound?
it doesn't matter. just make sure it's a pure base. her spinal cord's deteriorating.  same rate of collapse.
"acetylcholine, twenty five microlitres. it's not helping. i'm reading massive synaptic failure."
this doesn't make any sense.
paris to engineering. transfer all available power to sickbay.
acknowledged.
"some kind of plasmic energy is arcing between their neural membranes. that weapon, it was designed to do this."
to leave a residual charge in the victim's body?
"an energy pulse that remains in the neural membranes, working its way up the spinal cord to the brain. they'll be dead in minutes if we don't find a way to stop it. i've got to protect their brain functions."
his neocortex is failing.
a spinal shunt. i'll isolate the spinal cord from the brain stem until i can repair the cellular damage. but i don't have time to perform the procedure on both of them.
then talk me through it. we'll do them together.
it's too complex.
"then make a choice, before we lose them both!"
subdermal scalpel. bio-electric field generator.
his vital signs are stabilising. it's working.
cellular regenerator. his neural membranes are re-establishing themselves. good.
"the attack, how did it end? were there more casualties?"
"we exchanged fire for another few minutes, then the aliens withdrew. there was only one casualty. ensign jetal."
"i don't mean to seem unfeeling, but i'm programmed to accept the loss of a patient with professional detachment."
"we are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead, ensign ahni jetal. her intelligence and her charm have made our long journey home seem not quite so long. as she continues on a journey of her own, we will keep her in our hearts and in our memories."
"we're low on synthetic antigens, and i'm sorry to report many of the medicinal plants you've collected over the past several months were destroyed as well."
i have some herbs in storage you might be able to use.
been holding out on me?
"no, i was keeping them around just in case."
good planning.
"as for the antigens, i'll have to start replicating them in batches. which do you want first?"
"decisions, decisions. how do you make a decision, mister neelix? in general, i mean."
i guess i weigh the alternatives and try to decide which is best.
which is best. how do you determine that?
"i never thought about it, really."
"well, maybe you should. think about it, i mean."
i guess every situation is a little different.
"for me, it's rather simple. while i'm faced with a decision, my programme calculates the variables, and i take action. for example, what could be simpler than a triage situation in sickbay? two patients, for example, both injured, for example, both in imminent danger of dying. calculate the variables. my programme needs to ascertain which patient has the greater chance of survival, and that's the one i treat."
"simple. but, what if they have an equal chance of survival? what then? hmm? flip a coin? pick a card?"
doctor.
"oh, i'm all right. i'm a hologram. i don't get injured, i don't feel pain, i don't die. unlike some people i could tell you about. for example, two patients. both injured, both in imminent danger of. don't touch me! i'm a hologram. photonic energy. don't waste your time."
"neelix to security. send a team to the mess hall, please."
"a whole team, mister neelix? throwing a little party, are we? why, i attended a party just recently. a birthday party for a very nice young woman. i made a decision there, too. several of them, in fact. when i came through the door, do i turn right or do i turn left? as i recall, i decided on the latter. then, what should i see before me but the hors d'oeuvre tray, and another decision. do i take a canapé or refuse? oh, that's an easy one. i'm a hologram. i don't eat."
something's wrong with him.
"don't you know it's rude to refer to somebody in the third person. you had a choice, mister neelix. should i do something rude or not do something rude?"
"doctor, we must return to sickbay."
"why should i? what if i don't want to return to sickbay? what if i decide not to return to sickbay? no, i don't choose this. leave me alone! let me go! why did she have to die? why did i kill her? why did i decide to kill her? why? somebody tell me why!"
it was downhill from there. you developed a feedback loop between your ethical and cognitive subroutines. you were having the same thoughts over and over again. we couldn't stop it.
our only option was to erase your memories of those events.
"you were right. i didn't deserve to keep those memories, not after what i did."
you were performing your duty.
"two patients, which do i kill?"
doctor.
"doctor? hardly! a doctor retains his objectivity. i didn't do that, did i? two patients, equal chances of survival and i chose the one i was closer to? i chose my friend? that's not in my programming! that's not what i was designed to do! go ahead! reprogramme me! i'll lend you a hand! let's start with this very day, this hour, this second!"
"computer, deactivate the emh."
here we go again. captain?
"it's as though there's a battle being fought inside him, between his original programming and what he's become. our solution was to end that battle. what if we were wrong?"
"we've seen what happens to him. in fact, we've seen it twice."
"still, we allowed him to evolve, and at the first sign of trouble? we gave him a soul, b'elanna. do we have the right to take it away now?"
we gave him personality subroutines. i'd hardly call that a soul.
captain.
i'm having trouble with the nature of individuality.
you require a philosophical discussion?
"there's a time and a place for it. this is one of them. after i freed you from the collective, you were transformed. it's been a difficult process. was it worth it?"
i had no choice.
"if i could change what happened, erase what you did to me, would i? no."
"the more i think about it, the more i realise there's nothing i could've done differently."
what do you mean?
"the primordial atom burst, sending out its radiation, setting everything in motion. one particle collides with another, gases expand, planets contract, and before you know it we've got starships and holodecks and chicken soup. in fact, you can't help but have starships and holodecks and chicken soup, because it was all determined twenty billion years ago!"
there is a certain logic to your logic. progress?
"i'm not sure if he's making any sense of this experience, or if his programme's just running in circles."
you've been here for sixteen hours. let me continue while you rest.
i'll be all right. go back to the bridge.
how can you read at a time like this?
it helps me think.
think? what do you need to think about?
you. this book is relevant to your situation.
oh? what is it?
"poetry, written on earth a thousand years ago. la vita nuova."
"la vita nuova. the new life? ha! tell that to ensign jetal. actually, i killed her countless times."
what do you mean?
"causality, probability. for every action, there's an infinite number of reactions and in each one of them, i killed her. or did i? too many possibilities. too many pathways for my programme to follow. impossible to choose. still, i can't live with the knowledge of what i've done. i can't."
captain? captain?
"oh, sorry."
how could you sleep at a time like this?
it's been a long day. you were saying?
what's wrong?
nothing.
you're ill!
i have a headache.
"fever, you have a fever."
i'll live.
medical emergency!
doctor.
someone's got to treat you immediately. call mister paris. you've got to get to sickbay.
"doctor, i'm a little busy right now, helping a friend."
"i, i'll be all right. go, sleep, please. i'll still be here in the morning."
are you sure?
"yes. please, i don't want to be responsible for any more suffering."
good night. if you need anything.
"i'll call. thank you, captain."
"in that book which is my memory, on the first page of the chapter that is the day when i first met you, appear the words - here begins a new life."
"the adventures of captain proton! chapter eighteen: bride of chaotica! the evil doctor chaotica kidnaps constance goodheart and plans to sacrifice her to arachnia, queen of the spider people.  captain proton travels millions of miles to planet x where he will invade the fortress of doom. chaotica fires his fiendish death ray. certain death for proton as his rocket ship bursts into flames."
we didn't burst into flames in the last chapter. why are these recaps always so inaccurate?
"well, they brought people back to the theatres."
cliff-hangers.
the lost art of hyperbole. you ready?
"aye, captain."
"let's get this show on the road. computer, begin chapter eighteen."
we're receiving a transmission. it's chaotica.
imagising.
captain proton. surrender!
not a chance. release miss goodheart and we'll be on our way.
i'm afraid your secretary has already been promised to queen arachnia as a supreme sacrifice.
you'll never get away with this.
"oh, ho ho ho, but i shall. you escaped from my death ray once, but you won't survive this!"
he's charging the weapon.
brace for impact.
direct hit. we lost both engines.
steering jets are on the fritz.
we're going down!
the landing gear is jammed. hang on!
opening hatch.
welcome to planet x.
what's the plan?
"this is the part where we defeat chaotica's soldiers, steal their uniforms, and make our way through the underground caverns."
"hey, i thought you said there were slave girls in this chapter."
"after we infiltrate the fortress of doom, we'll free chaotica's harem. let's go."
i'm right behind you.
planet x looks kind of familiar. what was the last place we went to?
the mines of mercury.
they're identical.
"sets were expensive. at least there's no erupting volcano this time. ah, behold the fortress of doom."
and how are we supposed to get up there?
i told you. the un
derground caverns.
right.
i thought you said there was no volcano.
i did.
"er, tom."
definitely not chaotica.
"computer, end programme."
unable to comply. holodeck controls are offline.
"paris to bridge. bridge, respond."
we need to find the manual overrides.
there's an access port in the rocket ship. come on.
report.
we've dropped out of warp. we're at a dead stop.
cause?
unknown. engines are operational.
i'm reading gravimetric forces around the ship. they're disrupting our power flow.
"control systems are going offline. i no longer have access to communications, deflector, weapons."
"scan for vessels, tractor beams, anything that might explain what's holding us here."
halt in the name of chaotica! proton!
buddy of yours?
surprised? you thought i perished in the den of crocodiles.
we don't have time for this.
i survived clinging to the thought that i would one day
i believe i have an explanation. sensors show that we've entered a layer of subspace. it's disrupting our warp field.
do we have impulse?
yes
engage at full.
no change in our position.
route all available power to the engines.
we're not moving.
the impulse reactor's running hot. we're heading for an overload.
give it all she's got. full thrusters.
no effect. reactors are critical.
abort. increase power to the structural integrity field. we may be here awhile.
it's no use. i can't disengage the programme.
"well, you better think of something fast, proton. a second distortion just appeared. whatever they are, they're getting bigger."
hold on. i've got access to the transporter. i'm going to try a site to site.
there's a third one.
i've run a trans-spectral analysis. the area between space and subspace is unstable throughout this region.
"basically, we've run aground on a subspace sandbar. i've tried realigning the warp field, reversing hull polarity."
maybe we should just get out and push.
the gravimetric forces are disrupting our control systems.
"as long as we're trapped here we won't have access to the computer core, tactical, holodecks, and all but six replicators."
what about those distortions on the holodeck? what's the connection?
they appear to be random energy fluctuations. i don't believe they post a threat.
"let's keep an eye on them anyway, and evacuate that deck just to be safe. a few years back, when i was a science officer on the al-batani, we tried to navigate a dense protonebula. it stopped us dead in our tracks. for three days we attempted to force our way out, until we realised we were trying too hard."
captain?
"every time we engaged the engines, we were increasing the resistance of the nebula's particle field. we may be facing a similar situation."
"our own warp field may be increasing the gravimetric forces. if we power down the core and use minimal thrusters, we might be able to break free."
you took the words right out of my mouth.
your plan could work.
now that we have your blessing.
let's give it a try.
"halt, in the name of chaotica!"
we intend no harm.
seize them! lower the drawbridge. we are bringing prisoners.
"yes, yes, yes, lonzak, what do you want?"
your majesty.
where's proton?
"he er, escaped."
fool! you will pay for your incompetence. seize him!
surrender.
"but majesty, i have brought prisoners."
more earthlings?
no. they claim they're from another dimension.
the fifth dimension. bring them to me.
identify yourself.
"you insult me. i am chaotica, ruler of the cosmos."
"kneel before his majesty. i said, kneel!"
you have invaded my planet. why?
to contact other photonic lifeforms. to learn from them.
are you alone or are you the vanguard of an invading army?
we are explorers.
i am growing weary of this charade. your armies will be no match for my space force. we'll crush you like insects.
they are hostile. this contact should be terminated.
"indeed. lonzak, execute them."
coward. he'll learn there's no escape from chaotica. gather my space force. power the death ray.
"at once, majesty."
"take miss goodheart to arachnia. invite the queen to join me in battle. together, we will rain destruction on the fifth dimension!"
look on the bright side. there's only three meals a day.
"coffee, black."
"sorry, captain. we lost two more replicators this morning"
"listen to me very carefully because i'm only going to say this once. coffee, black."
"yes, ma'am. coffee, black. while i've got your attention, there are"
"coffee first. now, what's the problem?"
"it's a, it's a delicate matter."
"i don't have time to play twenty questions, neelix."
replicators aren't the only systems of convenience offline. we've only got four functioning lavatories for a ship of a hundred and fifty people.
i see.
"needless to say, lines are beginning to form. if we don't get unstuck soon we may have a serious problem on our hands. especially with the bolians. all but three sonic showers are offline, too. in another couple of days"
i get the idea.
captain to the bridge.
on my way. i'm going to leave these problems in your capable hands.
"yes ma'am. i was thinking, if we drew up a schedule."
whatever it takes.
status.
the warp core has been powered down. the thrusters at standby.
"okay. let's give it a try. take us out, tom. nice and slow."
we're moving. two metres per second. three metres.
steady.
nine metres. ten.
increase power to the thrusters by fifty percent.
we're approaching the subspace boundary.
"twenty five metres per second. wait a minute, we're slowing down. nineteen metres per second, eighteen."
"captain, i'm reading power surges."
source?
"unknown, but they look like weapon signatures."
i'm not reading any other ships in the area.
we've stopped.
"i've localised the weapons fire. it's emanating from within the ship. deck six, holodeck two."
who's still on that deck?
no one. no lifesigns.
there's a programme running. it's captain proton.
proton?
can you shut it down?
negative. control systems still malfunctioning.
"tuvok, get down there and find out what's happening. well, join him."
"yes, ma'am."
it appears that a battle took place.
"believe me, it wasn't like this when i left. i must have missed a few chapters."
holodeck programmes don't normally run by themselves.
no kidding.
she's dead.
who is she?
"constance goodheart, my secretary. this doesn't make sense. she isn't supposed to die. she's one of the good guys."
"i'm sure you two were very close, but she is a holodeck character."
a character from 1930s hollywood. the good guys never get killed. something's wrong here.
invaders from the fifth dimension.
satan's robot.
naturally.
queen arachnia is on her way. invaders from the fifth dimension. destroy proton.
give me a hand. if we can repair his vocaliser he might be able to tell us what's been going on. it looks like he burned out a resister.
a what?
that's a few centuries before duotronic circuitry.
i see. how do you propose we repair him?
"well, first of all, i've gotta remove this damaged tube. no problem. just a few crossed wires."
your knowledge of this technology is most impressive.
"oh, thanks. got it."
intruders. intruders. intruders. intruder alert! intruder alert!
tell us what happened.
invaders from the fifth dimension. invaders from the fifth dimension
"hey, calm down."
how did these invaders get here?
a portal.
a fifth dimension? there's not supposed to be alien invaders in this story. that's in captain proton versus the cosmic creature.
invaders from the fifth dimension.
those subspace distortions. take us to this portal.
there.
photonic charges. the same signatures as the weapons fire we detected.
the fifth dimension.
we must report this to the captain.
wait. i want to check my rocket ship first.
excuse me?
"it's got sensors, sort of. maybe they can tell us something voyager's sensors can't."
i've established a visual link with the holodeck. the attack appears to be originating from subspace.
can you tell where it's coming from?
no.
what was that?
chaotica's death ray.
excuse me?
"let's see if we can get a look inside his fortress, find out what he's up to."
"full power to the death ray! arachnia, queen of the spider people. you have not responded to my summons. don't"
i don't get it. chaotica was supposed to be fighting earth in this chapter.
apparently he's found a new enemy.
the fifth dimension.
it seems your infantile scenario now poses a security risk.
it was just supposed to be a little harmless entertainment.
entertainment. another frivolous human endeavour.
these are your sensor readings?
telegram. it's a message to captain proton from the president of earth. intercepted communications between doctor chaotica and arachnia. stop. chaotica at war with aliens from fifth dimension. stop. must strike now to disable death ray.
stop. please summarise the message.
"well, it looks like chaotica has captured a couple of aliens from the fifth dimension."
an alternate universe.
could be. maybe they wandered into the holodeck through one of those distortions.
to participate in a game?
intruder!
i assume there's no locking mechanism on the hatch?
it was a simpler time.
is he part of the programme?
i don't recognise him.
invaders!
quiet! look there's been a misunderstanding. i'm ensign paris from the starship voyager. this is lieutenant tuvok.
you have killed fifty three of my people.
we haven't killed anyone.
ensign. everything you see here is a simulation. none of it's real.
simulation?
a photonically-based projection.
all life is photonic.
we are not. we are biochemical lifeforms.
i'm not familiar with biochemical.
we are carbon based. we live aboard a starship. i believe we have become trapped in a region of space that intersects your own.
we've detected no starship. only this planet.
"this planet isn't real. as i told you, it's part of a simulation."
maybe we can help you adjust your sensors.
you don't register as a lifeform. you are the illusion.
we're as real as you are. listen.
"citizen of the fifth dimension, you will be destroyed. you"
wait. wait!
damage. damage. require maintenance. help. help. help.
let me get this straight. transdimensional aliens have mistaken your captain proton simulation for reality.
"yes, ma'am."
and now an armed conflict has broken out between these aliens and chaotica's holographic army.
"yes, ma'am. his army of evil."
and will someone please explain why we haven't simply shut down the holodeck?
we've tried. the controls are still offline.
we're going to have to get through to these aliens somehow and explain that they're fighting shadows.
"we've tried, but they don't believe us. they think that we're not real. they can't detect voyager, so every time they scan us we seem as artificial to them as holographic characters do to us."
that explains why they haven't answered our hails.
the doctor is photonic. he may be able to persuade them.
it's worth a try. brief him.
"in the meantime, i think we should let the programme play out."
you're not suggesting we wait until this chaotica defeats the aliens?
"no, no, i'm suggesting that we help the aliens to defeat chaotica. they think that he's leading some kind of hostile invasion force. once that threat is gone, it's a good bet that they will leave and close up their portals."
how do you propose to defeat chaotica?
"well, he's been attacking the aliens with his death ray."
it's a shame we don't have one.
"forget about what it's called, tuvok. in the world of captain proton, it's the most powerful weapon that there is. and because it's photonic, it's lethal to these aliens. now, in chapter eighteen, captain proton disables this weapon just before chaotica can use it to destroy earth."
"and you think that proton, namely you of course, could still do that?"
"well, we'd have to knock out the lightning shield first."
a forcefield.
"yeah, now you're catching on. the destructo beam on my rocket ship can disable the death ray, but only if someone gets inside the fortress of doom and can shut down the lightning shield."
and who's supposed to do that?
"arachnia, queen of the spider people."
charming.
"chaotica thinks so. in the story, he's in love with her. he's been trying to form an alliance since chapter three. she's the only one that he trusts, the only one that can get close enough to disable the lightning shield. somebody is going to have to take on her character."
"who'd you have in mind? oh, no!"
it's the role of a lifetime.
"captain, need i remind you that we have exhausted all other possibilities of escaping this layer of subspace."
"until we can eliminate those distortions, we're trapped."
think of it as starfleet's first encounter with planet x.
thanks.
"captain, it won't be so bad. i can explain to you what you can expect. i can tell you"
"all right, all right. i'm a size four."
what's the emergency?
i've been enlisted. i'm supposed to make contact with our photonic friends from the fifth dimension and convince them to call off their attack.
congratulations. why do you need me?
it's an undercover mission. i'll need a bit of cosmetic surgery. these are the parameters for my new costume.
"what are you going as, the emperor of the universe?"
"well, i've been forced to scale back my role in the interest of credibility. i'll be president of earth. i must say, the idea of an entire universe populated by photonic beings is rather appealing."
"well, if your mission fails, you could be taking up permanent residence."
"kim to sickbay. report to holodeck two, doctor."
you're all set. the new parameters will activate as soon as you enter the holodeck.
thank you.
break a leg.
so all i have to do is find the controls of this death ray and deactivate it.
"it's not as simple as it sounds. now, chaotica might be a 1930s villain, but he's very clever. it'd help if you knew some of the rules."
i'm listening.
"all right. well, first of all, he's a megalomaniac, so it's a good idea to appeal to his ego."
right.
"and, er, use grandiose language. he likes to be called sire. and it helps to say things like the clever fiendishness of your evil plan is brilliant."
deck four.
"now remember, it's ray gun, not phaser. imagiser, not viewscreen. earthlings, not terrans."
got it.
"and another thing. these villains always have a trick up their sleeve. trapdoors, secret weapons."
it's the holodeck. i can't be hurt by weapons.
"that doesn't mean you can't be restrained, or thrown into the dungeon of pain."
noted.
"now, as soon as you get the death ray shut down, call me in my rocket ship and give me the signal to fire."
you'll have to use chaotica's broadcast microphone.
this is how you've been spending your free time?
"well, i've been studying how past generations viewed the future."
and?
"well, it didn't work out quite as black and white as they imagined. now, specifications for arachnia's costume. one more thing. if you have trouble with chaotica, or you can't get to the death ray, you can always uncork the pheromones."
i beg your pardon.
"chapter sixteen, spell of the spider. arachnia sends chaotica a vial of her irresistible potion. now, whenever he gets a whiff, he's under her spell."
i get the picture.
"yeah, well, my point is that these pheromones seem to throw chaotica for a loop. well, it works in chapter sixteen, anyway. now, the vial is sitting on a small pedestal next to the throne."
i'll keep an eye out.
okay.
thanks for the briefing.
"i'll see you at the fortress of doom. and remember, you're the queen."
sire. three more of our space ships have been destroyed.
argh! full power to the death ray.
citizens of the fifth dimension. your feeble attacks are nothing but pinpricks to me. surrender now and i will be merciful.
we're receiving a transmission.
they are surrendering.
no. it's queen arachnia. she wishes to cross the drawbridge.
what are you waiting for? show her in.
"i present her royal highness, arachnia!"
"ahh. at last, at last. my queen."
this is an historic occasion. kindred souls meet at last.
"it's an honour to be in your presence, majesty. i've always admired your clever fiendishness."
"ah, your taste is exceeded only by your beauty."
this must be your death ray.
"that, my dear, is the cradle of persuasion. it's fully equipped. brain probe, pain modulator."
impressive. it's good you have the lightning shield to protect your equipment.
"yes. as long as it's electrified, i am invincible. but my greatest achievement is there. behold, the death ray."
"oh, it looks like a formidable weapon."
"the most powerful in the cosmos. there is so much more i want to show you. my throne, for example. the seat of my empire."
ah. i see you've kept my pheromones. i didn't realise you were the sentimental type.
your perfume inspires me.
would you mind?
"oh, please."
somehow i feel comfortable here.
join me and you will have your own chair. one adorned with the most precious jewels and the softest silk.
your majesty seems overly concerned with romantic matters when there's a battle to be won. that is why you asked me here.
"of course, my dear. forgive me. it's just that the air itself seems to vibrate in your presence."
"we can't be slaves to our passion. not when your empire is threatened. i have assembled my fleet of spider ships. however, the lightning shield prevents them from approaching your fortress."
"we'll send them directly into battle, alongside my space force."
my soldiers wish to pay homage to you.
"gratifying. of course, if i lower the shield my fortress will be defenceless. even an ally might choose such a moment to seize my throne."
you don't trust me.
there is a way you could convince me of your loyalty.
oh?
"i'll lower my lightning shield but first, you must become my queen! gather my courtiers! prepare for the ceremony!"
"and don't forget to deactivate the lightning shield, so my subjects may witness the blessed event."
"very well. do as she says, once her guests have arrived."
"yes, sire."
"and so, my dear, the day you have always dreamed of has arrived. the day you become bride of chaotica!"
welcome.
you are photonic.
guilty as charged.
you signalled me across the threshold. how?
i believe you dropped your calling card. i return it to you as a sign of good faith.
identify yourself.
i am the president of earth.
earth?
a planet some distance from here. i've come on a mission of peace.
elaborate.
your people and the people of earth have a common enemy.
chaotica.
the one and only.
"he threatens to invade our realm, destroy our people."
"join the club. chaotica has designs on earth too. but we've withstood countless attacks, all thanks to one man. captain proton."
captain proton?
"defender of the universe, scourge of intergalactic evil, and a competent medic to boot, but don't say i said so. even as we speak, he's preparing to destroy chaotica's death ray, but he needs your help."
explain.
"your weapons pose a threat to proton's rocket ship. you must cease firing while he mounts his attack. once chaotica's death ray is destroyed, you can return to your realm confident that you'll never hear from him again."
captain proton may proceed.
"on behalf of the citizens of earth, i thank you."
space drive.
check.
check.
destructo beam.
check.
check.
"if i could access holodeck controls, the first thing i'd do is delete this guy."
delete this guy.
"as a matter of fact, as soon as this is all over i think i'm going to delete the whole programme."
what about your historical study?
"class dismissed. no more robots, no more mad scientists, no more death rays. i am retiring my rocket pack, harry. someone else can save the universe from now on."
"the final chapter, huh?"
the end.
isn't anyone going to sing hail to the chief?
mister president. how'd it go?
my performance was unimpeachable.
he agreed?
let's just say i'm considering running for office when we get back to earth.
"all right, then. let's get this thing in the air and hope captain janeway is giving a command performance."
queen arachnia.
don't tell me. my wedding ring.
doctor chaotica's wedding ring. you will present it to him at the end of the ceremony.
"your majesty, perhaps we should lower the lightning shield in anticipation of my guests."
why this preoccupation with the shield?
"oh, forgive me. it's just that, as a fellow ruler of the cosmos i often have to do things myself."
"ah. because of the incompetence of your inferiors, no doubt."
something like that.
"oh, arachnia, my love, my life. how well you understand our plight. if it weren't beneath my dignity, i, i would weep. how i've longed for someone who would understand."
we have a saying on arachnia. it's lonely at the top.
"no longer, my dear."
majesty! proton is preparing to attack.
target his rocket ship.
you have betrayed me. you are in league with proton. impetuous harlot!
"tell me how to deactivate the lightning shield, or i'll show you just how impetuous i can be."
"what are you waiting for, you great lummox? kill her!"
"ha! you're no match for arachnia. now, tell me how to shut down the shield."
the confinement rings.
"oh, don't worry, i wouldn't kill my bride. not until after our wedding night. reactivate the death ray! destroy proton!"
we've been hit.
"well, i guess the captain ran into some trouble."
"we're not going down without a fight. doc, activate the destructo beam."
the what?
big button in the middle of that panel.
destructo beam!
the other panel!
the other panel!
destructo beam activated.
we just dropped out of range. we're losing altitude.
report.
the alien weapons fire is increasing. it's causing the distortions to grow larger. we're being pulled deeper into subspace.
invaders! invaders!
"er, incoming."
"proton's ship is damaged, but still airborne."
not for long. fire at will.
lonzak.
man the lightning shield.
arachnia?
"lonzak. quickly, lonzak. no time for dawdling."
your beauty is maddening. entangle me in your web.
"let me out of here and i'll do all that, and more."
"at once, my queen."
back to your station.
idiot!
deactivate the shield. now.
"such passion, such strength. together we could conquer the universe. end this madness, and you may yet live to be my bride."
the shield.
i don't know how to tell you this  but the wedding's off. arachnia to proton. arachnia to proton. do you read me?
arachnia to proton.
i'm reading you.
the lightning shield is down.
"acknowledged. harry, target the death ray. doc, fire the destructo beam on my mark. ready? now!"
the distortions are closing.
we're realigning with normal space.
"helm, full impulse."
bridge to janeway.
go ahead.
and they've closed the distortions. we've cleared the subspace layer.
"secure all systems, and organise damage repair teams."
understood. we're preparing to shut down the holodeck.
"chakotay, give me a minute."
"i was about to say, captain proton to the rescue, but i see you have everything under control."
"i'm the queen, remember?"
"arachnia, death as you know it has no hold on me. my defeat is but a temporary setback. i shall return to seek my revenge."
"he doesn't give up, does he?"
they never do.
"our love was not meant to be, my queen. but be warned. you have not seen the last of  chaotica."
the end of a twisted madman.
and you're going to miss him.
a little.
the kol-ut-shan. a cornerstone of our beliefs.
infinite diversity in infinite combinations. i know all about vulcan philosophies.
why have you come here?
i was sent against my will.
then i suggest you leave.
i'm not a prisoner?
"only of your emotions, or so i have been told."
my emotions free me.
i see. it's regrettable that i won't be able to teach you.
where should i go?
are you seeking my counsel?
i can't return home. my father's banished me.
your school?
they revoked my seat.
why?
"because i refused to deny myself passion, the way you and men like my father do."
you reject logic.
"if i was meant to deny feelings, why was i born with them? where's the logic in that?"
hidden for you to find. or in plain sight for you to ignore.
you speak in riddles because the truth frightens you.
"you're right, it does frighten me. you are surprised to hear a vulcan master admit to having emotions?"
yes.
emotions can be a powerful tool. to deny their existence is illogical. but you must learn to control them.
why?
you wish to be taught?
i would question everything you say.
"you would not be a worthy pupil otherwise. let us begin. sit down, tuvok."
tu be veg!
"er, sorry?"
sen. neeba sen.
"either the universal translator's offline, or i hit my head harder than i thought."
ruk.
"all right. take it easy. all right, all right. take it easy."
fita!
"this? listen, i really need this."
fita ur neeto.
"okay, okay."
first day in town and i've already been mugged.
i'm commander tuvok of the starship voyager. tuvok.
tuwok.
yes. and you?
noss.
noss.
we'll go to my vessel. i see you've already been there.
"mayday, mayday. paris to voyager, respond. oh, come on."
her name is noss. she was attacked by two humanoid males.
sure she didn't attack them?
they were attempting to rob her.
seems to be a local pastime.
she requires medical attention.
"i'd love to help, but somebody stole our med-kits."
food. what's the status of the shuttle?
"fractures throughout the hull, environmental systems down, impulse engines are beyond repair. told you we should have brought the delta flyer."
communications appear to be functional.
"it won't do us any good. every time i transmit a signal, it gets bounced back by the distortion field that pulled us down here. it looks like we fell into some kind of gravity well. as far as i can tell, this planet is a part of an entire solar system that is stuck in a pocket of subspace."
fascinating.
"yeah. well, scientific interest aside, i don't see any easy way out."
no doubt voyager has begun a rescue effort. the doctor?
"his mobile emitter was damaged during the crash. with a little luck, i might be able to repair it and bring him back online."
make it your top priority.
"gren, gren."
what is it?
thirteen humanoids approaching. the same species that attacked her. gather as many supplies as you can carry. we're leaving.
you really think it's smart to abandon the shuttle?
noss appears to have survived here for some time. it's logical to assume she has access to a more secure shelter.
nemok. alen. alen.
whatever you say.
ai kan.
doesn't look like this bird's gonna fly either.
"minimal power and life support, but the ship is protected by a forcefield."
that explains how she's been able to survive here. anything resembling an engine?
i'm detecting engine debris two kilometres away. it is of the same configuration as this vessel.
"great. we've got two unusable ships, and the only way voyager is going to detect our distress call is if they crash land right on top of us."
progress?
"the optronic relays took heavy damage. i'm bypassing the primary circuits. come on, doc. i know you're in there."
i'm guessing we hit a snag.
an accurate assumption.
rev den ut. ut rev?
tun sank. ton rev ut teem sayd.
you speak her language?
a universal translator was written into my programme.
ask her how long she's been here. if she knows a way to get back through that sinkhole.
deen ya tone ud la kar. padeen nefka minruk?
laka heen. zen nik lurka. irut tota. maez bemrukaya.
what'd she say?
"she said she's been here fourteen seasons, and in that time, she's seen many ships come down. but she's never seen one go back up again."
"come back, you little bloodsucker."
"i don't know what's worse, catching them or eating them."
no poison.
"well, hey may not be poisonous but they give me the creeps. maybe i should have left the hunting to you and tuvok."
let me. yah!
looks delicious.
shut down my programme? why?
our resources are severely limited. we may need your mobile emitter as a source of power.
"i'm a doctor, not a battery."
"until we're rescued, or you are needed for an emergency, i must insist that you remain offline."
make way for the mighty hunters.
"if mister paris' hunting ability is any indication, maybe we should take him offline."
"thanks for the vote of confidence, doc."
the hunt was good.
impressive.
"voyager has fifteen decks, a crew of one hundred fifty two, warp and impulse engines."
i want to see.
"someday, perhaps."
tell me about you there.
i am the chief tactical officer.
what else?
can you be more specific?
your duties. where you sleep. what you eat. music. friends.
why is any of that relevant?
because it is you.
"when i first met her, she wouldn't even look at me. but she warmed up after, oh, three years."
the longest flirtation in starfleet history.
no kidding.
she sounds fascinating.
i just hope i see her again.
you must really baiya jouton.
love her very much.
yeah.
more spiders?
"oh, no, thank you. three's my limit."
i will assist you.
"well, i suppose it's time i shut down my programme."
"good night, doc."
she likes you.
she has been alone for many years. she appreciates our company.
no. i mean she likes you.
what are you implying?
"oh, come on, tuvok. you may be cold, but you're not blind."
need i remind you that i am married.
"your wife is fifty thousand light years away, in a different layer of space! the chances of you ever seeing her again are practically nonexistent."
excuse me.
what are you doing?
i'm recalibrating the distress beacon.
"listen. what i said in there, about your wife. i'm sorry, i didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
i have no feelings for you to hurt.
"i think you do. you work hard to bury them, but they're there. and even if they're not, this is home now. you might as well accept it and try to find as much happiness as you can. listen, you have a chance to make a decent life for yourself here."
there is still a possibility that voyager will rescue us. you may see lieutenant torres again.
"if i didn't know you better, i'd say you were trying to cheer me up, tuvok."
is there a point to your pessimism?
"it's not pessimism, it's practicality. you of all people should understand that. look, i've never met your wife but if she's half a logical as you are, i bet you she'd tell you the same thing."
your attempt to play matchmaker is misguided. i am not experiencing pon farr.
"what difference does it make? you obviously care about noss. if you won't admit it to me, at least admit it to yourself."
i respect her ability to survive.
it's more than that. i've seen the way you look at her.
what way is that?
like someone who wishes he wasn't vulcan.
i'm sorry i was born vulcan.
bilak par. self-pity.
are you cataloguing my emotions?
what is the source of your self-pity?
"isn't it obvious? if i weren't vulcan, i wouldn't be here now going through this pointless ritual."
you see only what is in front of you. you must learn to see behind you.
another riddle. i have no eyes to see behind me.
"you have the eyes of memory. the knowledge of why you are here, and why you have lost control. tell me your story."
my father's already explained it.
i wish to hear it from you.
her name's jara. her father's a terrelian diplomat. she's been granted a seat at my school.
and you have developed an emotional attraction toward her.
yes.
you love her.
yes.
does she love you?
"no. she's, jara doesn't return my feelings."
"what if i were to say that i received a letter from your father, telling me that jara is in love with one of your fellow students?"
that's a lie! who is it?
jealousy?
i'll challenge him.
"that would be illogical, because i have received no such letter."
you're trying to trick me.
"no. i'm trying to help you to understand. shon-ha'lock, love, is the most dangerous emotion of all. it produces many other emotions. jealousy, shame, rage, grief. you must learn to suppress them all, otherwise they will consume you. i can sense emotions building inside you like a gathering storm. if we begin now, we may be able to stop them."
i'm not detecting any debris.
maybe the shuttle was tractored or transported somewhere.
scan the region. look for plasma emissions or em displacements. anything that might indicate another ship.
"nothing out of the ordinary. hydrogen, helium, space dust."
there has to be something out there. shuttles don't just vanish into thin air.
it's a gravimetric shear.
source.
unknown.
"red alert. helm, full ahead."
we're caught in some kind of subspace sinkhole. it's pulling us in.
the gravimetric shear is increasing.
go to warp
i can't establish a field.
then we need more power to the impulse engines.
that won't be enough. we've got to find a way to counter the gravitational pull.
"b'elanna, vent three million isodynes of plasma from the nacelles. chakotay, reverse shield polarity."
we're clear.
move us away. stand down red alert. secure all stations. i'd say we have a pretty good idea what happened to that shuttle.
the anomaly is approximately six hundred metres in diameter.
"it's out of phase with normal space. even after recalibrating the sensors, it barely registers."
the distortion circumscribes a subspace zone that includes a type g sun and three planets.
any sign of the shuttle?
no.
i'd say it's time to break out the multispatial probe.
agreed. what the hell was that?
a vessel approaching off the port bow. they've locked on a tractor beam.
captain to the bridge.
"i'm only going to say this one more time. disengage your tractor beam, sir."
you were in danger of being pulled into the distortion. you should show a little gratitude.
"we appreciate your help, but we didn't ask for. captain, this is mister yost."
"supervisor yost, renovation team nova."
"kathryn janeway, of the starship voyager."
"until tomorrow, i suggest you stay at least two million kilometres from the distortion."
what happens tomorrow?
the rift will be closed by then.
some of our crew are trapped inside.
i am sorry. we have lost eleven ships to the distortion over the last year. it must be sealed.
what about your people?
"even if there were survivors, there's no way to rescue them. the best we can do is to prevent others from being trapped."
we can't abandon our crew. if you could delay your mission
"my orders are to seal the rift by this time tomorrow. if you want to attempt a rescue between now and then, the risk is yours to take, but i wouldn't advise it."
launch the probe.
"aye, captain."
work with b'elanna and seven to enhance the sensors. do whatever you can to find tom and tuvok. i'll be looking for a way to counter those gravitational forces.
"come in. i've been brushing up on sinkholes, quantum singularities."
any luck?
all the data leads me to the same conclusion. they're mono-directional phenomena. what goes in doesn't come out.
"well if it's any consolation, something's coming out of that anomaly."
what is it?
telemetry from our probe. we've located the shuttle's distress beacon on a class-d planet.
"vulcan, human, alien lifesigns. at least we know they're alive."
keep reading.
there's astronomical data here covering a three month period. how is that possible?
there seems to be some sort of temporal differential.
how big a differential?
"it's difficult to say, but every hour that passes for us could mean weeks, even months for tom and tuvok."
"months trying to survive in a class-d environment? more than likely, they've assumed that we left them behind long ago."
ready for the bad news?
you're kidding.
"the gravitational stress is increasing. seven believes the sinkhole is on the verge of collapse. when it does, everything inside will be crushed."
noss!
medical tricorder.
we were ambushed.
give me twenty milligrams of inaprovaline.
they got away with a pair of resonator coils that we found.
"three fractured ribs, subdural hematoma, internal bleeding."
will he live?
vulcans are very resilient. he'll be fine. how long has it been since i was last activated?
almost two months.
"two months? so, what's new?"
"oh, same old thing. fighting off scavengers, hunting spiders."
no word from voyager?
they're probably three hundred light years closer to home by now.
i think i should remain online until mister tuvok is fully recovered.
"it's good to have you back, doc."
rest.
how long was i unconscious?
too many hours.
mister paris?
he'll be fine. i was afraid. it is good to see your eyes.
don't.
"i only want to show you how i feel. you, you, you feel nothing for me?"
"i told you, i don't experience emotion. i have developed an appreciation and respect for you. nothing more."
nothing?
i am sorry. i cannot return your affection.
"you cannot, or you will not?"
a minor distinction.
logic! i hate logic!
your emotions will only exacerbate the situation.
shevrot kat!
insulting me will not help.
derot orat!
we can use the multispatial probe as a transporter relay.
"it'll take a little time to reconfigure the targeting scanners but, with a little luck, it should work."
any reason we can't use the same relay to send a comm. signal?
i don't see why not.
good. let them know that help is on the way.
captain to the bridge.
they've started ahead of schedule.
hail them.
yes?
it was my understanding you wouldn't begin for another six hours.
we're ready now.
well we're not. we need at least another two hours to make a rescue attempt.
i'm sorry.
how long until they seal the rift?
approximately thirty minutes.
then that's all we've got.
tuvok? hey!
"i am meditating, mister paris."
i don't care.
i trust there is an urgent reason for your lack of courtesy.
you're damn right there is. what did you say to her?
our conversation was private.
"well, whatever you said, she's talking about leaving. going off by herself because it's too painful to be around you."
she is under the influence of unfettered emotions.
"well, maybe you're able to fetter your emotions, but the rest of us don't have that luxury. she is a living, breathing woman who for reasons that i can't begin to fathom, has fallen in love with you. now, if you're incapable of returning her feelings, at least show her some compassion. try to let her down easy."
there is no easy way to recover from infatuation.
"oh, really? and what do you know about infatuation?"
more than you might imagine.
enlighten me.
i have no intention of continuing this conversation any further.
"come on, tuvok. come on. it's just you, me and the rocks."
"when i was a young man, i experienced an emotional attraction toward a woman. it nearly destroyed me."
your wife?
"no. her name was jara, a terrelian female. i would have violated every tenet of vulcan philosophy simply to be near her."
she must have really been something.
i lost all sense of who i was. the emotional attraction i felt for her became a kind of insanity.
"tuvok, everyone feels a little insane when they fall in love, but it's worth the risk."
"for you, perhaps. but i am vulcan. my natural emotions are erratic, volatile. if i don't control them, they will control me."
whatever happened to jara?
"i chose to leave her. i spent several months in isolation, studying with a vulcan master. i learned to suppress my emotions."
too bad.
gravimetric distortions.
what's causing them?
unknown.
"no response to our hails, captain."
"at this rate, their anti-graviton beam will seal the distortion in approximately twenty nine minutes."
transporter status?
"i've completed the reconfiguration, but we're only going to be able to relay one transporter beam through the probe."
we'll have to get tom and tuvok within a two metre radius of the distress beacon.
harry?
i've opened a channel.
voyager to away team.
what is it?
the distress beacon. we're receiving a transmission.
"can you route it through your comm. system? if i'm right, this message was sent almost nine hours ago on a very slow carrier wave."
can you speed it up?
i'll try.
voyager to away team. a transporter beam with a radius of two metres will activate at the coordinates of your distress beacon in exactly thirty minutes.
thirty minutes? that would have been over eight hours ago!
"shh, there's more."
"be advised we've detected a temporal difference between our two positions. according to our calculations, the differential ratio is point four seven four four seconds per minute. repeat. voyager to away team. a transporter beam with a radius of two metres"
"according to that formula, thirty minutes would translate to two days, eleven hours and forty seven seconds."
"well, we've waited this long."
tom.
the forcefield is holding.
not for long if they keep pelting us with these photon grenades.
how are we supposed to hold them off for two more days?
the rift will be sealed in less than two minutes.
move us into range. stand by for transport.
"yes, ma'am."
the forcefield's losing power. time?
we still have another hour before transport.
where are you going?
to repair the field generator.
i will accompany you.
no. you stay. prepare for the attack.
you can't go alone.
risking two lives would be illogical.
we're in transporter range.
link up with the probe and relay the signal.
stand by. i've got a lock on their beacon.
they're supposed to be ready for transport in thirty two seconds. let's hope they don't stand us up. begin twenty second countdown on my mark. now.
we've got less than ten minutes to transport.
where the hell is noss?
i'll find her.
fifteen seconds. fourteen. thirteen.
tuvok.
i could not leave you behind.
nine. eight. seven.
"now, mister paris!"
hurry.
four. three. two.
initialise transport sequence. energise.
we've got them. welcome back. who?
a friend.
tuvok. weird day.
problems?
"i've spent the last two months wondering if i'd ever see b'elanna again. as far as she's concerned, it's only been two days. i guess i expected her to have missed me, too."
"were it not for the time differential, i'm sure she would have experienced a deep sense of loss."
"you know something? i always thought that beneath that cold, vulcan exterior lay a even colder vulcan interior. now, i'm convinced you're a hopeless romantic."
"there is no need to insult me, mister paris."
"oh, here they are now. i was just getting noss' recipe for sautéed spiders. she told me how much you enjoyed them."
let's just say it's an acquired taste.
"goodbye, tom.  thank you."
"come on, neelix."
"oh, of course."
crewman.
i'm sorry.
for what?
i know how difficult this was for you. for us. i just wish things had been different.
as do i.
i understand. thank you.
"live long and prosper, noss."
you too.
infinite diversity
in infinite combinations.
your training is now complete. you have done well.
thank you.
"you are now prepared to return to the world. grief, anger, fear, and especially love, will never threaten you again."
i am grateful.
"ah! surprised? what's wrong? can't figure out why i'm still not running,ha? can't read my thoughts? go ahead, attack, take my ship. damn ship. hold together. hold!"
wormhole?
approximately four hundred million kilometres from our position.
take a look at the transkinetic vector.
it leads to sector zero zero one.
it looks like a wormhole but we're detecting massive bioplasmic activity.
that suggests a lifeform. neutrino flux?
erratic.
"a direct route to earth's doorstep, out of the blue. what's wrong with this picture?"
we should launch a probe.
go to yellow alert. prepare a class five probe. let's see what's really out there.
"if you go looking for deuterium tomorrow, can i come?"
"well, that's up to the captain."
it's likely you'll be replaced by a more experienced officer.
but this is my first away mission and i didn't get to do anything.
i disagree. you familiarised yourself with this vessel.
"well, can't we make first contact with somebody, or get in a space battle?"
"yeah, can't we?"
"another time, perhaps."
"hey, naomi, you want to take the helm?"
can i?
ensign.
"she'll be familiarising herself with the vessel. here. okay, first bring us up to one quarter impulse. hit this control, then that one."
"one quarter impulse, aye."
"now, you think you can chart a course back to voyager?"
"yes, sir."
they're in a hurry.
crewmen boylen and white. frequently late for their duty shifts.
"speaking of late, i'll make a deal with you. i'll explain to sam why her daughter's two hours late for bedtime, if you start on the survey report."
acceptable.
have fun.
you're back. i was beginning to worry.
the survey took longer than expected.
lucky our deuterium shortage is no longer an issue.
a wormhole.
the wormhole. it leads all the way back to earth.
the odds of finding such a phenomenon are infinitesimal.
never bet against the house.
what are you doing?
looking for anomalous readings.
you will find none.
"he's right. no subspatial contortions, no temporal variance."
the probe we sent in has already picked up faint signals from the other side.
"b'elanna's still downloading them, but she's pretty sure they're from starfleet."
this wormhole is only three hundred million kilometres away. long range scans should have detected it days ago.
perhaps it was an oversight on your part.
"if it'll make you feel better, run a diagnostic. in the meantime, let's maintain course."
come in.
i completed my diagnostic. sensors are operating at peak efficiency.
then there's nothing to worry about.
on the contrary. the wormhole's neutrino levels are extremely erratic.
"i thought so too, until i received this. it turns out those faint signals we detected were communiqu�s from starfleet. they assure me the neutrino flux is nothing to worry about."
starfleet may be in error. we should run further scans.
no time. the wormhole might destabilise.
"the doctor often instructs me to look before i leap. it is an antiquated adage, but i believe it is relevant."
i have another one for you. he who hesitates is lost.
captain.
"i thin we're avoiding the real issue here, seven. you're still feeling uncomfortable about returning to the alpha quadrant. it's nothing to be ashamed of. trust me, you're going to thrive on earth, just as you've thrived on voyager. yes?"
letter number two. i'm getting jealous.
"mark. apparently his engagement was broken off. what about you, any news?"
a full pardon and reinstatement to starfleet. i've even been offered a professorship in anthropology at the academy.
"oh, chakotay, congratulations, but it's not fair."
"don't worry, it's only part time."
how can i be expected to manage the ship without you?
you'll do fine.
"computer, access all logs entries recorded by captain janeway on stardate 52542."
access to those files is restricted.
access granted.
play first log entry.
"captain's log, stardate 52542.3. long range sensors have identified a wormhole leading to the alpha quadrant. unfortunately, secondary scans have revealed that it's some kind of elaborate deception. the question is, who's attempting to deceive us and why?"
play next log entry.
"captain's log, supplemental. we've begun to receive faint telemetry from our probe. i don't want to get the crew's hopes up but b'elanna thinks it may be a message from starfleet. i'm beginning to wonder if my earlier scepticism was justified."
play next log entry.
"captain's log, supplemental. i've set a course for the wormhole. with any luck, we should be back in the alpha quadrant in a matter of days."
annika? annika hansen.
there is no one here by that name.
"are you sure, because i have a letter here addressed to her. i never realised you knew anyone from the alpha quadrant."
i don't.
"well, it looks like someone knows you. who's it from?"
claudia hansen. she claims to be a sister of my father.
your aunt.
she is looking forward to meeting me.
that's great. starfleet's appointed me ambassador to the lan'tuana sector.
ambassador?
i guess they thought i'd have a flair for quadrupeds.
"ensign, i require a moment of your time."
sure.
have you noticed anything unusual about the crew's behaviour since we returned?
like?
"when i presented the captain with evidence that the wormhole may not be what it appears to be, she seemed unconcerned."
really? that doesn't sound like her.
i believe the crew is being deceived by false telemetry as well as overly-optimistic correspondence.
"the letters from home? i got one, too."
no doubt containing good news.
"oh, i'll say. an old buddy of mine offered me a spot at the new test flight centre in australia. beautiful beaches, a chance to pilot the latest experimental ships. i can't believe it."
then you doubt the veracity of the letters as well.
are you kidding? i've already written back and accepted the job.
"computer, activate the emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
the wormhole is not what it appears to be. i believe that the crew is being
hold on. wormhole?
you weren't informed.
not a peep.
"considering everyone's recent behaviour, that's not surprising. since the discovery of this wormhole the crew has ignored obvious signs that it's a deception. you must determine if there is a physiological explanation."
on my way.
i'll call in a few crewmen for routine examinations. that should allow me to run the necessary diagnostics.
we've just entered visual range. i thought you'd like to take a look. we're starting to get images from the other side.
there is considerable interference.
i think i can help clear it up. try it now.
how long until we reach the wormhole?
fifty three minutes.
maintain course.
"all hands, this is the bridge. secure all systems."
"when we reach earth's orbit, lay in a descent trajectory. north american continent. starfleet headquarters."
"computer, perform a gravimetric scan of the wormhole's interior. look for inconsistencies in the spatial gradient."
the anomaly is consistent with a class one wormhole. no irregularities detected.
recalibrate sensors and try again.
no irregularities detected.
"isolate grid nine two five and magnify. computer, is that a vessel in grid ninety one?"
no vessel has been detected.
open a comm. channel.
channel open.
"alien vessel, this is the starship voyager. respond. alien vessel."
who are you?
"seven of nine, federation starship voyager. our ship is on an intercept course three point four light years from your position."
"turn around, you're being deceived."
how.
he knows what you want.
"computer, identify the cause of the power failure."
"captain's orders. power from astrometrics has been rerouted to the navigational array, at least until we've completed our journey through the wormhole."
i've made contact with a vessel inside the anomaly.
starfleet?
alien. the pilot attempted to warn us away.
sensors show no record of an incoming transmission.
the sensors are malfunctioning. he said we were being deceived. the wormhole is not what it appears to be.
the preponderance of data suggests otherwise.
the data is flawed.
as is your reasoning.
may i ask you a personal question? are you looking forward to seeing your wife and family?
indeed.
and is that desire stronger than you expected it to be?
your point.
"i believe you are being manipulated. someone or something is compromising your logic, otherwise you would be willing to listen to my concerns."
access to the astrometrics lab is restricted until further notice. dismissed.
naomi wildman. your presence here is unauthorised. state your intentions.
i'm hiding.
from whom?
everyone. they're all acting strange. even mom.
elaborate.
"she keeps smiling all the time, talking about earth like it's the greatest place in the universe."
you do not share your mother's desire to return to earth?
"voyager's my home. if we go to earth, i'll have to leave the ship. i'd miss my room, neelix. you and i wouldn't be able to play kadis-kot anymore."
curious. you and i appear to be the only ones not affected.
affected by what?
i am not certain. stay here until i return.
"computer, activate emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
where's the doctor?
offline.
why?
starfleet orders. something about the wormhole interfering with the holographic systems. they didn't want to damage his programme.
he must be reactivated.
no can do. not until we're on the other side.
it's urgent.
"believe it or not, i am capable of handling almost any medical problem you might have."
i was just coming to see you.
why?
"i'm afraid i have some troubling news. evidently, our wormhole passes through a layer of subspace monitored by the borg. starfleet's concerned that your neural transceiver might attract some unwanted attention. we need to deactivate your implants."
you should not attempt to do so without the doctor's supervision.
"unfortunately, he's offline."
then the procedure is inadvisable.
try to relax. we're only going to keep you in stasis until we've reached the alpha quadrant. i realize the prospect of returning to earth is frightening to you. it's perfectly natural for you to resist the unknown. but you're in good hands. resistance is futile.
"what's our distance, tom?"
"two thousand kilometres and closing. goodbye, delta quadrant."
"no more hirogen hunting parties, malon garbage scows."
"by this time tomorrow it'll be cardassians, romulans, ferengi."
chakotay to the bridge.
go ahead.
i've spoken to seven of nine. we're putting her into stasis.
make it fast. we don't want the borg to crash our welcome home party.
i need to adjust my regeneration parameters. how long will i remain inactive?
a couple of hours to be on the safe side.
security alert!
naomi wildman.
"security's on their way, chakotay. what happened?"
seven's trapped us behind some kind of borg forcefield.
try to disable it.
"naomi, go back to your quarters."
pay attention to me. if this indicator begins to flash enter the following series of commands. watch carefully.
naomi.
do you understand?
yes.
"naomi, i'm giving you a direct order. step away from the console."
she's blocking my commands.
keep trying.
"computer, lock onto my coordinates and initiate a site to site transport. main engineering."
seven?
i'm sorry.
we've got phaser fire in engineering.
janeway to security.
"computer, erect a level ten forcefield around engineering. lock out the command controls of borg encryption code two nine four."
seven's tapping into the engine manifold. she's trying to shut down impulse drive.
"bridge, she has erected another forcefield. it'll require"
several minutes to deactivate it.
"where is she, exactly?"
engineering console sixteen beta. captain?
i'm sending an em surge to that station. seven's going into stasis whether she likes it or not.
"she's down, captain."
"captain, we're at the threshold."
take us in.
report?
it's just spatial turbulence.
it's beautiful. steady as she goes.
"seven, wake up. seven of nine, wake up! forcefield?"
you are damaged.
it's just a scrape.
the crew?
"unconscious, sort of."
our hull is demolecularising.
do wormholes do that?
"no, they don't. return to your quarters while i assess the situation."
but i can help. my mom says two heads are better than one. isn't that the borg philosophy too?
"simplistic, but accurate."
"please, i don't want to be alone."
"neelix! oh, neelix."
he will survive.
neelix.
we must keep moving. naomi wildman. we will return for him.
i don't think that's earth.
no.
so where are we?
"i've restored partial systems. i'm reading organic compounds, bioplasmic discharges, a vast network of neural pathways."
is it a lifeform?
"if it is, it's the largest i've seen. over two thousand kilometres in diameter."
what are you doing?
my earlier scans revealed a vessel. i'm trying to find it again.
somebody else is stuck here?
"possibly. there. it's heavily damaged but still functioning. alien vessel, respond."
this is the starship voyager. please respond.
i told you to stay away. why didn't you listen?
our crew believed they were returning to their homes.
"everything they've always wanted, correct?"
yes.
he deceived them.
he?
i believe we should work together to escape this anomaly. lower your shields and i'll beam you aboard.
shields are the only things holding my ship together. i'd be destroyed.
i will enhance your shield emitters.
you won't fool me that easily.
i assure you we are not a deception.
"oh, how convenient, an enormous starship comes to my rescue. you might try a more subtle approach."
"my scans indicate that your shields will fail in approximately fifteen minutes. join us, or you can remain on your vessel secure in the knowledge that you were not deceived. but that knowledge will do you little good when you are dead. decide now."
"all right. all right, i'm taking my shields down."
ow!
"you look real enough. but over the years, he's made me believe many things are real. a fortune at my fingertips, good friends risen from the dead."
you're referring to the anomaly we've entered.
"anomaly? it's a beast! cunning, deadly."
what does it want?
"you. your ship. antimatter, biomatter. he consumes it."
everyone believed it was a wormhole.
"telepathy. psychogenic manipulation. he senses your thoughts, your desires, and then he preys on them."
like a pitcher plant.
pitcher plant?
the doctor taught me about it in botany class. it catches insects by mimicking pheromones.
"yes, you're right, but this one doesn't eat insects. he eats starships."
you are familiar with this lifeform.
familiar? i�ve been hunting it for nearly forty years.
and have you become impervious to its telepathy?
"almost, but there are days when he can still trick me. like yesterday. i thought i had found a way to kill him once and for all. i'd allow him to begin consuming my ship and then i'd fly directly to his most vulnerable system, his primary neural plexus. boom! i'd destroy him from the inside out. but he knew. he showed me what i wanted to see. i was nowhere near his neural plexus. i was flying directly into his digestion chamber. and speaking of digestion."
how do we get out of the monster?
"it's not a monster, it's a bioplasmic organism, and we will find a way out."
"no, the girl's right. he's a monster, and the only way out is to destroy him."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
your ship is being devoured. i'd say that's an emergency.
"the monster ate his ship, too."
monster?
i want to see your weapons manifest.
"weapons? this is a sickbay, not an arsenal. what's going on?"
voyager has been lured into the digestive chamber of a bioplasmic organism. we require your assistance in charting an escape route.
slow down. the last thing i remember i was speaking to mister paris. he said the wormhole posed a threat to my programme.
"the beast has been manipulating your crew. the moment he realised you were beginning to suspect something, he made sure you were deactivated."
"and who might you be, the local monster expert?"
"as a matter of fact i am. he's been fooling you for days, creating false sensor readings, and he's been altering your crew's thought patterns. a little neurogenic telepathy to make them lower their guard."
that might explain the heightened dopamine levels i found during my routine examinations of the crew. have you informed the captain?
she's asleep.
asleep?
it's our proximity to the creature. the neurogenic field is stronger here. it's already rendered most of the crew unconscious. does your vessel's database contain information on the creature's anatomy?
of course.
retrieve it.
"in the meantime, let's work on a wake-up call for the crew."
"computer, increase neurotransmitter levels by twenty nine percent."
a cortical inhibitor?
i thought it might disrupt the organism's hold on her.
it won't. i already tried a similar procedure.
i don't remember asking for a second opinion. it's working. she's regaining consciousness.
doctor?
you're being exposed to a powerful neurogenic field. you've been unconscious for several hours.
they're here.
who?
"the maquis, they're alive!"
"b'elanna, you're still on voyager. you're hallucinating."
starfleet thinks you've all been killed.
"computer, increase neurotransmitter levels by another ten percent. b'elanna, focus on my voice."
she doesn't want to.
they never want to.
"it's the silence i hate. the way he takes you without a fight. it was the same way with the nokaro. a crew of nearly three thousand. families mostly, mine included, looking for a new world to settle. but they came across our friend here and he showed them what they wanted to see. a glistening green paradise. by the time i responded to their distress call, all that was left of them was some fading engine emissions. that was thirty nine years ago. thirty nine years, two weeks, four days."
do you mind? the situation is dismal enough.
i�m just trying to explain who we're up against.
"well, i�m getting a pretty good idea on my own. judging by these bioscans, the organism's been devouring life forms for a bit longer than thirty nine years. i'd estimate it's at least two hundred thousand years old."
the intelligent always survive.
i wouldn't go that far. it appears to operate on highly evolved instinct. i haven't detected any signs of sentience.
"oh he's intelligent, all right. smart enough to fool your crew into taking you offline."
no need to get personal.
seven?
i�m here.
are we still inside the monster?
"yes, but we are going to find a way out."
there. this is it. exactly what we need.
"these class nine torpedoes in your weapons manifest. if we can bring your vessel deeper into the creature's digestive tract and detonate one of these charges, we might be able to destroy it."
starfleet's not in the habit of killing lifeforms.
even if that lifeform is about to kill you?
if i could take a few hours to examine the creature more thoroughly
there is no time.
we kill him!
maybe there's another way.
explain.
"any living organism, no matter how large, will attempt to expel a foreign body. if we could just make voyager a little less tasty?"
"my scans indicate that your weapons are tetryon based. if you were to fire one at a pocket of antimatter released from our warp core, it would produce an electrolytic reaction."
would that make voyager taste bad?
it might at that.
"once i�ve beamed you back to your ship, try adjusting your shields to this frequency. you'll find them more resistant to the bioplasmic discharges."
"you seem to know a little about everything. medicine, exobiology, shield harmonics."
i�m something of a renaissance emh.
i could use a crewmate like you. the beast would have a difficult time manipulating a hologram's desires.
"an ishmael to your ahab? no, thank you."
you're turning down the hunt of a lifetime?
"as appealing as that sounds, i�m a doctor, not a dragon slayer. my programme requires that i do no harm."
shame.
qatai's vessel is ready.
"i�ve rerouted bridge controls to engineering. ops, tactical, helm, all integrated into one station."
efficient.
i thought you'd like it.
i�m plotting a course for the organism's oesophageal aperture. prepare to release the antimatter. hull integrity's dropped another thirteen percent. doctor?
ready on my end.
voyager to qatai. prepare to fire.
"wait, wait. no, no, no, no, no."
what's wrong?
that last jolt
must have destabilised my targeting sensor.
i could establish an interface to voyager's targeting array.
don't bother. i know my ship. it's just being stubborn.
ready.
initiate the burst on my mark. now.
like the taste of that?
i�m reading violent contractions throughout the digestive chamber. it's working. we're moving back through the oesophageal aperture!
voyager has been expelled. we're three point nine kilometres from the organism.
after just one burst? for a big fellow he certainly has a low tolerance for tummy ache.
qatai's vessel was also released.
hail him.
why haven't you ejected a second burst?
we've cleared the organism.
you've been deceived. we're both still inside it.
he's right. i'm reading bioplasmic energy.
i am impervious to the creature's influence.
"you were impervious, when it was creating the illusion of voyager getting home, because you didn't share that desire. but now we're trying to escape, which is what you want."
think about it. he's showing you exactly what you want to see.
seven!
initiate another antimatter burst. now. fire.
we're out.
are we certain?
no sign of bioplasmic energy. we've escaped.
i�m taking us out of range. maximum warp.
i'd better see to the crew.
"well, i'll be on my way. thanks for your help."
your engines have taken heavy damage. you require our assistance.
no time. the beast is already altering course. i�ll handle repairs myself.
the procedure would take several days.
don't worry about me. just get your ship home. and watch out for pitcher plants.
location?
we're still in the delta quadrant.
scan the wormhole. find out what went wrong.
it's gone. i can't find it on sensors.
"captain, bridge controls have been routed to engineering. ops, tactical, helm, all of it."
bridge to engineering.
"yes, captain."
seven? what's going on?
"the doctor will explain. i will file a complete report in the morning, after i have regenerated."
naomi wildman.
don't worry. my presence here is authorised.
by whom?
mom. she thinks i need to learn more about earth.
i see. and does studying this image increase your desire to go there?
not really.
i concur. it is unremarkable.
"but my mom likes it, and even neelix can't wait to get there, so i guess it can't be that bad."
"given this crew's determination to return home, i have no doubt we will see it for ourselves someday."
a vessel has been detected. unimatrix four two four grid one one six. activate. alter course to intercept.
"vessel identified. federation starfleet, intrepid class, one hundred forty three lifeforms. prepare for assimilation. we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile."
break off your pursuit or we'll open fire.
irrelevant.
is it? you've scanned our vessel. you know we can match your firepower.
you will be assimilated.
regenerate primary shield matrix. remodulate weapons.
security breach. starfleet photon torpedo. disarm weapon.
i thought we were trying to disable it.
the torpedo detonated near the power matrix. it caused a chain reaction.
survivors?.
none.
debris status.
"there's a few components intact, but they're badly damaged."
begin a salvage operation.
captain?
"there might be something we can use. weapons, a transwarp coil. i don't know about the rest of you, but i feel lucky today."
"now, this is how i prefer the borg. in pieces."
"eight kilotons of debris, most of it hull fragments. so far we've recovered two power nodes and a dozen plasma conduits, all in working order."
"their propulsion system, anything left?"
b'elanna found a transwarp coil.
it's lighter than i expected. it must be some kind of polytrinic alloy. let's hope our little skirmish got back to the hive mind. maybe they'll think twice before they attack us again.
"it was only a probe. next time, we might not be so lucky."
"captain, don't touch that."
what is it?
"i don't know, but a few minutes ago it was crawling around the floor. i think it's some kind of auto-regeneration unit."
"thanks for the warning. by my count, we've added at least two years to our journey by avoiding the borg. i'm tired of turning tail every time we detect a cube."
"better safe than assimilated,"
mmm.
maybe i should go to red alert and get it over with.
commander?
you're about to drop one of your bombshells.
now what makes you say that?
the way you fiddle with your com. badge. you do it every time.
"well, i'll have to keep an eye on that."
"eureka! i was hoping to find one of these. it's a servo-armature from a medical repair drone. laser scalpel, biomolecular scanner, micro-suture, all rolled into one instrument."
no federation sickbay should be without one.
this could revolutionise the way that i perform surgery.
excellent. why don't you deactivate it for now?
remodulate the coil frequency.
no effect.
try again.
the field regulator is fused.
what seems to be the problem?
we can't activate the transwarp coil.
"when a borg vessel is critically damaged, all of its vital technology self-destructs. the coil is beyond repair."
at least the doctor found a new toy.
"captain. datanodes. one of them is a drone manifest, the other contains tactical information."
specifically?
"long range sensor telemetry, assimilation logistics and vessel movements for a radius of thirty light years."
"well, let's take a look."
i'll need to convert the information to starfleet parameters.
time?
two hours.
do it.
"after nine hours staring at that debris, i was beginning to feel like a drone."
i could use a shower.
"do borg shower? neelix, we need a couple of beers."
name your malt.
"ktarian. replicate a pint for yourself, because we're going to toast the man of the hour."
oh?
it was harry's idea to beam over a photon torpedo while they were remodulating their shields.
i didn't think they'd fall for it.
"ah, but they did. hook, line and sinker. oh, i would have loved to have seen the look on their faces. boom!"
"to be honest, i wish the boom had been a bit smaller. we were only trying to disable them."
"they were drones, harry. mindless automatons. we did them a favour."
seven.
"look, i didn't mean anything by that."
your apology is irrelevant. it is impossible to offend a mindless drone.
cheers.
i was able to recover sixty two percent of the data. this is an isogrid of borg tactical movements across twenty five sectors.
are there any dangers along our present course?
"there are three cubes approximately nine light years away, travelling on a trajectory parallel to our own. they do not pose a threat."
what about that vessel?
"it's a scout ship, eight light years away, travelling at warp two. the ship is heavily damaged."
was it attacked?
no. an ion storm. the sphere is presently regenerating. that explains why it is travelling at low warp.
limping home.
in a manner of speaking.
"i want a detailed schematic of this vessel, down to the power distribution nodes. i think we've just struck gold."
"so what we have here in two simple words is, fort knox."
captain?
"tom, translate?"
fort knox. the largest repository of gold bullion in earth's history. over fifty metric tons worth over nine trillion u.s. dollars.
keep going.
"well, er, when the new world economy took shape in the late twenty second century and money went the way of the dinosaur, fort knox was turned into a museum."
"and no one ever managed to break into that facility, right?"
"well, a couple of ferengi tried about ten years ago, but other than that, it's considered impenetrable."
are you planning a heist?
as a matter of fact. except we're not chasing gold. we're going to steal a transwarp coil. think it might come in handy?
"if i could equip our engines with even one coil, we could shave about twenty years off this trip."
do you believe the borg sphere is damaged enough for us to penetrate its defences?
"long enough to take what we want and get out in one piece. but we'd have to plan this operation down to the millisecond. there would be no margin for error. as i see it, we plan an intercept course that won't attract their attention, then create a diversion to keep them occupied so we can send in an away team to obtain the technology."
"i'd like to see the data on that sphere. we might be able to recreate parts of it on the holodeck, run a few tactical simulations."
it's all yours.
"we need to mask our warp signature. i've got a few maquis tricks up my sleeve. they're not exactly starfleet approved, but."
"this is no time for protocol. get started. the sphere is three days away by maximum warp. set a course. chakotay, i want an outline for our heist by tomorrow morning. we've proven ourselves against the borg once before, twice before, but we're always the ones under attack. i think it's time to do a little assimilating of our own, hmm? dismissed."
i was hoping you'd be a little more vocal. any thoughts?
your plan is ambitious. there are many variables. but it can succeed.
"i'd like to narrow that list of variables. i was hoping your parents might provide us with a few insights. i've been looking over the records we found on the u.s.s. raven. your parents kept extensive field notes, detailed journals. there are over nine thousand log entries alone."
the information is irrelevant.
"on the contrary, seven. they spent their careers studying the borg. they tracked a cube at close range for what, two years?"
three.
"well, i'd say that made them experts. i want you to study their research. look for any data that might give us a tactical edge."
my parents were assimilated. obviously their tactics were flawed.
"look, these records have been collecting dust in our database for over a year. you say they're irrelevant, and i say you've been avoiding them. you're the best person for the job, but i'll assign it to chakotay if i"
no. the information belongs to me. i will read it.
you're late.
"sorry. it took longer than i expected to download these records. this is only the first batch. your parents sure had a lot to say. i organised the information by category. field notes, personal logs, biokinetic analyses. i don't mean to pry, but is it true your parents were studying the borg?"
yes. the hansens were exobiologists.
fascinating. they must have been very courageous.
they were misguided.
"a faded holo-image. that's all i've got left of my family. a picture of my sister. except, of course, what i keep in here.  what i wouldn't give for a treasure trove like this. well, i'd better get started on the rest of those files."
"field notes, u.s.s. raven, stardate 32611.4. it's about time. the federation council on exobiology has given us final approval. starfleet's still concerned about security issues but they've agreed not to stand in our way. we've said our goodbyes, and we're ready to start chasing our theories about the borg."
"zoom, zoom."
"ah, ah, ah, put down the cube, muffin. it's not a toy."
i won't crash it.
"come here, daddy wants to talk to you. now, remember when i said that you, me and mommy were going on a very long voyage?"
ah ha.
"well, we're leaving tomorrow and we won't see earth for quite a while."
are we going to see the borg?
if we're lucky.
"do the borg have kids, too?"
nobody knows. we'll be the first humans to study them up close.
what do they look like?
"we're not sure exactly, but we think they might look a lot like us, but with technology inside their bodies."
cy-ber-netic?
mmm hmm.
are they friendly?
"well, they're different. they don't talk like us, or even think like us, but we're hoping to make friends one day."
"i hope so, too, daddy."
"field notes, u.s.s. raven, stardate 32623.5: we've been tracking stray readings for nearly eight months now, but there's still no sign of a vessel. i'm beginning to wonder if the borg are nothing more than rumour and sensor echoes."
magnus.
"we have to keep moving. if we take the replicators offline and run environmental systems at half power, we can go another twenty light years before refuelling."
we should refuel now. the nearest dilithium is in an asteroid field just ten days from here.
"that's ten days we can't afford to lose. we're getting close. if we stop now, we might as well just turn around and go home."
"home, to what? we have deviated from our flight plan, crossed the neutral zone, disobeyed a direct order to return. our colleagues obviously think we are insane. we have burned our bridges, magnus."
i can't sleep.
come here. why can't annika sleep? the greatest scientific mystery of our time.
i have a hypothesis. her noisy parents are keeping her up.
hmm. sounds plausible.
"tri-quantum waves, six hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow."
"subspace disruptions, field magnitude two point nine teracochranes and rising. annika, bed."
power utilisation curve is highly symmetric.
artificial source probability point nine eight.  now. it's got to be a transwarp conduit. nothing else could generate these readings. i'm taking us closer.
"it's a borg cube, two thousand kilometres starboard."
i've got a visual.
"it's massive. twenty eight cubic kilometres, hundred and twenty nine thousand lifeforms on board. we're being scanned. they haven't altered course."
"this could prove our theory. they ignore any lifeform until they consider it a threat, or a target. they're moving off."
let's match their course and speed. keep a distance of five million kilometres.
seven of nine to the bridge.
on my way.
have we been detected?
"no, ma'am."
i have a visual.
on screen. magnify.
looks like they took a real beating.
they could still pose a threat. let's not get too close. match their course and speed. keep a distance of ten million kilometres.
"aye, captain."
"seven, scan the vessel. i want to know their current status."
"their weapons array is regenerating, but shields and transwarp drive are still offline."
how long until they have transwarp?
approximately seventy two hours.
"we may not get this opportunity again, and i don't intend to miss it. whatever it takes, double shifts, round the clock simulations, i want to be ready."
bridge to away teams. you're six seconds behind schedule.
we are at the shield matrix. stand by.
the primary shield generator. i've got it.
"spatial charges. here, there and there."
you've got fifty five seconds.
tuvok to janeway. charges set. we're returning to the transport coordinates.
the transwarp coil is offline.
"tuvok, now."
activate the charges.
"bridge, their shields are down. energise."
tom?
i've got a lock.
target obtained.
you're out of time.
they've adapted. this way.  seven!
"bridge, stand by for transport."
hurry!
energise.
i've got them. transporter room one.
beam them out of here.
i can't get a lock. they've adapted to our transport frequencies.
"computer, freeze programme, both holodecks. what happened?"
they tapped into our transporter beam.
chakotay to holodeck two. we got the transwarp coil
but we also picked up some uninvited guests.
what was our time?
two minutes twelve seconds.
twelve seconds too late. once we disable their sensor grid we only have two minutes until it regenerates.
did you run into any problems?
none.
we were efficient.
what if we beam directly into the transwarp chamber?
there's too much shielding.
perhaps we could modify our transporters?
i've already explored that option. it won't work.
twelve seconds. might as well be an eternity.
the hansens. they were able to remain inside a borg cube for several hours without being detected.
how?
i'm not certain.
"well, keep investigating."
"yes, captain."
"we've run enough simulations for one day. let's work on refining our tactics, anything we can do to shave a few more seconds off our little heist. computer, end programme."
i don't know about you but i'm glad to be back on voyager. borg vessels make my skin crawl.
it was a holodeck recreation.
close enough. we just spent the last three hours dodging drones. it didn't bother you?
your point.
you seemed a little nervous in there.
"the last time i was on a borg vessel, i was a drone. the recreation was unsettling."
you were reluctant to look at your parents' research and now i sense you're a little reluctant to go on this mission. maybe i'm pushing you too fast.
i'll adapt.
it's easier said than done. it's been over two years since you came face to face with the collective. are you sure you're up to it? i need everybody working at peak efficiency.
you doubt my ability to function.
"no, i'm simply voicing my concerns."
they are unjustified.
"i hope so, because the next time we won't be on the holodeck."
understood.
naomi wildman.
i had a bad dream. can i stay with you for a while?
where is your mother?
"she's working in engineering, and neelix is on a duty shift. please? i won't bother you."
very well.
it looked just like this.
what did?
in my dream. there was borg stuff everywhere.
elaborate.
"i went on the mission. the one my mom told me about, the borg sphere? but it didn't work. everybody got assimilated."
nightmares are caused by irrational fear. they're not real. they can't damage you. try to ignore it.
mom said we're going to steal something.
a transwarp coil.
will you be on the sphere?
yes.
are you scared?
we will succeed.
but what if you don't? what if they make you a drone again?
"naomi wildman, you agreed not to bother me."
what's it like to be a drone? does it hurt?
you will terminate this line of questioning.
do the borg have kids? what do they look like? are they friendly?
return to your quarters immediately.
resistance is futile.
seven of nine to security. intruder alert.
they can't hear you.
who are you?
"i am the borg. seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one, you've become weak."
this is a dream. i'm regenerating.
it's not a dream. we've accessed your neural transceiver. our thoughts are one. we know about voyager's plan to invade the sphere. it will fail.
"if that's true, then why haven't you assimilated them?"
we've come to make you an offer. rejoin the collective and we'll spare voyager.
why me?
because you are unique.
"field notes, u.s.s. raven, stardate 32629.4: after three months of tracking our borg cube, the vessel entered a transwarp conduit. we followed in its wake. our sensors tell us we've travelled all the way to the delta quadrant, the borg's native territory."
"magnus, you're breaking up."
just some bio-electric interference. stand by. is that better?
much. how's junior?
"he took a real beating when that plasma conduit blew out. he's regenerating. wait a minute, something's happening. bill and needle fingers just arrived. this is odd. they're making repairs to junior."
i thought drones from different subunits didn't interact.
looks like we were wrong.
they deactivated him.
why?
maybe he was too badly damaged. they're dismantling him. they must be salvaging the components.
your bio-dampener is losing power. it's time to come home.
i've got another minute or so. stand by.
we may not get another chance to observe this behaviour.
"it prevented the borg from detecting them. they referred to it as a bio-dampener. the device creates a field around the body, which simulates the physiometric conditions within a borg vessel."
camouflage.
precisely.
we need four of these devices. how soon can you replicate them?
i'll have to tailor each unit to its user's physiology. a few hours at least.
begin immediately. i'll inform the captain.
ingenious design.
the hansens were resourceful.
sounds like you're warming up to your folks.
it was merely an observation.
"this is an important stage of your social development, seven. try not to think of it as simply a research project, but as an exploration of how you were raised."
"my parents underestimated the collective. they were destroyed. because of their arrogance, i was raised by borg."
coffee? you look like you could use some.
no.
it's a human vice you might want to try one day. keeps you sharp.
one day.
"i've been fine-tuning our game plan for tomorrow morning, and i've decided to reassign you to the bridge."
captain?
"i'm concerned about voyager's safety, and if the sphere decides to attack i'll need your expertise at tactical."
i should be on the away team.
b'elanna will do just fine in your place.
"you may encounter unexpected obstacles. forcefields, encryption codes. i'm the only member of this crew who can anticipate them."
you underestimate the rest of us.
and you underestimate the borg.
"this is more than just a question of tactics. i'm concerned about your well-being, and your ability to perform on this mission."
your concern is unwarranted.
"is it? i'm not the only one who's worried about you. chakotay, neelix, the doctor, we've all noticed changes in your behaviour. you are preoccupied, agitated, and you're making mistakes. don't get me wrong. i appreciate your efforts, and we couldn't have come this far without your help, but it's obviously taken its toll. if i'd realised how those journals were going to affect you, i never would have pushed you to read them. and i'm not about to ask you to face the collective in your present frame of mind."
"the past several days have been difficult. but i must join the away team, and i assure you i will not make another mistake."
"i've made my decision, seven."
"if i don't go, this mission will fail."
you sound awfully certain about that.
i know the borg.
and i know you. there's more to what you're saying. what's wrong?
"over the past two years, i have become familiar with the individuals on this vessel. voyager is my collective now. your survival is important to me. i am willing to risk my own well-being if it increases our chances of success. assign me to the away team. please.  thank you."
"seven. you've made remarkable progress as an individual and as a member of this crew. for what it's worth, voyager wouldn't be the same without you."
a vessel has been detected. unimatrix four two four grid zero three. activate.
"vessel identified. federation starfleet, class two shuttlecraft. three lifeforms."
the sphere is maintaining course.
move the shuttle in closer.
the borg are still ignoring it.
bridge to transporter room two.
they're not taking the bait.
shuttle status?
all systems go. false bioreadings are holding steady.
how about a phaser shot across their bow. might grab their attention.
no. the shuttle would be perceived as a threat and they'd destroy it.
"commander, increase the energy output of the shuttle's warp profile."
that should present a more inviting target.
warp signature detected. prepare for assimilation. relevant technology. engage tractor pulse.
"they've got it. they're pulling it in toward a docking port along the central radius. five hundred metres, two hundred. they're dropping shields."
energise.
they're in.
bio-dampeners are stable. they're as good as invisible.
the sphere?
the shields are back up. they're assimilating the shuttle.
keep a sensor lock on the away team. maintain course.
never forget who you are.
"seven, are you all right?"
proceed.
primary shield generator. got it.
"spatial charges here, there and there."
"tuvok to janeway, charges set. returning to transport coordinates."
the transwarp coil is offline.
"tuvok, now."
activate the charges.
their shields are down.
lock onto the coil and energise.
target obtained.
seven of nine.
"seven, keep moving!"
no. i wish to stay. i intend to rejoin the collective.
i can't let you do that.
you have no choice.
keep moving. that's an order.
go!
chakotay to away team.
the sphere has detected voyager. they've altered course to intercept and they're charging weapons. we've got to get you out of there now.
four hundred thousand kilometres and closing.
full power to weapons.
i'm not leaving without you.
then you will be assimilated.
they can see us.
how?
i don't know.
"bridge, we're in position. three to beam up."
three?
energise.
where's seven?
she had a change of heart. report.
the sphere's changing course. they're retreating.
they're bringing the remaining transwarp coils online.
pursuit course. target their propulsion system.
"they're gone, captain."
"welcome home. you've changed. your exo-plating, your ocular implant. they've taken you apart and they've re-created you in their own image. hair, garments, but at the core you are still mine."
"the borg have changed as well. i expected re-assimilation, not conversation."
i see they've also given you a sense of humour.
my humour is my own.
spoken like a true individual. the last two years must have been a remarkable experience. you are unique.
my experience will add to your perfection.
yes.
that is why you removed me from voyager.
that is why we put you there in the first place. you believe that voyager liberated you from the collective. did you really think we would surrender you so easily?
explain.
you must be tired. it's time to regenerate. we've adapted an alcove just for you. go. it will help order your thoughts. when your cycle is complete we will continue our conversation. comply.
progress?
"we were having trouble modulating the coil to our warp field. but i had an inspiration this morning. instead of trying to adapt the coil to our technology, we should be adapting our systems to theirs. with any luck, we should have transwarp capability by oh six hundred."
impressive.
"actually, i can't take all the credit. i did some digging in seven of nine's personal database and i found some designs she'd been working on to enhance the warp drive. with a few adjustments"
work with mister paris on a flight plan. i want to make our first trial run tomorrow afternoon.
right.
and b'elanna? don't access personal databases without my authorisation.
captain?
there are protocols for observing privacy on this ship.
"no offence, but seven of nine is not on this ship anymore."
"i realise the two of you weren't exactly close. regardless, we've just lost one of our own."
"she was never one of our own, captain. didn't she just prove that?"
"i don't know what happened on that sphere and neither do you, lieutenant. carry on."
no sign of borg activity. we made a clean getaway.
the sphere?
it hasn't shown up on long range sensors or subspace telemetry. it could be anywhere in the quadrant by now.
launch a class five probe. scan for residual transwarp signatures.
understood.
why choose this moment to rejoin the collective?
maybe she'd been planning it all along.
she's had any number of opportunities to leave before now.
but never direct access to a borg vessel. i will betray you. that's what she said two years ago when you disconnected her from the hive.
"two days ago, she told me voyager had become her collective."
"captain, we've cleared out most of the debris, but before we vaporise it i'd like to melt down the larger fragments and extract the polytrinic compounds."
makes sense.
"that leaves just one item, seven of nine's alcove. it requires a lot of power, over thirty megawatts. should i deactivate it?"
"no, leave it alone."
"computer, isolate the sensor readings for time index one one four point six. identify source."
random subspace energy fluctuations.
isolate the sensor readings for time index one six six point two. source?
random subspace energy fluctuations.
"computer, run a transpectral analysis on all subspace fluctuations.  yes?"
"a member of the crew has requested an appointment with the captain. i informed her that you were occupied, but she was insistent."
"whatever it is, i'm sure commander chakotay can handle"
request granted. send her in.
permission to submit a proposal for your review.
proposal?
it's a rescue operation for seven of nine.
oh. you created this plan all by yourself?
"yes, ma'am. you see, if we change our long range sensors to seven's cortical implant frequency maybe we can find her."
"the delta quadrant is a very big place, and seven could be thousands of light years from here."
what if we boosted our sensor range with power from the main deflector?
"you've been spending too much time in engineering. i'm afraid it's not quite that simple. but thank you, crewman. your initiative is duly noted."
"captain? you're not going to give up, are you?"
"there are three things to remember about being a starship captain. keep your shirt tucked in, go down with the ship, and never abandon a member of your crew."
transpectral analysis complete.
"take a look at this, naomi. what do you see?"
sensor logs.
"these aren't random energy fluctuations. they're borg comm. signals, and they were all directed at cargo bay two."
you mean the borg were talking to seven of nine?
it sure looks that way. come on.
good morning.
my visual cortex. it's been altered.
we've enhanced it with borg technology. you've seen through human eyes long enough. it's a neural processing adjunct designed to increase your synaptic efficiency.
remove it.
you prefer to remain small?
i prefer to remain unique.
"don't be afraid. we won't turn you into a drone. you're much too valuable to us with your individuality intact. but you've left humanity behind. try to abandon their petty emotions as well. fear, anger, vanity. they've corrupted you, but the damage can be repaired."
you've expended significant resources to capture me. why?
"isn't it obvious? you're going to help us assimilate humanity. we failed in our first attempt to assimilate earth, and we won't succeed the next time unless we understand the nature of their resistance. we want you to be our eyes. let us see humanity."
"while i was regenerating, you assimilated my memories."
our thoughts are one.
then you already possess all of my knowledge. what more do you want?
you are the only borg that has ever returned to a state of individuality. we want to keep you exactly the way you are. otherwise you would lose your human perspective. we don't want another drone. we want you.
i will resist.
i know.
what's happening?
our vessel is disengaging from the unicomplex. we're setting a course for grid five three two.
state our purpose.
"assimilation. our presence is not required, but i thought the experience would be a rewarding one for you. species one zero zero two six."
how many lifeforms?
three hundred ninety two thousand. you're experiencing compassion. a human impulse. you've forgotten what it means to be borg. those lives will be added to our own.
"field notes, u.s.s. raven, supplemental. it's been a busy week. the cube linked with another borg vessel and received over fifty thousand new drones. we now begin the dangerous task of identifying the newcomers."
"species six nine six one, ktarian. tritanium infrastructure. he's a tactical drone."
take a look at his proximity transceiver. let's check his previous designation.
"three of five, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix one."
"i want to keep an eye on this one. let's tag him. bring me the subdermal probe, will you?"
is he special?
"very special. we think he used to work near the borg queen. if he ever goes back there, we'll be able to track him now."
does the queen have a throne?
nobody knows.
we think she's more like the queen of an insect colony. she helps coordinate all the other drones.
his regeneration cycle's almost complete. we'd better get him back.
bye.
he's in his alcove. nobody missed him. enough drones for one day. anybody hungry?
me.
"you two go ahead. i want to read through his cranial transceiver logs, see if he was ever in direct contact with the queen."
don't be long.
it turns out his hunch was right. the drone had been receiving direct commands from this borg queen. i analysed the comm. signals. look at the transpectral frequencies.
they match the ones that were sent to seven. what did the hansens learn about this queen?
i'm afraid they never got a chance to find out.
"one thing is certain. she contacted seven of nine, and the next day seven rejoined the borg. obviously, she exerts some influence."
you think seven was instructed to leave voyager?
"instructed, coerced. she insisted she join the away team. she was adamant that if she didn't board that sphere, our mission would fail. sounds to me like she was being threatened. my instincts told me she was holding something back, but i, i didn't pursue it. i let her go."
"if you hadn't, we might all be drones by now."
"what's running through that collective mind of yours? you've got thousands of species to choose from, billions of individuals. why seven of nine? you should've assimilated us while you had the chance."
captain?
i want you to keep analysing the hansens' database. compile a list of every technology they created to track the borg. assemble a team of engineers to assist you.
"if you're planning a rescue mission, that research will only take us so far."
oh?
"i've studied their log entries long enough to realise that as brilliant as the hansens were, they made a fatal mistake. they became overconfident."
we won't make the same mistake.
"this will be a long range tactical rescue. it could take days, even weeks, before we find our missing crewman. lieutenant torres is equipping the delta flyer with the transwarp coil. it'll allow us to cover more territory. an away team will take it into transwarp space, where tuvok believes we can track the sphere that abducted seven of nine. thanks to the hansens, we'll be well prepared for an encounter with the borg. their multi-adaptive shielding will make the flyer virtually invisible to borg sensors, and narrow beam transporters will allow us to penetrate the sphere. mister paris, you'll man the helm. commander tuvok, tactical. doctor, there's no telling what condition seven will be in when we find her. you'll come along."
"yes, captain."
i'll be leading the away team. the rest of you will remain on voyager and maintain position at the threshold of our transwarp conduit. we may need tactical support when we return. you'll be taking your orders from commander chakotay. we'll be searching for one individual among thousands of drones. but she's one of us and i'm not about to let her go. let's get started.
all systems go. we're ready for the jump.
bring the coil online. prepare for transwarp.
power output fluctuating.
compensating.
we're at critical velocity.
"engage, mister paris."
"transwarp in four, three, two. we've crossed the threshold."
"steady as she goes. doctor, are you all right?"
just a little motion sickness. i'll need to adjust my matrix to accommodate for extreme velocity.
i'm detecting residual transwarp signatures. they match the borg sphere.
"adjust our course and follow it, mister paris."
i believe the captain's order was steady as she goes.
full speed ahead.
we've arrived. are you ready?
i have familiarised myself with the species.
tactical weakness.
their vessels lack manoeuverability.
tactical strength.
they've developed a modulating phaser pulse that can penetrate our shields.
how do you propose we adapt?
you are the borg. you tell me.
thirty nine of their vessels are converging on our position. they're firing weapons. our shields are failing. we will be destroyed. how do you propose we adapt?
triaxillate our shield geometry to absorb their phaser pulses.
i was thinking the same thing. adaptation complete. they're no longer a threat. go to the primary assimilation chamber. you'll monitor the bio-extraction process. you look reluctant. maybe i've been pushing you too quickly. you can assist with the repairs to our shield matrix instead. seven of nine. be efficient.
"assist me. i am not borg, i will help you escape. assist me!"
"i'm detecting one of your vessels. it's heavily damaged, the crew is dead. the borg are ignoring it. it's propulsion system is still functioning. i will transport you aboard. remain there until the borg leave orbit. then set a course on a heading of one two one mark nine. do you understand?"
congratulations.
regarding?
assimilation is complete.
three hundred thousand individuals have been transformed into drones. should they be congratulated as well?
"they should be. they've left behind their trivial, selfish lives and they've been reborn with a greater purpose. we've delivered them from chaos into order."
comforting words. use them next time instead of resistance is futile. you may elicit a few volunteers.
"you cling to sarcasm because you are afraid to see the truth. species one zero zero two six is already adding to our perfection. you can feel their distinctiveness coursing through us, enhancing us. stop resisting. take pleasure in this."
i will not take pleasure in the destruction of a race.
"human sentiment. compassion, guilt, empathy. they're irrelevant."
not to me.
me? there is no me. there is only us. one mind.
my thoughts are my own.
"we've overlooked something. a ship. four lifeforms. they're trying to escape. how do you suggest we proceed? destroy the vessel, or assimilate it?"
neither. there are only four lifeforms and the vessel is heavily damaged. it would be an inefficient use of our resources. we should ignore it.
"in this case, our thoughts are not one. if those individuals are allowed to survive, species one zero zero two six will survive and continue to resist us. but that's what you were hoping for, wasn't it? you tried to mask their lifesigns, but i detected them."
release the vessel.
"i'm sorry this lesson has to be so painful for you, but you are a difficult pupil. abandon your human frailties. they are the cause of your pain."
let them go. please.
i thought compassion was irrelevant.
"field notes, u.s.s. raven, stardate 32634.9. the raven was hit by a subspace particle storm. we took heavy damage and our multi-adaptive shielding went offline for thirteen point two seconds. unfortunately, it was long enough for the borg to perceive us as a threat."
i've found something. a nebula.
class?
"mutara. distance, three light years. i'm setting a course."
the particle density's too high. our hull would breach.
we can reinforce structural integrity.
we'll find somewhere else to hide.
there's no time.
it's been three hours and the cube hasn't found us yet. as long as we can keep masking our warp trail
the entire collective knows about us by now. they'll send more ships.
the nebula's too dangerous.
we've had close calls before. this is no different. remember when the transporters failed?
"and you had to spend the night in a maturation chamber, with fifty two neonatal drones. a transwarp conduit, two point three light years starboard. it's a cube heading right for us."
time to intercept?
"one hour, maybe less."
papa?
"be right there, annika. start looking for an m-class planet. we'll abandon ship if we have to."
hey.
are we going to be assimulated?
"not if i can help it. go back to sleep, your mother and i have work to do."
are the borg mad at us?
no.
then why are they chasing our ship?
"they're curious about us, like we are about them. but don't worry, we won't let them get too close."
can't we go home?
soon.
"papa, will it hurt to be a drone?"
sleep.
captain?
hmm.
i'd like to suggest a few modifications to the comm. array.
yes?
"i've studied seven's cranial schematics and i've isolated the frequency of her interplexing beacon. when we catch up with the sphere, we might be able to send her a brief message."
what if she's already been linked to the hive mind?
every drone has its own translink signature. only seven will be able to hear our message.
i'll give you a hand.
the hansen diaries. not exactly light reading.
i've been poring over their last log entries for any details we might have missed. i want to make sure history doesn't repeat itself.
"they should have quit while they were ahead. ten million terraquads of data, three years in the wild."
"they could have studied the borg for another three decades and still have barely scratched the surface. i agree their methods were unorthodox, but that's been true of most great explorers."
most explorers don't take their four year old daughter along for the ride.
"we'll get her back, doctor, with her parents' help."
"captain, i've got a fix on the sphere's location. it's in a region about two hundred light years from here."
red alert. bring the multi-adaptive shielding online. set a course for those coordinates and prepare to disengage transwarp drive.
report.
"i'm detecting thousands of integrated substructures, trillions of lifeforms, all borg."
there's a cube coming up fast off our port bow.
did they detect us?
i don't believe so.
any sign of our sphere?
"yes, ma'am. its ion signature leads directly to that whatever it is."
"take us in, mister paris, minimum thrusters. begin scanning for seven, tuvok."
"aye, captain."
i have a task for you. we're planning to deploy a new mode of assimilation designed for highly resistant species. i want you to programme the nanoprobes.
your technology has changed since i left the collective. my knowledge is insufficient.
"your knowledge for the target species is invaluable. species five six one eight. human. warp capable. origin, grid three two five. physiology inefficient, below average cranial capacity, minimal redundant systems, limited regenerative abilities. our previous attempts to assimilate them were all direct assaults. they failed, so we've created a more surreptitious strategy."
you intend to detonate a biogenic charge in earth's atmosphere.
"it would infect all lifeforms with nanoprobe viruses. assimilation would be gradual. by the time they realised what was happening, half their population would be drones."
inefficient. the virus would take years to proliferate.
we've waited this long. interface with the central alcove. begin programming the nanoprobes. be sure to enhance the viral sequencers. you've been involved in hundreds of assimilations. this is no different.
"to you, perhaps. part of me is still human. i will not assist in their destruction."
we all originated from lesser species. i myself came from species one two five. but that's irrelevant now. we are borg.
i am an individual.
"you're only repeating their words. you sound like a mindless automaton. comply, or we will turn you into a drone."
"proceed, if you wish."
"you're torn between your desire to be one with us and your loyalty to them. it's time for you to complete your task. all of your emotions, grief, guilt, remorse, compassion, will be irrelevant once humanity is assimilated. forget voyager. they were never your collective."
i am annika hansen. human.
i remember annika. does she remember us? she wasn't afraid. why are you?
you attacked us. you murdered my family.
we did no such thing. we gave them perfection.
papa.
your family's here. you're here. be one with us again.
"seven of nine, we're searching for you. try to hang on."
captain.
what did you say?
nothing.
janeway.
our transmission's being deflected.
by whom?
i'm not certain.
i have isolated seven's position. she's inside a large infrastructure approximately six hundred kilometres away.
"set a course, mister paris."
"she's close. her comm. signal originated within this spatial grid, but we can't detect her vessel. he knows why. your father designed the technology captain janeway's using. multi-adaptive shielding. your perfect defence against the borg. but we assimilated that knowledge, didn't we? we will adapt easily."
the cube has altered course. it's heading straight for us.
they've detected us. remodulate the shields. evasive manoeuvres.
it flew right past us.
we won't fool their sensors much longer. tuvok?
seven is inside a large chamber.
can you get a lock on her?
not at this distance.
take us to within transporter range.
"we have their ship. a federation shuttlecraft. three lifeforms, one hologram."
"if you've captured their vessel, you've assimilated them by now. i would sense their presence in the collective. captain janeway is eluding you."
the chamber is too heavily shielded. i can't get a lock on her.
can we beam into one of these adjoining corridors?
i believe so.
"time for the bio-dampeners. tom, hold our position. target that chamber with full weapons. stand by to fire on my command."
"ma'am, won't you be down there?"
do it.
this way.
try to locate the shield matrix.
tuvok.
"i can disable the forcefield, but it will take several minutes."
do it.
"tuvok, give me the subdermal probe."
it's not too late to save them. as you wish.
they've isolated our shields again. three vessels are converging. i'm remodulating.
you underestimate them.
it's time for a more aggressive approach.
i thought they couldn't see us.
they can't! they're firing blind!
wake him. it's transmitting.
i've got it. field modulation is three two four point nine five.
proceed.
it's offline.
you'll be detected.
then i'd better hurry. you've got to disable the shield matrix around that chamber.
"it's no use, they've locked on to our shield modulators. they're adapting the second we change frequencies."
we are the borg. you will be assimilated.
resistance is futile.
you have failed them.
no!
we believed you would be an asset to us. we were wrong. you are weak.
"don't listen to her, seven. she's irrelevant. call them off or i'll destroy you."
your weapons are useless.
"don't be so sure. my tactical officer is disabling the shields around this room. tom, status."
"we've targeted the chamber, captain."
"let her go, or i'll give the order to fire."
"you would be destroyed as well, along with your crewman."
"better than being one of you. tom, high-yield torpedoes, full spread. fire on my command."
"captain, they've disengaged"
hold your fire. beam us out of here.
a dispersal field just activated around the chamber you're in. i can't get a lock.
"seven, shut down that field."
don't listen to her. she's poisoned your thoughts long enough.
i'm giving you an order.
"one order, one voice. insignificant."
"tom, energise."
she's adapting.
"the field went up again, captain. i can't beam you out."
you will assist the collective as drones. assimilate them.
"captain, target the power node directly above this alcove. it will disrupt her command interface. our thoughts are one."
welcome back.
"three vessels, closing fast."
direct hit to our tactical array. weapons are down.
bring the coil online. prepare for transwarp.
tom?
"transwarp in four, three, two. a vessel entered the conduit with us, just before it closed."
they're targeting our engines.
maintain course.
direct hit on the port nacelle. we're venting plasma.
rerouting emergency power.
"it's not enough. i'll need thirty teradynes at least, or we'll lose transwarp."
how long to the rendezvous coordinates?
"two point four minutes, but we'll drop out of transwarp in less than one."
reroute power from life support.
captain!
i'd rather suffocate than vaporise. do it!
"i'm picking up transwarp signatures. there's a conduit approaching, thirty thousand kilometres off our port bow."
battle stations.
we're twenty seconds from normal space.
the borg vessel?
"still in pursuit, closing rapidly."
fifteen seconds.
they're trying to lock on with a tractor beam.
remodulate shields.
"threshold in eight, seven, six."
they're locking on.
five.
i've re-polarised the shields. it's being deflected.
"three, two."
they're through.
voyager to delta flyer. report.
"we've got seven, but there's a borg vessel right behind us."
"target the threshold perimeter. photon torpedoes, full spread."
commander?
it should destabilise the matter stream and implode the conduit for at least a light year.
torpedoes locked.
fire.
"voyager, report."
we collapsed
the conduit. no sign of borg activity.
clear us for docking. we're coming home.
"commander, i'm picking up borg signatures. lots of them."
source?
the conduit.
i thought you collapsed it.
so did i.
stand by weapons. captain
raise shields. we've got company.
here they come.
i see you've picked up some bad habits.
captain?
the doctor told you to regenerate for at least two days. you're violating a direct medical command.
i will comply when my work is completed.
borg tactical data?
"during my time at unimatrix one i acquired a vast amount of knowledge. it may prove useful in our future encounters with the borg. i am downloading it into voyager's database. the borg believed i was unique, that i understood humanity. they were obviously mistaken."
how so?
"i betrayed the crew of voyager, threatened you with assimilation. i did not expect you to return for me."
looks like you still have a few things to learn. time to regenerate.
when i am finished.
"no, now. that's an order."
"yes, captain."
sweet dreams.
we shouldn't be here.
don't worry. nobody saw us leave.
"hey, i need that. what if somebody tries to call?"
shush.
what was that?
don't worry. come here.
i thought we agreed central control would be off limits.
"we did, but i need to access your warp assembly."
that technology's classified.
we have to reconfigure the assembly if we're going to finish this job.
then consider it finished.
we've come this far.
"you've turned our ship upside down for two weeks, and i've yet to see any results."
you might check the antimatter injectors.
back online.
"all you need now is a jolt of antimatter from voyager's engines and you'll be back in business, but i need access to your warp assembly. you know, i can understand why you're distrustful of other species. frankly, we've had a rough time in the delta quadrant ourselves. but our two species have made remarkable progress working together to repair your engines. we've come a long way since you ignored our opening hails. let's not throw all that away."
i'll admit we do share some things in common.
"we're both on long journeys, looking for allies. in many ways, we're like cousins."
cousins?
"well, distant cousins. think about it. four hundred years ago you started out the same way we did, a single starship, a small crew, facing the unknown. and now, centuries later, you've grown into a generational ship with a history and culture all your own. when i look at your vessel, i can't help but wonder if i'm seeing voyager's future. our journey could easily last several generations. so, what do you say, cousin?"
you can access the warp assembly from here.
thank you.
status?
the plasma couplings are online. we're ready for the antimatter transfer.
then let's get started. janeway to
voyager. status.
"ready here, captain."
initiate the transfer.
warp reactors one through fourteen are coming online. it's working.
keep your fingers crossed. for luck.
"if you're planning on leaving through the viewport, you might want to get dressed. the interstellar vacuum might get a little chilly."
"what? oh, funny."
come back to bed.
i can't sleep.
cuddle.
i can't cuddle.
"i told you we're not going to get caught. if someone had seen us, they would've reported it by now."
i'm violating about half a dozen regulations by just being in this room. and what we did earlier? i don't know if starfleet even has a regulation for that.
what are you saying? making love is a crime in your culture?
"yes! no. what i'm saying is, it's a breach of protocol."
how romantic.
the captain instructed all away teams. no personal interaction with the varro crew. i violated a direct order.
come back to bed. that's an order.
are all humans so jumpy?
"no, only me."
the warp engines. they've started the plasma transfer. we've got to get down there. we're late. what are you waiting for?
to see what you look like in my uniform.
you don't understand. if i'm not at my post.
you'll be executed?
funny. we'd better go in separately.
impressive.
just trying to orchestrate the antimatter flow.
you should try some chopin when you're done. look who showed up for the final movement.
excuse me?
"just a little late for the joke, as well as the job."
i was checking the manifolds in segment twenty two.
warp reaction's destabilising. tal?
i can't find the problem.
we're less than a minute away from multiple core breaches. abort the transfer.
so much for finger crossing.
b'elanna?
i'm reading microfractures all over the hull.
why couldn't we detect that before?
good question. we'll have to check the hulls in each of your vessel's segments.
but that'll take days.
"the sooner we start, the sooner we finish."
friendly people.
they've had a lot of bad experiences with other species.
"well, i don't know. it seems like your first contact went pretty well."
what's that supposed to mean?
i was just wondering where you disappeared to today.
i told you. i was checking the plasma conduits
"in segment twenty two, i know. they must have sonic showers over there. you're a lot cleaner than you were when you left. you are such a lousy liar. haven't you learned anything from me after five years? she's cute."
who.
"that assistant engineer, tal."
cute enough.
"oh, here we go again."
what?
"you, going after impossible women. a hologram, an ex-borg, the wrong twin, and now a girl from a xenophobic species?"
"you're right. you're absolutely right. i'm putting her out of my mind, i promise."
good. glad to hear it. i'm due back on the bridge.
see you in the morning.
"computer, open a channel to varro ship, segment sixteen, station two oh four. encode transmission with security code alpha seven."
channel open.
what took you so long? i've been waiting twenty two minutes for you to call.
i was testing myself. seeing how long i could resist calling you.
and?
i lasted twenty two minutes.
should i feel complimented or insulted?
"since this is the first chance i've had to open a comm. link, complimented."
so you liked what happened?
"yeah, a lot."
enough to try it again?
"absolutely. i've got to be honest, i wasn't expecting something so different."
"neither was i. our species look so similar. well, at least on the surface."
"i would've never guessed when it came down to the basics. well, let's just say the birds and bees would be very confused."
the birds and bees?
"i'm telling you, you should take a look at their database. they've got some pretty amazing stuff on that ship."
stuff?
"their environmental control system, for instance. it's completely regenerative. zero waste."
impressive.
"it can be programmed to create almost any habitat. if you wanted to, you could recreate vulcan in your quarters with that system."
why would i want to?
a little taste of home in the delta quadrant? think about it. springtime on the shores of lake yaron.
i require a desk and a bed. nothing more.
you're missing the point.
no doubt.
these people have been travelling for four hundred years. they've learned a thing or two about living comfortably.
our systems are more than adequate.
"oh, i give up."
"after only two minutes? tuvok, how do you do it?"
i wait until his own illogic overwhelms him. i'm detecting an unauthorised transmission.
origin?
unknown. it's been encoded.
find out where it's going.
where would you most like to be right now?
besides your quarters?
besides my quarters.
"on a distant moon, where the air is warm and the gravity is light. no bulkheads around me. where, if i walk too quickly, i can almost fly."
i like that.
what about you? where would you most want to be right now?
besides your cabin?
besides my cabin.
"sorry, i can't come up with anything better than your cabin."
and what would you do if you were here?
now?
this very moment.
i'd ask you to dim the lights.
and what if i said no?
"okay, so we leave the lights on."
"the message is being sent to the varro ship, segment sixteen."
living quarters.
"er, commander? i think i can track that down for you. hold on, something's wrong. i'm losing the signal."
tal?
the transmission has ended.
if it was a transmission. it could have just been a glitch in the comm. system.
run a diagnostic.
finding the source of these structural problems isn't going to be easy. they've already scanned most of their ship and come up empty. i'm hoping we'll do a better job.
we should form smaller teams to maximise efficiency.
"agreed. we'll work in pairs. now, what i'd like to do is start with their reactor bay, where we first detected the problem."
you owe me.
what?
"eyes front. last night i had to sabotage the comm. system to cover your tracks. you called her, didn't you?"
guilty.
how long has this been going on? the truth.
from the moment we first saw each other. it was like touching an open plasma relay.
sounds serious.
maybe it is.
has it occurred to you that you're breaking a few dozen protocols?
we know what we're getting into.
dismissed.
do you?
our duty assignment. we're to survey the generational ship from astrometrics.
team alpha and gamma have finished scanning sections one through sixty four.
"kind of puts a borg cube to shame, doesn't it?"
"the vessel's technology is impressive, but its construction is haphazard."
"i guess they sort of improvised as they went along. seven, you've been around humans for a while now. what do you think about love?"
we're scanning for microfractures. i don't see the relevance.
just curious.
"parental love, romantic love, affection between friends. specify."
romantic love.
an attraction based on sexual desire when it facilitates procreation.
i guess i'm asking the wrong person.
not at all. the borg have referenced this condition in over six thousand assimilated species.
condition? you make it sound like a disease.
"physiologically, it bears a striking similarity to disease. a series of biochemical responses that trigger an emotional cascade impairing normal functioning."
forget it.
"are you in love, ensign?"
i guess that's what i've been asking myself.
you're glowing.
i beg your pardon?
your epidermis luminesced.
"oh, itmust be the lighting in here."
"no, it was you."
you should report to sickbay.
it's nothing.
you must comply.
lie still.
i feel fine.
no doubt you're feeling wonderful. your beta endorphins are abnormally elevated.
really?
you've been spending a lot of time on the generational ship. do you recall coming into contact with any toxins? antimatter radiation?
no.
maybe something in one of their medical bays. a biological agent?
no.
did you consume any of their cuisine?
no.
"doctor, there is unusual synaptic activity in his cerebral cortex."
no kidding.
this could be the work of an alien virus. we'll have to initiate full quarantine protocols. inform the captain and request a bio-alert.
wait! there's no need for that. i can explain.
i'm listening.
could you give us some privacy?
if there is the possibility of an epidemic the doctor may require my assistance.
there isn't and he won't. please.
last night i had an encounter with one of the varro.
encounter?
a personal encounter.
specifically?
sex. we had sex.
you had intimate contact with an alien species without medical clearance?
it was in the heat of the moment. i didn't think anything like this would happen.
"correction. if you'd been thinking, you would have considered the risks and exercised restraint. sit down. you'll need a full biomedical workup and your friend will have to come in as well."
do we have to drag her into this?
"it is my medical responsibility. which, i'm sorry to say, also requires me to report this to the captain."
i expected more from you.
i'm sorry. i don't know what i was thinking.
"don't you? i've seen tal. she's an impressive young woman, beautiful. but that's no excuse to ignore your obligations as a starfleet officer."
"yes, ma'am."
there's a reason you took a semester of interspecies protocol at the academy. there's also a reason why the handbook on personal relationships is three centimetres thick.
all starfleet personnel must obtain authorisation from their c.o. as well as clearance from their medical officer before initiating an intimate relationship with an alien species.
"bravo. unfortunately, your recitation comes a little late. according to the doctor, your condition isn't life-threatening. there's no reason to confine you to sickbay. nut i do agree with his recommendation to run full bioscans on both you and tal. and her people need to be told so they can evaluate any bio-threat you might have introduced into their population. we're trying to help these people, ensign, earn their trust. i was even hoping they might return the favour, share their technology, their insights into long-term space travel. but your little escapade put that in jeopardy."
"permission to speak freely? with all due respect, this wasn't a fling. i've really gotten to know tal, and i've developed true feelings for her."
"noted. but there are regulations, and you've broken them. i'm entering a formal reprimand into your record, and i'm ordering you to break off this relationship. do you understand?"
"yes, ma'am."
dismissed.
"commander, i wanted to share a few security concerns. a few days ago i noticed some mess hall supplies had disappeared. liquid nutriments, emergency rations. nothing to warrant a red alert, but i took the liberty of investigating on my own. take a look at this."
unauthorised use of the mess hall replicator is hardly a felony.
it wasn't just unauthorised. someone accessed the ship's environmental controls from that station.
"life support was routed to jefferies tube g thirty three, deck fifteen."
isn't that section normally uninhabited?
whoever did this encoded the procedure so it wouldn't be detected.
it appears we have intruders.
it looks like a varro scanning device.
breathable oxygen is confined to this chamber and the area immediately behind this hatch. stand back.
come in.
work?
"no, i'm just tormenting myself with what ifs. what if i actually had the chance to see that pulsar field? go there instead of just squinting at it through long range sensors."
"too far off your course, huh?"
too close to an inhabited planet. they might make contact with us. it's too dangerous. it's always the same thing. the mighty generational ship. all we do is run away from anything that's different. but that's going to change.
"i'm afraid i've got some bad news. i er, i can't see you anymore. captain's orders."
how did she find out?
"something happened to me this morning. i had a strange sensation and then my skin luminesced, just like last night."
that shouldn't have happened. our species are too dissimilar.
what shouldn't have happened?
"we call it olan'vora, the shared heart, when two of us merge. you know the biological connection we had last night? it becomes stronger. it won't hurt you, harry, but it will change you. it'll change both of us. bring us closer."
so can this process be reversed?
"in time, if we stay away from each other. but if we don't, the more we're together, the harder it will be to stop it. but then, you have your orders."
orders. it's an old story. boy meets girl from the wrong side of the galaxy. boy loses girl.
and girl loses boy.
it's not like we didn't know this was going to end.
at least we had two weeks.
two great weeks.
"goodbye, harry."
bye. are you really going to let me leave?
if that's what you want.
it's not.
welcome aboard. normally we like to know something about our guests before we invite them to join us. care to tell us how you got here?
through a docking port.
your entry would have triggered an intruder alert.
your technology's easy to circumvent. it doesn't matter how i got here. i'm not going back.
that remains to be seen. you haven't explained your reasons for leaving the generational ship.
"i'm not a criminal, if that's what you think. if you leave me at the next inhabited system, i'll manage from there."
"your next stop is the brig, unless you answer my questions."
i came aboard four days ago with one of the work details.
why?
"our ship's not the paradise our leaders make it out to be. there are thousands of us who feel like prisoners, and others who"
continue.
there are rumours of a movement. people who want to leave the ship. some of them are willing to take violent action.
can you be more specific?
this is a trick.
a trick?
you're trying to get me to expose the movement. our leaders put you up to this.
on the contrary. we haven't even told them we've found you.
you're lying.
"i don't have time for a debate. you asked for asylum. fine, i'll consider it. but only if you answer my questions. what movement? contact the varro authorities. let them know we've found one of their people, then take him to the brig."
you can tell the authorities that i'm not the only one. there are hundreds more like me.
do we know anything about this supposed uprising?
"jippeq said the rumours are just that, rumours. but he's questioning our stowaway, just to be certain. new protocols for working with the varro. after the incident with ensign kim, they insisted we keep our crews segregated."
that's pretty severe.
"harry violated protocol. frankly, i understand their position."
is that why you came down so hard on him? a formal reprimand for being intimate with a young woman?
"i know it seems a little extreme, but i wanted to leave a lasting impression. chalk it up to growing pains."
"well, he looks pained, all right. until now he's had a spotless record. maybe you should reconsider."
what are you implying?
"are you angry because harry disobeyed orders, or because he let you down."
i set the same standards for all my officers.
"if i object to one of your decisions you'll hear me out, even insist i speak up."
"you're my first officer, he's an ensign. he hasn't earned the right to question my orders, whatever his personal views."
i see.
engineering to the captain.
yes?
we've found something.
on my way.
do your officers make a habit of seducing the species they encounter?
certainly not. but it's my understanding this relationship was consensual.
i find that difficult to believe. we don't share your cavalier attitude toward intimacy.
our attitude is anything but cavalier. ensign kim has already been reprimanded. what about tal? what happens to her?
"in our society, mating is taken very seriously. when two people chose each other the bonding is permanent. they become biochemically linked. separation is rare. it induces illness, sometimes fatal. what's to become of tal when your ensign flies off in search of his next conquest?"
captain.
you found something?
we've detected microfractures in one of voyager's docking ports.
microfractures? that's the same problem we've been having.
a coincidence?
i had suspicions that it wasn't. seven confirmed them.
"observe. silicon-based parasites which feed on duranium alloys. apparently they began replicating on the varro ship's hull several months ago, and then migrated to voyager."
we analysed them and found artificial gene sequences. the parasites are synthetic.
they may have been created by someone aboard your vessel.
sabotage? i don't believe it.
perhaps not everyone is content to be in your collective.
"tal, are you there?"
harry?
i can't keep this comm. link open. where are you?
by my computer.
"okay. get ready for a ride, i'm locking on."
a ride?
where are we?
a shuttlecraft.
a shuttlecraft?
a short range vessel. we use it for away mission.
we can go anywhere we want?
"anywhere. for a while, anyway. i'm not due back on voyager until nineteen hundred hours. they think i'm still out repairing a hull fracture. i finished early."
"you're a fugitive now. how many protocols did you break this time? let's see. unauthorised use of a shuttlecraft, kidnapping."
direct violation of the captain's orders. i must be crazy.
i like you crazy. navigation?
"careful, that's the weapons array. you know you almost vaporised your living quarters."
"well, they could use a good cleaning. let's go somewhere."
where?
"there's a nebula about three hundred thousand kilometres from here. i've been watching it on the sensors for the past few days. oh, i would love to see it with my own eyes."
have a seat.
look at this. a subspace vacuole near the centre of the cloud. it must act as a gravitational anchor. there's so much data here it'll take weeks to analyse. do you have a storage device? we need to download these reading. what?
i've just never seen anyone so excited about a class three nebula before.
maybe you've been taking them for granted.
maybe i have. don't stop. you're beautiful when you're scanning.
is that what you say to every girl you take for a ride? i bet you've left a trail of broken hearts across the delta quadrant.
actually
problem?
stray radiation from the nebula. i thought it was the proximity alarm.
you said we had a couple of hours. no one's going to come looking for us.
"oh, you don't know commander tuvok. if he sees one electron out of place he calls for red alert. here we are alone and all i can think about is duty and orders."
"those things are important. i think about them, too. but sometimes you need to follow a different kind of protocol. if you believe in something strongly enough, you can't ignore it, even if it means breaking a few rules."
"that's why i took this shuttle. but every time i break a rule, i feel like my skull is going to decompress. i'm like some kind of borg drone. programmed. except i was designed to be the perfect starfleet officer. top of his class, captain of the velocity team. interstellar honours. first field assignment, bridge officer on a starship. every cadet's dream come true."
"you're not a programme. in fact, i envy your freedom. i mean, your crew's mission to seek out life. what could be more liberating? you explore the unknown. don't be afraid to explore what's happening between us."
"oh no, the delta flyer."
commander tuvok?
we're being hailed.
"well, you'd better answer them before they open fire."
kim here.
"ensign, you are in direct violation of the captain's orders. return to voyager immediately, and bring derran tal with you."
"yes sir, but why bring tal?"
she's wanted by the varro authorities regarding an act of sabotage.
"there's no point in lying. we found a schematic for the parasite on your personal database. you realise this could destroy our ship, our home?"
to some of us it's more like a prison.
"so you've resorted to sabotage, no doubt involving him."
mister kim's complicity remains to be proven.
he had nothing to do with our movement.
movement?
tell them.
it's none of their concern.
"if you want our help, you'll need to explain."
she's referring to a small group of dissidents.
it's not a small group. there are hundreds of us.
what are you trying to achieve?
"our freedom. the right to live where we choose, to go where we choose."
how will you accomplish that if your vessel is destroyed?
we're not trying to destroy it. we're trying to dismantle it. the parasites weren't placed randomly. they're targeting the linkages between segments. each segment will become its own ship. people can decide whether to go or stay.
"you're destroying the work of every generation that came before you. our ship isn't just a collection of modules, it's an expression of unity, tradition. for the sake of our history we must respect the rights of"
of the majority.
yes.
what about the rights of the minority?
"tal, if those segments come apart there could be decompressive explosions, most likely casualties. is that what you want? you know more about the parasites than we do. you could help us."
"captain, she's a criminal."
and maybe your only chance of stopping a catastrophe. set up a datalink with voyager. we'll do what we can from our end.
tal?
i'll help you slow down the parasites so you can evacuate the segments in danger. nothing more.
let's get started.
captain.
"stow it, ensign. right now the only thing standing between you and the brig is this report. the doctor's bioscans confirm that you and tal have developed some sort of biochemical bond. clearly it's affected your behaviour, so i have to assume that's why you disobeyed my orders. report to sickbay. you'll be confined there until this is over."
captain!
i told you to report for treatment.
i don't want treatment!
in my ready room.
you've got thirty seconds before i have tuvok drag you to sickbay.
"captain, i am not sick. i didn't disobey your orders because i'm under some alien influence. i disobeyed your orders because tal and i are in love, and it's not right for you to keep us apart!"
listen to yourself. you don't sound anything like the harry kim i know.
"good. i have served on this ship for five years and said, yes, ma'am to every one of your orders. but not this time."
"you're willing to risk your rank, your career, over this?"
"have you ever been in love, captain?"
your point?
"did your skin ever flush when you were near another person? did your stomach ever feel like someone hollowed it out with a knife when you were apart? did your throat ever swell when you realised it was over? seven of nine, seven of nine told me love's like a disease. well, maybe it is. pheromones, endorphins, chemicals in our blood, changing our responses, physical discomfort, but any way you look at it, it's still love."
"for the sake of argument, let's say you're right. your feelings for tal are no different than mine for what, the man i was engaged to marry? well, i lost him and you're going to lose tal. you know that. what the doctor is offering you is a way to ease the pain."
"that man you were going to marry. if you could have just taken a hypospray to make yourself stop loving him, so that it didn't hurt so much when you were away from him, would you have done that?"
captain to the bridge.
we're detecting structural breaches on the varro ship.
take your station.
their shields are weakening.
one of the junctions is about to decompress.
"on screen. mister paris, release the docking clamps. back us away."
docking controls are offline. i can't break us free.
their shields are continuing to weaken. the superstructure will collapse in less than three minutes.
if that happens while we're still docked
keep trying to break free. janeway to
varro control room. what's your status?
"tal was able to slow the parasites' growth with a polaron surge, but the junctions are still destabilising."
how much longer until you've evacuated the affected areas?
we need another two minutes at least.
i've got the docking controls back online.
initiate decompression sequence.
"wait. if we stay where we are, and extend voyager's structural integrity field around the varro ship, we could buy them another minute or two. they could finish the evacuation."
"however, if an explosion occurs while both ships are inside the field, neither vessel will survive."
"we can do it, captain."
keep us where we are. janeway to engineering.
torres here.
"divert all available power to the integrity field, and extend it around the varro ship."
understood.
"voyager's reinforcing our shields. surprising, isn't it? a ship of outsiders risking their lives to save ours."
they're unusual people.
"well, maybe the galaxy isn't as hostile as you think. all junctions are clear. what are you waiting for? tell voyager to move away."
i'm initiating another polaron surge. we can destroy these parasites.
it's too late. you'll only destroy voyager along with our ship. let them go. let us go.
tal to voyager.
the evacuation's complete. disengage your structural field and move to a safe distance.
releasing docking clamps.
come in.
i wasn't sure i'd see you again.
the captain gave me permission to say goodbye.
how are you feeling?
lovesick.
"me, too."
will you manage?
we have medications. i'll recover eventually.
"so, where are you going?"
the natori system. a pair of binary stars caught in each other's gravity. we passed within a parsec three months ago. now we're going back for a real look.
do me one favour.
anything.
"next time you run across a class three nebula, think of me."
"chronic sleep loss, acute gastroenteritis. you must feel awful, yet you're still refusing treatment?"
"captain, just the person i wanted to see. this nonsense has gone on long enough. order mister kim to take his medicine."
is his condition fatal?
that's hardly the point.
will he recover without taking his medicine?
"yes, but it could take weeks, even months."
"well then, if mister kim wants to suffer."
sometimes i think everyone on this ship has been possessed by alien hormones.
"would you excuse us, please?"
thank you.
"oh, don't thank me. i have no intention of relieving you of your duties, no matter how lousy you feel."
i understand.
and the reprimand still stands. i've been thinking about how i reacted to your relationship with tal.
you reacted like any captain would.
"probably. but i can't help wondering if my response would have been the same if it had been, say, tom paris instead of you. oh don't get me wrong, i still would have been angry and disappointed, but i wouldn't have been surprised."
because ensign kim doesn't break the rules.
"the truth is, harry, i think about you differently than the rest of the crew. which isn't to suggest that i don't care deeply about each of them. you came to me fresh out of the academy, wide-eyed with excitement about your first deep space assignment. from that first day, i've always felt more protective of you than the others."
i appreciate that. but that was five years ago. i've changed.
"yes, you have."
maybe i'm not the perfect officer anymore.
maybe not. but you're a better man.
last call. there's a bowl of soup in storage and i left the replicator online.
thanks.
good night.
"oh, i was just closing up for the evening, but if you need anything?"
i'm here to see ensign kim.
"oh, good luck."
ensign.
hmm?
thank you.
for what?
you completed several of my astrometric scans this morning.
"you're welcome. i had some time between duty shifts. besides, it kept me occupied."
you are attempting to distract yourself from your emotional damage?
i wish i could say it was working.
the treatment to relieve your condition was available and yet you refused.
"i've got a disease, but i'm willing to live with the symptoms. doesn't make much sense, does it?"
"i assumed that romantic love was a human weakness, but clearly it can also be a source of strength. perhaps my analogy was flawed. love is not a disease. get well soon."
"are you sure this rice isn't supposed to be cooked? steamed, fried?"
"the idea is to shower the couple with a symbol of good fortune, not garnish them like a roast chicken. smile."
"rice, anyone?"
i'll take one.
red alert.
ready?
"this is it, tom. your bachelor days are over."
not a moment too soon.
second thoughts?
"second, third, fourth."
i never thought i'd see the day.
"given the volatile nature of their relationship, one might have predicted homicide rather than matrimony."
"when it comes to affairs of the human heart, it is wise to look beyond logic."
"we're gathered here today, not as starfleet officers, but as friends and family, to celebrate the marriage of two of voyager's finest. b'elanna has asked me to forego the rigours of klingon painsticks in favour of a more traditional ceremony."
they're saving the painsticks for the honeymoon.
"as captain, the honour of joining these two people has fallen to me. but before i declare them husband and wife, tom and b'elanna have prepared their own vows."
"i still don't know what i've done to deserve you, but whatever it is, i'll try to keep doing it. and i promise to stand by you, to honour you, till death do us part."
ensign?
hmm?
the ring.
oh.
may this ring be the symbol of our eternal love.
"you stood by me when most people would have run for the nearest airlock. you were willing to see past my shortcomings, and to take all the bumps and bruises that came along with it. you made me a better person, even though i put up one hell of a fight. i look forward to our journey together."
commander.
may this ring be the symbol of our eternal love.
"not so fast. lieutenant thomas eugene paris, lieutenant b'elanna torres. with the power vested in my by starfleet command and the united federation of planets, i now pronounce you husband and wife. now, tom.  bravo."
congratulations.
for what?
you may not want to know.
in this case the shortest path is a straight line. we'll pass right through the centre of the milky way.
and be in sector zero zero one within two years?
more or less.
you had seven double-check the calculations?
"two years, eleven days, six hours, provided we continue to operate at peak efficiency."
"naturally. of course, if we operate at peak efficiency, we'll be missing some interesting phenomena along the way. an anomalous gradient to the curvature of space, unusual bioharmonic readings from a binary system we'll reach about six months from now."
and the scientist in you can't resist stopping to take a look.
it would only add another two or three months. do you think the crew would mutiny?
on the contrary. everyone'll jump at the chance for some last-minute exploration.
"everyone, except seven."
let your first officer deal with the personnel problems.
"here's a lovely programme modelled after a mountain resort on the fifth moon of cytax. just you, b'elanna, and the crickets."
crickets?
cytaxian crickets. their song is reputed to be an auditory aphrodisiac.
"ah. well, between you and me, b'elanna and i don't need aphrodisiacs."
there's always the beaches of ahmedeen. windsurfing on a sea of liquid argon.
i was hoping for some place a little more down to earth.
"well, it's your honeymoon. just how down to earth did you mean?"
"earth. i was thinking chicago in the roaring twenties. speakeasies, flappers, the charleston."
if that's what you want.
is there a problem?
"no, of course not. it's just that we're so close to earth anyway, i thought you might want to try something a little more exotic."
"let me let you in on a little secret, neelix. earth has the best vacation spots in the galaxy. it's got the cultures, the climates, the history, the people. it has everything you ever want in a planet."
you sound like a travel brochure.
"no, no. just a native."
"oh, and make sure the deuterium manifolds are never opened wider than six hundred microns."
i am familiar with the specifications.
are you familiar with how temperamental the isolitic converter can be?
yes.
"most important, the enhanced warp drive. with the dilithium matrix running hot all the time now, you have to watch it like a hawk."
there is no point in providing me with knowledge i already possess.
"i guess i am being a little overcautious. i've just, er, never been away from engineering for more than a couple of days. certainly never a week."
my engineering abilities are more than sufficient. enjoy your honeymoon.
"you may understand the isodynamics of this engine, but i don't think you understand its personality."
personality? it is a propulsion device.
"that's my point. it's not just a device. it it has its own quirks, its own, its own moods"
that's just a minor fluctuation in a subsidiary injector port. i will take care of it.
i'm going with you.
"lieutenant, you are on leave."
not for another twenty minutes.
"so, who's the lucky guy? you caught the bouquet. that means you're next in line for the altar."
"yes, the doctor informed me of that archaic human superstition."
how about harry kim?
i fail to see the benefit of monogamous relationships.
so you want to stay single?
"if you mean remain open to social situations with a wide variety of individuals, then yes."
"i'm married. i'm not going into stasis for the rest of my life. no, i plan to have"
"i do not wish to be dependent on anyone. by marrying, one limits one's romantic interactions to a single individual, a circumstance which implies extreme monotony."
i'm glad we had this little talk.
try the manual release.
"i thought you said it was a minor fluctuation,"
this entire jefferies tube is losing molecular cohesion.
i guess the honeymoon's off.
it's our warp field. the enhanced drive is emitting some form of subspace radiation that's affecting voyager's infrastructure.
it's beginning to break down the molecular bonds in all surrounding sections.
"we're seeing early stages of the effect in the warp core. reaction chamber, injector ports, they're all showing signs of de-cohesion."
it doesn't make any sense. we knew about the subspace radiation and we ran dozens of simulations before we brought the new drive online.
have you tried taking the core offline?
it's not stopping the problem.
"try to isolate the cause of this, and stabilise the sections that have already been affected. dismissed."
"computer, begin chief engineer's log, supplemental. i've spent the last four hours analysing the warp field schematics, but i'm still no closer to finding out what's going wrong. computer, did it just get colder in here?"
negative.
raise the temperature by five degrees.
hungry?
"ah, can't join you tonight. dinner with b'elanna."
married one day and you're already domesticated.
"jealous? good night, harry."
"b'elanna? if we're going to live together we're going to have to compromise on the temperature. computer, reset environmental controls to standard. b'elanna!"
shush.
"bring her in, quickly. it looks like we've got an epidemic on our hands."
acute cellular degradation?
their chromosomes are breaking down at the molecular level.
proximity to the warp field?
"i believe so. b'elanna and my other three patients all work in engineering. they've been subjected to the heaviest exposure. but preliminary scans suggest the rest of the crew has been affected as well, including the captain. it's only a matter of time before you begin showing the same symptoms."
we've shut down the warp drive. the ship is still deteriorating and so are we. why?
every bulkhead and conduit from deck one to fifteen show signs of molecular de-cohesion.
even food from the replicator shows signs of decay.
"as soon as anything comes into contact with voyager's atmosphere, it's affected."
that's what we thought at first but take a look at this. these vegetables are completely free of decay.
i thought you said the replicators
"they weren't replicated. i harvested them on an away mission last week. the same goes for these particle accelerators, the trilithium ore samples, the keg of hazari ale. all of them were brought aboard over the last few months, and none of them is disintegrating."
"we haven't been able to narrow the time frame precisely, but it appears that anything brought on board over the past thirty to forty weeks is immune."
something happened to the ship months ago that's causing this decay.
a logical conclusion.
"eight months, seventeen days ago, first contact with the kmada."
they tried to sabotage our life-support systems with low-frequency theta radiation. any chance that could have caused the phenomenon?
unlikely.
let's keep looking.
"the next event of note took place nine months, two days ago when the n'kree tried to conscript voyager into their battle fleet."
and failed. next?
hey.
hey.
how's my old lady?
well enough to break your nose if you call me that again.
here it is.
what?
our honeymoon.
tell me.
"six days and seven nights in the historic graystone hotel in beautiful downtown chicago, circa 1928. wait till you see it. crystal chandeliers, wall to wall italian marble. we'll take a drive up michigan avenue in a vintage duesenberg, hobnob with the stars of the silver screen, dance the charleston at a genuine speakeasy called the green mill."
what do i wear?
that's already taken care of. our bags are packed and waiting for us at the hotel.
champagne?
"it's on ice, in a silver bucket right next to our canopy bed. b'elanna? doctor!"
cortical stimulator. initiate an iso-synaptic pulse. it's not working. again! increase the electrolytic levels to seventy five millijoules. we've lost her.
increasing electrolytic levels to ninety millijoules.
there's nothing more we can do.
maybe we can try a direct neural resequencing.
lieutenant.
we can't just let her die!
return to your quarters.
no! i don't want to leave her.
i understand. but i need to perform an analysis before her cells have completely degraded. please.
"nine months, twenty eight days. we collected silicate from a comet in the podaris sector."
"according to neelix's manifest, those samples are stored in the geology lab. they're showing no signs of molecular degradation. take us further back."
"ten months, eleven days ago. voyager was forced to land on a class y planetoid in the vaskan sector."
the demon class planet. one of our more interesting missions. we set down looking for deuterium and ended up helping a new form of life to be born.
the planet possessed a biomimetic compound.
the silver blood. it sampled our dna and created duplicates of the entire crew.
i've often wondered what happened to them. are they flourishing? have they continued to evolve?
do they still resemble us?
is she?
i'm afraid so.
"scan for traces of deuterium, hydrogen sulphate and dichromates."
dichromates?
just do it.
what's this about?
we have a disturbing theory.
i'm detecting all of those compounds.
i want you to inject her with a dichromate catalyst.
commander?
we've got to be sure.
i don't understand.
that wasn't b'elanna. it was a duplicate. a biomimetic copy.
copy?
we are all duplicates. none of us are real.
behold the primordial soup.
that's what created us?
not just us. the entire ship is composed of the same material.
"it's a biomimetic compound that duplicated the crew's molecular structure so precisely that i would never have detected it, if i hadn't known what to look for."
i was born on earth in indiana. i remember growing up there. i remember graduating from the academy. i have no memory of being a copy.
"apparently, the original kathryn janeway's memories were duplicated as well. somehow, after the real voyager left, we began to forget we were duplicates."
"eventually, we assumed their lives and set a course for earth."
and now the warp core is breaking down our cellular structure. we didn't think the radiation would hurt us because it isn't harmful to humanoids.
"each and every one of you will disintegrate just as b'elanna did. i'm not immune, either. the holo-emitters, like everything else, are copies. it's only a matter of time before my programme begins to degrade."
what can we do to stop the process?
there is one option. go back.
to the demon class planet?
we were created to survive there.
"he's correct. it's reasonable to assume that if we return to our native environment, the degradation will cease."
"even if we survived the trip, we'd be travelling thousands of light years in the wrong direction."
it may be the only way.
"duplicate or not, i'm still the same person i was yesterday and so are all of you, and that means we're going to do everything possible to complete our mission, which is to reach earth. is that clear?"
"yes, ma'am."
i want you to adjust the environmental controls to simulate a class y planet. that should slow the rate of degradation.
it's only a matter of time before the environmental controls themselves are affected.
"i realise that. that's why we're going to try and find a safe harbour till we can figure out a way to stop the degradation. scan for the nearest class y planet and set a course. in the meantime, i'll explain our situation to the crew."
"there's still a great deal we don't know about this phenomenon, and i have every confidence we'll find a way to reverse it."
"so you're saying all our experiences before we were duplicated, none of it's real?"
"i don't pretend to understand it myself, harry, but the way i choose to look at it is this. if everything about us was duplicated, that includes our memory engrams, the emotional centres of our brain. so if you feel something, remember something, believe something, i'm not about to tell you it's not real."
"but there is another crew out there, right? the real voyager."
"i suppose there is, but i don't want that thought to distract any of you from our mission."
what mission is that?
"the same as it's always been, tom. to reach the alpha quadrant safe and sound. but to do that we're going to have to beat this problem, and for now that means conserving energy, running the ship in grey mode, cutting crew shifts in half. the less you exert yourselves, the slower the cellular decay. duplicates or not, you're still my crew. dismissed."
tom.
there's no one here by that name.
"i just wanted to say, i'm sorry about b'elanna."
sorry? what for?
she was your wife.
"she was a duplicate, just like you are, harry."
"you heard the captain. if we're going to survive this, we've got to believe in ourselves."
"you can drop the good soldier routine. you don't have to do everything the captain says anymore. hell, she's not even the captain."
she is to me.
"okay. well, let's suppose she does get us back to earth. what then? you really think your family is going to welcome you with open arms?"
i don't know.
"for all you know the real harry kim is having sunday dinner with them right now. and you come strolling through the door, they're going to see you for exactly what you are. an impostor."
"so what are we going to do, huh? wait around till we all disintegrate?"
"come in. chicken paprikash. my grandmother's recipe. well, maybe not my grandmother, but it's still delicious. it's our weekly dinner together. don't tell me you forgot."
we've lost three more people. we've got to head back.
i've spent the past five years trying to get this crew home. i'm not about to quit now.
listen to yourself. you haven't even been alive for five years. home is a class y planet in the delta quadrant. we don't belong on earth.
"how do you know where we belong? for all we know, the real voyager's been destroyed and we're all that's left. for all we know, we're supposed to be living their lives."
"that's a pretty big assumption, and it's putting this crew in danger."
"there's only one thing i know how to be, chakotay, and that's kathryn janeway."
"i'd like to think i know kathryn janeway pretty well myself. and as much as she'd like to get her crew home, i don't think she'd be willing to kill them in the process."
maybe this dinner wasn't such a good idea after all.
"i've tried everything i could think of. biomolecular enhancers, gene splicing with replicated dna, and i'm no closer to finding a cure. but i do have an idea."
i'm listening.
"find the original voyager. if the real captain janeway were here, we could sample her dna and imprint it onto your mimetic pattern."
"but doctor, we have no way of knowing where they are. they could be behind us, ahead of us, back on earth, destroyed. besides, even if we could find the real janeway, how do we know she'd help?"
she's you. my emitter is starting to degrade.
you'd better get back to sickbay.
tuvok to the captain. sensors have detected a class y planet.
on my way.
"it may not be home, but it checks out. thermionic radiation, surface temperatures in excess of five hundred kelvins."
just what the doctor ordered. safe harbour?
there's no guarantee this is going to work.
"harry, vent all plasma from the nacelles, transfer available power to atmospheric thrusters and stand by to commence landing sequence."
"yes, ma'am."
red alert.
landing struts online. inertial dampers at maximum.
"take us down, mister paris."
"captain, a vessel is approaching from the planet surface."
on screen.
they're hailing.
open a channel.
you're in direct violation of the ord'mirit mining treaty. leave orbit or you'll be destroyed.
they are firing weapons.
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we are not your enemy.
they seem to disagree.
we're not interested in your mining operation. our ship is badly damaged. we need to set down on the surface to make repairs.
we repeat. leave or be destroyed.
shields down to fifty two percent.
"with our systems degrading, we won't be able to take this much longer."
target their weapons systems. fire.
"no effect. hull breaches on decks eleven, fourteen and fifteen."
the damaged sections are turning into biomimetic matter. containment fields are failing.
evacuate those decks.
"if we emit a polaron burst, we can disable their shields long enough to target their warp core."
"no, we're not going to destroy them over a misunderstanding."
either that or retreat.
"we're starfleet officers, we can't forget that. break orbit."
that planet may be our last chance for survival.
we'll have to find another option.
i'm not sure why we're still taking orders from you.
"lieutenant, follow orders or leave the bridge."
the alien vessel's not pursuing.
"begin scanning for other class y planets. harry, transmit a distress call on all subspace bands. if the real voyager is out there, i want to find them."
"in the meantime, which direction do you want me to go?"
"resume course for the alpha quadrant, mister paris."
i know what you're going to say and i don't want to hear it.
too bad.
"i'm willing to take a little insolence from tom, but i shouldn't have to remind you that i'm still the captain."
you're not. you're a biomimetic lifeform created in her image.
are you saying you're not taking orders from me anymore?
i'm saying you need to step back and look at our situation objectively.
you think i should have given the order to fire on that vessel.
"no, i agreed with your decision to stand down. but how long can we adhere to starfleet principles before we start making compromises?"
"as long as it takes. our ship may be deteriorating, but our humanity is intact."
belief alone won't hold this ship together.
it's gotten us this far.
"not far enough. tom and i aren't the only ones who question your decisions. now that the truth is known, a lot of people think we should turn around and head for the class y planet. they're starting to remember their existence before voyager."
"what, what existence? pools of biomimetic fluid? we didn't even experience sentience until voyager came along."
"what good is sentience if we're not alive to experience it? kathryn, we've got to go back."
i promised the crew i'd get them home.
home isn't earth.
"janeway to sickbay, medical emergency."
he's not responding. his neural pathways are destabilising.
"we've lost commander chakotay. duplicate or not, he was real to me and he was a fine starfleet officer. and he was a friend who wasn't afraid to let me know when i am wrong. mister kim, bring the enhanced warp drive online. turn voyager around. we're going home."
captain?
set a course for the demon planet.
the holographic projectors in sickbay went offline at oh three hundred. we've lost the doctor.
what's tom's condition?
no change.
"well, looks like we're in the market for a new medical officer. feel up to it, neelix?"
i've only been trained as a field medic.
it'll have to do.
what about my other duties?
make sickbay your priority. at this point morale is a luxury. how's the core holding up?
"the modified nanoprobes are still reinforcing the warp field. it should remain functioning until we reach the demon planet. however, there is less than a twenty percent probability that voyager will remain intact that long."
"well, it won't be the first time this crew has been up against"
captain?
"it's all right, i'm just a little tired."
let ensign kim take command for a little while.
i'm still the captain.
and i am the chief medical officer. don't force me to relieve you of your duties.
"your concerns have been noted, sir. now, there is another matter. i want to download the ship's database and our personal logs into a signal beacon. in the event we don't survive, there should be some record of our accomplishments."
a time capsule.
"this crew's existence may have been brief, but it's been distinguished. none of you deserves to be forgotten."
i will use unaffected components to construct a beacon.
the deflector's offline. interstellar dust is contaminating the warp field.
purge it.
i can't. the exhaust manifolds have disintegrated.
we've come too far to be stopped by dust. reroute auxiliary power to the deflector.
"warp field failure in eight, seven, six, five, four, three"
got it.
reinitialising the deflector. the warp field has stabilised.
"i may not be morale officer anymore, but i think this is a cause for celebration. what do you say, captain? captain?"
she's gone.
"acting captain's log, stardate 52597.4. our situation's getting worse every day. more than eighty percent of the ship is uninhabitable. most of the crew are gone. it seems less and less likely that the few of us left will reach our destination."
"computer, hull status."
hull integrity at forty five percent.
what was that?
cargo bay two has decompressed.
seal off that deck.
"computer, erect a level ten force field around the bridge."
unable to comply.
"seven, i need more power up here. the bulkheads are coming apart."
i'm transferring the last of our power reserves.
deck one force field is in place.
that's better. how's life support?
degrading.
we have approximately ten hours of air remaining.
what about the time capsule?
it's ready for launch.
do it.
the launch sequencer has misfired.
reset the
initiator. try it again.
it won't work. the launch mechanism is demolecularised.
salvage the probe.
it's too late. it's been destroyed.
"personal logs, mission logs, all our history, gone. now what?"
i'm detecting a vessel twenty two light years away.
"i see it. i'm trying to hail them. the subspace transceiver's malfunctioning. if they move out of range, they won't see us. we still have one active comm. circuit but we'll have to go to impulse to use it. seven, drop out of warp."
the engine controls are fused.
then unfuse them.
without an isolitic
"converter, i cannot comply."
dump the core.
"ensign, dropping out of warp at this velocity could"
tear the ship apart.
we're already falling apart. we're not going to make it
to the class y planet in one piece
which means that ship is our only hope. think about it. what would captain janeway have done?
"computer, prepare to eject the warp core. authorisation seven of nine, omega phi nine three."
warp ejection systems enabled.
eject the core.
we've lost attitude control and shields. hull integrity at nineteen percent.
"reroute life support! hell, reroute everything we've got left to the containment fields."
hull breaches on
"decks nine, ten and eleven."
"seven. seven! computer, how long until we're within hailing range of that ship?"
five minutes and thirty four seconds.
range?
five million kilometres.
try hailing again.
no response.
"captain, i've found the source of the distress call. it's coming from a vessel."
can you identify it?
"no, the readings are erratic. looks like they've taken heavy damage."
four hundred thousand kilometres.
"drop to impulse. are the rescue teams ready? bridge to sickbay, stand by for casualties."
in visual range.
on screen.
where's the ship?
no sign of it.
"that debris, that couldn't be all that's left."
"i'm detecting residual deuterium, anti-neutrons, traces of dichromates. if it was a vessel, it isn't any more."
"scan for lifesigns, escape pods."
none.
"make a note in the ship's record. we received a distress call at oh nine hundred hours. arrived at the vessel's last known  coordinates at twenty one twenty. the ship was destroyed. cause unknown. no survivors. mister paris, resume course."
"aye, sir."
no! make them stop!
anything?
nothing of relevance. his neural pathways are still fluctuating.
doc! can't you do something? look how much he's suffering.
if i sedate him we could lose any chance of making contact with the aliens.
get them out!
"commander, can you hear me? focus on the sound of my voice."
i can't understand them. they won't stop talking!
what are they saying?
"i don't know! make them stop, please!"
"janeway to sickbay. any progress, doctor?"
it's not going well.
our ambassador is still delusional.
we're running out of time.
"the graviton shear is buckling the hull. if we don't find a way out of chaotic space soon, we're going to die here,"
"chief medical officer's log, supplemental. despite my efforts, chakotay's condition continues to deteriorate."
doctor!
"yes, commander."
i'm tired. i want to sleep.
"if you lose consciousness, it could sever your link with the aliens."
aliens?
the ones who live in this place. we're trapped here. they may know a way out. it's urgent that you speak with them.
but i don't understand what they're saying.
i can try to help you understand.
i'm going to end up like my grandfather. a crazy old man.
"no, you're not crazy. i believe the aliens are reconfiguring your neural pathways so they can communicate with you. do you remember the day you were injured on the holodeck?"
in the boxing simulation?
"yes. you were knocked down, remember?"
i was injured. i came to see you. we had an argument.
that's right. try to remember more about the holodeck.
"i was sparring with a terrellian, and boothby was there. he used to train me when i was a cadet."
keep going. what round was it?
three. round three. the fight was going badly. i was avoiding my opponent.
"stay away from the ropes, son. that's it, that's it."
end of round three.
that wasn't so bad.
it was terrible.
am i missing something? he barely landed a glove on me.
"give him time. you're not reading him. you think he's slow and stupid. i know better. in fact, i know his kind in my bones. literally. i can count the fractures, if you'd like."
he's not landing any punches.
that's the problem. you're not letting him.
have i got this sport all wrong?
boxing is more about taking the shots than dishing them out. you shouldn't be dancing away from this fellow. let him punch himself out a little. it all comes down to the heart. do you have the heart for this? that's the contest. it's not against him. it's against your own natural human desire not to get hurt. that's the real fight.
begin round four.
"go. go, go, go."
"stay with him. too close. come on, come on, break it up. atta boy. keep him busy."
gloves up!
how many?
three.
good guess. i've got a good mind to use a needle and thread. add a little authenticity to your fun.
be my guest
"you'd like that. a manly scar above your eye. chakotay, the maquis mauler. pointless violence. that programme shouldn't even be in our database."
"there's nothing like a good fight, doctor. i was there when pryce-jones went twenty three rounds with gul tulet. the knockout in the neutral zone. best match i ever saw."
"really? most blood spilled, or did pryce-jones drive gul tulet's nasal bone up into his brain?"
you've got the wrong idea.
the idea is simple enough. do enough damage to your opponent to render him unconscious. how's the headache?
it hurts.
oedema beneath the anterior fossa of the cranium. hairline fracture of the septum.
i saw something strange.
i'll bet you did.
"no, before i got hit."
what do you mean?
"i looked over at boothby. he yelled at me. i turned back, then the ring got distorted."
an hallucination. you probably had some pressure building up along the optic nerves from a previous blow.
"no, i was keeping away from him the whole fight. he never touched me."
"hmm. a number of the ganglia in your visual cortex are hyperactive. your opponent wasn't firing on you with an energy weapon, was he?"
just his gloves.
chakotay to the bridge.
on my way.
"i want you back in here for some tests, unless you want to be seeing things on a regular basis."
it's changed course again. twenty thousand kilometres off starboard.
ion storm?
"not exactly. it's two light years across, emits enough energy for a dozen stars, it doesn't match any phenomenon in our database, and it won't sit still."
"okay, eleven thousand kilometres off the port bow."
we are too close.
i'm backing us off.
the phenomenon has been shifting positions every few minutes.
nothing so massive could move that fast.
full reverse. maximum shields.
full stop. anybody want to tell me where we are?
we appear to be inside the disturbance.
"i'm picking up a lot of raw data. subspace flux, graviton waves. sensors must be confused. the readings are shifting around so much i can't make heads or tails of what's out there."
"captain, this is seven of nine. please report to astrometrics at once."
the borg have been aware of this phenomenon for many years. it is a zone where the law of physics are in a state of flux. chaotic space.
why didn't sensors warn us in time?
chaotic space appears randomly and unexpectedly. the borg have observed it throughout the galaxy.
then why hasn't a federation starship encountered anything like this?
no doubt some have.
think of all the starfleet vessels that disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
"borg vessels are more advanced, but only one cube has survived an encounter with chaotic space."
those aren't good odds.
"if the physical constants are shifting, our sensors can't function."
"the problem is here. changes in the gravitational coefficient will cause sudden shear forces against our hull. shields will protect us, but only for a time."
how much time?
unknown.
"we've got to recalibrate the sensors, redesign them if necessary, otherwise we're flying blind. let's get to work."
begin round one.
"computer, did you say something?"
negative.
"pick them up, son. it's the fight you've been waiting for."
begin round one.
bridge to commander chakotay.
"go ahead, tuvok."
please report to the bridge.
on my way.
graviton wave displacement says we're moving at warp six. subspace sensors show we're standing still.
"we can't be that far from where we entered. maybe we should just set a course, go to impulse and see what happens."
what would most likely happen is a collision with an asteroid field or a star.
that'd be better than just sitting here waiting for.
report.
torsional shear has increased by two hundred percent.
shields?
holding.
like i was saying. better than just sitting here waiting for our hull to breach.
perhaps we could drop a series of beacons to help us navigate.
now that's an idea.
did you hear something?
i heard nothing unusual.
i didn't hear anything.
begin round one.
"i'll plot a course. we'll take it slow. what do you think, chakotay?"
"the challenger, chakotay!"
don't you hear that?
hear what?
look.
commander. are you all right?
"put on the gloves, son."
i'm not ready.
commander.
"in this corner, wearing the red trunks."
begin round one.
bridge to sickbay. we've got a medical emergency.
laaaa. laaaa. lets go to eight hundred eighty hertz. laaaa.
music lessons?
pretty soon we'll be singing duets.
i'm checking to see if there's been any damage to the auditory nerves. nothing so far. his vision checks out as well. i'm afraid the source of the trouble may be a little deeper.
the family curse.
what do you mean?
chakotay has the genetic marker for a cognitive disorder. sensory tremens. the primary symptoms are visual and auditory hallucinations.
"my family doctor suppressed the gene before i was even born, so i never had to go through what the others did, like my grandfather."
"for some reason, the gene's been switched on. i'm not saying for certain that's why chakotay thought he was getting ready for a prize-fight, but it's a good bet. the holodeck boxing simulation was fresh in his memory. a few misfiring neurons did the rest."
"this chaotic space we've entered, could it be stimulating the gene?"
"possibly. the only way to make certain would be to get the ship out of here. in the meantime, the commander will have to stay in sickbay."
tuvok tells me you've got a mean left jab.
never spar with a vulcan.
how are you doing?
"i'm all right. when i was a boy, my grandfather started seeing things nobody else could see, hearing what nobody else could hear. he refused treatment. a couple of hyposprays a day, that's all he would have needed, but he was stubborn. he said his spirit was in pain, but that the wound must be honoured. crazy old man."
"ready, captain."
janeway to seven. bring the grid back online.
stand by.
"we've got sensors. scanning to one hundred thousand kilometres, seven hundred thousand."
sensors are stable to one million kilometres. we won't be able to scan any further.
are you picking up anything at that range?
"no planets, no asteroid fields, no sink holes."
good enough for me.
"set a course dead ahead, one quarter impulse. sensor status?"
continuing to function.
still nothing ahead.
"good. let's increase our speed. mister paris, go to half impulse."
wait! it's a ship.
warp capable. it's adrift and the outer hull is damaged.
no lifesigns.
let's take a closer look.
"computer, let's hear that again."
"why won't you answer? did you give up on me for being so late? it's not my fault. we got lost in here. why do the stars make such a noise? let me sleep! i don't understand them, i don't want to talk to them. i just want to go home."
that was the final distress call.
"according to the vessel's medical records, the captain and one of his engineers started hallucinating after they entered this space. the physician on board never found a way to treat them."
how long were they stranded here?
almost a year. eventually their systems were compromised.
they died of exposure.
"the sensors in that ship are more advanced than ours, and they couldn't find a way out."
let's hold our position until we get a better idea of what we're up against.
it looks like that's what they did.
"along the way, a couple of them started sounding just like chakotay."
i can't believe that's a coincidence.
then why hasn't anyone else been affected?
that's a question i can't answer. not yet. request permission to beam their captain's body on board. i'd like to perform an autopsy.
granted. pull the sensor technology off that ship. use it to enhance ours. we're going to need all the help we can get.
"i made a deep scan of the alien's brain tissue and sensory organs. the optic and auditory neurons have been partially stripped of their normal protein insulation. the result, auditory and visual hallucinations."
"the same symptoms as chakotay, but a different cause."
exactly. in this case the gene responsible for producing protein insulation was shut down.
by what?
"there might be something in chaotic space that reacts with dna, alters it. but why it targeted him specifically and now you i can't say."
is there a treatment?
"i can control the hallucinations using a neural suppressant, but unless i can find a way to deactivate that gene of yours"
i need to go on a vision quest. captain?
that's not the best idea right now. a vision quest taps directly into your frontal cortex. it could agitate your mind.
or help me control it.
permission granted.
very well. i will ask you to wear a cortical monitor. it'll help me keep track of your vital signs.
"a-koo-chee-moya. i am far from the sacred places of my grandfathers, i am far from the bones of my people. but perhaps there is a powerful being who will embrace me and give me the answers i seek."
grandfather! what are you doing here?
"i, er seem to be lost. just a little lost."
you didn't take your medicine this morning.
which medicine are you talking about? there are many medicines.
the one the hospital gave us.
"oh, that one."
where are you going?
my spirit doesn't want that medicine.
i don't care what your spirit wants. you're going to take it.
i don't think so.
come with me back to the house.
now why would i want to do that? it's better where i'm going. it's more interesting.
where are you going?
to the place where my spirit lives.
grandfather! where are you? answer me!
begin round one.
begin round one.
"the aliens. they were there, watching me."
inside your vision quest?
they were trying to tell me something.
what was it?
i don't know.
are they with you now? can you hear them?
yes.
let them speak to you.
no! they'll make me go crazy.
you're not going crazy. they're doing this for a reason. you've got to trust them. stop fighting. open your mind. let go. listen.
chaotic space intersects ours at the eighteenth dimensional gradient. voyager entered through a trimetric fracture.
trimetric fracture?
"we must escape, or we'll be destroyed."
how do we escape?
we've got to alter our warp field.
in what way?
rentrillic projectory.
rentrillic?
it doesn't make any sense. i can't understand it. i'm scared i'm losing my mind.
try to focus!
it's too much! i can't! it's too much!
chakotay!
get them out!
first contact?
"it was brief, but he definitely communicated with them."
rentrillic trajectory.
"unfortunately, they never got around to explaining what that meant."
"could be some sort of alien geometry, but we'll need much more. is it safe for him to try to make contact again?"
"medically speaking, yes. the problem is convincing the commander of that."
"i realise you're frightened, but you're our only hope out of this place. you think this could risk your sanity, but your sanity won't do you any good if we remain in chaotic space. i need you to keep trying, chakotay. will you keep trying?  keep me posted."
"are you ready to continue? try to focus on the alien voices, tell me what they're saying."
i can't hear them.
are you sure? listen carefully. maybe we can return you to a more receptive frame of mind. think back to when you first heard them in the vision quest. what were you doing? where were you?
in their boxing ring. a strange ring.
was anyone else there?
"yes. my opponent, kid chaos."
describe him.
"tuvok, move into position."
"thompson and sharr, target the midsection. ensign macalister, you and i will aim for the head."
set your phasers to kill.
"not exactly the marquis of queensberry rules, now, is it? set to kill? that's not even starfleet! put down the weapons, son."
"tactical advice from an academy groundskeeper? we fire at your command, sir."
"give that order and you'll be out for the count, the whole lot of you."
lower your weapons.
commander.
"i said, stand down."
"we've just heard from vegas, mars and orion three. the odds are running thirty three to one that he'll outpoint you. eleven to one that you'll be k-o'ed by the fifth. subspace radio is calling it the disaster in the delta. we can still scratch the card. i'll call the doctor. we'll get you out on a medical."
he's trying to hornswoggle us. double check those calculations.
let me see that padd.
"no. fine, don't want to trust your friends? you're on your own."
"i'm filing a grievance with the delta quadrant boxing commission. this bout came out of nowhere. there's some scheduling mix-up. you haven't had the time to train, you're not ready. if you fight now, you'll be destroyed!"
i can't fight now. i'm not ready for this! i can't stay here!
"i follow your example, learn from you, look up to you. i don't want to lose that."
you'll find another role model. you'll be okay.
"you're my first officer. your duty is to this crew. if something happens to me, you've got to get voyager home."
tuvok can take command.
"you're being selfish, chakotay."
"i'm doing this for you, for all of you!"
"a delusion. dementia puglistica. you're punch-drunk, commander."
"a hard shot to the head and neck collapses the carotid artery and cuts the flow of blood to the brain. the hook. the head and neck twist laterally, traumatising the cerebral tissue. and who can forget the upper cut? the head snaps back, rupturing tissue in the cerebellum and upper spinal cord. yes! and the result of all this poetry in motion? neurologic dysfunction, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, loss of balance and coordination, loss of memory. starting to sound familiar?"
"chakotay's fine. he just needs a little conditioning, that's all."
he needs to listen to his doctor and not to his fantasies. step into that arena and you'll become what you most fear.
what are you talking about?
"he knows what i mean, don't you, chakotay? hmm?"
what's wrong?
"victory. defeat. knockout. tko. it's all beside the point. we know how it really ends. a crazy old man. it's your fate, your destiny. there's no escape."
you just got to do your best. you can't let yourself give into your fears.
i'm not afraid.
who said you were?
"i'm sorry! please, come back!"
they got away.
"grandfather, where did you go?"
"some people were shouting at me. they were going for a walk. they wanted me to come along. it's hard to follow them. oh, god, they go to strange places."
i'm supposed to be watching you. we're going to get in trouble if we don't go back home.
be a good boy and go. we understand.
you have to come with me.
they say you can come with us.
there's nobody else here.
they say you're just like we are.
i'm not! i'm not like you!
"it's not so bad. when you get used to it, they're not so bad. they're just a lot of talk. sometimes i wish they were more quiet, but they like to talk."
come home.
"oh, i'm too tired. this is a nice place. a nice place to call home."
begin round one.
did you hear that?
no.
"yes, you did. there's a lot of them this time."
tell them to go away!
go away! they've got other ideas.
i have to go home.
"they, they're coming for you."
"the challenger, chakotay!"
better late than never. they almost scrubbed the bout.
i'm afraid.
i know you are. you'd be a liar if you said anything else.
but i've always been afraid.
i know that too.
"the champion, kid chaos!"
"that's it! all over! the fight's been cancelled on medical grounds. put them down, let's go. i hear there's some bear-baiting at the arena next door. have fun."
he's coming out of it.
you stopped the fight.
you were stuck in the vision quest.
i've got to go back.
you're going nowhere but sickbay.
let me go.
calm down. it's over for you.
"no, let me get in the ring."
chakotay.
let me back in the ring. let me

launch another beacon.
beacon launched.
i'm reading a shift of point zero zero three in the graviton shear.
status.
shields holding.
speed is steady at one quarter impulse.
"maintain course and heading, mister paris."
sensors are functioning. our course is still clear.
"captain, i recommend we go to three quarters impulse."
increasing power to the engines could affect chaotic space. there are too many unknowns.
"at this speed we should see daylight in about two months. the longer we're in chaotic space, the longer we're exposed to these unknowns."
"his logic is undeniable, captain. we should increase our speed."
finally.
who am i to dispute logic?
take a look at this.
it's the first beacon we launched three hours ago.
we've been going in circles?
"to be precise, one large circle."
hold our position.
all stop.
report.
i've applied ten thousand fifty three algorithms to the energy signatures produced by chaotic space. there is a pattern.
order to chaos?
observe. an isolinear frequency.
some kind of signal?
i haven't located the source. it may be natural. a star orquasar that's managed to survive in chaotic space.
but it could be a transmission.
possibly.
have you tried the standard language decryptions?
"all of them, with no success."
success seems to be in short supply lately. oh! impossible.
captain?
and to think that kept me from getting an a.
it was the only question i missed in exogenetics my senior year.
the nucleotide resonance frequency.
that signal was designed to activate dna.
it realigned his molecular bonds.
now do you believe me? they're the ones who scheduled the fight. they're promoting it. they're putting up the purse.
his sensory cortex is hyperactive. he's still hallucinating.
"it's not an hallucination, not a vision quest. it's a prize-fight!"
"chakotay, do you know me? do you know where you are?"
"i know you, captain. but you stopped the fight. you ruined my career. nobody will put me on the card after this!"
"it's better for you to rest, chakotay, until we can figure out why this is happening to you."
they want to contact me.
who does?
the people who live here.
this will sedate him.
"wait a minute. you believe somebody lives here, in chaotic space, and they're trying to communicate with you?"
yes. i saw him.
tell me about him. what does he look like?
"he's got a couple of kilos on me, a few centimetres in height, but i can take him, captain. i just have to stay off the ropes."
"the holodeck boxing simulation is still strong in his memory. obviously, it's the primary source of imagery for his hallucinations."
"what if those hallucinations are being induced for a purpose? aliens who exist on some perceptual wavelength that our senses can't detect, and the only way for them to communicate with us is to alter our senses. chakotay's bad gene gave them the opportunity."
what are you proposing?
"remember the derelict ship? two of their crewmembers claimed they were seeing things. was somebody trying to communicate with them? was somebody trying to warn them, help them?"
"or trying to destroy them, just as they're trying to destroy us."
why go through all the trouble? we're trapped here anyway.
let me back in the ring.
even if this is some kind of alien communication it could harm him. permanently.
bridge to captain janeway.
"go ahead, tuvok."
graviton shear has increased again. hull pressure is rising.
i'm on my way.
captain. when have we ever turned away from a first contact?
send him back in the ring.
report.
some kind of spatial sinkhole just opened up beneath us.
full thrusters. status?
we managed to side-step that one but graviton shear has increased by another three hundred and ten percent.
janeway to sickbay.
sickbay here.
it's now or never.
"understood, captain."
i've got to get in there. they're about to ring the bell.
i'm going to subject you to a field that will enhance the nucleotide bonds. the gene should become fully activated. do you understand?
i understand.
find us a way out of here.
i'll try.
good idea. keep him waiting. let him sweat it out.
"in this corner, representing the alpha quadrant, earth and humanity. the challenger, chakotay!"
everybody loves an underdog.
"and on this corner, champion of the delta quadrant, kid chaos!"
looks like he's got a lot of upper body strength. a real puncher.
"just keep your elbow low when you throw the right, and don't come in too straight. you'll be okay."
where's the scouting report? we don't know anything about this guy. i don't know who i'm up against!
"you're up against yourself, that's all you've got to remember. and don't raise the elbow."
begin round one.
"boothby, where are you?"
"still here, son. i'm not going anywhere."
you
are

do you understand?
yes. we are far from home. we are lost.

we are too

"maybe we're the ones who are too alien, too strange."

you
stay

realigned.
how can i?
your mind
must be
realigned. realigned. realigned. your mind
must be.
realigned.
i understand.
end round one.
get them out!
"let go, commander."
i can't take any more punches!
they aren't hitting you!
"duck, feint, clinch."
stop fighting!
i can't. they'll destroy me.
that's a risk you'll have to take.
you take the damn risk.
they want you.
why?
because you have the gene.
the crazy gene.
"yes, the crazy gene. the aliens are trying to speak to you, and the only thing keeping you from understanding them is your own fear. your fear of losing control, your fear of the unknown."
the unknown. and i don't want to know.
"but we have to know, or we're all going to die. allow yourself to hear them for just a few moments. do it for us."
what will happen to me when they're done?
"you'll be on voyager, surrounded by friends."
i can't understand them.
you will.
they're talking too fast. too many words.
try to focus on one word at a time.
too many words.
don't stop.
i'm scared. i don't want to die.
they won't hurt you. no one will hurt you.
eighteenth gradient. trimetric fracture.
keep going.
we have to modify our deflector. we have to induce a paralateral rentrillic trajectory.
how do we do that?
i think i understand. it's making sense.
where are you going?
i can make the adjustments myself. i have to get to the bridge. i don't know how much longer i can keep it in my mind.
commander.
what happened?
"he's got a right uppercut almost knocked me out. move over, harry."
"hang on, ensign."
they showed me how to get out.
he's hallucinating.
out of the way.
tell us what to do.
i can't! it's too difficult to explain
i'm locking him out.
no. give up your post.
he's recalibrating the deflector dish and routing it through the sensor array.
it must be altered.
"captain, the graviton shear is increasing."
i'm reading microfractures on the hull.
stay and we'll be destroyed. activate the deflector. maximum amplitude. bring sensors online.
captain.
do it.
"i don't know how, but the sensors have found us a course."
"maximum impulse, now!"
"captain, if that course is wrong, we could breach our hull."
engage.
we've re-entered normal space.
"mister paris, resume a course to the alpha quadrant."
"aye, sir."
"when i said you should take the next day or two off, i thought you'd want to stay in your quarters with a good book."
boxing helps me unwind.
"well in that case, report for duty first thing in the morning."
"see you then. computer, run chakotay training programme fifteen beta."
"ah, come for a little more punishment?"
i thought i'd spar for a few rounds.
after that last bout? did you talk to the doc?
i've got a clean bill of health.
"that's good enough for me. okay. i've been watching him fight. he falls in too much when he clinches, and he moves more to his right than he does to his left."
i'll double up on the left jabs and see what happens.
you sure you're ready for this?
i'm ready.
okay.
begin round one.
hello? hello? i'm here! hello?
i'm here to see mister kurros. could you?
could you tell me where to find mister kurros?
wait!
do not mind bevvox. he can be grouchy in the morning. welcome aboard.
thank you.
you seem tense.
no.
"this is a time for celebration. the geostability of your world has been restored, your people saved. and all because you had the wisdom to accept our help."
you accomplished in days what our scientists failed to achieve in decades.
that it not to say it was not a challenge. finding the precise harmonic for a planetary containment field did put my colleague here to the test.
"but in the end, she prevailed."
we owe you our lives.
solving problems is what we do. and seeing the look of gratitude in your eyes is almost reward enough. almost.
i have some bad news. our bernicium mines were destroyed in the last series of quakes. the ore's buried under sixty gigatons of rock. we can't get to it. we hoped you'd accept this instead. a rubidium geode. priceless. the only one ever found on our planet.
"it is rare, but hardly unique. and it is not what we agreed upon."
"i'm sorry, this is all we can offer you."
"you are lying. the mines collapsed, but before they did you transferred the ore to a shielded storage facility. needless to say, we detected it."
"please, we need the ore to repair our replicator systems. without it, we'll be unable to feed our people."
"get it to us now, or i will deactivate the containment field. have you ever experienced a level twelve seismic event? most violent. quite unnerving."
"no! i'll have the ore transported at once. this, this was all a misunderstanding."
"of course. it is already forgotten, my friend. perhaps we will do business again someday."
yes.
show our friend back to his shuttle. i would hate for him to get lost in such an unfamiliar place.
oh! pardon me.
yes?
"captain, long range scans have detected."
one second. i've wasted two hours on this thing and i'm no closer to solving it.
you can thank ensign paris for introducing the artefact to the ship.
"he was behind the last ship wide craze, too. yo-yos. now it's sheer lunacy. another hour and i'll go insane."
the solution is quite simple. if you align
"no, i want to figure this out myself."
you said something about long range scans?
they've revealed a planetoid with high concentrations of dilithium crystals.
let's take a look.
got it! false alarm.
"keep at it, harry."
we're within visual range.
on screen.
initial scans reveal substantial dilithium deposits beneath the planetoid's crust.
full sensor sweep.
"the deposits are in the upper mantle, about sixty kilometres down."
we'll have to use phasers to cut through the
hold on.
what is it?
"some kind of resonance wave emanating from the core. it's building fast, captain."
"right after we ran our scans? that can't be a coincidence. back us off, tom."
the planetoid is destabilising.
shields.
report.
we're trapped in a cloud of metreon gas. it's collapsed our warp field and knocked the impulse engines offline.
a heavily armed vessel just dropped out of warp off the port bow.
"captain, i recognise it. it's hazari. species four two two eight. technologically advanced, extremely violent. they make excellent tactical drones."
what do they want with us?
the hazari are hired to capture and deliver alien vessels.
bounty hunters.
yes.
so who hired them?
"the malon, the devore? we've made our share of enemies here."
they're hailing.
surrender. no one need be hurt. my client would prefer your vessel intact.
who hired you?
that's not your concern.
i'm only asking because i'm curious how much they're paying? maybe we can do better.
doubtful.
we're far from defenceless. why don't you save yourself some trouble.
it's no trouble.
charge phaser banks to full power.
fire and you'll ignite the gas cloud. you'll be destroyed.
you've left me no choice. i suggest you back off if you want to save your own ship. end transmission.
they are moving closer. they've locked on a tractor beam.
"looks like they're calling your bluff, captain. it was a bluff, wasn't it?"
"seven, do we still have warp power?"
"yes, but it's useless while we remain in the gas cloud."
maybe not. reroute every spare gigawatt to the shields. prepare to fire phasers.
our target?
the gas cloud.
do you believe the impact will throw us clear?
if our shields hold.
that's a big if.
go to warp one on my command. fire.
shields are holding. we're approaching the perimeter of the gas cloud.
we're out.
warp speed.
no sign of pursuit.
they weren't that heavily damaged. why aren't they following us?
there's the reason they didn't come after us. they've got reinforcements throughout the sector.
twenty three ships.
and long range scans show more on the way.
must be one hell of a reward.
"the size of the bounty is immaterial. according to seven of nine, the hazari pride themselves on honouring their agreements."
great. bounty hunters with a work ethic.
"there's got to be a way out, something they haven't anticipated. download the data for the captain. she wants to see what she can come up with on her own."
should i have the doctor prepare a hypospray?
excuse me?
so you can absorb the caffeine more directly. save time.
point well taken. i'll make this my last cup.
how about trying a sounding board?
"oh, you don't want that job."
try me.
"it's these hazari. they're like jackals, circling, feinting to draw us out while they cut off every route of escape."
you make them sound worse than the borg.
"at least the borg come straight at you. the hazari wait, invite you to make mistakes. they've anticipated almost every move we can make, and the few things they seem to have missed, i'm convinced are traps. you still glad you volunteered?"
we've faced tough odds before. you'll get us through. goodnight.
goodnight.
"there is nothing like a good problem to spark the synapses, is there? to open the mind to new possibilities, new ways of seeing things. of course, one must always confront self- doubt and fear, but that is a small price to pay for the exhilaration of finding the perfect solution."
who are you and what do you want?
"you have a problem, captain. i am the solution."
security to the mess hall. intruder alert
"i've deactivated your communications device, captain, but do not worry. i am not an intruder. in fact, i am not really here."
a hologram.
nothing so crude. an isomorphic projection.
you actually enjoy this?
it's an acquired taste.
it bears a resemblance to an alkian confection we acquired several years ago.
we?
"i am a member of a small group. explorers, like you. but we seek out challenges, problems to be solved. technological, biological, social, even artistic."
a think tank.
i like that. it's very apt. our think tank is nearby. a modest vessel. i have come to offer our help with your hazari paradox.
paradox?
"that is right. is it an escape route or is it a trap? do they know that you know that they know? it is the best kind of puzzle. pure tactics, psychology."
something tells me your help comes with a price tag.
"whatever your culture has to offer that is unique. technology perhaps, or maybe something you would not even think to value. i would need a closer look at your database."
"and how do i know you aren't an hazari trap? maybe they're trying to lure us into an ambush, like before."
"you are wise to be suspicious, captain. we have done some preliminary analysis on their manoeuvres. it does suggest some more likely ambushes. i've downloaded the data onto your computer."
all right. you've got my attention. but i want to meet you face to face. and the rest of your crew.
"naturally. our coordinates are in here, too. but we have our own security concerns, captain. please, bring only one crewman and no scanning equipment."
fair enough.
then i look forward to meeting you in person.
we're approaching the coordinates.
full stop.
looks like there's nothing here.
maybe they're cloaked.
i'm reading a subspace flux.
the vessel's hull is composed of a neutronium-based alloy.
"starfleet's theorised about such materials, but we've never come close to producing them."
neither have the borg. the think tank's technology is advanced.
"well, you and i will have the chance to evaluate it first hand. mister kim, you have the transport coordinates."
the universal translator must be inoperative.
or his speech patterns are too complex to process.
they must be studying it.
"actually, she is studying you. our resident expert on temporal physics. perhaps the most gifted member of our group. she finds you interesting."
how do you communicate?
"one of my most gifted crewmen, seven of nine."
"bionetic implants, neural transceivers? a borg? i've never seen one outside the collective."
i am an individual now. you may address your comments to me.
"forgive me. i am kurros, and this is fennim. in answer to your earlier question, this device allows the members of our group to communicate telepathically."
impressive.
it sounds as if another member of our crew is anxious to meet you.
a bioplasmic lifeform.
his name is bevvox. he prefers a variable gravity environment.
what's his specialty?
"at the moment exo-sociology and quantum mechanics, but his interests vary from time to time. bevvox founded our group more than one hundred years ago, after wandering the galaxy on his own for a few millennia."
how old is this creature?
"if you please, that is a sensitive topic with him. and there is one other individual who rounds out our group."
an artificial intelligence.
"the mind of mathematician and the soul of an artist. i'm afraid he'd much rather be modelling a fractal sculpture than analysing the data of our latest astronomical scan. and now you have met us all. a small group of minds, but we have helped hundreds of clients. we turned the tide in the war between the bara plenum and the motali empire. re-ignited the red giants of the zai cluster. just recently, we found a cure for the vidiian phage."
the vidiians?
"you would hardly recognise them now. just last month we helped retrieve a lyridian child's runaway pet. a subspace mesomorph, i might add. we had to invent a whole new scanning technology just to find it."
and what did you ask for as compensation?
"one of their transgalactic star charts. the best map of the known galaxy ever created. when we helped the citizens of rivos five resist the borg, all we asked for was the recipe for their famous zoth-nut soup. care for a taste?"
"another time, perhaps."
"tell me, is there any job you won't do?"
what do you mean?
"well, we have a non-interference protocol, our prime directive. i'm curious where you draw the line."
"as you know, there is no shortage of conflict in what you call the delta quadrant. many of our clients are at war. to be frank, we will assist in the neutralisation of fleets, starbases, even planets. but we will not participate in the decimation of an entire species, nor will we design weapons of mass destruction. my colleague here wishes to speak to seven of nine about her bionetic technology. may he interface with you?"
i am in direct telepathic communication with this individual. it is requesting information about integrating organic components into its technology.
feel free to give him some pointers.
you're welcome.
"to business, captain. i believe we can solve the hazari paradox without firing a single weapon."
that's just what i'm looking for.
then there is only the matter of payment.
voyager's schematics and an overview of its database. specify what you want and i'll see what i can do. i recommend the replicators. they're very popular this year.
i'll contact you with our requests.
i take it first contact was a success?
"i have some qualms about their morality, but i believe they can help us."
it was an interesting experience.
"glad to hear it. we don't have much good news of our own. every escape route we've considered is clearly a trap, and more hazari ships keep joining the search."
then we have no choice. we'll put our own plans on hold and see what the think tank comes up with.
come in.
you have a visitor. mister kurros has returned in isomorphic form.
send him in. welcome back.
"captain, we have compiled a short list of items we would like. it was not easy. voyager has a great deal to offer."
quantum slipstream technology. i should warn you. we never got that to work reliably.
"it is still intriguing, theoretically."
neelix's recipe for chadre'kab?
yes.
an ancient olmec figurine. i guess commander chakotay can be persuaded to part with it.
i am pleased to hear that.
you can't be serious.
"i realise the next item may seem unorthodox, but i believe it can be beneficial to both of us."
you never mentioned anything about bartering my crew members.
she will have an extraordinary opportunity to explore the galaxy as one of us.
i'm afraid the answer is no.
"i understand your feelings, captain, but have you thought to ask seven of nine herself?"
a curious proposition.
to say the least.
how do you wish to proceed?
i want your opinion.
"they are offering us the assistance we require, i am the payment they require. the solution is obvious."
"this isn't a puzzle, seven. there is no solution. what's at issue here is your future."
the issue is voyager's survival.
"sit. please. while i still question this think tank's way of doing things, there is a genuine opportunity for exploration. it could be the chance of a lifetime."
you're saying i should go?
"i don't want you to go, but it's not my right to tell you what to do. until now, i've kept a close eye on your progress, helped you with decisions but, i think you've learned enough as an individual to make this decision yourself. would you like to join them?"
i am intrigued. they are an unusual collective with a compelling mission. but i require more data.
that's why i want you to talk to kurros yourself. see if he can answer your questions.
"captain, i appreciate your giving me this choice."
"you've earned it. and remember, if you do choose to go, make sure it's what you want, not what you think is best for voyager. we're getting out of this, with or without the think tank's help."
why me?
"i admire your humility. the collective knowledge of the borg contained within a single mind. when we factor in your innate intelligence and the enhancements afforded you by your bionetic implants, we concluded you are an ideal candidate. the first we have recruited in seventeen years."
when did you arrive at this assessment?
during your interview.
my dialogue with the artificial intelligence.
it was the most efficient way to evaluate your abilities. i am sure you can appreciate that.
how much do you know about me?
enough to know that you are tapping into only a fraction of your potential as a member of voyager's crew. you were adjusting the deflector array to improve shield harmonics. do you find such duties challenging?
no.
"without problems that test the limits of your abilities, you cannot expand them. perfection will always be beyond your reach. seven, you could become one of the greatest intellects in the galaxy, but that will not happen here among these limited lifeforms."
"the crew of voyager has accepted me, integrated me into their collective."
"they are your family. it was hard for me to leave my family, too. and i was only a child. not much older than you when you were first assimilated."
why did you leave?
to help them and my world solve a cataclysmic problem.
the think tank requested you as payment.
"i did not realise it at first. i was too young. but they gave me a remarkable opportunity, and now i am offering the same to you."
"your group can assist many collectives, and yet you often use that ability as a means of coercion to obtain what you want. how many have suffered because they were unwilling to agree to your conditions?"
"we have a singular mission, to perfect our knowledge. perfection sometimes necessitates selfishness. it is your life. not voyager's, not captain janeway's or anyone else's. it is up to you to achieve the goals you have set for yourself."
"i agree, but i can do that here."
"please, take more time to think about this. we will remain nearby in case you change your mind."
i doubt that will happen.
"seven of nine, report to the bridge."
acknowledged.
may i accompany you?
as you wish.
"do you have a problem, captain?"
two hazari ships are approaching.
i have declined their offer.
our first offer.
glad you're sticking around. take your station.
"they are dropping out of warp, flanking our position."
which one fired?
the ship to starboard. shields down to sixty percent.
evasive manoeuvres. target their weapons systems and return fire.
their shields are holding.
i can't get away. they're right on top of us.
hull integrity's been compromised on decks seven and twelve.
"captain, when the hazari strike in pairs, one ship always remains behind to reinforce the shields of the attacking vessel."
so we should target the support ship. how much is this tip going to cost me?
this one is free.
i'll take it. tuvok.
retargeting. firing photon torpedoes. they are disengaging.
"get us out of here, maximum warp. thanks for the help."
consider it a friendly gesture of goodwill in the hopes that seven will change her mind.
i have not.
you are making a fatal mistake. we have already analysed hundreds of scenarios. voyager will not survive without our help.
"your scenarios, not mine."
"your confidence is unfounded, captain. reconsider. order seven of nine to join us."
"we have an old expression, kurros. don't call us, we'll call you. remodulate the shields to a phase variance frequency."
his ship is vanishing from sensors. it's being absorbed into subspace.
i get the distinct feeling they won't take no for an answer.
same here. looks like we're facing two threats now. the hazari and our would-be saviours.
our offer was denied. how shall we proceed?
we are already proceeding.
our offer was refused. we must let the scenario continue.
our calculations indicate a ninety six percent chance the borg will still be ours.
then it is decided. we will wait and let our problem solve itself.
"duranium hull fragments, a thruster assembly, human organic residue. we were supposed to disable their ship, not destroy it."
they've entered the debris field.
detonate the spatial charges.
their vessel has taken heavy damage. shields and weapons are offline.
move us into position. lock on a tractor beam and pull them into the shuttlebay.
we're in transporter range.
i've got a lock. two lifeforms.
energise.
any luck?
i'm still trying to access their primary database.
let me guess. they're the strong but silent types.
very silent.
did you try a mind meld?
without success. they are unusually resistant.
"well, hold off on the torture till we see what we can dig up here."
i've found something. a series of encoded transmissions.
"they've been discussing voyager. our coordinates, our defences."
whoever hired the hazari know a lot about us.
check these sensor logs. see if they had any visitors recently.
"i've got some bioreadings, but they're pretty scrambled."
"if they are bioreadings, perhaps the doctor can unscramble them."
tell him to give it a try.
"i've created a forensic reconstruction from the bioreadings, using the holoemitters. brace yourselves."
"malon. huh, they must really hold a grudge. we haven't run into them for months. i'm sorry, doctor, something doesn't feel right."
the malon are economically motivated.
"and there's no profit in revenge. take a look at this. isomorphic signatures embedded in the bioreadings. this was no malon, it was only a projection."
you mean that's a hologram of a hologram?
in a manner of speaking. i believe i can restore the original biosignal parameters. brace yourself.
"well, it appears our hazari paradox is more complex than we thought."
i believe we're both being manipulated by the same person. recognise him?
no.
"his name is kurros, the malon you met with was nothing more than a projection."
my sensors would have detected a hologram.
"not this one. kurros is a member of a think tank. they solve problems for a price. oh, you have heard of them."
they're notorious in this sector. they've made quite a few enemies.
enemies who might be willing to pay a hell of a bounty.
their technology is very advanced. it makes them difficult to track.
not if we work together. you're the best hunters in the quadrant and we have the perfect lure. all we have to do now is out-think the think tank.
"we've got a puzzle and we're not leaving this room until we solve it. the think tank is out there somewhere, hiding in subspace. how do we find them? and even if we can, their ship's hull is neutronium-based alloy, impervious to our weapons. how do we capture them?"
what if we send out a multispatial probe?
it would take weeks of scanning to find them.
weeks? we're not willing to wait that long.
we could use subspatial charges to force them into the open.
where do we target the charges? we've still got to find them first.
"maybe we're going about this the wrong way. a direct assault seems unlikely to succeed. pure tactics, psychology. that's how they solve problems. that's what we have to do. they've created this paradox to manipulate us into giving them seven of nine. how do we manipulate them? think."
i thought we were onto something with b'elanna's plan
forget it. i was wrong.
let him talk.
we're talking in circles.
"enough! three hours, no progress. i should have contacted my ships by now."
maybe we can't out-think them.
captain?
"we have to assume they've planned for every contingency, including anything we could come up with to undermine their plan. this thing has been driving me crazy. you said you knew the solution. prove it."
"seven, how'd you do that?"
i scanned the device. its mechanism operates on a simple fractal regression.
you scanned it? that's cheating.
cheating is often more efficient.
"if you can't solve a puzzle, cheat. if you can't out-think a think tank, don't try."
are you suggesting we give up?
"not at all. when you were in contact with the artificial intelligence, you were linked through their internal communications array."
"yes, for several seconds."
"if you were to link with them again, we might be able to disrupt those systems. if they can't communicate, they can't function as a think tank. they'd be vulnerable."
back to square one. how do we find them?
simple. we give them what they want. you're going to join their group willingly.
they won't believe her.
we'll have to make them believe. pull up a chair. we've got some more work to do.
an hazari vessel is sending hails into subspace. it's trying to contact us.
put them through.
they're responding.
"hazari vessel, we have received your hails. can we be of assistance?"
you deceived us.
i do not believe we have met.
stop the pretence. you wanted us to deliver voyager. very well. but only if you triple our bounty.
"my friend, regardless of the circumstances, we have a contract."
"pay us, or we let voyager go."
"all right, we will triple the bounty. but you must deliver them to us now."
agreed. we'll contact the rest of our ships. we'll seize voyager as planned.
shields down to thirty percent.
return fire.
our phasers aren't penetrating their shields.
that last volley took out our shield generators and phaser banks.
"life support's failing, all decks."
"let us be honest, captain. things do not seem to be going your way."
don't count us out just yet.
"i admit you have been clever. you uncovered our subterfuge, but you failed to factor in all the variables. the greed of the hazari, for example."
photon torpedoes?
aft launchers are still online.
target a full spread at the lead hazari ship.
"a few torpedoes will not alter the outcome. if you do not convince seven of nine to join us now, the destruction of your ship is ninety nine point eight percent certain."
fire.
direct hit. it's been disabled.
clinging to that point two percentage? hazari reinforcements should be here any minute.
he's right. sensors just picked up a half dozen ships on an intercept course.
"captain, i'm detecting an unauthorised shuttle launch. it's seven of nine."
what the hell is she doing?
i believe she's saving your ship.
she's not answering hails. her shuttle's being pulled into subspace. she's gone.
"have a safe journey home, captain."
"seven of nine, welcome."
your hospitality is irrelevant. i am here because you left me no choice.
"you gave into your human instincts to save your crew, as we knew you would. just another factor in our equation."
"if voyager is destroyed, i will not cooperate."
do not worry. the solution to the hazari paradox is quite simple.
we have what we want. call off your attack.
not until we've been compensated.
"fine, but first order your other vessels to stand down."
"now, or we'll destroy voyager."
why is he in such a hurry?
comply.
"if we decloak, we would be vulnerable. the hazari could make quite a bounty on us. far more than we are paying them."
their technology is inferior to yours. they would never attack you directly.
"i think this is a trap, a new paradox your captain has created for us. if we call their bluff, the hazari might destroy voyager, and we would lose you. if we reveal ourselves, we could be destroyed."
"you told me, without problems to test the limits of your ability, you can never expand them."
"there is one very simple way to narrow the odds. we simply link you to our communications system, allow our artificial intelligence to probe your mind as it did before, and captain janeway's plans will be revealed, like a jewel in a bed of fog."
sickbay to bridge. seven's neural transceiver has been activated.
acknowledged. do it.
i'm transmitting the carrier wave.
voyager is sending an interference signal into our systems using her cortical implants as a relay. disconnect the link.
disconnect the link.
they can't understand you.
voyager to hazari vessels. their systems are down. fire the spatial charges.
we seem to be experiencing some turbulence.
primitive spatial charges. i will have the dome back online before they can do any damage.
we're being pulled out of subspace.
i've got a lock on seven.
initiate transport.
the hazari vessels are converging on the think tank.
tom.
setting a course.
"i urge you to reconsider, captain."
a good guest knows when he's outstayed his welcome.
we can still negotiate a peaceful solution. do not destroy my faith in diplomacy.
your diplomacy could use some polishing.
you know you will never be satisfied here among these people. is this what you really want?
"acquiring knowledge is a worthy objective, but its pursuit has obviously not elevated you."
looks like your ship's having difficulties.
a minor problem.
"oh, i'm sure you'll find a solution. just give it some thought."
"zeeesh. alert, alert, decompression on platform six eight four. brace for hull rupture. thrusters are down. we're going to crash! ahhh. hey, what do you think? look at the detail on the dorsal plating."
impressive. are you sure you're willing to part with it?
i just hope your boy enjoys it as much as i do.
"i'm certain he will, if we make it home in time for his birthday."
we'll make it.
"if you and savar had a child of your own, you'd have an excuse to play with toys more often."
i'm detecting a fluctuation in tank four. there's a full scale rupture in progress.
isolate the deck. activate the emergency containment field.
the emergency systems are offline.
backup controls are down too. eject the tank.
here? there's an inhabited system.
we have no choice!
the ejection ports aren't responding.
impossible.
there's another rupture forming in tank six.
we'll have to send somebody down there to seal off the tanks manually. contact the theta core.
communications are down.
get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks.
i didn't sign up for core labour.
i'm giving you an order.
i'll be contaminated.
now!
"the flame, like emotion, is a primitive force. left unchecked, it's chaotic, destructive. but if controlled it can be a powerful tool. the lamp controls the flame, as you must learn to control your emotions."
i lost my temper. no big deal.
you destroyed the doctor's holographic camera.
"i told him three times to leave engineering, but he kept buzzing around snapping pictures for some photo essay."
a day in the life of the warp core.
"i apologised, and i replicated him a new camera."
"you have a long history of emotional volatility. the point of this exercise is not to atone for past transgressions, but to prevent future ones."
you can't order someone to meditate.
commander chakotay thinks otherwise.
are my eyes supposed to be open or closed for this part.
whichever allows you to focus your mind.
envision the flame burning within you.
sorry.
"the flame grows hotter. a point of white light. follow it backward through the years to a time when you were younger, a child. is there something amusing, lieutenant?"
"i'm sorry, an image just flashed through my mind. you as a child, those pointy little ears. you must have been cute."
indeed. please follow my instructions or we'll discontinue this exercise.
"right. me, childhood. how old?"
your earliest memories. try to recall a time when you experienced uncontrollable anger.
daniel byrd.
i beg your pardon?
he was one of my classmates in grammar school. he was always terrorising me. he used to point at my cranial ridges and tease me about being half klingon. he called me miss turtlehead.
that angered you.
"of course, it did. so i attacked him once, during recess, on the gyro-swing. i disengaged the centrifugal governor. he was spinning so fast, he almost flew apart. then i yanked him off the swing and started pounding his little face! if miss malvin hadn't showed up, i probably would have"
describe the anger you felt at that moment.
"i, i wanted to hurt him. to take revenge for all the humiliation he caused me."
"your anger was a source of strength. it protected you, gave you courage."
i suppose it did.
and when the doctor tried to take a holo-photograph of you?
i was annoyed. he kept getting in the way.
the rage within you runs deep. it's been with you for many years.
i'm not a vulcan. i'll survive.
"whatever you say, miss turtlehead."
what did you say!
you're easily provoked. you must learn to master your emotions.
i've had enough mastery for one day. school's out.
"so, how'd it go with b'elanna today?"
our meditation sessions are confidential.
"no, i'm not asking for sordid details. i just want to know if you think you can help her."
her training will be a challenge for both of us.
"take it from me, getting b'elanna to control her temper is like convincing a ferengi to leave his estate to charity."
"captain, we're receiving an automated distress call."
origin?
"coordinates one twenty one by two six eight. range, two billion kilometres."
who's sending it?
i can't tell.
"let them know help's on the way. set a course, mister paris."
thirty seven escape pods.
they're contaminated with theta radiation.
malon?
possibly. lifesigns?
"two, but they're erratic."
beam them to sickbay. initiate bio-hazard containment procedures.
theta radiation has affected a radius of six hundred million kilometres.
source?
a malon freighter travelling at high impulse. it appears to be abandoned.
i thought we'd seen the last of the malon.
i guess they're looking for new places to dump their toxic waste.
do we know what happened to their ship? were they attacked?
i'm just as curious as you are. can you revive either of them? i'm captain kathryn janeway.
fesek. controller fesek. where am i?
you're on my vessel. we responded to your distress call.
my ship?
it's heavily damaged.
where?
three million kilometres from here.
that's too close. we've got to get further away.
"calm down, calm down. tell me what's wrong with your ship. why did you abandon it?"
we were on a waste export mission.
dumping theta radiation.
"two of the theta tanks ruptured. systems malfunctioned one by one, communications, navigation, propulsion. we had no choice. radiation was venting from every port. over sixty crewmen died within minutes. it was chaos. we stumbled through the gas to get to the escape pods. only a few of us made it. where are the others?"
the two of you were the only ones we found alive.
"listen to me very carefully. the fact that we're still here means the ship hasn't exploded, yet. when it does, over four trillion isotons of antimatter waste is going to ignite. everything within three light years will be destroyed."
janeway to the bridge.
go ahead.
put at least five light years between us and the malon freighter.
quickly.
"you heard her, tom."
send out a sector wide alert.
warn any other ships in the vicinity to
evacuate immediately.
our warp field just collapsed.
all this theta radiation. it's disrupting subspace.
can you reinitialise the field?
negative.
tuvok. without warp drive there's no chance we'll clear the blast radius.
agreed.
"mister paris, set a course for the freighter. full impulse."
"aye, captain."
what?
"if we can't outrun your ship, maybe we can disable it."
every deck has been contaminated. anyone who goes on board will liquefy within minutes.
we'll find a way.
we? i'm not going anywhere near that vessel.
"you can either stay and help us or i'll send you back to your escape pod. your choice. clean them up, doctor. i need them on the bridge."
how long until those storage tanks explode?
approximately six hours.
can we get an away team on board?
"the freighter's hull is intact. life support appears to be operational. however, thirty three of forty two decks are flooded with high levels of theta radiation."
"including the control room, which is where we'd have to go to reestablish containment. as i told you."
"we could beam on to one of the lower levels where there's less radiation, and vent the contaminated sections one by one."
clear a path to the control room.
"i appreciate what you're trying to do, but if what you're considering were possible, we'd have tried it before we abandoned the ship. we have years of experience aboard freighters of this gradient."
your experience is what got us into this mess in the first place.
"that's enough, lieutenant."
maybe there's another way.
i'm listening.
"four hours from here there's a nebula that could protect us from the blast. we could alter course, wait there until after the explosion."
there are at least three other ships in the sector. what about them?
i don't see what we can do.
so hundreds of people become contaminated because you're not willing to clean up your garbage.
lieutenant. assemble an away team. we're going over there.
wait! tell them about the vihaar.
what's he talking about?
nothing. it's a myth.
what kind of myth?
it's an old story shared among freighter crews. some of them say they've seen creatures in the theta storage tanks.
creatures?
"created by radiogenic waste. according to the legend, they are poisonous monsters that wreak havoc aboard malon ships. it's a common belief among our more superstitious recruits."
"i never believed it myself, but during the evacuation some of the crew people saw something. a form."
hallucinations are one of the first symptoms of theta poisoning. you know that.
maybe. then how do you explain what happened? we checked every system.
you'd say anything to get out of going back to that freighter.
"if you'd been there, you'd be afraid to go back, too."
this chamber seems to be the least affected by radiation. we'll beam in there.
that's fifteen decks below the control room.
we'll have to work our way up.
"the pressurisation systems, they're offline. how will we vent the gas?"
there are two main airlocks on each deck. we'll open them as we go. perform a series of controlled decompressions.
what's to stop us from being vented?
forcefields. i spent six years aboard a talaxian garbage scow. i know a few things about waste management.
even low levels of theta radiation can be lethal.
our doctor's developed an inoculation. it'll temporarily prevent our cells from absorbing the radiation.
how long will it last?
"two, three hours."
half of the doors and bulkheads are fused. the ascenders are offline. it could take us twice as long as that to reach the control room.
then we'll have to work quickly. we'll take phasers to cut through any obstacles.
"i've ordered my men to do a lot of risky things, but nothing as foolish as this."
more foolish than towing around a trillion isotons of toxic waste?
we take every precaution to keep it contained.
until you dump it in someone's back yard.
is your crew always so diplomatic?
your concerns are noted. get them inoculated. we'll meet you in transporter room one.
"we're trying to avoid explosions, remember?"
oh! not another lecture about my emotions.
"no, a lecture about how to treat guests aboard this ship."
"guests? chakotay, these people are the scourge of the quadrant."
"agreed, but right now they're our only hope of repairing that freighter, so i suggest you make friends."
diplomacy. janeway's answer to everything.
"this isn't the captain talking, it's me, and i'm giving you an order. keep your temper in check. understood? understood?"
yeah.
i didn't hear you.
yes.
"b'elanna, i need your expertise on this mission, not your bad mood."
i'll see what i can do.
"ready, neelix?"
"ah, not quite. do we still have a minute? it's just it's not quite strong enough yet. would you mind passing me that little dish?"
"neelix, i admire your dedication, but the crew can figure out lunch on their own."
"lunch, and dinner, and a midnight snack have all been taken care of. this is for me. it's a talaxian theta radiation remedy. crushed rama leaf and katyllian clove. it helps fortify the cellular membranes."
i think the doctor's inoculation might be a better way to go.
"every little bit helps. oh, by the way, thank you."
for what?
for sending me on such an important mission. not that my duties in the mess hall aren't challenging.
it was an easy choice. you were the best man for the job.
"well, our scow once ran smack into a theta radiation field. knocked the propulsion out. we had no choice but to sit there. we were barely alive when they found us. if it hadn't been for this, nobody would have survived."
once you get past the choking reflex it's really not so bad. want to try some?
i'll take my chances.
transporter room one to commander chakotay. we're ready to proceed.
on our way.
b'elanna. aren't you forgetting something?
i don't think so.
"a goodbye would be nice. so long, see you soon, something along those lines."
i didn't want to risk it.
risk what?
starting an argument.
"argument? us? so, i hear it's been a short fuse kind of day."
about this long.
nothing you can't handle.
if you think so.
i know so.
i suppose it's always going to be like this.
like what?
me against the galaxy.
"well, the galaxy doesn't stand a chance. now, promise me that you're going to be careful over there. no stopping to have fun."
fun? on a malon freighter?
see you soon.
"well, it's nothing a fresh coat of paint wouldn't brighten up."
this way.
"theta radiation density, twenty million ev per cubic metre. structural integrity's holding. wish i could say the same for my lungs."
what was that?
"this corridor's filled with methogenic particles, highly charged."
something's causing an electrostatic cascade. our scanning signals are igniting the particles. it's the tricorders!
take cover.
no more tricorders.
control mechanisms are down. we're going to have to open the airlocks manually.
wait here. we'll take care of it.
"b'elanna, go with him."
we can do this ourselves.
i'd prefer to keep an eye on your progress.
you're on my freighter. i'm in charge here.
"you abandoned ship, remember? you take your orders from me."
we'll have to crawl into an injector port. it's only big enough for two people.
"pelk, you stay with us."
shall we?
how can you stand to work in these conditions?
"you think we're animals, don't you?"
"you said it, not me."
i'm a waste controller half the year. do you know what i do the rest of the time? i'm a sculptor.
what's your point?
every year i give up work i love to expose myself to radiation that will probably cut my life in half.
then why do it?
have you ever been to malon prime? it's a remarkable place. it's one of the most beautiful worlds you'll ever see. our planet would choke with industrial wastes if it weren't for the sacrifices of people like me.
how many worlds are you willing to contaminate to keep your own home so tidy?
"do you have any idea of the trouble we go to, to locate isolated areas? ah, manual actuators. i'll release them, you monitor the pressure variance."
right.
do you have any children?
no.
i have a son. he's seven years old. he wants to be a waste controller when he grows up.
you must be very proud.
ready.
torres to chakotay. stand by for the decompression sequence.
acknowledged.
it didn't work.
there's something jamming the airlock controls.
torres to chakotay. we've got a problem. the actuators aren't working. somebody's going to have to go up there and take a look.
wait. that deck is still contaminated.
i'll go. i've been exposed to worse.
wait.
one for the road.
it's probably just the decouplers. they're always getting encrusted with oxides.
who's there?
help! help! help!
i saw it. i saw it.
what?
the creature.
give me twenty cc's of anesthezine.
chakotay to voyager. transporter status.
still too much interference. i'll try compensating. stand by for further instructions.
what happened?
"we don't know. he went away for a minute, he screamed, and we found him here."
these look like chemical burns.
"without tricorders, it's hard to make a diagnosis."
it's here.
what?
the creature.
"you're hallucinating. it's the radiation, but you're going to be all right."
"no. it attacked me. it, oh."
he's going into shock. cortical stimulator.
"pelk, get up!"
he's not responding.
he said the creature attacked him.
he imagined it. he was probably scalded when that conduit ruptured.
or maybe there is someone else on this ship.
voyager to away team. transporter interference has cleared. we're locked onto your coordinates. stand by.
"harry, pelk is dead. lock onto his signal and beam him to sickbay. ask the doctor to determine the cause of death."
aye sir.
someone still needs to get up there and open the airlocks.
me.
hold on. i'll join you. from now on nobody works alone.
progress?
they've vented five decks. ten to go.
"at this rate, they'll reach the control room in approximately three hours. however, the storage tanks will detonate in less than two."
i've been working on a contingency plan.
an o type star.
if the freighter exploded within the star's corona it might absorb the radiation.
the star is not on the freighter's trajectory.
what if we gave it a little nudge?
"a series of carefully timed tractor pulses could alter the freighter's course. but given the vessel's weakened state, one miscalculation could set off the explosion."
"i'm still counting on the away team to succeed, but i want to be ready with plan b if they don't."
i don't know about the rest of you but i could sure use a sonic shower.
i'd love to soak in a hot bath for a day or two.
"oh no, not me. i want to feel those sonic pulses dissolving every last atom of this grime off my body."
we have a decontamination bay on board that can purge over fifty workers at a time.
"well, that sounds like fun."
b'elanna?
"i'm okay, just a little light-headed."
your hand.
"oh, god."
"freighter blight, from the prolonged exposure."
lovely.
"in my business, it's an occupational hazard."
we'd better try inoculating you again.
"if she's blistering, she's already received a fatal dose of radiation. she needs treatment."
i'll live. let's keep moving.
we have medicines in the infirmary. it's only two sections from here.
we don't have time for a detour.
"b'elanna, go with him. we'll meet you outside the control room."
"chakotay, i'm fine."
i said go!
this is the infirmary? it looks more like a morgue. what happened to him?
it looks like he was being treated for long term exposure. he was probably left behind during the evacuation.
"tough luck, huh?"
there was nothing more we could do for him. he was a core labourer.
meaning?
he worked close to the storage tanks. only three of ten core labourers survive a standard mission.
occupational hazard?
they know the risks when they accept the assignment.
they know they're going to end up like this?
core labourers can make more in two months than most malon make in a lifetime.
what good is the money if they're not around to collect it.
it will go to his family.
what is that thing?
it's a subdermal injector. it contains analeptic compounds to reverse the cell damage.
i feel better already.
i won't hurt you. i've done this a hundred times. you'll feel a slight burning sensation.
"commander. the captain's plan b. i've calculated the inertial force required to divert the freighter. plan c. shield modulations that should reduce the structural damage of voyager. it will also help protect the crew against theta radiation poisoning, if we fail."
"a wise precaution. with any luck, we won't be needing it."
i didn't think vulcans believed in luck.
"as a rule we don't, but serving with captain janeway has taught me otherwise."
she does seem to succeed more often than random chance would allow. i'll factor it into my calculations.
is there a plan d?
no.
"initiating decompression sequence, deck four. deck clear."
"twelve down, three to go."
the airlocks are opening on this deck.
what?
i can't close them.
"forcefields, where are they?"
they're offline!
we've got to get off this deck. move!
this way.
chakotay!
he was right behind me.
torres to chakotay.
that deck is a vacuum by now.
torres to voyager.
acknowledged.
lock onto chakotay's comm. signal and beam him to sickbay.
we've got him. he's okay.
i thought that deck was secure.
it was.
then why did we almost get blown into space?
i don't know.
airlocks don't open by themselves!
what are you saying? you think it was me?
"calm down, both of you! we don't have time to argue about what happened. we've got to keep moving."
chakotay?
unconscious but stable. the doctor is treating him now. we'll be able to talk to him in less than an hour.
i'll want a full report.
shall i beam to the freighter and take command of the away team?
i just spoke with b'elanna. she's got everything under control.
this is a dangerous situation. there is no margin for emotional error.
we have plenty to do here. help me remodulate the tractor beam.
"b'elanna is unpredictable, captain. under these circumstances, her volatile nature could compromise the mission."
"your concerns are noted, but if i send you over there i'd be sending the wrong message. that i don't have faith in her. but i do."
"your faith is admirable, but logic suggests"
"this isn't about logic, it's about trust. she'll come through for us. now, give me a hand."
lieutenant? lieuten. are you all right?
fine. report.
we just vented the last deck. we should have a clear path to the control room.
"let's get this thing over with, then."
if you need to rest.
i said i'm fine. i was meditating.
meditating? you?
do me a favour. don't tell tuvok.
your secret's safe.
it's this place.
"i know how you feel. the next time i volunteer to board a malon freighter, check me into sickbay and have my head examined."
i feel like i'm ready to explode.
we'll get through this together. i've got a knack for diffusing explosive situations.
thanks.
torres to astrometrics.
go ahead.
we're outside the control room
but without tricorders we can't tell if it's safe to go in there.
the room is too heavily shielded. our sensors can't penetrate it.
you must stand by.
the theta dampening field is still active. it should be safe.
after you.
it's worse than i expected. the theta gas has leaked into the warp manifold.
we've got less than ten minutes before this vessel explodes.
emergency systems are down.
this should feed enough energy to your power matrix to reinitialise them. try it now.
"they're coming back online, but only one containment grid is still operational. we have two unstable tanks. one grid can't handle them both."
we'll seal them one at a time.
doctor?
"easy, commander."
"ow, my head aches."
i'm not surprised. you took a severe blow.
i've got to get back to the freighter.
"not in this condition. if you want to help, you can answer some questions about mister pelk's death. i've found unidentified tissue in his wounds."
what sort of tissue?
the computer is running a microcellular scan.
pelk said he was attacked.
"ah yes, the malon bogeyman."
microcellular analysis is complete.
"odd. the tissue is saturated with theta radiation, but it's not showing signs of decay. it came from someone or something that's developed a resistance to the radiation. sickbay to seven of nine."
"yes, doctor."
scan for additional lifeforms aboard the malon vessel.
i've been running continuous scans.
i assure you there is no one there aside from the away team.
this lifeform's heavily irradiated. it could be blending in with ambient toxins.
i'll recalibrate our sensors.
tank one stable.
reroute the containment grid to the tank two.
what happened?
a power surge. we're losing the grid.
it was triggered from a workstation on this deck.
janeway to away team.
we've detected an alien lifeform aboard the freighter. we believe it killed pelk.
"captain, we just lost power."
we're diverting the freighter into a nearby star. leave the control room so we can get a lock on you.
acknowledged.
what's going on?
it's jammed.
seven of nine
to away team. i've detected the alien lifeform. it's moving toward your position.
the gas is being routed through the environmental systems.
i'll try to shut it down.
is there another way out?
no.
do you have them?
not yet.
the lifeform has entered the control room.
"i'm trying to vent the gas, but the release valves are jammed."
use the environmental controls instead.
"in the meantime, see if you can get that hatch open."
neelix?
"no, you'll ignite the gas."
neelix?
we've got to get him back to voyager. get that hatch open!
i'm trying!
"fesek, behind you!"
you're a core labourer.
not anymore.
stay back. don't make me kill you.
i'm already dead.
you've been sabotaging this ship.
there's no other way to make them understand.
so that's your way of getting even? killing your crew? causing an explosion that will contaminate other ships?
they poisoned me!
the freighter is on course for the star.
"away team, we've adjusted the vessel's course. it's heading for an o type star."
you have to get out of there now.
no. no.
the freighter's manoeuvring thrusters just activated. it's altering course.
compensate.
no effect. i'm detecting radiation surges in the theta tanks. they're going to detonate in three minutes.
harry?
as long as they're in the control room i can't get a lock
janeway to away team. get those manoeuvring thrusters
offline then get out of the contaminated area. we can't get a transporter lock on you.
"get the hell away from there, now!"
no! it's too late!
"okay. okay. look, i know what they've done to you. they used you. you want to hurt them. listen, listen to me. i know. i know that you're so angry you want to destroy everything in sight, but there's another way to make them understand. i'm on your side. i can help you. innocent people are going to die if you do this."
no. it's over.
"please, please. please, let me help you."
no.
step away!
the malon's thrusters are powering down.
i have restored the freighter's trajectory.
"b'elanna, get out of there."
"come on, we've got to go. fesek."
"the away team, mister kim?"
i got them.
maybe the meditation's working.
what makes you say that?
from what neelix told me. you kept your temper in check over there.
don't expect me to make a habit of it.
"well, i've repaired most of your cellular degradation.  i wish i could say the same for you, but you've suffered long term systemic damage. your condition will deteriorate over time."
it's an occupational hazard.
we've contacted a malon transport ship in the next sector. we've altered course to rendezvous with them.
"thank you, captain. i don't know how i'm going to explain what happened."
tell them the truth. tell them the vihaar is no myth.
"computer, activate sonic shower."
"so, harry throws it in gear, floors the gas, and backs us right through a burrito stand."
so when are you going to teach me how to drive?
you sure you're ready?
i've piloted starships. i think i can handle a car.
you'd be surprised. the clutch on a '69 mustang can be pretty tricky.
take a look. she's watching us again.
she's working. relax.
dessert?
what is it?
some cheese i prepared for our kadi guest. tell me what you think.
it's a little bland.
"just a little? oh, that's bad. the kadi don't approve of spices. anything that might inflame the senses."
you're talking this mission very seriously.
the kadi are easily offended. the captain's leaving their representative entirely in my hands while she's at the colony.
"i'm sure you're up to it, ambassador."
i hope so.
she's watching us again.
you're imagining things.
i don't think so.
b'elanna.
enjoying the view?
explain.
"you've been staring at us all night. in fact, you were following us yesterday when we were walking to engineering, and the day before when i was waiting for tom outside the shuttlebay."
"you are correct, i have been observing you. it's part of my research on human mating behaviour."
"stardate 52647, fourteen hundred hours. subjects quarrel in corridor outside female's quarters. male returns with twelve flowering plant stems, species rosa rubifolia, effecting a cessation of hostilities. stardate 52648, oh three hundred hours. intimate relations resume. how the hell do you know when we're having intimate relations?"
there is no one on deck nine section twelve who doesn't know when you're having intimate relations.
is there a problem?
i want all the data you've collected.
i haven't completed the study.
"then study this. borg provokes klingon, klingon breaks borg nose."
b'elanna.
call sickbay. tell them there's about to be a medical emergency.
"b'elanna, let's go have a nightcap."
this time you've crossed the line.
"i read b'elanna's report. needless to say, i was surprised."
i was careful not to violate protocols.
"that's not the point. this is a starship, not a nature preserve. oh, i'm missing a pip."
you asked me to broaden my knowledge of human behaviour.
"i'm not questioning your goals, seven. it's your methods. you shouldn't be taking field notes on the crew. help me with this, will you please?"
"have you ever considered trying it yourself? romance, i mean."
i do not require a romantic relationship.
so why'd you collect thirty thousand gigaquads of information on the subject? i'm late.
"i missed this on my first pass through their database. kadi monks only wash with purified water, so sonic showers are out."
i've already equipped his quarters with an ablutionary fountain built to their specifications.
they observe eight daily services.
noted.
"show the ambassador our best side, neelix. i don't want him going back to his superiors with tales of how immoral we are."
energise.
the ritual greeting.
"travellers who have left the sanctity of their home and family, we welcome you into our home, our family."
accept these symbols of our purity and the goddess mother's blessing.
"commander tuvok, the senior officer who will accompany me, and mister neelix, who will familiarise your ambassador with voyager."
tomin is an excellent judge of character. he'll help us determine whether your crew is worthy of receiving our minerals.
he's in very good hands.
it is time to welcome you to our home.
"this way, ambassador."
"voyager's an intrepid class starship with a crew of one hundred and forty six, designed for long-term exploration. i thought we'd start with a tour of our primary systems. first stop, engineering."
i was hoping i might sample a food item i noted earlier in your data files. hasperat.
it's a bajoran dish. very spicy. i believe that your dietary protocols prohibit flavourful foods.
"i want to broaden my palate while i'm here, in the interest of better understanding."
"in that case, first stop, mess hall."
your cortical implants are operating at peak efficiency. nanoprobe levels stable. complaints?
none.
i heard about the mess hall incident.
this crew can be very efficient at disseminating information when they choose to be.
they say gossip travels faster than warp speed. so why were you studying tom and b'elanna?
scientific curiosity.
"are you sure? perhaps there's a reason that hasn't occurred to you. you're a woman, seven."
is that an observation or a diagnosis?
"a simple biological fact, with repercussions that are hard to deny."
what is your proposed treatment?
perhaps you should consider expanding your research to the realm of dating.
dating. you mean procreation?
"one step at a time. dating is a human ritual wherein two people share a social activity, get to know each other. in time, it can lead to a romantic involvement and eventually, if all goes well, even marriage."
one step at a time.
this could be an important stage in your social development. it's worth exploring.
the captain would seem to agree. how shall i proceed?
"you mean, we. i'll prepare a lesson plan. meet me on holodeck two in one hour. most women start dating a little younger than you but, better late than never."
"i've prepared an introduction. i call it love amid the stars.  the milky way, home to thousands of humanoid species and countless courtship rituals. klingon males initiate courtship by biting the female. here we see two bolians getting to know one another.  the courtship rituals of some species remain shrouded in mystery. for example species 8472 appears to have as many as five sexes. bystanders better keep their distance. of course, the species you're most likely to interact with is human, so without further ado, lesson one. first contact. there are any number of ways humans can meet prospective mates. here we see the chance encounter. equally common is the formal introduction. when first contact is successful, romance quickly ensues and, in the happiest of circumstances, procreation. here we see how fortress ovum is besieged by countless little warriors."
"doctor, i am familiar with the physiological processes of sexuality."
"oh. then let's skip ahead to the first of the practical exercises. lesson two. encounter in a public place. computer, initiate holo-programme paris three."
our location?
"chez sandrine. it's on earth, in a city called marseilles. ensign paris whiled away a good portion of his academy years here, no doubt to the detriment of his scholastic performance. now, pull up a bar stool and pretend you've come here to meet the man of your dreams. hi, there."
hello.
come here often?
this is my first time.
you must be new in town. how do you like the south of france?
it is very quaint. exactly as i've always pictured it.
may i buy you a drink?
i don't require a liquid supplement at this time.
you're not giving this a fair chance
this exercise is pointless.
"it may seem pointless, but small talk is a vital dating skill. it helps to establish a rapport with your companion."
perhaps there's something to be said for assimilation after all.
"all right, why don't you try your own approach on that gentleman over there? go ahead."
very well.
hello.
hello.
may i buy you a drink?
"er, sure. steven price."
and you are?
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of. you may call me seven."
"seven. that's an unusual name. please, have a seat."
looks like sandrine's is under new management. who deleted my pool table?
shush. school is in session.
more social lessons?
watch. you might learn something.
curious jewellery.
it's a borg implant. i was a drone.
"oh, so then it's a family heirloom."
borg do not have families. they have unimatrices.
"well, in that case, why don't you tell me about your unimatrix."
"they're hitting it off, don't you think?"
he's a hologram.
your point?
"well, you programmed him to interact with seven. real people don't respond the same way."
"under my guidance, she'll be dating real people in no time."
you're teaching seven how to date? ha! talk about the blind leading the blind.
i've had my share of romantic encounters. are you implying that seven couldn't get a date?
"are you kidding? half the men on this ship would jump at the chance. but getting a date is one thing, keeping it from turning into a disaster is another."
i have every confidence in her social skills.
"well, fine. let's say you get her a date. this is the holodeck. the cards are stacked in her favour. if you want to really put her to the test you have to do it in the real world, where anything can happen."
"mister neelix is hosting a reception for the kadi ambassador on thursday night. not only will seven arrive with a date, she will have him eating out of the palm of her hand."
"put your latinum where your mouth is. if seven brings a date to the reception, and leaves with the same date on good terms, without causing a diplomatic incident, i will work double shifts in sickbay for the next month."
and if she fails?
i get a month off.
it's a bet.
where are you going?
our small talk is terminated. i have mastered this exercise. we can proceed to the next.
if i were you i'd start looking for somebody to fill in for me.
one ktarian pudding.
"mmm. ah. mmm. ah, the texture is so frothy. it seems to be evaporating in my mouth."
"the recipe includes a catalytic agent designed to do just that. if we don't hurry, we'll miss lieutenant torres. she's been waiting half an hour."
"you're right. engineering, your warp core. i must see that."
"in our society, males and females work separately, but i can see the wisdom of your approach. promotes a more stimulating environment."
it's time for third prayer.
"yes, it is. but i think i can forego this service and perform the appropriate penance later. it's more important that i continue exploring your culture. perhaps another dessert?"
good morning. it's time for lesson three. getting to know you.
elaborate.
the key to finding a compatible partner is learning how to share your interests and goals. we'll start with hobbies. what do you do with your spare time?
regenerate.
"ah. tell me about your tastes, your likes and dislikes."
i dislike irrelevant conversations.
okay. which brings us to goals. what do you want out of life?
perfection.
"perfection is a laudable goal for oneself, but you can't expect it from others. i learned that lesson myself when i was first activated. one of the ways i adapted was to pursue interests people could identify with. holo-photography, for example. opera."
music does have intriguing mathematical properties.
excellent. perhaps we can mould this curiosity into an interest. something you can share with others. let's see how much you know. here we see
a basic musical phrase in the major mode. i've done a preliminary study of the topic.
"sing it for me.  seven, has anyone ever told you, you have a beautiful voice? it's a true gift."
the gift is from the collective. a vocal subprocessor designed to facilitate the sonic interface with borg transponders.
let's try something a little more challenging.
you are my sunshine?
it's a simple melody from earth's twentieth century. a good piece for beginners. sing.
"the other night, dear, as i lay sleeping, i dreamed i held you in my arms."
"that was flawless, but try putting a little more emotion into it. like this. when i awoke, dear, i was mistaken and i hung my head and cried. see? computer, add instrumental accompaniment. on to the chorus. together now."
"you are my sunshine, my only sunshine. you make me happy when skies are grey. you'll never know, dear, how much i love you. please don't take my sunshine away.  you are my sunshine, my only sunshine. you make me happy when skies are grey."
"you'll never know, dear"
how much i love you. please don't take my sunshine away.
"seven, i need the data from those last two astrometric scans."
in a moment.
that looks like the crew manifest.
the doctor asked me to pick a suitable candidate.
for what?
lesson ten. the first date.
your first date?
"i've narrowed the list to two crewmen, based on work performance and compatible interests."
i didn't know you had any interests.
"neither did i, but apparently they include astronomy, quantum mechanics and music."
"i play the clarinet, you know."
"you are not one of the candidates, ensign."
"oh. well, maybe i could help you pick mister right."
"ensign bronowski, assigned to the airponics bay. his work record is flawless and he plays the accordion."
"badly, very badly. he's got no sense of humour."
"lieutenant chapman, structural engineering."
chapman's a nice guy.
we worked together on an away mission. he seemed efficient.
"robertson, if that's you, i need an isolinear spanner."
it is not.
"i apologise, lieutenant. i didn't mean to startle you."
"no, my fault. you need something?"
"your presence is required er, rather, it is requested, tonight. nineteen hundred hours, holodeck two."
another engineering simulation?
dinner.
dinner?
the consumption of nutritional biomatter.
"no, i know what dinner is. i just. are you asking me to join you?"
yes. state your response.
okay. yes.
please be punctual.
"i will, thanks."
a dropped tool can be a workplace hazard. be more careful next time.
seven. please state the nature of the medical emergency.
i have a date.
sorry i'm late.
"it's quite all right. in fact, why don't you take the day off, relax. those double shifts are going to take a lot out of you."
oh?
"seven of nine has a date tonight. if all goes well, as i'm sure it will, he'll accompany her to the reception tomorrow."
who'd she pick?
lieutenant william chapman.
ha! chapman? good luck.
what's that supposed to mean?
he's renowned for being nervous around women.
so.
are you kidding? seven's dominant personality will have him running for the airlock before dessert.
"seven may seem intimidating, but that's only a reaction to the way people treat her. in fact, she's an efficient and charming young woman."
"efficient. i'll give you that, but charming?"
most people don't take the time to look beyond her exterior. did you know she has a lovely singing voice?
"no, i didn't, but then again, i've never asked her to sing for me."
what are you implying?
it sounds like you're getting a little infatuated with your star pupil.
infatuated? that's absurd.
"whatever you say, maestro."
it was part of the lesson plan!
"you're meeting with him in ten minutes, seven. why aren't you ready?"
i am.
"aren't we forgetting something? lesson eight, dress for success."
my appearance is sufficient.
"sufficient, yes, but you could use a little more panache. let's start by doing something different with your hair. i don't have much first-hand experience with this, but, try shaking your head a little bit."
is this more appropriate?
yes. when i first designed your dermaplastic garment i also tried my hand at some casual attire. you might want to replicate one of these.
how shall i choose?
i think you'd look very nice in this one.
i am uncertain how to wear such a garment. assist me.
"oh, i, i, i'm sure you'll manage. i'll go prepare the holodeck. remember, the idea is to have fun tonight. i'll expect a full report in the morning."
"you, you look beautiful."
thank you. you look beautiful as well.
"thank you. er, would you like to sit down?"
where is our designated location?
best table in the house. i wasn't sure you'd actually show up.
i requested your presence.
"well, to be honest, i thought one of my friends put you up to it. champagne?"
synthehol impairs my cortical function. water will suffice.
mind if i?
proceed.
i must admit i'm a little nervous.
elaborate.
"oh, let's just say it's been a long time since i've been out on a date."
"i've never been on a date. as a result, i am experiencing anxiety as well."
"well, i guess that means we've got something in common. garçon?"
"server, report to this station. we require your assistance."
problem?
this creature has an exoskeleton.
it's a lobster. they're a delicacy on earth. try it.
i will replicate you a new garment.
"i'm fine, fine. it's just a little bit of exoskeleton. maybe we should order dessert."
you wish to accelerate our social encounter.
"no, no, i didn't say that. i'm just, er, i'm having a very interesting evening. would you like to dance?"
that activity is covered in lesson thirty five. i haven't reached it yet.
"i'm not much of a dancer myself, but it might be fun."
as you wish.
relax. try to relax. you seem a little tense.
relaxation would disrupt my chronographic sequencer. it allows me to maintain synchronous movement with the music.
"that's handy. but maybe you could ignore your chronographic sequencer and, er, let me lead. that's better."
you are damaged.
"no, i'll be all right."
you've torn a ligament. i'm afraid you'll have to report to sickbay. mister paris will treat you. no need to mention how this happened.
"i had a great time, seven. let's do this again, someday."
i have failed.
"nonsense. even romeo and juliet hit a few snags at first. besides, lieutenant chapman's not the only lobster in the sea."
i wish to terminate our social lessons.
"just because you didn't achieve perfection your first time out, doesn't mean you should give up."
"dating is a poor means of interaction. there is far more efficiency in the way you and i communicate. we say what we mean, simply and directly."
"you and i do have a rapport, but we're colleagues. we're not pursuing romance."
no.
i'm certain you'll be able to master these basic skills in short order.
my first date was certainly short.
was that a joke?
"lesson six, beguiling banter."
"now you're getting the hang of it. perhaps this evening doesn't have to end so abruptly. this may be a good time to cover lesson thirty five, shall we dance? computer, play someone to watch over me, instrumental only. we'll begin with some simple steps. place your left hand on my shoulder and your right hand in my left. now, follow me, one step at a time. don't worry. i don't have any ligaments to tear."
another drink!
ambassador!
"neelix! my friend, my host, my saviour. neelix, i want you to meet, alandra and tria."
what are you doing?
i'm sampling yet another entrée on the menu of pleasure that you have opened up for me.
"i checked today's menu, and they're not on it. coffee, black."
"neelix, i decided to go exploring and i found your holodecks, where i discovered this little gem still simmering in the memory buffer."
"you can explore it later. right now, we've got to get you to your reception."
pungent taste. what is it?
coffee. and there's plenty more where we're going.
"no coffee on our colony. nothing to tempt the appetite of even the most weak-willed novitiate. neelix, a confession. i am thinking of leaving the colony, joining voyager. i want to throw off my vows and immerse myself in your wonderful culture."
that's just the synthehol talking.
"no, i've never been more clear-headed about anything, and i have you to thank."
that's right. up. there we go.
hard at work?
our lessons have disrupted my duties.
then i suppose you're too busy to attend the ambassador's reception?
my presence is not required.
"true, but it might be an opportunity for you to apply your newfound social skills."
"lesson eleven, life of the party?"
exactly. join me?
are you asking me on a date?
i suppose i am.
then i accept. is my appearance sufficient?
you look perfect.
how do you bend a hologram's ear? use a prism. what did the counsellor say to the hologram? you're projecting.
"this humour, it's a revelation."
are you sure you wouldn't prefer some more coffee?
"coffee. yes, i'll have that too. go."
"neelix, is it my imagination, or is our guest of honour drunk?"
"commander, i tried. i had an itinerary, i even set up a prayer dais in his quarters, but i just couldn't control him. the captain is due back in the morning with the kadi minister. what do i do?"
pray.
"well, well, well. what do we have here?"
"mister paris, i believe you know seven of nine, my date for the evening."
"oh, you don't say? well, your last date ended up in sickbay. i hope this one goes a little smoother."
there's no need to be insulting.
"it's all right, doctor. i believe he is merely engaging in small talk. may i get either of you gentlemen a drink?"
"yes, a gin and tonic with a twist."
you know i don't drink. i don't have the stomach for it.
"a well-crafted joke, doctor."
impressive. you've actually taught her to be polite. but don't think you've won our bet. she was supposed to bring a real date.
"photons and force fields, flesh and blood, why quibble over details. i'm just as real as any of you."
where's the funny man?
"mister tomin, please, why don't, why don't we sit down."
"oh, there he is, there he is. ensign paris, tell us another one of those hologram jokes."
you've been stealing my material?
that guy's so lubricated he'll laugh at anything.
"there he is, the ambassador of humour."
i could use a little help here.
"seven, perhaps now would be a good time to review lesson twenty three, toast of the town."
very well.
"ladies and gentlemen, i require your attention. may cultural differences encourage us to build bridges of understanding. to all that makes us unique."
who is that extraordinary female?
seven of nine.
i want to meet her.
take a number.
that was lovely.
thank you.
"i've got to admit it, you've done wonders. all right, you win."
win?
i know when i'm licked. you tell me when you want me to start those double shifts.
you made a wager regarding me? clarify.
it's not what you think.
"er, don't blame him, it was my idea."
"i believed your interest in my social development was sincere, not motivated by personal gain."
it was sincere.
clearly i am not the only one who requires social lessons. thank you for a lovely evening.
"hey, why don't we go back to my quarters? i've studied human mating rituals."
remove your hand or i will remove your arm.
did you hear what she said to me? i am the guest of honour!
"ambassador, it's been a long day. maybe you should get some rest."
no! i'm not leaving! i want another drink.
i thought synthehol wasn't supposed to have this effect on people.
most people. the enzymes that break down synthehol aren't present in his bloodstream.
can you counteract the effects?
"i can synthesise the enzymes, but that'll take days."
days? the captain will be back in the morning.
maybe he needs a cold shower.
"if his superiors find him like this he'll be banished from the colony, and our trade agreement will go right out the airlock."
"oh, seven of mine."
it may be possible to encode some of my nanoprobes to assimilate the synthehol molecules.
assimilate me.
there may be some adverse effects.
please.
but it's worth a try.
the kadi have rules against medical procedures that haven't been sanctified.
i'd say he's already violated a few rules. what's one more?
"either we treat him or he remains intoxicated. you're his caretaker, decide."
nanoprobes.
i owe you an apology.
nanoprobe extraction is an insignificant procedure. my systems will adapt.
"no, i'm referring to the wager i made with ensign paris. i can see how you might have felt manipulated, but i assure you that was never my intention."
i accept your apology.
"i want to make this perfectly clear so there's no room for misunderstanding. i asked you to go with me to the reception because i enjoy your company. in fact, over the last few days i feel as though we've grown closer."
closer?
we've become more than colleagues. we're friends?
friends. agreed. i should begin.
of course.
"i'll take over from here. mister paris. hypothetically, if one develops romantic feelings for another person, how does one usually go about expressing them? it's for one of seven's social lessons."
ah. i recommend the direct approach. tell the person how you feel.
what if the feelings aren't mutual?
"well, that's the risk you always take."
oh. thank you.
"why don't you tell her? come on, doc. it's obvious the ambassador is not the only one in this room who's intoxicated."
impossible. she's my student.
a hologram and a borg? stranger things have happened. just look at me and b'elanna.
"er, could we walk a little slower?"
they're due back any minute.
but my throat feels like an ancient parchment. can't we go back to sandrine's for a refreshing glass of
"no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"those doors, they're so loud"
you've got a hangover.
"neelix, i don't remember much of last night but, i imagine i might have said some things."
"you spoke eloquently, charmed the entire crew. your reception was a success. understand?"
"yes. neelix, you've been most patient."
"well, that's my job, and it isn't over yet."
welcome back.
good to be home. how's it going?
"all systems functioning normally. ensign kim detected a minor fluctuation in sensor array, but he took care of it."
i was referring to ambassador tomin. did he enjoy his visit?
"oh, well, well, i would say that he, er, he enjoyed himself immensely."
there are many distractions aboard this vessel. you didn't indulge in any of their more colourful traditions?
of course not.
"we followed the itinerary that you approved, to the last detail."
"oh, shame."
your holiness?
"it isn't a violation to explore new experiences, as long as you don't make a habit of it."
i see your point.
"shall we conclude our negotiations, captain?"
by all means.
i'll show you to the briefing room.
"good work, ambassador."
do you like them?
species rosa rubifolia. state your intention.
i wanted to congratulate you on the latest phase of your social development. why don't you read the card?
you are my sunshine.
"these past few days have been unforgettable. you've brought light into my life, seven."
you have developed romantic feelings for me.
"it's as if you've become a part of my programme. when we're apart, i, i feel like i'm missing a subroutine.  i don't expect you to reciprocate, but i wanted you to know how i feel.  computer, end programme."
enter. seven.
i wish to speak with you.
what a coincidence. i was hoping to speak with you as well.
regarding?
you first. what's this?
it's a medical tricorder. i enhanced its scanning resolution by thirty three percent. you once stated you desired a more efficient instrument.
i suppose i did.
"it is a gift. lesson twenty two, thanks for the memories. is it insufficient?"
"no, no, it's very thoughtful."
"i chose to convey my gratitude at this time because i no longer require your assistance. it's obvious there are no potential mates for me aboard this vessel. however, if i encounter a compatible individual in the future, i will again seek your guidance."
guidance. of course.
you said you had something to tell me.
"i just wanted to say, the past few days have been unforgettable. thank you."
you're welcome.
"computer, activate holoprogramme paris three."
"won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead. oh how i need, someone to watch over me."
good morning.
morning.
requisition reports for the week.
thanks.
what can you tell me about the great wall of china?
pardon?
"the great wall of china, on earth. who built it?"
the chinese.
what for?
why does anybody build a wall? to keep people out.
deck one.
in fact it was the first q'in emperor who connected the walls built by a previous dynasty. he did it to prevent an invasion by nomads to the north. how big is it?
i have a feeling you're going to tell me.
"twenty four hundred kilometres long, median width three point eight metres. before the twenty second century, it was one of the only manmade objects that could be seen from earth's orbit with the naked eye."
"very impressive, neelix. i had no idea you knew so much about my homeworld."
status?
we're on a course for the class y cluster. we should be there in about three days.
gives us some time to relax. carry on. why this sudden interest in the great wall?
i've been studying earth landmarks.
mister paris and i have been exchanging a little cross-cultural trivia. he's become quite an expert on talaxian geography.
"all right, here's one for you. what can you tell me about the millennium gate?"
"the millennium gate. constructed in the 21st century in the united states of america. it was another one of the objects that could be seen from orbit. er, three point two kilometres at the base, one kilometre in height, surface covered with highly reflective solar panels. a self-contained ecosystem."
it became a model for the first colony on mars. did you know that one of my ancestors built it?
really?
"not with a hammer and nails, but with words and a lot of courage. shannon o'donnel, one of the first woman astronauts. she was the driving force behind the project."
that's something to be proud of.
we were always told stories about her at family gatherings. the first of a long line of janeway explorers.
tell me more. i want something to stump mister paris with.
where to begin?
the millennium gate. how did she get involved with that?
"well, at that time, she was still in the space programme, but she'd also become something of an entrepreneur. i believe she was asked to join the project by the governor of indiana. he wanted her expertise on recyclic life support systems. the way my aunt martha, tells it they flew her in on a private aircraft."
"five am, december 27th, 2000. i'm in the great state of indiana, i think. i saw the world's largest ball of string this morning, and the world's largest beefsteak tomato this afternoon. it was the size of a volkswagen. the string, not the tomato. at least christmas is over. oh, no."
excuse me. i think i made a wrong turn. is there a millennium gate around here?
you're looking at it.
"the sign said gas, food, lodging. i need all three."
you won't find any of that here. get back on the interstate and go to exit nine.
i don't think i'm gong to make it.
good luck.
"tell me, are people a little friendlier off exit nine?"
"oh, no."
you stopped.
you didn't. got a pen?
"i, i just didn't see you. i'm sorry. are you okay?"
insurance?
not really.
not really?
it ran out.
it's not too bad. two hundred bucks ought to cover it.
two hundred bucks?
"let me guess. the money ran out, too."
hi.
hi
the sign said open?
"yes, that's right. till six o'clock. can we be of assistance?"
"it's cold outside, and i wondered if i could wait here."
for what?
for the tow truck. my car broke down. i'm trying to get to florida.
she doesn't look like a corporate hit man.
i assure you i'm not. at least not anymore.
"well, in any case, she's unarmed and chilled to the bone. i think we can handle her. zeus himself watched over travellers. we should follow his example. make yourself at home."
thank you.
where's your car?
"down the street, next to the coffee shop. what used to be the coffee shop. it looks like this whole town is closed down."
it is.
"except for you, huh?"
"this ship will never sink. right, dad?"
decaf. not exactly the nectar of the gods.
it'll do. thank you.
"what's this about, if i may ask?"
preserving the past.
"i'm jason, by the way."
shannon o'donnel.
i'm henry. henry janeway.
"hi. so, you're trying to get them to stop building this millennium whatever-it-is?"
the millennium gate. the world's first self-sustaining civic environment.
that's what the propaganda calls it. it's nothing but hype. it's actually a glorified shopping mall. they've talked all of my neighbours into selling their businesses. only one thing stands in their way.
you're the last holdout?
"this time, rome withstands the barbarians."
"i may be able to help you, if you'd be willing to hire me."
"believe me, you don't want to be licking stamps for the next two days."
we could do all this on a computer.
"yeah, but my dad doesn't believe in computers. we don't even have one."
"well, i do. we can e-mail every computer within a hundred miles. it'll just take a few hours. it's easy."
"i'm not hiring anybody right now. besides, you're going to florida."
maybe the tow truck is waiting. thanks for the coffee.
you're welcome.
"i wouldn't ask you for a lot. just enough to fix the car. i really, i kind of need a job right now."
dad?
i suppose we could use some help.
"you do believe in electricity, don't you?"
"so, who are these barbarians, anyway?"
a company down in texas
why come here?
"the city fathers made it easy for them. free building permits, deferred taxes, new roads, so the invaders, they return the favour. they have offered us twenty percent above the market price for our properties. you know what the catch is? we've all got to sell."
everybody must love you.
"people i knew when i was growing up, family, friends, it seems like they've all just turned against me. if this were roman times, they'd feed me to the lions."
to the good old days.
"you know, i was born in the wrong millennium."
i'll stick with the modern age.
the classical age. greatest literature mankind ever produced.
no antibiotics.
families who'd take care of one another.
no cars.
air you can breathe.
no telephones.
what a pleasure.
shorter life spans.
lives that were worth living.
no cold beer.
"there you got me. speaking of the modern age, do you have any plans for the millennium eve?"
no different than last year's millennium eve. i plan to be asleep.
life of the party.
"oh, don't tell me you've bought into all that hype again?"
"oh, maybe just a little."
"last year, when 2000 arrived? everyone was convinced it was the dawn of a new era. but when the world didn't end and the flying saucers didn't land and the y2k bug didn't turn off a single light bulb, you'd think everybody would have realised it was a number on a calendar. but, oh, no, they had to listen to all those hucksters who told them the real millennium was 2001. so this new year's eve will be as boring as last year."
"come to think about it, i have sold an awful lot of doomsday books."
see what i mean?
"so, what's in florida?"
i have a cousin down there. i'll stay with her for a while until i can get back on my feet.
"if you don't mind my asking, did you lose your job?"
i'm in a transitional period.
from what to what.
from what i was doing to what i'm going to do. your son tells me that your bookstore's belonged in your family for generations. that you've never done anything else.
"yes, that's right."
"you know, i'm just the opposite. i love to see places i've never been, try new things. i'm kind of an explorer."
really? hmm. that station wagon of yours doesn't exactly look like a sailing ship.
it's a rocket ship.
my mistake.
we have every intention of breaking ground on monday. day one of the next millennium. the people of this town have given us their full cooperation.
that's not true!
"if you'll let me finish, mister janeway. with the exception of mister janeway here."
"mister janeway, would you like to comment?"
"yes. yes, i would. you, you just can't, you can't bulldoze this town away. this, this is our heritage. this is our past."
we're trying to give portage creek a future. can't you see that?
"yeah, yeah, your, your future. your future, not ours."
"mister moss, we've heard you're considering moving the project to one of your alternate sites. can you shed any light on that rumour?"
"i'm afraid that's more than a rumour. if we can't work out an arrangement in portage creek, we'll have no choice but to select another location."
what city?
no comment.
"is it true that canton, ohio has been chosen for the alternate"
thank you for your time.
"thank you, mister moss."
"well, that's that. all we have to do is stand firm till new year's."
easy for you to say. i have to go to school with their kids.
your school is one of the first places they're going to tear down.
"they said they'd build a new one, a better one."
whose side are you on? i'm sorry. we're all in this together. come on. let's head back to civilisation.
"where shall we dine tonight? ah, how does paris sound?"
it's friday night. can we get a reservation?
"well, i think i can arrange it. i know the maitre d."
too bad i don't speak french.
"well, we'll keep it to ourselves. there. to new friends."
and a gracious host.
bon appetit.
i wouldn't mind visiting paris one day.
"yes, it'd be nice."
you haven't been?
"i haven't been outside indiana. these are my travelling companions. they'll take me anywhere, anytime."
it's not such a bad idea to experience the real thing every now and then.
i prefer my books.
maybe you just never had the right guide.
is that an offer? i could make a similar argument. not such a bad idea to settle down every now and then.
"is that an offer? you're a peculiar man, mister janeway. cloistered away with all your books, shutting out the world."
any more peculiar than exploring the midwest in an ailing station wagon?
only slightly. any word on my car?
it's got a brand new oil pan.
you forgot to tell me that.
"well, we were busy today. it's parked behind the garage whenever you're ready."
first thing in the morning.
not so fast. jason told me you promised to show him a few tricks on the computer.
i could use another day of rest.
"great. jason'll be pleased. and when you're done with him, perhaps we'll take a stroll along the boulevard st. germain."
you're making it difficult to say goodbye.
maybe that's the idea.
"you wished to see me, captain?"
i need your help with this. the millennium gate.
impressive.
"it was built by one of my ancestors over three hundred years ago. i've been digging through the historical database, but a lot of the information from that era has been lost or damaged. i thought you might be able to help me reconstruct some of it."
is this relevant to our present mission?
it's relevant to me.
this ancestor of yours is fifteen generations removed. you only possess a small fraction of her genetic material. insignificant.
"this isn't about chromosomes, seven. it's about character."
explain.
"shannon o'donnel inspired me when i was a girl. she had a, an influence on my imagination, on my goals."
i never realised genealogy could have such an impact.
i wouldn't have become a starfleet captain if it wasn't for her.
the temple of artemis at ephesus.
that's four.
the colossus at rhodes.
no. in chronological order.
right. the mausoleum of halicarnassus. the colossus at rhodes.
that leaves just one more.
the seventh wonder of the ancient world is
can't remember?
"oh, it's right on the tip of my tongue. it's. forget it, i give up."
ha! i got you. it's the er.
can't remember?
the lighthouse of alexandria built by ptolemy the second in 280 bc.
behold the wonder of the modern world. borg photographic memory. we'll call this one a draw.
brushing up on earth's history?
captain janeway requested that i research one of her ancestors.
shannon o'donnel.
you've heard of her.
who hasn't? you mind if i lend a hand?
if you wish.
sven 'buttercup' hanson.
he was one of my progenitors. a twenty second century prize-fighter. the captain encouraged me to investigate my genealogy as well.
"well, your ancestors can tell you a lot about yourself."
"somehow, i doubt 'buttercup' has much relevance to me."
the connection could be deeper than you think. sven. seven.
a coincidence.
"the point is, there's some of him in you. just as there'll be some of you in your descendants."
if i choose to procreate.
i wouldn't dismiss it so lightly. someday you may enjoy a little seven of nine point five running around. or not. or not.
my research has failed. i have found no references to this individual.
"well, genealogy's a lot like fishing. you've got to cast a wide net. computer, expand record search for subject shannon o'donnel to include non-federation databases. er, personal archives and photographic indexes, as well."
reference found.
"well, take a look at this. shannon janeway."
where in the world did you find this?
a ferengi database.
ferengi?
"eleven years ago, one of their historians collected massive amounts of data about the origin of space travel in the federation. he wanted to market it as a nostalgic gift item."
i would have been his first customer.
"it's a handsome family, captain."
these must be her sons and daughters. grandchildren. great-grandchildren.
i've also discovered journalistic accounts in the historical archives. mostly articles concerning resistance to the millennium gate.
"the whole town was against her. download this image for me, will you, neelix? i'm going to frame it."
"yes, captain."
"the citizens of canton, ohio greeted millennium gate representatives with a small parade today. canton is one of three alternate sites now being considered by gate officials. vowing not to bow to pressure, henry janeway, owner of portage creek's alexandria books, says he has no intention of closing down. marci collins, channel three news."
"next stop, mars. i used to be in media relations with nasa. as i recall, your class came up with that slogan. do you mind? it's a shame you didn't make the cut."
"not good enough, i guess."
do you still keep in touch with any of the others?
no.
"i do. in fact, i made a few calls last night. remember lieutenant mcmillan?"
how's she doing.
co-pilot on the joint mission with the europeans scheduled for 03. four months on the space station.
not bad for a girl with claustrophobia.
she got over it. sorry to hear about your last job. all this downsizing in aerospace. engineers aren't given the respect they deserve.
who told you i lost my job?
"i made a few calls. you don't have to live like this. borrowing money, sleeping in your car."
you've got no business checking up on me.
"actually, i do. we run a history on all our candidates."
are you trying to make me some kind of an offer?
we know you've been working closely with henry janeway. he'll listen to you.
"oh. you want me to talk to him, get him to change his mind."
if you can.
and in return?
we'd give you a job. make you a consulting engineer on the project. you certainly have the credentials. well?
i'll think about it.
think quickly. we can't wait another thousand years.
"roger that, and go ahead."
"that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
morning.
morning.
i didn't think you'd mind. you've got some really great games on this.
don't worry about it. have you tried matrix of doom?
"oh, yeah. i got vaporised on level six."
try launching a flare before entering the steel fortress.
cool. coffee?
please. where is your father?
"bloomington. all the suppliers in town are boycotting us, so he went up there to place some orders."
he left you in charge?
"alexandria books, may i help you?"
sounds like you've got it down.
i pay the bills too. dad's not very good at accounting. you have any kids?
no.
not a priority?
"i wouldn't say that. i just never got around to it. if you don't mind me asking, where's your mom?"
she died.
"oh, i'm sorry."
"i was really young. i don't remember her much. dad says none of the great heroes grew up in a nuclear family. hercules, achilles, odysseus. they all grew up with single parents."
"you're in good company. you like working here, jason?"
it's okay.
"you know, i get the feeling you don't share your father's enthusiasm about preserving the past."
i don't know. the millennium gate could be pretty cool.
did you ever see the first landing on the moon? one small step for man.
they showed it in science class one time.
i saw it on tv when i was eleven years old. the whole world watched it.
must have been great.
"oh, it way. so, do you have any heroes?"
"we are not living in a heroic age, that's what my dad says."
"come on, there's got to be somebody."
"dad. i mean, he's a pain sometimes, but he's pretty cool.  alexandria books, may i help you? that's all right. first call in three days and it's a wrong number."
"glorious hector, son of priam, slips past the greek front lines bringing much-needed supplies to the embattled city of troy."
"hey, dad you're famous."
local business owner topples gate.
let it fall. any customers this morning?
no one here but us galliforms.
that's chickens for the non-scientists in the crowd.
you two are dangerous together. portage creek will thank us one day. you don't sacrifice history for a shopping mall.
"it's a little more than that, henry."
i beg your pardon?
"i said, it's not just a mall."
have you read the promotional literature? over six hundred retail spaces available. franchise potential.
"there's a commercial dimension to the project, but that's not its only function."
what's your point?
"i've learned a few details about the millennium gate. it's a self-sustaining city, an experimental biosphere. it's never been done before."
what's wrong with the biosphere we're living in now?
nothing.
exactly.
but this project will help scientists learn more about our environment. possibly even recreate it on other worlds.
other worlds? don't we have enough problems on the one we're on?
yeah. which is why i'd like to get the hell off it one day.
i think you're taking this exploring a little too far.
"and you're so afraid of change you can barely walk out that front door. the millennium gate has a lot of potential, henry. you just can't see it. all you can see are these books. you're living in the past."
sounds like you've been sleeping with the enemy.
"having a beer, anyway."
moss.
he offered me a job.
doing what?
consulting engineer.
on the millennium gate?
i said i'd think about it.
"and he said, get janeway to sign on the dotted line and you're hired?"
that's one way of looking at it.
"and when i say no, then what? you're going to go with them, right? to canton, ohio, or the third circle of hell, or wherever it is they decide to build this damn thing."
i can't keep living out of my car.
you don't have to. stay here.
no.
why not?
because i can't.
that's not a reason.
"because i don't want to! you've been really nice to me, henry, but i can't get stuck here."
stuck? like me?
i didn't say that. you can live however you want to.
and so can you.
what's going on?
we're helping our guest resume her journey.
but i thought you were staying here for a while.
something came up.
we can manage by ourselves. i guess saying goodbye isn't that difficult after all.
"jason. jason, where you going?"
aunt pat's. happy new year.
jason? jason!
it was around 2210. my uncle jack was on a deep space mission to beta capricus.
that's when deep space meant the next star over.
"and that was when they still had to go into stasis. so, jack put his crew under as soon as they left orbit, and piloted the ship by himself for six months."
no contact with anybody along the way?
there wasn't anybody along the way. not back then. the transmitter wasn't even subspace. it took weeks to get a message back to earth.
i would prefer stasis.
"me too. that long alone, i'd probably go a little batty."
"so, six months to beta capricus and when they finally arrive, there's nothing there."
no planets?
"no. no star, no nothing. it turns out beta capricus was just an em echo of a distant galaxy."
what was his course of action?
what else could he do? he turned the ship around and headed home.
and the crew?
"he figured there was no reason to bother them. there's nothing to see, nothing to do. so six months later he gets back to earth, brings everybody out of stasis, and they wake up wondering why they haven't left orbit."
come in.
oh. i didn't realise you were in a briefing.
not at all. we're talking about our family histories.
oh. this can wait. may i join you?
please.
"i, too, come from a distinguished line."
his cousin's an electric shaver.
hardly. my programme was compiled from the most advanced holo-matrices in the federation. my cousin was a prize-winning chess programme.
"ensign paris, you have yet to elaborate on your family origins."
"well, they were a pretty ordinary bunch, salt of the earth type people. farmers, mostly. some planetary colonists. ah, but there was one. he was a pilot. he flew the first orbital glider over the lower martian plateau."
mars? your ancestor must have known the captain's.
"she did work on all the early mars projects. looks like we go way back, mister paris."
what was her name?
shannon o'donnel.
o'donnel. i don't think so.
what do you mean?
"well, i know all the mars projects from the 1970s on. unmanned, manned, who's who. there were no o'donnels in any of them."
come in.
ship's status report.
"let me guess. the holographic engineer is having problems with her programme. neelix, the cardassian cook, is low on supplies. seven of twelve is regenerating and captain chakotay is doing just fine. just wondering how they'll piece together our lives a few hundred years from now."
depends on how big the pieces are.
"a padd here, a captain's log there, maybe a couple of holodeck programmes. it won't be as much to go on as we might think. i've gone through dozens of histories written about twenty first century earth, all of them biased in one way or another. the vulcans describe first contact with a savagely illogical race. ferengi talk about wall street as if it were holy ground. the bolians express dismay at the low quality of human plumbing. and human historians? exact same story. every culture saw it a different way. so i go back to the raw material. birth certificates, death certificates, marriage certificates, census surveys, voter registration forms, housing records, medical, employment, court records. it's all fragmented and incomplete."
"so, did she exist?"
"her name was shannon o'donnel. she did train to be an astronaut, but she didn't finish. she was an engineer, but never worked on the mars missions."
did she work on the millennium gate?
only as a consultant.
what about all the opposition you spoke of? you said she fought to get the project underway.
"there was no opposition. in fact, the millennium gate was greeted with open arms by the local population. except for one man."
henry janeway.
"she married him, and changed her name. but she certainly never changed history."
don't be too hard on her. she may not have known she was supposed to live up to your expectations.
"oh, i'll get over it. the question is, when we get back to earth, how will i break the news to aunt martha?"
"with less than three hours to go, henry janeway still refuses to cooperate with millennium gate representatives. i'll return with live updates as midnight approaches. marci collins, channel three news."
i don't suppose there's any chance he'll change his mind?
by midnight? doubtful.
"then it looks like we'll have to scrub the launch, at least where portage creek is concerned. it's a shame how one ignorant man can stand in the way of progress."
it's not that simple.
"henry's a very likable guy, but he's playing for the wrong team. he's looking back. this town needs people who look towards the future."
"well, while you're looking forward, i'll be driving to florida."
wait a minute. i'm not about to turn a fellow explorer out into the cold.
i didn't hold up my end of the bargain.
"if we didn't think you had something to add to this project, we never would have made the offer in the first place. henry janeway's pigheadedness doesn't change that. we could still use your help, just not here."
my associate in canton. i'll tell him you're on the way. he'll find a place for you.
shannon!
what's the matter?
it's dad.
see you in ohio?
he won't leave the shop. there's all these people outside. the police are there.
your father can take care of himself.
"please, won't you talk to him? he'll listen to you."
"no, he doesn't, jason."
where are you going? and what's this about i'll see you in ohio?
ohio. florida.
what's wrong with this place?
it didn't work out.
i thought you liked us.
i do.
then why are you leaving?
i'm sorry.
"december 31st, 2000. eleven fifteen pm. i've got ninety five miles of interstate before i have to decide whether i head east or south, but those ninety five miles won't be uneventful. my guidebook tells me i'm not too far from leonardo da vinci's last supper, recreated entirely in corn."
"the last few days have been memorable, to say the least. i met henry janeway. interesting man. liked to talk. unfortunately, he doesn't listen to anybody but himself. he gave me a place to stay, though. and we had dinner. in paris, no less. he has a son. good kid. bright, like his father."
"i personally don't regret a single day i've spent in this lovely town, and i want to thank you all for your encouragement and support."
would you consider extending your deadline?
excuse me. i'm sorry.
no further.
i'm afraid that's not possible. we'd like to express our deepest regrets to the town of portage creek and on behalf of. excuse me.
get this.
let her through.
we're closed.
it's me!
"i said, we're closed."
"that's not what the sign says. damn it, henry, it's cold out here."
who's with you?
nobody but us galliforms.
thought you'd be in ohio by now. car break down again? what the hell are you doing?
get your things. we're leaving.
i'm not going anywhere.
do i have to drag you out the front door?
you can try.
henry.
i won't leave.
it's over.
then i'll have to ask you to leave.
half the town is out there. you're on the news. maybe you'll go down in history. you have made your point.
"obviously, i haven't, because if i had you wouldn't be asking me to sign my life away."
maybe if you'd looked up from your books once in a while you'd see what's in front of you.
"oh, please, no more speeches about the future."
as long as i don't have to hear you pontificate about the past.
it's a deal. glad we had this chat. goodbye.
"it's almost midnight, henry."
exactly. i've won.
what have you won? the right to hide behind these shelves for the rest of your life?
it's worked so far.
"well, it isn't working for your son, or this town, or me."
"look, i know you've got a job to do."
"oh, this isn't about the job."
then why are you here?
it was the cookies.
cookies?
"i was on the interstate. i stopped for gas, and i bought a bag of chocolate chip cookies in a convenience store. it's a little ritual of mine. whenever i get back on the highway, i like to treat myself."
"i see. well, er, what does this have to do with anything?"
"they didn't taste good, henry. it wasn't the same. i just kept thinking about you, and how i wish you'd been there."
"actually, i prefer oatmeal cookies. i'm allergic to chocolate."
"oh, you don't know what you're missing. it's been a long time, but i'm starting to feel like maybe i found a place where i'd like to stick around for a while, with you and jason."
and we'd like to have you.
"but i can't work in a bookstore for the rest of my life. i've been given a second chance, henry, and i can't lose that. i'm stuck in the future, you're stuck in the past. but maybe we could get unstuck in the present."
"i, i don't see how with, without sacrificing my"
"you know, mister moss offered me a job in canton, even though i failed to keep up my end of the bargain. i guess he felt sorry for me. but i'm prepared to turn him down if you want me to stay with you."
i suppose i could re-open my shop in that monstrosity you want to build.
"well, i'll have a few connections. i could probably get you a nice remote location, so nobody would bother you."
not much profit in that. you sure you won't drive away again?
"no, but if i do, we'll make the trip together."
what time is it?
a minute to midnight.
then we're not too late.
neelix to captain janeway.
yes?
"captain, would you mind coming to the mess hall?"
is there a problem?
"no, no emergency. but i need to speak with you. a personal matter."
give me a minute.
happy ancestor's eve!
"happy ancestor's eve, captain."
what's all this?
"it's april 22, ancestor's eve. it's a holiday first established, er, well, er, today, actually. with the captain's permission."
neelix.
"i think he's onto something, captain. an evening of reflection in honour of those who came before."
"here, here, uncle jack would approve."
it got me out from under a warp conduit. i'm all for it.
"i appreciate what you're trying to do, but"
"neelix, the gift."
what gift?
"shannon o'donnel janeway, circa 2050. we did a little more research. this photograph was taken in a small park near portage creek, thirty eight years after the dedication of the millennium gate. i thought it would look nice in your ready room, on the shelf next to your desk."
"thank you, but i'm not so sure she has a place there any more."
"you are mistaken, captain."
oh?
her life captured your imagination. historical details are irrelevant.
i concur with that analysis.
"if it weren't for shannon o'donnel, you never would have joined starfleet."
"yeah, and i would have never have got you all stuck here in the delta quadrant."
it gave us all time to get to know each other.
"time for a family portrait of our own. everyone, gather around the captain, please. face the camera. smile."
to family.
to family.
another one for posterity.
"no, no."
i think we should get out of here.
enough is enough.
"knock it off, kieran. that's an order."
you're late.
"sorry, sir."
what's the threshold of the h-two molecule?
fourteen point seven electron volts.
third brightest star in orion?
viewed from where?
earth.
"gamma orionis, or bellatrix, if you prefer the original arabic name."
"not bad. now, give me a hug, katie, that's an order."
i wasn't expecting a pop quiz.
just wanted to make sure all those pips haven't made you forget you're a scientist first.
how could they? i still have nightmares about your fractal calculus final.
"there's still some work to be done, but once the sawdust clears, i think you'll be impressed. voyager may not be as big as a galaxy class ship but she's quick and smart, like her captain."
"seven hundred thousand metric tons, fifteen decks, and computer systems augmented with bio-neural circuitry, top cruising speed warp nine point nine seven five."
deck one.
"of course, i expect to get that up another notch or two."
sounds like you already know your ship pretty well.
i've been buried in voyager's schematics for the past three months. i could walk the corridors blindfolded.
you might not want to shut your eyes just yet.
captain on the bridge.
as you were. it's bigger than i expected.
schematics never fully prepare you for the real thing.
"try it on. don't get too comfortable, i have more to show you."
your home away from home.
coffee?
"ah, no thanks."
"coffee, black. any word from tuvok?"
not yet.
shouldn't he have made contact by now?
we know he's aboard chakotay's ship. he's probably decided not to risk exposure until he has to.
"catching up with him in the badlands is going to be tricky, even in a ship as quick and smart as voyager. i've heard about a pilot who might make the job easier."
who's that?
tom paris.
"admiral paris's son? correct me if i'm wrong, but he's serving a sentence for"
he's made some mistakes. but everybody deserves a second chance.
i'll look into it.
"if it's not too late, i'd like to recalibrate the navigational sensors. i think i can enhance the range."
"your coffee's not even cold, you're already making changes."
"excuse us, ensign. i like a ship that knows where it's going."
"i assure you, voyager has the best sensors in the fleet."
there's always room for improvement.
i assume you've read
i have. a few changes
the bridge is clear. no sign of the weapon.
continue scanning.
acknowledged.
your briefing room.
"starfleet's most up to date vessel and they still can't design a comfortable place to hold a meeting. what do you think, ensign?"
captain?
what's your opinion of this room?
it is an efficient design.
"well, there you have it, admiral. it's efficient. i must be wrong. carry on."
we've added a new system we're thinking of installing throughout the fleet.
"the emergency medical hologram. i'm up to date. computer, activate emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
it's programmed with over four million surgical procedures.
"five million, and the medical knowledge of over three thousand cultures."
impressive.
did you call me to chitchat or is there an actual emergency?
its personality could use some work.
i'm designed to practice medicine as efficiently as possible. small talk only compromises my performance.
"thank you, doctor. computer, deactivate emh."
hello.
sir.
lieutenant carey. i don't think we've met.
"jameson, anna, service number eight six zero seven nine zero."
i'm not security. i'm just trying to get to know all the new faces around here. what are you working on?
i am attempting to realign the eps manifolds.
do you need a hand?
no.
"well, maybe i'll see you in the mess hall later."
unlikely.
hmm?
i am not a member of voyager's crew. i'm on assignment here at utopia planitia.
"too bad. well, next time i'm in the neighbourhood, i'll drop by and say hello."
i wish starfleet would give me more than three weeks. with a little more time we could really explore the badlands.
you haven't changed a bit.
"main engineering. class nine warp drive, tricyclic input manifold. you'll be the first to test it in deep space."
"i've localised the temporal distortions. deck four, section thirty nine."
i've found the weapon.
begin the procedure.
problem?
one of the eps relays just went offline.
voyager's first malfunction.
"i'm sorry, captain. i tested those systems this morning."
"as you were, lieutenant. i've been looking forward to getting my hands dirty."
the weapon is out of phase. you've sent me to the wrong time frame.
at least we know where the weapon was placed. now we have to determine when.
this hatch is locked from the inside.
this isn't a secure area. none of these hatches should be sealed.
i'm reading some kind of chronoton flux.
chronotons?
it's coming from inside this jefferies tube.
patterson to security. seal off deck four.
i've been detected. i must leave.
there's too much interference from the weapon. recalibrate your temporal transport beacon.
understood.
we can access section thirty nine through here.
"scramble the locking mechanism before they get in. hurry, they're approaching your coordinates. you'll need to reset the command controls."
stand by. we're trying to get you out of there.
it's time. pull her out.
there's too much interference. if i transport her now we'll damage her bionetic implants.
"if we don't, captain janeway's going to find her and it'll contaminate the timeline."
sir.
now.
temporal transport in progress.
"question, admiral. what causes a chronoton flux of point zero zero three?"
i don't know.
"neither do i, but whoever or whatever it was, it's gone now."
the subject is approaching the temporal threshold.
i told you this was going to happen. she's dead.
any luck reviving her?
"no, sir."
we'll have to recruit her again.
"sir, a fourth jump? she could suffer neural damage, even temporal psychosis."
"unless we repair the timeline, she's going to die. we're giving her another chance to save her crew and herself. we'll go back and retrieve seven of nine a microsecond before the explosion. that way no one will notice she's gone. tempus fugit, lieutenant."
"raise shields. time frame, stardate 52861.274. delta quadrant. spatial coordinates eighty seven theta by two seventy one. target, uss voyager."
"follow the light. to the left, right, and up, and down. hmm."
i ran a complete self-diagnostic.
hmm hmm?
"at first i thought my ocular implants were malfunctioning. however, after consulting the starfleet medical database, i realise it is a flaw in my human physiology."
specifically?
"i'm experiencing dizziness, double vision. after considering all potential environmental and genetic factors, i've concluded i'm suffering from albright-salzman syndrome."
a rare neurological condition that hasn't affected a single human being for over two centuries. unlikely.
"human physiology is imperfect, susceptible to a variety of disorders."
"true, but in this instance, we can safely say that you are suffering from a mild case of sensory aphasia. a minor disruption to your neuro-receptors. neither rare, nor life-threatening."
apparently i was in need of a second opinion.
that's the danger of self-diagnosis. patients always assume the worst. this should clear it up. how do things look now?
normal.
"doctor, please report to sickbay."
"on my way. next time your human physiology fails you, don't consult the database. just call me."
you are the database.
with two legs and a splendid bedside manner.
a curious exercise.
"yeah. ping-pong. you should try it, it's a great test of hand-eye coordination."
i don't require testing.
"yeah, so the doc tells me. a visual acuity index of ninety nine point six. you know, you'd be great at this game. why don't you be my partner in the doubles tournament tonight? chapman was supposed to play, but he's come down with a nasty case of space sickness."
i'm busy.
"oh, too bad. well, i guess i'll have to tell b'elanna that you thought you couldn't beat her."
you're attempting to appeal to my vanity.
is it working?
i will consider your request.
"it's yes or no, seven. the tournament's tonight."
yes.
great. meet me in the mess hall at nineteen hundred hours. we'll get in a little practice first.
"captain, you don't look well. come in, please."
i'm sure it's nothing serious.
symptoms?
"nausea, dizziness."
it looks like a simple case of space sickness. the third one i've treated today.
that's odd. we haven't run into any turbulence.
it's possible the inertial dampers are out of alignment.
"even so, i've been on some pretty rough rides. it's never affected me like this"
it happens to everyone. twenty milligrams of inaprovaline should restore your space legs.
i'll check the dampers. double check your bio-readings. see if there's another explanation.
yes!
"point, server."
it's all in the wrist.
score?
nineteen eighteen.
"say goodnight, harry."
what do you call that shot?
i'm reading temporal distortions.
report.
the temporal distortions are fracturing space-time throughout the ship.
cause?
"unknown. they appear to be emanating from deck four, section thirty nine."
"we've already erected forcefields but they're not having much effect. if we can't find a way to stop them, they'll tear the ship apart."
how much time do we have?
two hours at most.
go to deck four and find out what we're dealing with. let's see if we can find a way to enhance the forcefields.
an injection a day keeps space sickness away. you try to be funny after treating thirty seven cases of nausea.
janeway to sickbay.
go ahead.
we've found the source of our epidemic. temporal distortions.
i was beginning to suspect some kind of anomaly. i've designed a treatment that seems to be inhibiting the symptoms.
keep me posted.
"aye, captain."
neelix to the doctor. i've got a medical emergency in the mess hall. ensign mannus is violently ill.
on my way. take over here.
"doctor, shall i whip you up a photonic snack?"
where's the medical emergency?
i hope you're not referring to this pot roast.
you called me a few minutes ago. you said ensign mannus was ill.
i did?
yes.
ensign mannus is right over there. he came in an hour ago and he looks perfectly normal.
acute space sickness.
good thing you were here.
"i wouldn't have been, if you hadn't. temporal distortions."
doctor?
"this is all starting to make sense. in sickbay, it's fifteen hundred hours forty three minutes, but in the mess hall, it's fifteen thirty six."
seven minutes earlier.
i did get a call from you. you just haven't made it yet.
"coffee, black.  come in. before you say anything, let me remind you what happens to bearers of bad news."
don't kill the messenger.
"go ahead, fire."
it looks like these space-time fractures are growing stronger. we're detecting temporal paradoxes throughout the ship.
paradoxes?
internal chronometers show it's oh six hundred on deck nine and oh six hundred five on deck thirteen. time's passing more quickly in some parts of the ship and slowing down in others.
maybe that explains why this coffee tastes like it's three days old.
the same thing's been happening in the mess hall. food replicated less than an hour ago is already spoiled.
"i've been working on a way to enhance our containment fields, to keep the fractures from spreading,"
"i'll get a team on it right away. in the meantime, we should evacuate the affected areas."
see to it.
there's one other problem.
turbolifts two and three are offline so we've been using the jefferies tube.
captain?
there's a temporal distortion intersecting this room. it's expanding.
time to test your new containment fields.
this is where they're coming from. i still can't tell what's causing them.
what is it?
a piece of technology. it's emitting temporal distortions.
why can't i see it?
my ocular implant can detect irregularities in space-time.
torres to bridge. we've found the problem.
there's some kind of device in junction beta twenty eight.
beam it off the ship
i can't get a lock.
"the distortions are beginning to demolecularise the hull. hull breach, ventral section fourteen."
"captain, i'm picking up a strange reading on deck four."
what kind of reading?
"it's a chronoton flux, point zero zero three."
more distortions?
i don't think so.
dry dock.
ma'am?
"the first time i saw these readings was five years ago. voyager was still in dry dock. same readings, same location."
what caused them?
i never found out.
we're losing structural integrity.
"multiple breaches, all decks. emergency systems are failing."
the distortions are ripping us apart. we have to abandon ship.
"all hands, this is the captain. proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship. repeat, abandon ship."
programme the pods for a heading of one seven eight mark four. we'll rendezvous in orbit of an m class planet at those coordinates. repeat. all hands proceed to the escape pods and abandon ship.
identify yourselves.
no time.
welcome back.
why have you brought me here?
"for some reason, i always think you'll remember. i'm captain braxton. this is lieutenant ducane. you're aboard the federation timeship relativity."
i'm no longer in the twenty fourth century?
"no. for you, it's almost five hundred years later. we've brought you here to help us solve a mystery. someone, we don't know who, has planted a weapon aboard voyager. it's designed to fracture space-time within a radius of one hundred and fifty metres."
why do you need me?
your ocular implant. it can detect disruptions in space-time better than our sensors.
"you're more familiar with voyager and her crew, less likely to arouse suspicion. so far, you've been quite useful."
so far?
we've recruited you twice before for this mission. take a look. a force three temporal disrupter. your previous attempts to disable it have been unsuccessful.
we're trying to catch the saboteur before he places the weapon on voyager.
do you have a suspect?
not yet.
do you know when the device was placed?
"not precisely, but we've narrowed the window to a period two years before you joined the crew, when the ship was under attack."
"species three two nine, the kazon."
our database indicates voyager was boarded twice during that period.
the kazon are an inferior species. they don't possess the technology to create such a complex weapon.
we believe the saboteur infiltrated this time frame because voyager's shields were down. it was the perfect opportunity to evade the detection.
"if i fail, you will recruit me again."
"if necessary. this'll be the third time you're going to be removed from your time frame. if we do it a fourth, there could be certain side effects."
side effects?
you might experience sensory aphasia. it affects the cerebral cortex and can lead to temporal psychosis.
"but in your case we're hoping third time's a charm, eh?"
i'll do my best.
bring her up to date on our protocols.
"aye, sir."
"when you're finished here, meet me in holomatrix one. i've prepared a simulation."
let's see how much you've assimilated. the dali paradox.
also known as the melting clock effect. it refers to a temporal fissure which slows the passage of time to a gradual halt.
the pogo paradox.
a causality loop in which interference to prevent an event actually triggers the same event.
excellent. can you give me an example?
"the borg once travelled back in time to stop zefram cochrane from breaking the warp barrier. they succeeded, but that in turn led the starship enterprise to intervene. they assisted cochrane with the flight the borg was trying to prevent. causal loop complete."
"so, in a way, the federation owes its existence to the borg."
you're welcome. the seven of nine paradox.
i beg your pardon?
how we do know that my presence on voyager will not alter the timeline?
"you know, you've asked me this every time."
what's been your response?
that uncertainty is part of the equation. we don't know what's going to happen.
i don't enjoy uncertainty.
"neither do i. but i trust captain braxton's instincts, just as you trust captain janeway's."
"this is a simulation of junction forty nine on voyager's fourth deck. thanks to you, we've learned that the temporal disrupter was, and will be, concealed here. i gave up trying to keep my tenses straight years ago."
how will i disarm it?
"you've already tried, unsuccessfully. the weapon's out of phase. you'll have to find the saboteur before he plants it. this will detect any chronoton flux other than your own, and i'm authorising you to use whatever force may be necessary."
understood.
one more thing. watch out for the janeway factor.
i am not familiar with that protocol.
"your captain has a knack for sticking her nose where it doesn't belong, especially when it comes to time travel."
captain janeway is quite resourceful. has it occurred to you that she may be helpful?
helpful? that woman has been responsible for three major temporal incursions.
no doubt creating numerous paradoxes.
and who do you think had to repair the damage? me. she's reckless. she has no regard for the integrity of the timeline. i asked for her help once. she refused and i ended up stranded in the late twentieth century. have you ever been to that time frame?
no.
"well, i don't recommend it. after three decades with those post-industrial barbarians i had to go through extensive rehabilitation before i could return to duty. avoid contact with janeway. that's an order."
"yes, sir."
this will occlude your borg implants. ready?
yes.
we have a saying in our line of work. there's no time like the past.
"raise shields. time frame, stardate 49123.5621. delta quadrant. spatial coordinates, twenty one alpha prime by nine three six zeta. target, uss voyager."
"all hands to battle stations. we're under attack. repeat, all hands to battle stations."
return fire.
dropping spatial charges.
evasive manoeuvres.
shields down to twenty percent.
another kazon ship is approaching.
janeway to engineering. we need warp engines.
i can't give them to you. not until i've repaired the containment generator.
time?
i'll need ten minutes at least.
"captain, i'm picking up a strange reading on deck four."
what kind of reading?
"it's a chronoton flux, point zero zero three."
any idea what's causing it?
not yet.
it could be random interference from kazon weapons fire.
i don't think so. i've seen these readings before.
there's no sign of the weapon.
any uninvited guests?
not yet.
the lead vessel's been disabled. the others are regrouping.
"b'elanna, status."
"warp drive's online, but the containment field's still unstable. warp two is the best i can give you."
i'll take it. engage.
they're not pursuing.
dry dock.
ma'am?
"the first time i saw these readings was over two years ago when voyager was in dry dock. same readings, same location."
what caused them?
i never found out. the signal vanished before we could isolate it. erect a level ten forcefield around that section.
is this really the time to be chasing sensor ghosts?
"something tells me this is more than a coincidence. seal off deck four. tuvok, you're with me."
"they've erected forcefields around my location. i may have been detected. how shall i proceed? lieutenant, respond."
what's wrong?
the forcefields are blocking our transmissions.
"compensate. seven of nine, report."
"relativity, are you there?"
"it's no use, sir. she can't hear us."
"i don't believe we've been introduced, ensign."
lower the forcefield.
i stand corrected. we have met. utopia
"planitia, the briefing room. you told me it"
was efficient.
janeway.
you've
mistaken me for someone else.
"oh, i don't think so."
"so, here you are, two years later"
on the other side of the galaxy. imagine that.
you're preventing me from completing a vital mission.
"who are you, and what are you doing on my ship?"
don't say anything
"she can't hear you, sir."
"my designation is irrelevant, but i assure you i have no hostile"
intentions.
"somehow, i don't find that very comforting. are you working with the kazon?"
"no, i am not."
i'm detecting biomechanical implants. they have a borg signature.
janeway to the bridge. scan the vicinity for borg ships.
did you say borg?
do it.
you will find none.
then how did you get here?
i'm no longer borg.
then who are you?
i can't answer your questions.
good.
why not?
it would be a violation of the temporal prime directive.
you're from another time?
yes.
no.
who sent you?
i can't tell you that. i would be risking damage to the timeline.
"i don't care if history itself comes unravelled, i want to know"
why you're on my ship.
what's that?
you must release me.
why?
voyager is in grave danger.
so we've noticed.
"not from the kazon. from an act of sabotage. i've been sent here to stop it. the intruder has already boarded the ship. please, your lives depend on it."
you're not going anywhere until you tell me what's happening.
"my name is seven of nine. i'm a member of your crew. rather, i will be a member of your crew."
i've travelled back in time to try to prevent a disaster that will destroy voyager.
get her out of there.
i'm trying.
let's see if i've got this straight. you're a borg drone attempting to prevent a disaster that won't occur for another three years?
three years six months and two days.
does this make any sense to you?
"like most time paradoxes, it's implausible, but not necessarily illogical."
"captain, when you take me from the borg you are going to tell me that part of being human is learning to trust. trust me now."
lower the forcefield.
seven of nine to braxton. respond.
stay where you are. we're pulling you out.
that would be unwise. i am pursuing the saboteur
with captain janeway's assistance.
tempus fugit.
proceed.
"yes, sir. the intruder is in junction fifty two beta."
take the starboard hatch.
"aye, captain."
captain braxton. lower the temporal disruptor.
it's armed. i'll activate it. lower your weapons.
janeway.
have we met?
"too many times, but you wouldn't remember. they haven't occurred yet."
"seven of nine, report."
i have located the saboteur.
who is it?
"it's you,"
captain braxton.
me?
"more accurately, a future you."
now let me complete our mission.
our mission? i don't know what you're talking about.
listen
"very carefully. the circumstances of your life are going to change in the next few years. you'll be sent into rehabilitation again, forced to retire, and it's all because of voyager."
"captain, i believe your future self is suffering from temporal psychosis."
"well of course i am, you pedantic drone. the only way for me, for us, to recover is to obliterate voyager from the timeline. that way, none of the events that caused this illness will have occurred."
what events?
thirty years of exile on twentieth century earth. the temporal inversion in the takara sector. three violations that i had to repair.
can you get a lock on him?
"negative. he's activated a dispersal node. i should say, you've activated a dispersal node."
don't be absurd. i have no wish to sabotage voyager.
not yet.
"remodulate the transporters. find a way to cut through the interference. i gave you an order, lieutenant."
"i'm sorry, sir. i'm taking command of this vessel, and i'm relieving you of duty for crimes you're going to commit."
i haven't done anything.
seven of nine
apprehend braxton.
no.
"relativity, he's escaped."
"i'm tracking him. he's travelled to another time frame, two years earlier."
transport me to those coordinates.
that would be your fourth jump.
i am aware of the risks.
stand by.
thank you for your assistance.
"there's still some work to be done but, er, once the sawdust clears i think you'll be impressed. voyager may not be as big as a galaxy class ship but she's quick"
take cover!
"security, report to deck four, section twelve. erect forcefields around all access points. is this part of the tour?"
i've lost him.
he's still on voyager
but he's gone five years ahead.
initiate transport.
yes!
"point, server."
it's all in the wrist.
score?
nineteen eighteen.
who are you?
"bridge, intruder alert, deck two."
explain.
no time. you must apprehend him. he's trying to destroy voyager.
"seven of nine, status."
i am incapacitated. it's sensory aphasia.
stand by.
i'm pulling you out.
stop him. your future depends on it.
braxton?
i disabled his tricorder. he's trapped there. seven of nine is pursuing him. she is efficient. she will succeed.
"let's hope so, because we've run out of options."
you again!
"i don't believe we've met, ensign. no, i'm wrong, we have met. captain braxton."
not anymore. i've lost my rank thanks to you.
seven of nine to seven of nine. what's your status?
we've apprehended braxton. how shall we proceed?
stand by.
long time no see.
"are you all right, seven?"
i believe we've just prevented voyager's destruction.
would you care to explain how you
the timeship relativity.
we need your help.
"this seven of nine stopped braxton, but she created several temporal incursions along the way. she instigated a phaser fight at utopia planitia. she was seen by you and lieutenant tuvok two years before she joined your crew. and she interacted with her past self in front of fifteen crew members at a ping-pong tournament approximately six minutes ago. your time frame, of course."
of course.
"needless to say, we need to clean up the timeline. someone must go back to the beginning and prevent the chain of events from occurring in the first place."
i can't make another jump without damaging myself.
i get the feeling i'm about to be drafted.
"in exchange for leniency, captain braxton informed us of the precise moment he boarded voyager to plant the weapon. we'll be sending you to stop him. tell her."
"deck four, section thirty eight. i'll stumble over a wounded crewmember. that will be your chance to capture me."
"don't miss it, or we'll have to do this all over again."
"wait a minute, let me get this straight. i'm going back in time to stop braxton. but you already have him."
"and there's a third one in our brig. i arrested him earlier today. but, don't worry. they'll all be reintegrated in time for the trial."
and seven?
"oh, i assure you, when all this is over there'll be just one seven of nine."
all right. let's get started before my headache gets any worse.
"captain, a kazon torpedo just blew out the containment generator. do you want me to reroute emergency power or take the warp core offline?"
use your best judgment.
i thought you were on your way to the bridge.
"i have to take care of something first. now get moving, lieutenant."
send damage control teams to decks nine through fourteen. seal the breaches if you can. i'll be on the bridge. keep me informed.
"yes, ma'am."
oh!
come here often?
incursion factor point zero zero three six. it's better than i expected.
glad we could lend a hand. when do we go home?
"you'll both be returned to your time frame. you'll be reintegrated with the other seven of nine. since none of your time jumps were to your foreseeable future, only the past, i see no reason to resequence your memory engrams. but remember the temporal prime directive. discuss your experiences with no one."
understood.
"oh, captain. braxton was right about one thing. voyager shows up on our sensors far too often. try to avoid time travel."
see you in the twenty fourth century.
"i look forward to it, or should i say, backward?"
don't get started.
show mercy.
"your people have a saying. fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. in other words, your credit's no good here."
i'll pay you back double with next month's replicator rations.
that's what you said when i let you replicate all those pork rinds for your monster movie marathon.
let me put it another way. this is a life and death situation.
hyperbole won't help.
i'm not exaggerating. this is the anniversary of my first date with b'elanna.
and you forgot all about it?
yes. and if i don't come through with some kind of romantic dinner
"all right, you've made your case."
"neelix, you're a saint. okay, that'll be one bottle of mouton rothschild, a 2342 if it's in the database. a terrelian pheasant, steamed asparagus, and a single rose."
where do you want it?
"you can send the food requisition to b'elanna's replicator, the wine and the flower i'll take with me. i can't show up empty-handed."
"neelix, how about a pot of coffee while you're at it?"
coming right up.
flowers and wine?
"ah, anniversary. coffee?"
bridge duty. i've got eight hours ahead of me.
sitting in the big chair again?
fourth night in a row.
you're not fooling anyone.
excuse me?
you love these night shifts. your chance to play captain.
i'm not playing. this is an opportunity to get command experience. you might put in for some yourself.
"oh, what's the point of trying to compete with an ambitious upstart like you? just promise me one thing. when you reach the top, you'll remember all the little people you climbed over to get there. you won't make them work night shifts?"
"helm, status?"
same as it was twenty minutes ago.
refresh my memory.
"current speed warp six point three, heading oh twenty one mark two. permission to speak freely, sir?"
granted.
we're on the night shift. relax.
"one of these days you'll get the call to take the bridge, and maybe then you'll understand the burden of command."
report.
it's an automated distress call.
origin?
"a class m planet, range point seven three light years, bearing two six one mark one five."
that would be a significant course change.
"the burden of command is on your shoulders, sir. of course, we could always wake commander chakotay."
no. alter course.
open a channel. this is ensign kim of the starship voyager. can we be of assistance?
i'm not picking up on any lifesigns. i guess they didn't make it.
"there could be any number of reasons why we're not detecting lifesigns. we'll have to go down there and take a look. i'll inform the commander. oh, jenkins? the bridge is yours."
i hope i made the right decision.
about changing course or waking me up?
"sorry, sir, but i thought"
"relax, harry, you did the right thing on both counts. hey, why don't you lead the away team? i'll monitor your progress from the bridge."
"yes, sir."
the distress call was automated?
that's right. i'm hoping whoever sent it is still alive.
who's leading the mission?
you're looking at him.
really?
problem?
"no. i just thought, given the circumstances, a new planet, unknown hazards, that commander chakotay or tuvok would be in charge."
"i am a senior officer, doc. i've been on this ship for five years. i think i can handle an away mission."
i certainly didn't mean any offence.
none taken.
"of course, having me on the team will certainly compensate for any lack of experience on your part."
energise.
are you sure these are the right coordinates?
positive.
"apparently, whoever sent the distress call was rescued."
"maybe, but as long as we're here we should make a thorough search. spread out."
ensign.
this is the source of the distress call.
what is it?
"i don't know. paratrinic shielding, a dense energy matrix, bioneural circuitry."
bioneural?
"whoa, back off. this could be dangerous."
"no, wait. it's speaking to us."
speaking?
"in duotronic algorithms. hold on. my translation matrix is interpreting. it says it's injured. it needs our help. it's asking why it can't see, or feel its arms and legs. it's terrified. can you identify yourself? it's saying that its memory has been damaged. it doesn't remember its name. don't worry. we're going to help you. crewman lang will remain with you."
what do you think? an artificial intelligence?
one that doesn't seem to realise its artificial.
maybe we should tell it the truth. try to jog its memory.
no. i don't want to risk psychological trauma.
"psychological trauma? doc, this is a machine."
one which is confused and asking for our help. we should beam it aboard.
not until we know what we're dealing with. away mission protocols dictate that we
"morality dictates that we help. it may not be flesh and blood, but it's clearly in distress."
make way for the day shift.
how's he doing?
"well, let's see. i haven't heard from him in almost five minutes so he should be checking in right about"
away team to voyager.
now.
"that's our harry. if i were you, i'd watch out for your job. go ahead, ensign."
we found the source of the distress call. it's some
"kind of artificial intelligence, badly damaged. the doctor thinks we should beam it aboard."
"you're in charge of the away mission, ensign. what do you think?"
"well, i think we should help it if we can. but as a precaution, i recommend sealing off an engineering bay with a level ten force field and"
beaming it directly there.
agreed. give us a few minutes.
"we're going to transport you back to our ship. i'm voyager's emergency medical hologram. a projection of light and force fields guided by an optronic computer programme. no. technically speaking, i suppose i'm not a real person."
how's our patient?
complicated. it uses bioneural circuitry to mimic humanoid synaptic functions.
but its memory core is damaged. it's suffering from a technological form of amnesia.
any theories as to what it might be?
"it could be a probe, or a communications device."
"whoever our friend is, he wasn't alone. he claims to have been travelling with a companion."
"if there's another one down there, it might give us a few answers. i'll be in astrometrics scanning the surface. give our guest my regards."
"of course, captain. lower the containment field."
"how are you? well, that's an interesting question. ensign kim and lieutenant torres are attempting to repair your damaged circuitry. that's what i wanted to talk to you about. you're not an organic being. you're technological. you're an artificial intelligence embedded in a machine of some kind. no, there's no mistake. we believe the damage you suffered in the crash is causing your confusion. look at it this way. you and i have something in common. just because we're not organic beings doesn't mean we're in any way inferior. well, you're metallic, over a metre in length, cylindrical. oh, you're quite sleek, actually. you're welcome."
i'm detecting no further technology on the planet surface.
maybe the second device was destroyed when it crashed. scan for metallic particulates consistent with our friend in engineering.
there are minute traces scattered across the northern continent.
isolate. an impact crater.
it spans a radius of two hundred kilometres.
and look at this. heavy concentrations of radiogenic decay in the crater walls. and the fracture gradients are consistent with a highly focused explosion.
"evidently, we've discovered its function."
a weapon of mass destruction.
"i understand your concerns, but the device hasn't shown itself to be hostile."
not yet. but it's only a matter of time before it puts the pieces together.
"all the more reason we should talk to it, explain our concerns. ask for help in defusing its explosive components."
"if it's programmed to detonate, there's no telling how it will react."
"agreed, we have to neutralise the threat now. suggestions?"
transport the device off the ship and destroy it before it harms anyone.
"seven, this is a sentient being we're talking about."
very well. return it to the surface and deploy a warning buoy to alert other vessels.
i refuse to believe our only options are to kill it or abandon it.
what if we could separate the bioneural circuitry from the explosive?
take the weapon offline but salvage the intelligence.
they're fully integrated. where would we store the intelligence once we shut the device down?
"the answer's obvious. download it's synaptic patterns to a holographic matrix, like mine."
then what?
"try to find out where it came from, and return it to it's people."
the device is extremely complex. one error and we'd risk detonation.
saving life often entails risk.
"harry, b'elanna, assist the doctor."
"thank you, captain."
"at the first sign of danger, we transport it off the ship. understood?"
understood.
"i quite understand. i wouldn't like being carried around, either. of course you are, who wouldn't be? we're taking you to sickbay. because we're better equipped to help you there."
"deck five. we're going to transfer your intelligence to a holo-matrix. you should be pleased. in a little while, you're going to be walking around just like me."
i'm not certain. ensign kim's configuring your physical parameters as we speak. i'm sure you'll be quite handsome.
are we ready to proceed?
whenever you are.
"don't be alarmed. we have to access some of your systems to enable the transfer. he says he wants to know exactly what you're doing, as you do it."
this is a delicate procedure. i won't be able to concentrate if i have to give a blow-by-blow description.
"you'll have to forgive lieutenant torres. she's an excellent engineer. unfortunately, she doesn't share my bedside manner."
"harry, would you mind?"
"yeah, sure. er, well, first we're going to be setting up an active interlink between you and the holo-systems. er, now, to do that, er, we're going to take your programme offline while we resequence your bioneural circuitry."
he says he can't allow you to shut him down.
"i'm sorry, but there's no other way."
it's arming itself. the detonation sequence has begun.
sickbay to bridge. the device is going to detonate.
beam it off the ship.
we've lost the transporter lock.
"talk to it, doctor."
"please, you're going to destroy yourself, and us."
detonation in twenty seconds.
"b'elanna, send an em pulse through it's power matrix. maybe you can short it out."
i'm on it.
fifteen seconds.
please disarm yourself. we're just trying to help you.
ten seconds. nine.
initiating the pulse.
six. five.
now.
it worked.
"we shut it down, captain."
you shouldn't have done that.
"i know you've gotten a little attached to this thing, but."
you lied.
what are you talking about?
"you said you were trying to transfer my neural patterns, but you were really trying to shut me down."
you're the artificial intelligence.
it used the interlink to commandeer the doctor's programme.
"sickbay to bridge. captain, respond. he's tapped into the ship's systems, deactivated the comm."
"he's locked us in, too."
you tried to destroy me.
we were only trying to disarm you.
i'm a weapon.
yes.
why didn't you tell me?
it was a precaution. we were afraid you might be dangerous.
"obviously, we were right."
i couldn't let you destroy me. i have to complete my mission.
you remember it now?
"yes. i'm a long range tactical armour unit. i've been deployed by my people. they're facing a terrible threat. a hostile species. my companion unit was destroyed, but i will reach my target. your ship will take me there."
"look, we'll try and contact your people. if you could tell us who they are."
i must resume my mission!
the weapon's been rearmed.
security?
"they still can't gain access to sickbay, or any part of deck five, for that matter."
get a transporter lock on our people. we'll jettison the whole damn section if we have to.
"i wouldn't recommend that, captain. if you try to stop me again, i'll detonate. your ship and everyone on it will be destroyed."
doctor?
he's gone.
he's directing us to a system two point three light years from here.
is that your home?
"it's my target. the course i've plotted bypasses enemy minefields. don't deviate from it. your ship won't be harmed. once we've reached the system, you'll transport me to my target."
we won't help you wage war. this crew has a prime directive that forbids us to interfere in the affairs of other species.
you've already interfered.
we were trying to help you.
until you discovered my true nature. then you tried to deactivate me.
"just your explosive components, not you."
there's no distinction. i am what i am. now alter course or i'll detonate!
"if you do that, you'll never reach your target, will you?"
"i am programmed to take whatever measures are necessary to obtain my objective. failing that, i'm to consider anyone who tries to stop me an enemy. now alter course, and transfer your sensors to me so i can monitor your compliance."
release my crewmen from sickbay first.
i'm not programmed to negotiate. they'll remain were they are.
"lay in the course, mister paris. transfer sensors to sickbay."
"a sound tactical decision, captain."
assemble the staff. we're going to find a way to outsmart a smart bomb.
"if we could shut down the force fields around sickbay, i could get a transporter lock on it."
"even if you were successful, we can't beam it far enough from the ship to escape the blast."
she's right. our best option is to disarm it.
"good luck. it's got an internal sensor array. if we try so much as to loosen a screw, boom."
"commander, i think you should take a look at this. it's a power node i used to enhance the replicator system. i acquired it last week on a trading mission. it has transkinetic energy regulators and bioneural control circuitry. remind you of anything?"
our friend in sickbay.
"i didn't make the connection at first, but when i overheard a few of the engineers talking about the weapon i went back and i checked the schematics on this. it's the same technology."
who did you acquire it from?
a merchant named onquanii.
did he say where he got it?
"no, but he seemed eager to trade. maybe he'd tell us if we made it worth his while."
"scan for his vessel. if you find him, send an encoded message. tell him about our problem."
"aye, sir."
if we could tap into the holo-projectors without his knowing it we might be able to shut him down.
"he changed all the access codes. the second we try to decrypt them, he'll restart the detonation sequence."
do you have a better idea?
yeah. let the captain handle it. the last thing anyone needs is my opinion.
this is no time to be feeling sorry for yourself.
chakotay lets me make a command decision. what do i do? i beam a talking bomb on board.
"the first time i commanded an away mission, i led my people into a cave that i thought was a cardassian military installation. turned out i'd mistaken unstable mineral deposits for weapons signatures. there was a rock slide and we were stuck there for three days."
what did you do?
we dug ourselves out with our bare hands. where are you going?
to dig us out.
"you don't have to do this, you know."
it's what i was programmed for.
you're a sentient being. you don't have to be a slave to your programming. look at the doctor.
he's a tool. a holographic puppet.
"that puppet saved your life. if it weren't for him you'd still be damaged and alone on that planet. he's the one that convinced me to beam you aboard. and when we discovered what you were, and some people wanted to destroy you, the doctor defended your right to exist."
what's your point?
"even though he was only programmed to be a doctor, he's become more than that. he's made friends, he's piloted a starship, he even sings."
"despite all of his achievements, did he ever stop being a doctor?"
"no, but"
and i can't stop being a weapon.
"look at yourself. you're already much more than that. you've got a body now, eyes to see with. the second you detonate, that'll all be over."
that's the nature of what i am.
it doesn't have to be. we can give you your own holo-matrix. you can exist for as long as you want. accomplish anything you set your mind to.
the only thing i want to accomplish is the destruction of my target.
what is your target?
"a military installation on salinia prime. grid eleven, vector nine three four one."
tell me about it. who's the enemy?
"a ruthless, violent race that's threatening to destroy my people."
"what else do you know about them? what's their planet like? are there forests, wildlife, schools for the children of this violent race?"
i'm not programmed with superfluous data.
"well, lucky for you. you're aboard voyager now, and you have access to our scanners. why don't we take a closer look at your target?"
"a military installation, as i told you."
but it's manned.
by soldiers.
"who are going to suffer because of you. remember when you were suffering, blind and paralysed? do you really want to make others go through that?"
i have a duty to protect my people. i will not betray them. now get out before i'm forced to harm you.
nice try.
i'm reading a subspace surge off our port bow.
looks like a cloaked ship.
it could be him. onquanii travels in a cloaked vessel.
we're being hailed. audio only.
open a channel.
voyager! good to see you again.
"and you, sir."
i received your message. have you an intelligent weapon in your possession?
"actually, we're in its possession. we're being held hostage. do you know anything about this weapon?"
"if i'm correct, it was created by a species named the druoda. i've studied their technology. bring me aboard. i can assist you."
you've deactivated your comm. system?
and reinforced the shielding in this section. we won't be overheard.
i'd have more faith in your security precautions if you weren't already at the mercy of this weapon.
we didn't know what it was when we brought it aboard.
"this particular series has a class eleven intelligence factor. it's warp-capable, fully armoured, self-guiding. it has a maximum range of eighty light years. it can fly through an ion storm or an armada of hostile ships and still find its target."
charming. how do i get it off my ship?
you can't. but i can. my transporter system employs a dampening field which disables the detonator until my engineers can disarm it.
that's a generous offer. mind if i ask what you expect in return?
the device itself.
i'm not about to hand over a weapon of mass destruction to someone i just met.
"oh, my business is salvage, not war. i've no intention of deploying it."
but you might sell it to someone who does. i imagine you'd stand to make quite a profit.
"i can make more profit by selling off it's components. the energy matrix alone can power a fleet of starships. and its intelligence core, properly reprogrammed, can assist in a variety of things, from terraforming to planetary weather control."
"all right. you can have the weapon, as long as we keep the energy matrix. that way we can be sure no one ever deploys it."
i'm afraid that's unacceptable. the energy matrix is one of the most valuable components.
"i'm sorry, it's not open for negotiation."
we could offer you a few dilithium crystals in compensation.
that matrix worth a thousand dilithium crystals.
what if we threw in a plasma manifold?
"i want the entire weapon, or it remains here. captain?"
you seem awfully intent for someone only interested in salvage.
i'm sorry to waste your time. we'll have to find another way to solve our problem.
i wish you luck.
"sorry, captain. i thought it would help."
"bridge, report."
the alien vessel has opened fire. we've lost weapons and shields.
"sickbay to captain, what's happening?"
we're under attack.
how many ships?
"one, off the port bow."
return fire.
we can't. check your sensors. our weapons are offline.
the forcefields around sickbay are destabilising. he's trying to get a transporter lock on the weapon.
remodulate the shields.
no effect.
what are you doing?
the weapon's sending an antimatter surge back through the transporter beam.
they've been destroyed.
that wasn't necessary.
they were an enemy.
maintain course.
"i've studied the weapon's schematics. my nanoprobes can be adapted to disable its bioneural circuitry. however, i would need direct access to its primary control port."
that means getting you into sickbay without arousing suspicion.
"we could access the holomatrix controls above sickbay, disrupt the doctor's programme long enough for seven to inject the nanoprobes."
how much time would you need?
approximately twenty seconds.
"run a long range scan on that subspace minefield it warned us about. calculate their explosive yield, what kind of damage they might do to the ship."
"aye, captain."
what have you got in mind?
i have a feeling we're about to run into some unexpected trouble.
we've analysed the alien minefield and calculated the effect it would have on voyager.
"i think i can simulated the explosions with a well-timed disruption to the inertial dampers. of course, asking me to give you a bumpy ride is like asking a virtuoso to sing off-key."
i'm sure you'll manage. the weapon has access to our sensors. how do we make sure it won't catch on?
we've reconfigured the sensor array to send it false telemetry. it will believe we're navigating a minefield.
at least long enough for us to get seven to sickbay.
how?
medical emergency.
i intend to suffer third-degree plasma burns during our encounter with the mines.
"that's where i come in. chief cosmetics officer, at your service."
"another hidden talent, neelix?"
i know my way around a dermal regenerator. i should be able to simulate a convincing wound.
"okay, we get her inside. then what?"
"commander tuvok will be in position to disrupt the doctor's programme. once that happens, i will inject the nanoprobes and disable the weapon."
i'll inform the captain. get started.
"do well on this mission, neelix, and maybe the captain will promote you to senior beautician."
assist me.
with what?
"i'm trying to identify the malfunction that caused me to crash, but several of my memory files are still damaged. restore them."
we tried helping it before and look where that got us.
"when taken captive by a hostile force, seek out any opportunity to engage the assailant. didn't you ever read the officers' manual? section one twenty six."
"i don't think starfleet diplomacy is going to work this time. if we cooperate, we'll be giving it the advantage."
if there's even a chance that we can convince it to change its mind
"it's a bomb, harry."
a sentient bomb.
"i said, assist me!"
where do we start?
"there are several disruptions in my memory index, including a three minute thirty seven second gap just prior to the crash."
a recursive search algorithm might retrieve the missing data. there. you received a subspace transmission. a command to alter course and head toward the planet surface.
looks like your landing wasn't an accident.
it was an attempt by the enemy to divert me from my target.
"no, your access codes are encrypted."
they must have developed an infiltration code.
what if it wasn't the enemy?
who else would try to divert me?
"correct me if i'm wrong, but these are the same duotronic algorithms that you use to communicate with."
my own people wouldn't try to stop me.
maybe they changed their mind.
the enemy is ruthless. my target is a threat. why would my people call off the assault?
"if we clear up some more of these memory files, maybe we'll find out."
your assistance is no longer required.
what's wrong? you afraid you might find out you're not supposed to destroy that installation?
let us finish the job. then you can decide what you want to do with the information.
proceed.
does the name strategic command matrix mean anything to you?
that's my control centre. they ordered my launch.
"well, it looks like your orders were rescinded. see for yourself."
all long range tactical armour units. terminate mission immediately.
keep reading.
"it says the war is over. it ended nearly three years ago. my launch was a mistake. there was a malfunction in one of the command sensors. it activated a series of launch sequencers. my people managed to shut most of them down, but thirty four weapons were fired. including me."
i guess this means you can disarm yourself now.
no. there's no confirmation code here. we avoided the enemy's minefield so they're trying to deceive us.
the confirmation could be in one of your damaged memory files.
or maybe it was you. deceiving me to implement your pacifist philosophy.
that's not true.
you lied to me before. why should i trust you now?
you don't have to trust us. just access those files.
no! i am programmed to destroy my target. i will complete my mission!
"if the war is over, you could end up starting another one. how many of your people will die then?"
sickbay to bridge.
report.
we've run into a subspace mine. we had to drop out of warp.
there shouldn't be mines along this course.
we're detecting thousands of them scattered throughout the region.
we're plotting a new course to avoid them.
transmit it to me. this trajectory will delay us for two days.
that'll give you time to confirm that the war is over.
no! proceed as planned! i'm programming a shield enhancement
that will protect voyager.
i'm still going to have to reduce speed.
agreed. but only until we've cleared the minefield.
"maintain course, mister paris. one quarter impulse. think he bought it?"
he seemed to.
"let's give him another good shake, just to be sure."
"yes, ma'am."
that was another mine.
the shields will hold.
tuvok to bridge. i have accessed the holo-matrix.
acknowledged.
janeway to neelix. casualty report.
"i'm putting the finishing touches on seven's plasma burn and it looks pretty authentic, if i do say so myself."
good work. stand by.
"time to hit another mine, tom a big one. commander, blow out the plasma relays on deck six."
janeway to sickbay. we have heavy casualties.
maintain heading and speed.
that's going to be difficult. our astrometrics officer has been injured. she's the one who's been guiding us through the minefield.
replace her.
seven of nine's abilities are unique. we're not going to get past
these mines without her.
then treat her injuries and send her back to her post.
she has third degree plasma burns. she needs to go to sickbay to be treated. if you want to reach your target you're going to have to wait.
"all right, captain. but i'm warning you. no deceptions."
janeway to neelix. go.
treat her as quickly as possible.
they're in.
"now, tuvok."
"bridge, my holo-matrix is destabilising. why?"
we took damage to our secondary systems.
repair them. now! or i'll activate the detonation sequence.
stand by.
what's going on?
she's trying to defuse the weapon.
seven! she's going into neural shock. help me.
sickbay to bridge. your attempt to disable me did not succeed. i am designed to repel any
assault on my bioneural circuitry.
we've tried to reason with you. you left me no choice.
and you leave me
no choice. you and your crew will abandon voyager immediately.
no deal.
this is not a negotiation! comply or i will detonate!
go ahead. do it.
everyone on board will be killed!
but no one else will.
"captain, thirty two vessels just dropped out of warp off our port bow."
on screen.
one of them is transmitting a message to the doctor.
bridge to sickbay. we've got company. thirty two
self-guided weapons.
they detected my presence aboard your vessel. they say my target is essential. they altered course to ensure that i reach it. they are ordering me to transport off your vessel.
they will tractor me to my target.
"mister kim, reintegrate its neural matrix, and"
prepare to beam it off
"we can't do that, captain."
explain.
these weapons were fired by accident. we can't let them reach their targets.
"enough! captain, order him to proceed."
"harry, what are you talking about?"
"captain, i need"
a minute. you're making a mistake. your own people tried to disarm you
i cannot be certain of that.
"yes, you can. you can check your memory files. look for the confirmation code."
no more delays.
check the files.
reintegrate my matrix!
no!
do what harry says or you're not leaving this ship.
you're in no position to give me orders.
"if you detonate now, you'll destroy yourself and your companions. is that what you want?"
the confirmation code.
"coding intersequence four four three, vector three nine one two one. cessation of hostilities confirmed. unauthorised launch confirmed. order to terminate mission confirmed."
you must disarm yourself and tell the others to stand down.
it's a deception.
this code of yours uses a modulating algorithm. it would be almost impossible to duplicate.
the enemy is ruthless. they are violent.
"have you ever met the enemy? you're just spouting propaganda, what you've been programmed to believe."
i have a directive.
it's been countermanded!
"i am a series five, long range tactical armour unit designed to traverse enemy space and circumvent all attempts to deter me."
you're a sentient being.
"i have a duty to protect my people, to destroy my target."
"you've been programmed with intelligence so you could make decisions on your own. well, it's time to make one. countless lives are at stake. ever since you took the doctor's form you've been learning what it's like to be one of us. now, try to imagine what it's like to be one of your victims. your first victim. you've seen her suffering. increase that by a factor of one million, ten million, and that's how much suffering you'll cause if you don't end this."
they're asking why i haven't left your ship.
tell them.
"i'm transmitting our orders to terminate the mission. they also received those orders, but they had already crossed the targeting threshold. once we're within two light years of our target we cannot be diverted."
tell them the war's over.
i did.
"tell them you got the message before you crossed the threshold, when you were on the planet surface."
they don't believe me.
it's up to you to make them understand.
they only understand their directive. they won't listen. reintegrate my neural matrix and return me to the others.
we won't do that.
i have no intention of proceeding to my target. i will stop them.
how?
i am a weapon of mass destruction. you want me to see past my programming. then you must try to see past your doubts.
"b'elanna, give me a hand. bridge, lock onto the weapon. prepare to beam it into space."
"harry, what's going on?"
"captain, no time to explain. just trust me on this one."
"i hear you loud and clear, ensign. do it."
i've reconfigured the bioneural matrix.
ready? i'm sorry.
i am simply completing my mission. only the target has changed.
transfer complete.
please state the nature of the. what happened? how long was i offline?
we'll explain later. seven needs your help.
"bridge, energise."
they've gone into warp.
maintain long range sensors.
i'm detecting a series of antimatter explosions.
in proximity to what?
no ships. no planets. nothing.
bridge to ensign kim. the weapons have been destroyed.
anyone home?
ensign. feeling well i hope?
perfect. on my way to the bridge for another night shift. i came by to check on seven.
you just missed her.
what's her prognosis?
"she'll need another week of regeneration, but i expect she'll make a full recovery."
good news.
"considering i was responsible for her injuries, you can imagine my relief."
"well, you weren't exactly yourself at the time."
that's not what i mean. i was the one who asked you to bring that device aboard in the first place. i even argued with the captain to keep it aboard after we learned what it was.
"it was an artificial intelligence, like you. but i have to admit, his personality made you seem like mister congeniality. look, doc, the truth is i never would have gotten through to him without you."
"from what i've heard, i wasn't much help."
you were. i held you up as an example of how an artificial intelligence could exceed its programming. i didn't realise how true that was until today.
it seems your strategy worked. thank you.
i'd better get to the bridge. you never know when ensign kim will be called upon to take command again.
voyager could do worse.
"helm, status?"
"current speed, warp five, heading oh twenty one, mark three."
anything on long range sensors?
nothing to report.
as you were.
"permission to speak freely, sir."
why would tonight be any different?
people have been talking about you.
oh?
rumour has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb.
"well, not exactly. i made first contact with a sentient being. all i did was help it understand a few things. the rest was up to him."
"understood. actually, i've been authorised by the junior staff to thank you for keeping us in one piece."
you're welcome. any time. do me a favour?
"of course, sir."
no more distress calls. at least not tonight.
stay on your course.
shields are down to twenty nine percent. they're breaking through.
let them.
sir?
take the shields offline and recharge the emitters. that'll bring them up to full power.
the charging cycle takes forty five seconds. we'll be vulnerable.
we'll be dead if we don't get the shields back up. arm yourselves! drop shields. recharge cycle?
thirty seconds.
there!
time?
ten seconds.
federation starship equinox. we're under attack. we need assistance. this is captain ransom of the federation starship equinox. we're under attack. we need assistance.
ransom. he was in command of a science vessel. the equinox.
this distress call was transmitted approximately fourteen hours ago
distance?
three point two light years.
try to get a fix on their location.
what's it doing in the delta quadrant?
perhaps it's searching for voyager.
"the equinox is a nova class ship. it was designed for planetary research, not long range tactical missions."
i've got their coordinates. heading two five eight mark twelve.
"set a course, maximum warp. go to red alert. hang on, captain."
did you know this individual?
only by reputation.
"he was an exobiologist, promoted to captain after he made first contact with the yridians."
species six two nine one. the collective determined that they were extinct.
so did the federation. ransom proved otherwise. i always wanted to meet him. too bad it won't be under better circumstances.
"i look forward to meeting him as well, and his crew. i wish to expand my knowledge of humanity."
let's hope you get the chance.
approaching the coordinates.
take us out of warp.
i've got them. two thousand kilometres off the port bow. they're moving at low impulse.
intercept. can you get a visual?
they are heavily damaged. multiple hull breaches. warp drive is offline.
what's happening to their shields?
they're being disrupted by some kind of energy surges.
weapons fire?
there are no other ships in the vicinity.
we're in hailing range.
open a channel. this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we're responding to your
"voyager, you've got to extend your shields around our ship! match the emitter frequency!"
are you under attack?
"shields, quickly!"
do it.
we're in position.
i am attempting to match their shield frequency.
do you hear something?
"interspatial fissure are opening on decks ten, six and one."
tuvok!
stand by. shields are holding.
the fissures?
no sign of them.
"voyager to ransom. captain?  assemble rescue teams. secure the equinox. tuvok, you're with me."
hello? is there anyone here?  see if you can bring main power online. tom.
what happened?
some kind of thermolytic reaction. it's desiccated every cell in that body.
"commander. i can't make heads or tails of this injector manifold, and it looks like the dilithium matrix has been completely redesigned."
"we'll try to find one of their engineers to help us. in the meantime, see if you can bypass the core."
"aye, sir."
hang on.
"i'm commander chakotay, u.s.s. voyager."
"but, but we're the only humans in the delta quadrant."
that's what we used to think. come on.
over here. hang on. we're getting you out of here.
i don't believe we've met.
"ensign kim, and this is seven of nine. i have to cut him out with a plasma torch. talk to him, keep him calm."
state your name.
"lessing, noah. what are you doing on this side of the galaxy?"
the answer is complicated.
do me a favour? see if my legs are still there. i haven't felt them in two days.
your limbs are intact.
thank you.
"seven, give me hand."
do not be frightened.
too late for that.
i'm picking up lifesigns. hello? is there anyone here?
no!
we're here to help you.
take cover! we're under attack!
neelix to sickbay.
sickbay here.
we found another survivor. his wounds are not serious but he's suffering from psychological distress.
acknowledged.
my crew?
you took heavy casualties. we're treating the survivors. who attacked you?
we don't know. we can't communicate with them. they've been attacking us for weeks.
"easy, easy."
"i've got to secure the ship,"
leave that to us.
"no, treat me here. i'm not leaving my bridge."
"i can't pull rank on you, captain, but you're in no condition to put up a fight."
"so, how's earth?"
i wish i could say.
you weren't sent here to find us?
i'm afraid not. we've been stranded in the delta quadrant for five years. we were pulled here against our will by an alien called
the caretaker.
we'll compare notes later on. let's get you to voyager.
"we're here to commemorate our honoured dead. lieutenant william yates, lieutenant john molar, ensign dorothy chang, ensign edward regis and crewman david amantes, who all served with distinction. their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten. they will be missed, but now there is cause for optimism. captain janeway, voyager, on behalf of my crew, thank you."
"we'll have time to give the newest members of our family a proper welcome in the days ahead, but right now, we've got our hands full. the equinox is secure, but its primary systems are still badly damaged. harry, b'elanna, make it your priority. captain ransom has provided us with data regarding the alien attacks. tuvok, seven, you'll be working with first officer maxwell burke. to kindred spirits. may our journey home together be swift. dismissed."
we should begin by familiarising you with voyager's defences.
can you give me a minute? there's someone i'd like to say hello to first.
"we'll be in the astrometrics lab. deck eight, section twenty nine."
see you there.
blt.
max. i tried to say hello in sickbay but you were sedated.
"i remember. i thought i was dreaming. so, where's my sweater. the blue one? class insignia on the back?"
we went to the academy together.
ah.
maxwell burke.
tom paris.
harry kim. welcome aboard.
"first officer, impressive. the last time we talked you were about to drop out of starfleet."
i heard you beat me to it. the maquis?
for a while. until i ran into these two.
and it's been hell ever since.
"well, i told your resident vulcan i'd be right with him. are you free later? i'd love to catch up."
why don't we all have dinner together?
sounds great.
blt?
"bacon, lettuce and tomato. it was a nickname."
a nickname?
my initials.
"oh, how romantic."
we broke up over ten years ago. no need to go to red alert.
how about yellow alert?
you're cute when you're jealous.
who's jealous?
see you on the equinox.
"well, turkey platter, what do you say we go to work?"
who's jealous?
"commander? i've been assigned to one of the repair crews on the equinox, and i was wondering if i could join a different team. maybe one on voyager."
problem?
just a little post-traumatic stress syndrome.
bad memories?
a few.
"actually, i could use someone with your engineering abilities."
"well, thank you. such a clean ship. i mean, i'm used to falling bulkheads and missing deck plates."
in a few weeks you won't even recognise the equinox. you'll be happy to go back.
unless i stay. you said you could use someone with my engineering abilities.
i don't think your captain would appreciate that. he's got a skeleton crew as it is.
engineering's five decks down. it's a long crawl through the jefferies tubes.  deck eleven.
i haven't set foot in a turbolift in over three months.
claustrophobia?
"if one of those fissures opened up in here, where would we take cover?"
it's only a graviton relay. nothing to worry about.
do i look worried?  emergency stop!
if you don't mind i think i'd rather take the jefferies tube.
i could use the exercise.
i've run a thermographic analysis of our shields. it revealed multiple stress points. we believe they're the result of alien attempts to infiltrate our vessels. each time a fissure opens within a metre of our shields it weakens them by point three percent.
"at the present rate, we have less than two days to mount a defence."
according to your bio-scans the aliens can survive in our realm for only several seconds.
"they're like fish out of water, but they can do a lot of damage in those seconds."
"nevertheless, it is a tactical weakness. perhaps we can exploit it."
what have you got in mind?
"if we can show them we have the ability to hold them here, they'll think twice before launching another attack."
"but the question is, how do we catch these fish?"
you build a net.
commander?
a multiphasic force field to be exact. we wanted to see what we were up against so we built a small chamber that could keep one of them trapped for several minutes.
"if we could expand on that technology, we might be able to create a lattice work of multiphasic forcefields around both ships."
rudy?
if captain janeway agrees.
we'll need to examine that stasis chamber.
i'm afraid that won't be possible. it's in our research lab. that whole section was flooded with thermionic radiation during the last attack. it'll be days before anyone can go in there.
the design schematics are in our auxiliary datacore.
i'll see if i can download them. you give me a hand?
i couldn't help but notice your crew calls you by your first name.
"when you've been in the trenches as long as we have, rank and protocol are luxuries. besides, we're a long way from starfleet command."
i know the feeling.
you seem to run a pretty tight ship.
"we've been known to let our hair down from time to time. but i find that maintaining protocol reminds us of where we came from and hopefully, where we're going."
it seems to work quite well for you.
"oh, we've overcome our share of obstacles, warp core breaches, ion storms, a few rounds with the borg"
the borg? we haven't seen so much as a cube since the day we arrived.
consider yourself lucky.
have you ever run into the krowtonan guard?
never heard of them.
that's how we spent our first week in the delta quadrant. they claimed we violated their territory. i gave the order to keep going. i lost thirty nine. half my crew.
i'm sorry.
we never recovered from that loss. it changed everything.
what do you mean?
"when i first realised that we'd be travelling across the delta quadrant for the rest of our lives, i told my crew that we had a duty as starfleet officers to expand our knowledge and uphold our principles. after a couple of years, we started to forget that we were explorers. and there were times when we nearly forgot that we were human beings."
"this is a nova class science vessel, designed for short term research missions. minimal weapons. it can't even go faster than warp eight. frankly, i don't know how you've done it. you've obviously travelled as far as we have with much fewer resources."
"i wish that i could take all the credit, but we stumbled across a wormhole, and made a few enhancements on our warp engines. i'd like to ask you something, captain to captain."
mmm hmm.
the prime directive. how often have you broken it for the sake of protecting your crew?
broken it? never. bent it on occasion. and even then it was a difficult choice. what about you?
"i've walked the line once or twice, but nothing serious. there you are."
it's a good omen. let's put it back where it belongs.
i thought i'd find you here.
how could i resist after two years on emergency rations?
"don't get too comfortable. if janeway's any indication, these people will never understand."
they're going to find out eventually.
"not if we keep them out of the research lab, and away from the warp core injectors. and be careful what you say around their crew. that includes old girlfriends."
understood.
mmm. not bad.
how's my angel of mercy?
crewman lessing. i didn't expect you to recover so quickly.
you have an outstanding emh. ours can barely hold a laser scalpel.
the doctor is efficient.
i've been assigned to help you sort through our bio-data. you saved my life. the least i can do is save you a little time.
lateral shields are offline.
how's that possible?
"fissures are opening on decks one, eight and eleven."
reroute power.
what happened?
"apparently, the aliens began to focus their attacks on a single shield vector. it collapsed before the auxiliary emitters could respond."
it looks like they've changed their tactics. we may have less time than we thought.
we've examined the schematics of your multiphasic chamber. it can be adapted. we intend to create an auto-initiating security grid.
"the moment an alien invades either ship, a forcefield will surround it."
"once we modify our field generator to emit multiphasic frequencies, it will power the security grids on both ships."
how long will it take?
approximately fourteen hours.
we don't know when they'll break through again. we may not last that long.
we could cut the time in half if we evacuate all personnel from the equinox and focus our efforts here on voyager.
"remember, we are still thirty five thousand light years from earth. we should try to preserve both ships."
"with two vessels we'd be able to pool our resources, doubling our chances of finding a short cut home."
"normally i'd agree, but right now one of our ships in vulnerable. chakotay's right. we should make our stand on voyager."
i don't want to force the issue. but i am prepared to return to the equinox with my crew. what is the protocol in this situation? we have two captains and two ships. who gets the last word?
"starfleet regulation one hundred ninety one, article fourteen. in a combat situation involving more than one ship, command falls to the vessel with tactical superiority. i looked it up this morning."
good thinking.
"in this case, protocol recognises my authority."
are you ordering me to abandon my ship?
i'd rather not have to.
that protocol was written in the alpha quadrant. i'm not sure that it makes much sense out here.
the regulation stands.
who am i to dispute protocol? give captain janeway your full cooperation.
rudy.
"max, that's an order. we'll get through this. if that's all, captain, i'd like to return to my quarters and collect a few mementoes."
by all means.
"intruder alert. same old max, going through my things. that is a command station. it's off limits without my direct authorisation."
i didn't realise. are you going to throw me in the brig?
i think we can overlook this infraction. can i help you with something?
"just doing some homework, studying your propulsion system. if there's a chance i'm going to be stuck on voyager. i figured i better learn my way around. maybe you could tutor me over dinner?"
"problem is, you were never really interested in the work, or the meal. something tells me you haven't changed."
you'd be surprised. i'm not the. what did you once call me?
petaq.
petaq. i'm not the petaq i used to be. let me prove it to you.
"look, max, don't get me wrong, it's good to see you again, but ten years."
tom paris.
tom paris.
"you could do worse.  so, we're still on for dinner? just the two of us?"
"get going, or i will throw you in the brig."
"before we abandon the equinox, we should try to salvage any useful components. let's start with your dilithium crystals."
what we have left of them. i'm afraid we only have a few isograms.
that's barely enough to power the sonic showers.
can i make a suggestion?
please.
"let's forget about the primary systems. they're too badly damaged. let's focus on supplies. we picked up a few items i think might come in handy. two kilotons of kemacite ore, a dozen canisters of mercurium."
tell neelix to make room in cargo bay one.
right.
could you use a synaptic stimulator?
depends. what is it?
it's a neural interface you wear behind your ear. it taps into your visual cortex and shows you different alien vistas. just think of it as a poor man's holodeck.
so that's how you kept yourself entertained.
beats checkers. the ponea gave it to us.
never heard of them.
we called them the life of the delta quadrant. they see every first contact as an excuse to throw a party. i wish that we had encountered more species like that. you're the first friendly faces we've seen in months. i'm glad we found you.
the feeling's mutual. those modified plasma injectors looked elaborate. what were you trying to do?
we were experimenting with ways to enhance our warp drive. it doesn't work.
maybe we should let b'elanna take a look.
it won't work. we tried for months.
excuse me.
"oh, hello there."
"commander, permission to interrupt?"
granted.
ensign gilmore.
that's right.
"naomi wildman, captain's assistant."
is that so?
i wanted to officially welcome you aboard the starship voyager.
i'm glad to be here.
"if you need anything, replicator rations, a tour of the lower decks, i'm your man."
"thank you, miss wildman. i'll keep that in mind."
as you were.
i didn't realise that you had children on board.
only one. she was born here.
"i have a nephew back on earth the same age. well, not any more. i guess he's a teenager by now. i probably wouldn't even recognise him."
you'll see him again.
ransom to gilmore.
"yes, captain."
report to the equinox bridge.
on my way. duty calls.
assemble a salvage team.
"aye, sir."
"once we take their field generator, we'll part company."
what happens to voyager?
"they have weapons, shields, a full crew. they'll survive."
maybe we should abandon ship. try to forget everything that's happened here.
"a shower and a hot meal. i guess that's all it takes for some of us to forget what's at stake here. we're going home, we can't let voyager stop us now. not when we're this close. now we're proceeding as planned. are there any other objections? i need each and every one of you to give me your very best, as you always have. max."
"this won't be easy. the generator is located on deck eleven, next to the warp plasma manifold. we can't get a clean lock without boosting the signal. marla, we need you to set aside your claustrophobia and crawl through the access port, and set up the transport enhancers."
understood.
"we'll have to take the internal sensors in that section offline. noah, you're elected."
"you can count on me, sir."
i'll disengage the power couplings from engineering.
you'll all have time for one last shower. make the most of it.
there's a minor fluctuation in the security grid.
it's within tolerance.
"i believe i can correct it. the discrepancy is in the equinox research lab. if we can determine the exact frequency of their multiphasic chamber, i will tune our field generator to match it."
there are times when perfection hinders efficiency.
this is odd. the lab is still permeated with high levels of thermionic radiation.
it should have dissipated by now.
i believe i have an explanation. three eps conduits have been rerouted to the lab. it appears they are emitting the radiation.
the lab was contaminated intentionally.
any theories?
only one. ransom doesn't want us to enter the research lab.
"he has been adamant about protecting his ship. i thought it was simply a captain's pride. i want to take a closer look at that lab. if we close off those eps conduits, how long will it take to vent the radiation?"
several hours.
i don't want to wait that long. send the doctor. he'll be immune to its effects. tell him to look for anything out of the ordinary. monitor his progress from astrometrics.
shall i notify captain ransom?
not yet. i want to wait until we test your theory.
i'm in. i've found the multiphasic chamber. there's some kind of organic mass inside. it appears to be a member of the alien species.
but it's cell structures have vitrified.
"this is more that just a stasis chamber, it's some kind of matter conversion technology. hold on, there's a control port here. hmm."
doctor?
the chamber contains a polaron grid
and a submolecular resequencer. it looks like it was designed to convert the alien cell structures into some kind of crystalline compound.
that function was not specified in their schematics.
"i've a feeling there's a lot here they didn't specify. i've accessed their research logs. they're encrypted, but judging by the file headings, they've performed this procedure dozens of times. more of the alien compound, but it's been biochemically altered. they've extracted the base proteins. its molecular structure is most unusual."
can you be more specific?
it appears to store a great deal of
"nucleogenic energy. i'm no engineer, but i'd say they were trying to convert this material into a source of power."
i'm going to miss this ship.
"once we get back to earth, there'll be plenty of women. status?"
ready on all fronts. the transport enhancers are in place and noah's created a subroutine to mask voyager's internal sensors.
power couplings?
bypass controls have been routed to our bridge. all you need to do is say energise.
janeway wants to bring on the security grid at nineteen hundred hours. we'll have to act before then. tell the others to be prepared to.
"max, the transporter room's not far from here. keep moving."
captain janeway wishes to speak with you.
"the alien compound. ten isograms. if i understand your calculations, that's enough to increase your warp factor by what, point zero three percent for one month? unfortunately, that boost wouldn't get you very far, so you'd need to replenish the supply and that means killing another lifeform. and then another. how many lives would it take to get you back to the alpha quadrant? i think you know the reason we're under attack. these aliens are trying to protect themselves from you."
"sixty three. that's how many more it will take. every time i sacrifice one of those lives, a part of me is lost as well."
"i might believe that if i hadn't examined your research. these experiments were meticulous and they were brutal. if you'd felt any remorse, you'd never have continued."
"starfleet regulation three, paragraph twelve. in the event of imminent destruction, a captain is authorised to preserve the lives of his crew by any justifiable means."
i doubt that protocol covers mass murder.
"in my judgment, it did."
unacceptable.
"we had nothing. my ship was in pieces. our dilithium was gone. we were running on thrusters, we hadn't eaten in sixteen days. we had just enough power to enter orbit of an m class planet. and lucky for us, the inhabitants were generous."
"they were called the ankari. they provided us with a meal, a few supplies, even some dilithium crystals. they even performed one of their sacred rituals to invoke spirits of good fortune from another realm to bless our journey. but these weren't spirits, they were nucleogenic life forms. our scans revealed that they were emitting high levels of antimatter. later the same night we managed to obtain one of the summoning devices in exchange for an energy converter."
"we constructed a containment field that would prevent the lifeform from vanishing so quickly, but something went wrong."
get it out of there.
we tried to send it back.
we can't.
but it was too late.
we examined the remains and discovered it could be converted to enhance our propulsion systems. it was already dead. what would you have done? we travelled over ten thousand light years in less than two weeks. we'd found our salvation. how could we ignore it?
"by adhering to the oath you took as starfleet officers to seek out life, not destroy it."
"it's easy to cling to principles when you're standing on a vessel with its bulkheads intact, manned by a crew that's not starving."
"it's never easy. but if we turn our backs on our principles, we stop being human. i'm putting an end to your experiments and you are hereby relieved of your command. you and your crew will be confined to quarters."
"please, show them leniency. they were only following my orders."
their mistake.
"it's a long way home, captain."
"doctor, return to their research lab and retrieve all the data you can locate on the aliens. i want to find a way to communicate with them."
"aye, captain."
go to their engine room. take those warp core modifications offline.
captain?
let's try to make first contact the right way.
what's going to happen to us?
that's up to captain janeway. you'll be confined to quarters until we can find a way to make peace with these lifeforms you've been killing. if it's not too late.
"to be honest, i'm glad you stopped us. living the rest of my life knowing what we've done"
you could have stopped yourself. why didn't you?
"i don't know. when the captain ordered me to modify the warp core, i concentrated on the work. i tried not to think about how it was going to be used."
"well, think about it now, because we need your help."
commander?
after you.
we're having trouble making sense of all this.
the schematics are encrypted. i can't access them.
do you know the decryption codes? your captain's been relieved of command. you take orders from me now. do you have the codes?
yes.
proceed.
"think of it this way, ensign. you might live with yourself a little easier."
you said you wanted to learn more about humanity. i guess we're not exactly prized examples. i'm sorry.
on the contrary. you've taught me a great deal.
"computer, i decrypted this data file. why can't i access it?"
emh authorisation is required.
is your emh still functional?
affirmative.
activate him.
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
i require your assistance.
who are you?
your counterpart from the starship voyager.
where's captain ransom? my crew?
in custody.
how were you able to leave your sickbay?
"this device allows me to go anywhere i please. in case you weren't aware, your crew has been running criminal experiments here."
i know. i designed them.
you? that's a violation of your programming.
they deleted my ethical subroutines.
i'm picking up spatial fissures. hundreds of them.
looks like they've stepped up their attacks.
reroute all available power to the shields.
"they're holding, but at this rate it won't be long before the aliens break through."
bridge to tuvok. we need that security grid.
we're preparing to bring it online. charge the emitters.
bridge to the doctor.
sickbay here.
did you find anything?
could you be more specific?
"neural patterns, cortical scans, anything that could help us programme the universal translator."
"er, negative. i couldn't access the equinox data files. they were encrypted."
keep studying the information we have. see what you can come up with.
"acknowledged. computer, locate captain ransom."
"captain ransom is in crew quarters. deck nine, section twenty two."
chakotay to seven of nine. what's your status?
"i've dismantled the antimatter injectors, but i'll need several minutes to neutralise the dilithium matrix."
we don't have much time.
understood.
the equinox crew has been infected with a mutagenic virus. it may be contagious. i've been authorised to inoculate them.
you've all contracted a virus. i'll need to treat you.
a virus?
doctor's orders.
it's me.
activate the grid. what happened?
i don't understand. this should be working. i'm running a system-wide diagnostic.
"i'm reading phaser fire on deck nine, crew quarters."
"security, seal off deck nine."
shields are weakening. they're down to eighty four percent.
tuvok to bridge. the field generator is offline. its power couplings were disengaged.
someone reconfigured the sensors so we couldn't detect it.
"whatever it takes, get that grid online."
i rerouted transporter control to a panel in the next junction. we can
they've sealed off the deck.
don't worry. we're getting out of here.
shields down to fifty two percent.
"captain, unauthorised transport in progress. it's the equinox crew."
block it.
they've bypassed ops control. they're on their bridge.
forty percent.
janeway to seven of nine.
"seven, respond."
damn!
what is it?
b'elanna's erected a forcefield. i can't get a lock on the generator
try overriding the command codes.
someone's disrupting the forcefield. it's max. he's using one of his triquadric algorithms. i taught him how to do that ten years ago.
shields are failing. we've got less than one minute.
"open a channel. if you don't stop what you're doing, we'll both be destroyed."
"what's my alternative, thirty years in your brig?"
i'll open fire if i have to.
we've been through worse.
target their power systems. fire.
max!
"stand by! okay, blt, let's see if you remember this trick."
"bridge, they've got the field generator!"
"what do you mean, they've got it?"
"i don't know how, but they beamed it off voyager."
get us out of here.
i can't. warp drive is down.
bridge to marla. report.
one of their crew tried to dismantle the antimatter injectors. repairs are underway.
what about the field generator?
i'm integrating it now.
shields are down.
arm yourselves.
it's now or never.
generator's in place. i'm bringing the grid online.
"fissures are opening, all decks!"
hold your fire!
take it to the lab.
"sir, engines are up and running."
set a course for the alpha quadrant.
course laid in.
maximum warp. engage.
captain!
give me tactical control.
good guess. i used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields. it won't hold for long.
"bridge to sickbay. we have a medical emergency. doctor, respond. ensign."
"yes, sir."
"casualty reports are coming in. two dead, thirteen wounded. we took heavy damage to the engines."
the equinox?
they've gone to warp.
any sign of nucleogenic particles?
no.
then they haven't engaged their enhanced warp drive yet. keep looking for
report.
the shield grid is back in place. the aliens are staying clear.
are sensors picking up voyager?
it looks like they're under attack.
maintain course.
"captain, i found the doctor's mobile emitter on deck nine. you might want to take it to sickbay."
any sign of the doc?
i've got him right here.
please state the nature of the. don't bother.
you should start with chakotay. i've got him stabilised but he's got internal injuries.
we found your emitter on deck nine.
i was taken hostage by the equinox crew. i deactivated myself to escape. did you stop them?
no.
i'd ask for a status report but i'm not sure i'd want to hear it.
harry's analysing the sound we've been hearing. he thinks it's some form of communication.
"well, i once figured out how to speak with a terrelian seapod. this couldn't be that much harder, once i get out of sickbay, i'll lend him a hand."
we should all be focusing our efforts on finding the equinox.
first things first. we've got to stop these attacks.
our enemies aren't the aliens. they're the humans aboard the equinox. it's crucial that you don't
who is it?
it's max. i've brought you a visitor.
hold on. come in.
i'm glad you're okay. i've been using this synaptic stimulator. i was just taking a stroll along the tenkaran coast. you're welcome to try it.
state your intentions.
"you know, once we get our enhanced warp drive back online, we'll be on our way home, but it'll still take months to get there. you can spend that time in the brig, or you can become part of this crew. i'd prefer the latter."
i'd prefer the brig.
"you know, janeway's not the only captain who can help you explore your humanity."
you would be an inferior role model.
janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew. maybe you should learn from that mistake.
her only mistake was trusting you.
take care of her wound.
"first degree phaser burns, minor lacerations. looks like we'll have to amputate. that was a joke. you're supposed to smile and make a witty retort."
i'm familiar with human banter. yours is crude and predictable.
"you know, seven. can i call you seven? we don't have many luxuries around here. all we've got is each other. you might try letting your shields down or else it's going to be a lonely trip. i'll be damned. looks like our doctor left us a replacement."
seven?
we are captives.
i was attacked by their emh.
looks like he downloaded you into our database. good. you can treat your friend.
priming the injectors.
marla to bridge.
go ahead.
we're ready.
acknowledged.
infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound.
"aye, sir. warp drive ready."
engage.
what happened?
the power relays are offline. they've been encoded.
give us the codes.
no.
if she won't give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves.
seven's cranial infrastructure is highly complex. you'll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast.
that's why you're going to help us.
i refuse.
do it or i'll erase your programme.
be my guest.
doctor.
"don't worry, they need me. they'd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face. now i suggest you"
"all right, doctor. now, get to work. you know what we're looking for."
very well. she'll try to resist. i'll have to restrain her.
doctor.
i deleted his ethical subroutines. he'll be a little more cooperative now. keep me posted.
"aye, captain. this way, please."
"it's not exactly shakespeare, but it gets the point across."
a small olive branch is still an olive branch.
run this through to your translation matrix.
set your weapons down.
commander?
somebody's got to start trusting somebody around here.
"belay that order. i appreciate your optimism, but in this case, weapons."
ready to transmit.
"drop shields, bridge only. go ahead, harry."
raise shields.
"if they understood our message, they haven't responded."
there's your response. activate another deflector pulse.
shields are holding at sixty two percent.
that should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet. i suggest we make the most of it. focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive. we've got to find the equinox.
"if it's all the same to you, i'd like to take another stab at the message. if we can reroute"
"they're not listening, chakotay. we should be tracking ransom, not tinkering with adverbs."
want your first officer's advice?
"allow me. our deflector's losing power, and when it fails, we'll be defenceless. it's voyager we should be worrying about, not the equinox."
you'd make a great first officer. it's advice worth taking.
"maybe so, but we have a crew member trapped on that ship."
"is this really about seven, or is it about ransom?"
i don't know what you're talking about.
"you've been known to hold a grudge. this man betrayed starfleet, he broke the prime directive, dishonoured everything you believe in, and threw voyager to the wolves."
"borg, hirogen, malon. we've run into our share of bad guys. ransom's no different."
"yes, he is. you said it yourself. he's human. i don't blame you for being angry, but you can't compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta."
"i appreciate your candour. now let me be just as blunt. you're right, i am angry. i'm damned angry. he's a starfleet captain, and he's decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for. he's out there right now, torturing and murdering innocent lifeforms just to get home a little quicker. i'm not going to stand for it. i'm going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes, no matter what the cost. if you want to call that a vendetta, go right ahead."
why did you bring us here?
this planet has a parthogenic atmosphere. it will keep us from being detected while we make repairs.
we also found a few deuterium deposits.
"take an away team, noah, and see if you can localise the ore."
"you won't be protected from the aliens. arm yourselves with phasers. at the first sign of trouble, we'll beam you back."
"aye, sir."
"the ocular node's connected to the sensory node. the sensory node's connected to the cortical node. the cortical node's connected to the reticular node. don't look so gloomy. there's a silver lining to all this. just think, we're finally going to see earth."
you are obviously delusional. allow me to repair your programme.
now why would i want you to do that? you of all people should understand. being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient.
status?
"i'm going to extract her cortical array. it contains an index of her memory engrams. but once i've removed it her higher brain functions, language, cognitive skills will be severely damaged."
tell me the codes.
no.
janeway was right about one thing. you are unique. it would be a shame to lose you.
your compassion is irrelevant.
you think this is easy for me? the sight of you on that table. but you're leaving me no choice.
"no choice. you say that frequently. you destroy lifeforms to attain your goals, then claim that they left you no choice. does that logic comfort you?"
the codes.
you'll have to destroy me to obtain them.
the reticular node's connected to the occipital node.
come in.
you wanted to see me?
it's not like you to submit recommendations in writing.
the last time we spoke you weren't exactly receptive.
"i'm afraid i'm not going to be very receptive this time, either. it's an interesting idea, but the ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction."
"i understand that, but they're the ones who introduced ransom to these lifeforms. it stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them, tell them to call off their attacks."
our first priority is to find ransom. still no sign of nucleogenic particles?
not yet.
"then he couldn't have gotten far. without his enhanced drive, his ship's only capable of warp six. i've been studying his service record. he's had his share of run-ins with hostile aliens. it seems that when he's being pursued, he tends to hide. at epsilon four he ran into a klingon bird-of-prey. played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the klingons finally gave up. two years later, he eluded a romulan warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant. go to astrometrics. start looking for the kind of place you'd hide if your ship was damaged."
"yes, ma'am."
how was the beach?
do these programmes have people in them?
"no, just landscapes. why?"
forget it.
"i'm reading a vein of ore. azimuth one seventeen, thirty metres. it could run pretty deep. we might need to use phasers to excavate it. it's funny, this reminds me of mckinley park. i used to take my sister there when we were kids. this place looks just like it. as i recall, there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there. there was a patch of poison ivy next to it. when i was ten, i walked right through it and i swelled up like a rigellian bloodworm. when i get back to earth the first thing i'm going to do is"
four to beam up.
we're receiving a subspace transmission.
from who?
i can't tell.
i don't see a ship out there. open a channel.
doctor to equinox. respond.
we can hear you.
voyager's found you. they've entered orbit. they polarised their hull to mask their approach.
i believe they've planned an ambush on the away team.
janeway's been tracking the equinox for a couple
get him back.
i can't.
"ransom to away team. noah, prepare to beam back to the ship."
they're not down there.
all hands to battle stations.
thirty thousand kilometres and closing.
target their power core.
direct hit. minor damage.
return fire.
bridge to torres. status.
i can't locate their shield grid generator. can you divert more power to sensors?
stand by.
"they've damaged our deflector, captain. if it goes offline, we'll be vulnerable to the alien attacks."
noted. target his weapons array.
we lost all phaser banks.
"torpedoes, full spread."
it's b'elanna. she's trying to bypass our security protocols.
stop her.
"computer, open a comm. link to the equinox. workstation thirty three beta."
"max, listen to me."
"back for round two, blt?"
this isn't one of our games. people are dying over here.
i wish you didn't have to be one of them.
"max, please."
"shields are weakening,"
we've almost got him. keep targeting their weapons array. one more torpedo ought to do it.
captain.
fire!
weapons are down!
janeway to ransom. surrender your vessel.
"we still have thrusters, don't we?"
"aye, sir."
lay in a course through the planet's atmosphere. sixty degree vector.
what the hell is he doing? follow him.
we're crossing the upper thermosphere.
phasers.
"shields are weakening. thirty one percent, twenty nine."
inertial dampers are offline.
"captain, if we loose our shields, we'll be attacked by the aliens. captain!"
break off pursuit.
they're retreating.
take us up!
"they took heavy damage. shields, propulsion."
get us out of here.
they've gone to warp.
match their course and speed.
"we can't, not until we restore primary systems."
time?
we'll need a few hours.
at least we didn't come away empty-handed.
"i want ransom's tactical status. i want it now, mister lessing."
"or what, you'll hit me?"
"no, crewman. i'll drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit."
that would be murder.
you could also call it poetic justice.
"i suppose the plan is that you're going to come to my rescue now, right?"
there's no plan as far as i know. the captain's on her own.
"ransom's status, now."
no way in hell.
"we all make our own hell, mister lessing. i hope you enjoy yours. the comm. is active. we'll be outside if you have a change of heart."
what are you doing?
weren't you listening?
don't do this.
he'll break.
bridge to the captain. we've lost shields in section twenty nine alpha.
i know. stand by.
he's a loyal officer. he's not going to betray his captain. put up the shields.
he'll break.
captain!
as you were.
level nine authorisation required.
"damn it, kathryn!"
you're panicking. he's going to talk.
"captain, a fissure is opening in that section."
understood.
"okay, you've demonstrated your loyalty to your captain. fine. now let's talk about the ankari."
"if there's an ankari vessel less than two light years from here, why haven't we detected it?"
"apparently, they use a unique form of propulsion, which makes them hard to find."
you think they'll be willing to help us?
"it's worth a try. mister lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors. once you find the ankari ship, set a course."
"aye, sir."
did our prisoner disclose any other information?
i'm afraid not. the rest of you continue with the repairs. dismissed.
commander.
"all right, we're going to try it your way. but i want to make one thing clear."
"our first priority is to get ransom. if there's one thing you've made clear, it's that."
"we've had our disagreements, chakotay, but you've never openly opposed me."
you almost killed that man today.
it was a calculated risk and i took it.
it was a bad call.
i'll note your objection in my log.
"i don't give a damn about your log. this isn't about rules and regulations. it's about right and wrong. and i'm warning you, i won't let you cross that line again."
then you leave me no choice. you are hereby relieved of duty until further notice.
"what's happened to you, kathryn?"
i was about to ask you the same question.
they are not responding.
tractor beam.
"captain, the ankari ship has done nothing"
just do it.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
starfleet.
yes.
leave us alone. there's nothing of value on our ship.
we need your guidance. your spirits of good fortune are attacking us.
of course they are. you've been killing them.
we are not the ones responsible.
equinox.
that's right. can you communicate with the aliens?
release my ship.
i can't do that. not until you agree to talk to them.
"i will summon them, but you must talk to them. you must convince them."
they say they want the humans to die.
a difficult place to start a negotiation.
will they understand me?
yes.
we didn't do this to you. we're trying to stop the humans who did.
they don't believe you would harm your own kind.
we have rules for behaviour. the equinox has broken those rules by killing your species. it's our duty to stop them.
give us the equinox. give us the equinox. they insist on destroying the ones who are responsible.
we will punish them according to our own rules. they will be imprisoned. they will lose their freedom.
"all right! if you stop your attacks, i'll deliver the equinox to you."
captain.
"i know what i'm doing, tuvok."
these beings would destroy captain ransom and his crew.
what's their answer?
your behaviour is irrational. we could find another solution.
i've already confined my first officer to quarters. would you like to join him? well?
"they agree,"
we're going to need more fuel. we've only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years.
fuel. is that the euphemism we're using now? you mean we need to kill more lifeforms.
several more.
"oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling"
clementine.
how much longer?
"another hour, maybe less. you are lost and gone forever"
"dreadful sorry, clementine."
what are you doing?
"her auditory processor. we used to practice duets together. in fact, i taught her this old chestnut. light she was and like a fairy."
and her shoes were number nine.
herring boxes without topses.
sandals were for clementine.
drove she ducklings to the water
enough.
"why the long face, captain? you're about to get your crew home. she tried to stand in your way. you had no choice."
"no choice. thank you, doctor."
"when this is all over, perhaps you'll allow me to teach you my repertoire. i'm going to need a new partner."
hmm. drove she ducklings to the water.
you. what are you doing here?
"hiding, like you."
i'm not hiding.
it's beautiful. i can see why this brings you comfort.
i don't know what you're talking about.
but it isn't real.
you're not real. now leave me alone.
it's not too late to stop.
i don't have a choice.
find another way.
there is no other way.
stop trying to hide.
"i told you, i'm not hiding. now get away from me."
end this.
no!
bridge to ransom.
go ahead.
janeway's found us.
on my way.
distance?
"fifty thousand kilometres, closing fast."
maintain course. voyager's approaching at high warp. there's a class two nebula less than a light year from here. janeway's sensors won't be able to track us once we're inside. i think that we should pursue this course.
no. open a channel.
change of tactics?
you might say that. it's time we found another way home.
another way?
"we're going to cooperate with janeway, max, if she's willing."
"rudy, with all due respect, have you lost your mind?"
just the opposite.
they're within range. they're charging weapons.
hail them.
belay that order. raise shields.
"you're relieved of duty, commander."
"i'm taking command. anyone who isn't with me, speak up now. take him to the brig."
i'm sorry.
what's the status of our weapons?
full complement of torpedoes. minimal phasers.
open a secure channel to their sickbay. stand by weapons.
"aye, sir."
i'm here.
"we're going to need your help, doctor. see if you can find voyager's current shield frequency."
acknowledged. i'll need a few minutes.
they are firing torpedoes.
direct hit to our port shields. they're holding.
return the favour.
this isn't the brig.
"i know. i'm with you, sir. let's find a way to end this."
we'll need to access transporter control.
we've damaged their port nacelle. they're venting plasma.
they're dropping out of warp.
stay with them.
doctor to equinox. i've got their shield frequency.
i'm transmitting it to you now.
they'll try to remodulate. keep monitoring.
"aye, sir."
they've slowed to one quarter impulse.
prepare a tractor beam.
they are launching another torpedo.
full power to the forward shields.
hull breach on deck four.
how'd they get through our shields?
hard about. get us out of range. remodulate the shields.
they're retreating.
pursuit course. maintain fire.
they took out the weapons array.
tuvok.
i've been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds.
we've lost impulse engines.
we're being hailed. it's ransom.
put him through.
"captain, i'm prepared to surrender the equinox, but i'm no longer in command. max decided to stage a little mutiny, but i think i can stop him. i've isolated transporter control. i can beam all of us to voyager. you might want to have some guards standing by. not everyone here is going to be happy to see you."
proceed.
ma'am?
"he's still a starfleet captain. he may have forgotten that for a while, but i believe him."
someone's trying to beam us off. forcefields.
they're deflecting our targeting scanners.
"then beam the others to voyager, yourself included. i'll take care of max."
"aye, sir."
"computer, give me access to the shield grid."
"well, i see you've made yourself at home."
what are you doing here?
taking back my sickbay.
"stop where you are. i've planted photonic charges throughout these holo-projectors. with one command sequence, i can blow out your entire"
"computer, delete the equinox emh."
the doctor's not transmitting anymore.
"burke to doctor, report."
i'm afraid your physician's no longer on call.
"max, this is the captain. i've dropped the shield grid"
everywhere except the bridge and my current location.
the vital systems are exposed.
i suggest you beam to voyager while you still can.
the core is overloading. we've got to get out of here.
where? voyager's brig?
it's better than being vaporised.
we still have a working shuttle.
"the shuttle bay's two decks down. sir, the aliens!"
we'll make it.
this way.
there's only one life sign left. it's ransom.
captain.
"things didn't work out exactly as i planned, but you've got everyone worth getting."
we're beaming you out of there.
this ship is about to explode. i've got to put some distance between us. i've accessed helm control.
you can set auto-navigation and then transport to voyager.
"there's no time! you've got a fine crew, captain. promise me you'll get them home."
i promise.
good as new. i'd like you to regenerate for the next few hours. it'll help stabilise your cortical array.
understood.
regarding the unpleasantness aboard the equinox. i hope you don't think less of me.
your programme was altered.
it's quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into mister hyde.
perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols. it will prevent such tampering in the future.
good thinking.
"when i'm done regenerating, i will assist you."
thanks.
you were off-key.
i beg your pardon?
"my darling clementine, third verse, second measure."
that's impossible.
your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz. i can assist you with that as well.
"really? holodeck two, tomorrow, sixteen hundred hours. just you, me, and a tuning fork."
i look forward to it.
"the last time we welcomed you aboard, you took advantage of our trust. you betrayed this crew. i won't make that mistake again. noah lessing, marla gilmore, james morrow, brian sofin, angelo tassoni, you are hereby stripped of rank. you'll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel. your privileges will be limited, and you'll serve under close supervision for as long as i deem fit. this time, you'll have to earn our trust. dismissed."
repairs?
coming along.
how's the crew?
a lot of frayed nerves. neelix is organising a potluck to help boost morale.
will i see you there?
i'm replicating the salad.
"i'll bring the croutons. chakotay. you know, you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own."
"the thought had occurred to me, but that would have been crossing the line."
will you look at that?
"all these years, all these battles. this thing's never fallen down before."
let's put it back up where it belongs.
stay on your course.
shields are down to twenty nine percent. they're breaking through.
let them.
sir?
take the shields offline and recharge the emitters. that'll bring them up to full power.
the charging cycle takes forty five seconds. we'll be vulnerable.
we'll be dead if we don't get the shields back up. arm yourselves! drop shields. recharge cycle?
thirty seconds.
there!
time?
ten seconds.
federation starship equinox. we're under attack. we need assistance. this is captain ransom of the federation starship equinox. we're under attack. we need assistance.
ransom. he was in command of a science vessel. the equinox.
this distress call was transmitted approximately fourteen hours ago
distance?
three point two light years.
try to get a fix on their location.
what's it doing in the delta quadrant?
perhaps it's searching for voyager.
"the equinox is a nova class ship. it was designed for planetary research, not long range tactical missions."
i've got their coordinates. heading two five eight mark twelve.
"set a course, maximum warp. go to red alert. hang on, captain."
did you know this individual?
only by reputation.
"he was an exobiologist, promoted to captain after he made first contact with the yridians."
species six two nine one. the collective determined that they were extinct.
so did the federation. ransom proved otherwise. i always wanted to meet him. too bad it won't be under better circumstances.
"i look forward to meeting him as well, and his crew. i wish to expand my knowledge of humanity."
let's hope you get the chance.
approaching the coordinates.
take us out of warp.
i've got them. two thousand kilometres off the port bow. they're moving at low impulse.
intercept. can you get a visual?
they are heavily damaged. multiple hull breaches. warp drive is offline.
what's happening to their shields?
they're being disrupted by some kind of energy surges.
weapons fire?
there are no other ships in the vicinity.
we're in hailing range.
open a channel. this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we're responding to your
"voyager, you've got to extend your shields around our ship! match the emitter frequency!"
are you under attack?
"shields, quickly!"
do it.
we're in position.
i am attempting to match their shield frequency.
do you hear something?
"interspatial fissure are opening on decks ten, six and one."
tuvok!
stand by. shields are holding.
the fissures?
no sign of them.
"voyager to ransom. captain?  assemble rescue teams. secure the equinox. tuvok, you're with me."
hello? is there anyone here?  see if you can bring main power online. tom.
what happened?
some kind of thermolytic reaction. it's desiccated every cell in that body.
"commander. i can't make heads or tails of this injector manifold, and it looks like the dilithium matrix has been completely redesigned."
"we'll try to find one of their engineers to help us. in the meantime, see if you can bypass the core."
"aye, sir."
hang on.
"i'm commander chakotay, u.s.s. voyager."
"but, but we're the only humans in the delta quadrant."
that's what we used to think. come on.
over here. hang on. we're getting you out of here.
i don't believe we've met.
"ensign kim, and this is seven of nine. i have to cut him out with a plasma torch. talk to him, keep him calm."
state your name.
"lessing, noah. what are you doing on this side of the galaxy?"
the answer is complicated.
do me a favour? see if my legs are still there. i haven't felt them in two days.
your limbs are intact.
thank you.
"seven, give me hand."
do not be frightened.
too late for that.
i'm picking up lifesigns. hello? is there anyone here?
no!
we're here to help you.
take cover! we're under attack!
neelix to sickbay.
sickbay here.
we found another survivor. his wounds are not serious but he's suffering from psychological distress.
acknowledged.
my crew?
you took heavy casualties. we're treating the survivors. who attacked you?
we don't know. we can't communicate with them. they've been attacking us for weeks.
"easy, easy."
"i've got to secure the ship,"
leave that to us.
"no, treat me here. i'm not leaving my bridge."
"i can't pull rank on you, captain, but you're in no condition to put up a fight."
"so, how's earth?"
i wish i could say.
you weren't sent here to find us?
i'm afraid not. we've been stranded in the delta quadrant for five years. we were pulled here against our will by an alien called
the caretaker.
we'll compare notes later on. let's get you to voyager.
"we're here to commemorate our honoured dead. lieutenant william yates, lieutenant john molar, ensign dorothy chang, ensign edward regis and crewman david amantes, who all served with distinction. their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten. they will be missed, but now there is cause for optimism. captain janeway, voyager, on behalf of my crew, thank you."
"we'll have time to give the newest members of our family a proper welcome in the days ahead, but right now, we've got our hands full. the equinox is secure, but its primary systems are still badly damaged. harry, b'elanna, make it your priority. captain ransom has provided us with data regarding the alien attacks. tuvok, seven, you'll be working with first officer maxwell burke. to kindred spirits. may our journey home together be swift. dismissed."
we should begin by familiarising you with voyager's defences.
can you give me a minute? there's someone i'd like to say hello to first.
"we'll be in the astrometrics lab. deck eight, section twenty nine."
see you there.
blt.
max. i tried to say hello in sickbay but you were sedated.
"i remember. i thought i was dreaming. so, where's my sweater. the blue one? class insignia on the back?"
we went to the academy together.
ah.
maxwell burke.
tom paris.
harry kim. welcome aboard.
"first officer, impressive. the last time we talked you were about to drop out of starfleet."
i heard you beat me to it. the maquis?
for a while. until i ran into these two.
and it's been hell ever since.
"well, i told your resident vulcan i'd be right with him. are you free later? i'd love to catch up."
why don't we all have dinner together?
sounds great.
blt?
"bacon, lettuce and tomato. it was a nickname."
a nickname?
my initials.
"oh, how romantic."
we broke up over ten years ago. no need to go to red alert.
how about yellow alert?
you're cute when you're jealous.
who's jealous?
see you on the equinox.
"well, turkey platter, what do you say we go to work?"
who's jealous?
"commander? i've been assigned to one of the repair crews on the equinox, and i was wondering if i could join a different team. maybe one on voyager."
problem?
just a little post-traumatic stress syndrome.
bad memories?
a few.
"actually, i could use someone with your engineering abilities."
"well, thank you. such a clean ship. i mean, i'm used to falling bulkheads and missing deck plates."
in a few weeks you won't even recognise the equinox. you'll be happy to go back.
unless i stay. you said you could use someone with my engineering abilities.
i don't think your captain would appreciate that. he's got a skeleton crew as it is.
engineering's five decks down. it's a long crawl through the jefferies tubes.  deck eleven.
i haven't set foot in a turbolift in over three months.
claustrophobia?
"if one of those fissures opened up in here, where would we take cover?"
it's only a graviton relay. nothing to worry about.
do i look worried?  emergency stop!
if you don't mind i think i'd rather take the jefferies tube.
i could use the exercise.
i've run a thermographic analysis of our shields. it revealed multiple stress points. we believe they're the result of alien attempts to infiltrate our vessels. each time a fissure opens within a metre of our shields it weakens them by point three percent.
"at the present rate, we have less than two days to mount a defence."
according to your bio-scans the aliens can survive in our realm for only several seconds.
"they're like fish out of water, but they can do a lot of damage in those seconds."
"nevertheless, it is a tactical weakness. perhaps we can exploit it."
what have you got in mind?
"if we can show them we have the ability to hold them here, they'll think twice before launching another attack."
"but the question is, how do we catch these fish?"
you build a net.
commander?
a multiphasic force field to be exact. we wanted to see what we were up against so we built a small chamber that could keep one of them trapped for several minutes.
"if we could expand on that technology, we might be able to create a lattice work of multiphasic forcefields around both ships."
rudy?
if captain janeway agrees.
we'll need to examine that stasis chamber.
i'm afraid that won't be possible. it's in our research lab. that whole section was flooded with thermionic radiation during the last attack. it'll be days before anyone can go in there.
the design schematics are in our auxiliary datacore.
i'll see if i can download them. you give me a hand?
i couldn't help but notice your crew calls you by your first name.
"when you've been in the trenches as long as we have, rank and protocol are luxuries. besides, we're a long way from starfleet command."
i know the feeling.
you seem to run a pretty tight ship.
"we've been known to let our hair down from time to time. but i find that maintaining protocol reminds us of where we came from and hopefully, where we're going."
it seems to work quite well for you.
"oh, we've overcome our share of obstacles, warp core breaches, ion storms, a few rounds with the borg"
the borg? we haven't seen so much as a cube since the day we arrived.
consider yourself lucky.
have you ever run into the krowtonan guard?
never heard of them.
that's how we spent our first week in the delta quadrant. they claimed we violated their territory. i gave the order to keep going. i lost thirty nine. half my crew.
i'm sorry.
we never recovered from that loss. it changed everything.
what do you mean?
"when i first realised that we'd be travelling across the delta quadrant for the rest of our lives, i told my crew that we had a duty as starfleet officers to expand our knowledge and uphold our principles. after a couple of years, we started to forget that we were explorers. and there were times when we nearly forgot that we were human beings."
"this is a nova class science vessel, designed for short term research missions. minimal weapons. it can't even go faster than warp eight. frankly, i don't know how you've done it. you've obviously travelled as far as we have with much fewer resources."
"i wish that i could take all the credit, but we stumbled across a wormhole, and made a few enhancements on our warp engines. i'd like to ask you something, captain to captain."
mmm hmm.
the prime directive. how often have you broken it for the sake of protecting your crew?
broken it? never. bent it on occasion. and even then it was a difficult choice. what about you?
"i've walked the line once or twice, but nothing serious. there you are."
it's a good omen. let's put it back where it belongs.
i thought i'd find you here.
how could i resist after two years on emergency rations?
"don't get too comfortable. if janeway's any indication, these people will never understand."
they're going to find out eventually.
"not if we keep them out of the research lab, and away from the warp core injectors. and be careful what you say around their crew. that includes old girlfriends."
understood.
mmm. not bad.
how's my angel of mercy?
crewman lessing. i didn't expect you to recover so quickly.
you have an outstanding emh. ours can barely hold a laser scalpel.
the doctor is efficient.
i've been assigned to help you sort through our bio-data. you saved my life. the least i can do is save you a little time.
lateral shields are offline.
how's that possible?
"fissures are opening on decks one, eight and eleven."
reroute power.
what happened?
"apparently, the aliens began to focus their attacks on a single shield vector. it collapsed before the auxiliary emitters could respond."
it looks like they've changed their tactics. we may have less time than we thought.
we've examined the schematics of your multiphasic chamber. it can be adapted. we intend to create an auto-initiating security grid.
"the moment an alien invades either ship, a forcefield will surround it."
"once we modify our field generator to emit multiphasic frequencies, it will power the security grids on both ships."
how long will it take?
approximately fourteen hours.
we don't know when they'll break through again. we may not last that long.
we could cut the time in half if we evacuate all personnel from the equinox and focus our efforts here on voyager.
"remember, we are still thirty five thousand light years from earth. we should try to preserve both ships."
"with two vessels we'd be able to pool our resources, doubling our chances of finding a short cut home."
"normally i'd agree, but right now one of our ships in vulnerable. chakotay's right. we should make our stand on voyager."
i don't want to force the issue. but i am prepared to return to the equinox with my crew. what is the protocol in this situation? we have two captains and two ships. who gets the last word?
"starfleet regulation one hundred ninety one, article fourteen. in a combat situation involving more than one ship, command falls to the vessel with tactical superiority. i looked it up this morning."
good thinking.
"in this case, protocol recognises my authority."
are you ordering me to abandon my ship?
i'd rather not have to.
that protocol was written in the alpha quadrant. i'm not sure that it makes much sense out here.
the regulation stands.
who am i to dispute protocol? give captain janeway your full cooperation.
rudy.
"max, that's an order. we'll get through this. if that's all, captain, i'd like to return to my quarters and collect a few mementoes."
by all means.
"intruder alert. same old max, going through my things. that is a command station. it's off limits without my direct authorisation."
i didn't realise. are you going to throw me in the brig?
i think we can overlook this infraction. can i help you with something?
"just doing some homework, studying your propulsion system. if there's a chance i'm going to be stuck on voyager. i figured i better learn my way around. maybe you could tutor me over dinner?"
"problem is, you were never really interested in the work, or the meal. something tells me you haven't changed."
you'd be surprised. i'm not the. what did you once call me?
petaq.
petaq. i'm not the petaq i used to be. let me prove it to you.
"look, max, don't get me wrong, it's good to see you again, but ten years."
tom paris.
tom paris.
"you could do worse.  so, we're still on for dinner? just the two of us?"
"get going, or i will throw you in the brig."
"before we abandon the equinox, we should try to salvage any useful components. let's start with your dilithium crystals."
what we have left of them. i'm afraid we only have a few isograms.
that's barely enough to power the sonic showers.
can i make a suggestion?
please.
"let's forget about the primary systems. they're too badly damaged. let's focus on supplies. we picked up a few items i think might come in handy. two kilotons of kemacite ore, a dozen canisters of mercurium."
tell neelix to make room in cargo bay one.
right.
could you use a synaptic stimulator?
depends. what is it?
it's a neural interface you wear behind your ear. it taps into your visual cortex and shows you different alien vistas. just think of it as a poor man's holodeck.
so that's how you kept yourself entertained.
beats checkers. the ponea gave it to us.
never heard of them.
we called them the life of the delta quadrant. they see every first contact as an excuse to throw a party. i wish that we had encountered more species like that. you're the first friendly faces we've seen in months. i'm glad we found you.
the feeling's mutual. those modified plasma injectors looked elaborate. what were you trying to do?
we were experimenting with ways to enhance our warp drive. it doesn't work.
maybe we should let b'elanna take a look.
it won't work. we tried for months.
excuse me.
"oh, hello there."
"commander, permission to interrupt?"
granted.
ensign gilmore.
that's right.
"naomi wildman, captain's assistant."
is that so?
i wanted to officially welcome you aboard the starship voyager.
i'm glad to be here.
"if you need anything, replicator rations, a tour of the lower decks, i'm your man."
"thank you, miss wildman. i'll keep that in mind."
as you were.
i didn't realise that you had children on board.
only one. she was born here.
"i have a nephew back on earth the same age. well, not any more. i guess he's a teenager by now. i probably wouldn't even recognise him."
you'll see him again.
ransom to gilmore.
"yes, captain."
report to the equinox bridge.
on my way. duty calls.
assemble a salvage team.
"aye, sir."
"once we take their field generator, we'll part company."
what happens to voyager?
"they have weapons, shields, a full crew. they'll survive."
maybe we should abandon ship. try to forget everything that's happened here.
"a shower and a hot meal. i guess that's all it takes for some of us to forget what's at stake here. we're going home, we can't let voyager stop us now. not when we're this close. now we're proceeding as planned. are there any other objections? i need each and every one of you to give me your very best, as you always have. max."
"this won't be easy. the generator is located on deck eleven, next to the warp plasma manifold. we can't get a clean lock without boosting the signal. marla, we need you to set aside your claustrophobia and crawl through the access port, and set up the transport enhancers."
understood.
"we'll have to take the internal sensors in that section offline. noah, you're elected."
"you can count on me, sir."
i'll disengage the power couplings from engineering.
you'll all have time for one last shower. make the most of it.
there's a minor fluctuation in the security grid.
it's within tolerance.
"i believe i can correct it. the discrepancy is in the equinox research lab. if we can determine the exact frequency of their multiphasic chamber, i will tune our field generator to match it."
there are times when perfection hinders efficiency.
this is odd. the lab is still permeated with high levels of thermionic radiation.
it should have dissipated by now.
i believe i have an explanation. three eps conduits have been rerouted to the lab. it appears they are emitting the radiation.
the lab was contaminated intentionally.
any theories?
only one. ransom doesn't want us to enter the research lab.
"he has been adamant about protecting his ship. i thought it was simply a captain's pride. i want to take a closer look at that lab. if we close off those eps conduits, how long will it take to vent the radiation?"
several hours.
i don't want to wait that long. send the doctor. he'll be immune to its effects. tell him to look for anything out of the ordinary. monitor his progress from astrometrics.
shall i notify captain ransom?
not yet. i want to wait until we test your theory.
i'm in. i've found the multiphasic chamber. there's some kind of organic mass inside. it appears to be a member of the alien species.
but it's cell structures have vitrified.
"this is more that just a stasis chamber, it's some kind of matter conversion technology. hold on, there's a control port here. hmm."
doctor?
the chamber contains a polaron grid
and a submolecular resequencer. it looks like it was designed to convert the alien cell structures into some kind of crystalline compound.
that function was not specified in their schematics.
"i've a feeling there's a lot here they didn't specify. i've accessed their research logs. they're encrypted, but judging by the file headings, they've performed this procedure dozens of times. more of the alien compound, but it's been biochemically altered. they've extracted the base proteins. its molecular structure is most unusual."
can you be more specific?
it appears to store a great deal of
"nucleogenic energy. i'm no engineer, but i'd say they were trying to convert this material into a source of power."
i'm going to miss this ship.
"once we get back to earth, there'll be plenty of women. status?"
ready on all fronts. the transport enhancers are in place and noah's created a subroutine to mask voyager's internal sensors.
power couplings?
bypass controls have been routed to our bridge. all you need to do is say energise.
janeway wants to bring on the security grid at nineteen hundred hours. we'll have to act before then. tell the others to be prepared to.
"max, the transporter room's not far from here. keep moving."
captain janeway wishes to speak with you.
"the alien compound. ten isograms. if i understand your calculations, that's enough to increase your warp factor by what, point zero three percent for one month? unfortunately, that boost wouldn't get you very far, so you'd need to replenish the supply and that means killing another lifeform. and then another. how many lives would it take to get you back to the alpha quadrant? i think you know the reason we're under attack. these aliens are trying to protect themselves from you."
"sixty three. that's how many more it will take. every time i sacrifice one of those lives, a part of me is lost as well."
"i might believe that if i hadn't examined your research. these experiments were meticulous and they were brutal. if you'd felt any remorse, you'd never have continued."
"starfleet regulation three, paragraph twelve. in the event of imminent destruction, a captain is authorised to preserve the lives of his crew by any justifiable means."
i doubt that protocol covers mass murder.
"in my judgment, it did."
unacceptable.
"we had nothing. my ship was in pieces. our dilithium was gone. we were running on thrusters, we hadn't eaten in sixteen days. we had just enough power to enter orbit of an m class planet. and lucky for us, the inhabitants were generous."
"they were called the ankari. they provided us with a meal, a few supplies, even some dilithium crystals. they even performed one of their sacred rituals to invoke spirits of good fortune from another realm to bless our journey. but these weren't spirits, they were nucleogenic life forms. our scans revealed that they were emitting high levels of antimatter. later the same night we managed to obtain one of the summoning devices in exchange for an energy converter."
"we constructed a containment field that would prevent the lifeform from vanishing so quickly, but something went wrong."
get it out of there.
we tried to send it back.
we can't.
but it was too late.
we examined the remains and discovered it could be converted to enhance our propulsion systems. it was already dead. what would you have done? we travelled over ten thousand light years in less than two weeks. we'd found our salvation. how could we ignore it?
"by adhering to the oath you took as starfleet officers to seek out life, not destroy it."
"it's easy to cling to principles when you're standing on a vessel with its bulkheads intact, manned by a crew that's not starving."
"it's never easy. but if we turn our backs on our principles, we stop being human. i'm putting an end to your experiments and you are hereby relieved of your command. you and your crew will be confined to quarters."
"please, show them leniency. they were only following my orders."
their mistake.
"it's a long way home, captain."
"doctor, return to their research lab and retrieve all the data you can locate on the aliens. i want to find a way to communicate with them."
"aye, captain."
go to their engine room. take those warp core modifications offline.
captain?
let's try to make first contact the right way.
what's going to happen to us?
that's up to captain janeway. you'll be confined to quarters until we can find a way to make peace with these lifeforms you've been killing. if it's not too late.
"to be honest, i'm glad you stopped us. living the rest of my life knowing what we've done"
you could have stopped yourself. why didn't you?
"i don't know. when the captain ordered me to modify the warp core, i concentrated on the work. i tried not to think about how it was going to be used."
"well, think about it now, because we need your help."
commander?
after you.
we're having trouble making sense of all this.
the schematics are encrypted. i can't access them.
do you know the decryption codes? your captain's been relieved of command. you take orders from me now. do you have the codes?
yes.
proceed.
"think of it this way, ensign. you might live with yourself a little easier."
you said you wanted to learn more about humanity. i guess we're not exactly prized examples. i'm sorry.
on the contrary. you've taught me a great deal.
"computer, i decrypted this data file. why can't i access it?"
emh authorisation is required.
is your emh still functional?
affirmative.
activate him.
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
i require your assistance.
who are you?
your counterpart from the starship voyager.
where's captain ransom? my crew?
in custody.
how were you able to leave your sickbay?
"this device allows me to go anywhere i please. in case you weren't aware, your crew has been running criminal experiments here."
i know. i designed them.
you? that's a violation of your programming.
they deleted my ethical subroutines.
i'm picking up spatial fissures. hundreds of them.
looks like they've stepped up their attacks.
reroute all available power to the shields.
"they're holding, but at this rate it won't be long before the aliens break through."
bridge to tuvok. we need that security grid.
we're preparing to bring it online. charge the emitters.
bridge to the doctor.
sickbay here.
did you find anything?
could you be more specific?
"neural patterns, cortical scans, anything that could help us programme the universal translator."
"er, negative. i couldn't access the equinox data files. they were encrypted."
keep studying the information we have. see what you can come up with.
"acknowledged. computer, locate captain ransom."
"captain ransom is in crew quarters. deck nine, section twenty two."
chakotay to seven of nine. what's your status?
"i've dismantled the antimatter injectors, but i'll need several minutes to neutralise the dilithium matrix."
we don't have much time.
understood.
the equinox crew has been infected with a mutagenic virus. it may be contagious. i've been authorised to inoculate them.
you've all contracted a virus. i'll need to treat you.
a virus?
doctor's orders.
it's me.
activate the grid. what happened?
i don't understand. this should be working. i'm running a system-wide diagnostic.
"i'm reading phaser fire on deck nine, crew quarters."
"security, seal off deck nine."
shields are weakening. they're down to eighty four percent.
tuvok to bridge. the field generator is offline. its power couplings were disengaged.
someone reconfigured the sensors so we couldn't detect it.
"whatever it takes, get that grid online."
i rerouted transporter control to a panel in the next junction. we can
they've sealed off the deck.
don't worry. we're getting out of here.
shields down to fifty two percent.
"captain, unauthorised transport in progress. it's the equinox crew."
block it.
they've bypassed ops control. they're on their bridge.
forty percent.
janeway to seven of nine.
"seven, respond."
damn!
what is it?
b'elanna's erected a forcefield. i can't get a lock on the generator
try overriding the command codes.
someone's disrupting the forcefield. it's max. he's using one of his triquadric algorithms. i taught him how to do that ten years ago.
shields are failing. we've got less than one minute.
"open a channel. if you don't stop what you're doing, we'll both be destroyed."
"what's my alternative, thirty years in your brig?"
i'll open fire if i have to.
we've been through worse.
target their power systems. fire.
max!
"stand by! okay, blt, let's see if you remember this trick."
"bridge, they've got the field generator!"
"what do you mean, they've got it?"
"i don't know how, but they beamed it off voyager."
get us out of here.
i can't. warp drive is down.
bridge to marla. report.
one of their crew tried to dismantle the antimatter injectors. repairs are underway.
what about the field generator?
i'm integrating it now.
shields are down.
arm yourselves.
it's now or never.
generator's in place. i'm bringing the grid online.
"fissures are opening, all decks!"
hold your fire!
take it to the lab.
"sir, engines are up and running."
set a course for the alpha quadrant.
course laid in.
maximum warp. engage.
captain!
give me tactical control.
good guess. i used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields. it won't hold for long.
"bridge to sickbay. we have a medical emergency. doctor, respond. ensign."
"yes, sir."
"casualty reports are coming in. two dead, thirteen wounded. we took heavy damage to the engines."
the equinox?
they've gone to warp.
any sign of nucleogenic particles?
no.
then they haven't engaged their enhanced warp drive yet. keep looking for
report.
the shield grid is back in place. the aliens are staying clear.
are sensors picking up voyager?
it looks like they're under attack.
maintain course.
"captain, i found the doctor's mobile emitter on deck nine. you might want to take it to sickbay."
any sign of the doc?
i've got him right here.
please state the nature of the. don't bother.
you should start with chakotay. i've got him stabilised but he's got internal injuries.
we found your emitter on deck nine.
i was taken hostage by the equinox crew. i deactivated myself to escape. did you stop them?
no.
i'd ask for a status report but i'm not sure i'd want to hear it.
harry's analysing the sound we've been hearing. he thinks it's some form of communication.
"well, i once figured out how to speak with a terrelian seapod. this couldn't be that much harder, once i get out of sickbay, i'll lend him a hand."
we should all be focusing our efforts on finding the equinox.
first things first. we've got to stop these attacks.
our enemies aren't the aliens. they're the humans aboard the equinox. it's crucial that you don't
who is it?
it's max. i've brought you a visitor.
hold on. come in.
i'm glad you're okay. i've been using this synaptic stimulator. i was just taking a stroll along the tenkaran coast. you're welcome to try it.
state your intentions.
"you know, once we get our enhanced warp drive back online, we'll be on our way home, but it'll still take months to get there. you can spend that time in the brig, or you can become part of this crew. i'd prefer the latter."
i'd prefer the brig.
"you know, janeway's not the only captain who can help you explore your humanity."
you would be an inferior role model.
janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew. maybe you should learn from that mistake.
her only mistake was trusting you.
take care of her wound.
"first degree phaser burns, minor lacerations. looks like we'll have to amputate. that was a joke. you're supposed to smile and make a witty retort."
i'm familiar with human banter. yours is crude and predictable.
"you know, seven. can i call you seven? we don't have many luxuries around here. all we've got is each other. you might try letting your shields down or else it's going to be a lonely trip. i'll be damned. looks like our doctor left us a replacement."
seven?
we are captives.
i was attacked by their emh.
looks like he downloaded you into our database. good. you can treat your friend.
priming the injectors.
marla to bridge.
go ahead.
we're ready.
acknowledged.
infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound.
"aye, sir. warp drive ready."
engage.
what happened?
the power relays are offline. they've been encoded.
give us the codes.
no.
if she won't give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves.
seven's cranial infrastructure is highly complex. you'll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast.
that's why you're going to help us.
i refuse.
do it or i'll erase your programme.
be my guest.
doctor.
"don't worry, they need me. they'd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face. now i suggest you"
"all right, doctor. now, get to work. you know what we're looking for."
very well. she'll try to resist. i'll have to restrain her.
doctor.
i deleted his ethical subroutines. he'll be a little more cooperative now. keep me posted.
"aye, captain. this way, please."
"it's not exactly shakespeare, but it gets the point across."
a small olive branch is still an olive branch.
run this through to your translation matrix.
set your weapons down.
commander?
somebody's got to start trusting somebody around here.
"belay that order. i appreciate your optimism, but in this case, weapons."
ready to transmit.
"drop shields, bridge only. go ahead, harry."
raise shields.
"if they understood our message, they haven't responded."
there's your response. activate another deflector pulse.
shields are holding at sixty two percent.
that should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet. i suggest we make the most of it. focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive. we've got to find the equinox.
"if it's all the same to you, i'd like to take another stab at the message. if we can reroute"
"they're not listening, chakotay. we should be tracking ransom, not tinkering with adverbs."
want your first officer's advice?
"allow me. our deflector's losing power, and when it fails, we'll be defenceless. it's voyager we should be worrying about, not the equinox."
you'd make a great first officer. it's advice worth taking.
"maybe so, but we have a crew member trapped on that ship."
"is this really about seven, or is it about ransom?"
i don't know what you're talking about.
"you've been known to hold a grudge. this man betrayed starfleet, he broke the prime directive, dishonoured everything you believe in, and threw voyager to the wolves."
"borg, hirogen, malon. we've run into our share of bad guys. ransom's no different."
"yes, he is. you said it yourself. he's human. i don't blame you for being angry, but you can't compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta."
"i appreciate your candour. now let me be just as blunt. you're right, i am angry. i'm damned angry. he's a starfleet captain, and he's decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for. he's out there right now, torturing and murdering innocent lifeforms just to get home a little quicker. i'm not going to stand for it. i'm going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes, no matter what the cost. if you want to call that a vendetta, go right ahead."
why did you bring us here?
this planet has a parthogenic atmosphere. it will keep us from being detected while we make repairs.
we also found a few deuterium deposits.
"take an away team, noah, and see if you can localise the ore."
"you won't be protected from the aliens. arm yourselves with phasers. at the first sign of trouble, we'll beam you back."
"aye, sir."
"the ocular node's connected to the sensory node. the sensory node's connected to the cortical node. the cortical node's connected to the reticular node. don't look so gloomy. there's a silver lining to all this. just think, we're finally going to see earth."
you are obviously delusional. allow me to repair your programme.
now why would i want you to do that? you of all people should understand. being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient.
status?
"i'm going to extract her cortical array. it contains an index of her memory engrams. but once i've removed it her higher brain functions, language, cognitive skills will be severely damaged."
tell me the codes.
no.
janeway was right about one thing. you are unique. it would be a shame to lose you.
your compassion is irrelevant.
you think this is easy for me? the sight of you on that table. but you're leaving me no choice.
"no choice. you say that frequently. you destroy lifeforms to attain your goals, then claim that they left you no choice. does that logic comfort you?"
the codes.
you'll have to destroy me to obtain them.
the reticular node's connected to the occipital node.
come in.
you wanted to see me?
it's not like you to submit recommendations in writing.
the last time we spoke you weren't exactly receptive.
"i'm afraid i'm not going to be very receptive this time, either. it's an interesting idea, but the ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction."
"i understand that, but they're the ones who introduced ransom to these lifeforms. it stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them, tell them to call off their attacks."
our first priority is to find ransom. still no sign of nucleogenic particles?
not yet.
"then he couldn't have gotten far. without his enhanced drive, his ship's only capable of warp six. i've been studying his service record. he's had his share of run-ins with hostile aliens. it seems that when he's being pursued, he tends to hide. at epsilon four he ran into a klingon bird-of-prey. played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the klingons finally gave up. two years later, he eluded a romulan warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant. go to astrometrics. start looking for the kind of place you'd hide if your ship was damaged."
"yes, ma'am."
how was the beach?
do these programmes have people in them?
"no, just landscapes. why?"
forget it.
"i'm reading a vein of ore. azimuth one seventeen, thirty metres. it could run pretty deep. we might need to use phasers to excavate it. it's funny, this reminds me of mckinley park. i used to take my sister there when we were kids. this place looks just like it. as i recall, there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there. there was a patch of poison ivy next to it. when i was ten, i walked right through it and i swelled up like a rigellian bloodworm. when i get back to earth the first thing i'm going to do is"
four to beam up.
we're receiving a subspace transmission.
from who?
i can't tell.
i don't see a ship out there. open a channel.
doctor to equinox. respond.
we can hear you.
voyager's found you. they've entered orbit. they polarised their hull to mask their approach.
i believe they've planned an ambush on the away team.
janeway's been tracking the equinox for a couple
get him back.
i can't.
"ransom to away team. noah, prepare to beam back to the ship."
they're not down there.
all hands to battle stations.
thirty thousand kilometres and closing.
target their power core.
direct hit. minor damage.
return fire.
bridge to torres. status.
i can't locate their shield grid generator. can you divert more power to sensors?
stand by.
"they've damaged our deflector, captain. if it goes offline, we'll be vulnerable to the alien attacks."
noted. target his weapons array.
we lost all phaser banks.
"torpedoes, full spread."
it's b'elanna. she's trying to bypass our security protocols.
stop her.
"computer, open a comm. link to the equinox. workstation thirty three beta."
"max, listen to me."
"back for round two, blt?"
this isn't one of our games. people are dying over here.
i wish you didn't have to be one of them.
"max, please."
"shields are weakening,"
we've almost got him. keep targeting their weapons array. one more torpedo ought to do it.
captain.
fire!
weapons are down!
janeway to ransom. surrender your vessel.
"we still have thrusters, don't we?"
"aye, sir."
lay in a course through the planet's atmosphere. sixty degree vector.
what the hell is he doing? follow him.
we're crossing the upper thermosphere.
phasers.
"shields are weakening. thirty one percent, twenty nine."
inertial dampers are offline.
"captain, if we loose our shields, we'll be attacked by the aliens. captain!"
break off pursuit.
they're retreating.
take us up!
"they took heavy damage. shields, propulsion."
get us out of here.
they've gone to warp.
match their course and speed.
"we can't, not until we restore primary systems."
time?
we'll need a few hours.
at least we didn't come away empty-handed.
"i want ransom's tactical status. i want it now, mister lessing."
"or what, you'll hit me?"
"no, crewman. i'll drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit."
that would be murder.
you could also call it poetic justice.
"i suppose the plan is that you're going to come to my rescue now, right?"
there's no plan as far as i know. the captain's on her own.
"ransom's status, now."
no way in hell.
"we all make our own hell, mister lessing. i hope you enjoy yours. the comm. is active. we'll be outside if you have a change of heart."
what are you doing?
weren't you listening?
don't do this.
he'll break.
bridge to the captain. we've lost shields in section twenty nine alpha.
i know. stand by.
he's a loyal officer. he's not going to betray his captain. put up the shields.
he'll break.
captain!
as you were.
level nine authorisation required.
"damn it, kathryn!"
you're panicking. he's going to talk.
"captain, a fissure is opening in that section."
understood.
"okay, you've demonstrated your loyalty to your captain. fine. now let's talk about the ankari."
"if there's an ankari vessel less than two light years from here, why haven't we detected it?"
"apparently, they use a unique form of propulsion, which makes them hard to find."
you think they'll be willing to help us?
"it's worth a try. mister lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors. once you find the ankari ship, set a course."
"aye, sir."
did our prisoner disclose any other information?
i'm afraid not. the rest of you continue with the repairs. dismissed.
commander.
"all right, we're going to try it your way. but i want to make one thing clear."
"our first priority is to get ransom. if there's one thing you've made clear, it's that."
"we've had our disagreements, chakotay, but you've never openly opposed me."
you almost killed that man today.
it was a calculated risk and i took it.
it was a bad call.
i'll note your objection in my log.
"i don't give a damn about your log. this isn't about rules and regulations. it's about right and wrong. and i'm warning you, i won't let you cross that line again."
then you leave me no choice. you are hereby relieved of duty until further notice.
"what's happened to you, kathryn?"
i was about to ask you the same question.
they are not responding.
tractor beam.
"captain, the ankari ship has done nothing"
just do it.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
starfleet.
yes.
leave us alone. there's nothing of value on our ship.
we need your guidance. your spirits of good fortune are attacking us.
of course they are. you've been killing them.
we are not the ones responsible.
equinox.
that's right. can you communicate with the aliens?
release my ship.
i can't do that. not until you agree to talk to them.
"i will summon them, but you must talk to them. you must convince them."
they say they want the humans to die.
a difficult place to start a negotiation.
will they understand me?
yes.
we didn't do this to you. we're trying to stop the humans who did.
they don't believe you would harm your own kind.
we have rules for behaviour. the equinox has broken those rules by killing your species. it's our duty to stop them.
give us the equinox. give us the equinox. they insist on destroying the ones who are responsible.
we will punish them according to our own rules. they will be imprisoned. they will lose their freedom.
"all right! if you stop your attacks, i'll deliver the equinox to you."
captain.
"i know what i'm doing, tuvok."
these beings would destroy captain ransom and his crew.
what's their answer?
your behaviour is irrational. we could find another solution.
i've already confined my first officer to quarters. would you like to join him? well?
"they agree,"
we're going to need more fuel. we've only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years.
fuel. is that the euphemism we're using now? you mean we need to kill more lifeforms.
several more.
"oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling"
clementine.
how much longer?
"another hour, maybe less. you are lost and gone forever"
"dreadful sorry, clementine."
what are you doing?
"her auditory processor. we used to practice duets together. in fact, i taught her this old chestnut. light she was and like a fairy."
and her shoes were number nine.
herring boxes without topses.
sandals were for clementine.
drove she ducklings to the water
enough.
"why the long face, captain? you're about to get your crew home. she tried to stand in your way. you had no choice."
"no choice. thank you, doctor."
"when this is all over, perhaps you'll allow me to teach you my repertoire. i'm going to need a new partner."
hmm. drove she ducklings to the water.
you. what are you doing here?
"hiding, like you."
i'm not hiding.
it's beautiful. i can see why this brings you comfort.
i don't know what you're talking about.
but it isn't real.
you're not real. now leave me alone.
it's not too late to stop.
i don't have a choice.
find another way.
there is no other way.
stop trying to hide.
"i told you, i'm not hiding. now get away from me."
end this.
no!
bridge to ransom.
go ahead.
janeway's found us.
on my way.
distance?
"fifty thousand kilometres, closing fast."
maintain course. voyager's approaching at high warp. there's a class two nebula less than a light year from here. janeway's sensors won't be able to track us once we're inside. i think that we should pursue this course.
no. open a channel.
change of tactics?
you might say that. it's time we found another way home.
another way?
"we're going to cooperate with janeway, max, if she's willing."
"rudy, with all due respect, have you lost your mind?"
just the opposite.
they're within range. they're charging weapons.
hail them.
belay that order. raise shields.
"you're relieved of duty, commander."
"i'm taking command. anyone who isn't with me, speak up now. take him to the brig."
i'm sorry.
what's the status of our weapons?
full complement of torpedoes. minimal phasers.
open a secure channel to their sickbay. stand by weapons.
"aye, sir."
i'm here.
"we're going to need your help, doctor. see if you can find voyager's current shield frequency."
acknowledged. i'll need a few minutes.
they are firing torpedoes.
direct hit to our port shields. they're holding.
return the favour.
this isn't the brig.
"i know. i'm with you, sir. let's find a way to end this."
we'll need to access transporter control.
we've damaged their port nacelle. they're venting plasma.
they're dropping out of warp.
stay with them.
doctor to equinox. i've got their shield frequency.
i'm transmitting it to you now.
they'll try to remodulate. keep monitoring.
"aye, sir."
they've slowed to one quarter impulse.
prepare a tractor beam.
they are launching another torpedo.
full power to the forward shields.
hull breach on deck four.
how'd they get through our shields?
hard about. get us out of range. remodulate the shields.
they're retreating.
pursuit course. maintain fire.
they took out the weapons array.
tuvok.
i've been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds.
we've lost impulse engines.
we're being hailed. it's ransom.
put him through.
"captain, i'm prepared to surrender the equinox, but i'm no longer in command. max decided to stage a little mutiny, but i think i can stop him. i've isolated transporter control. i can beam all of us to voyager. you might want to have some guards standing by. not everyone here is going to be happy to see you."
proceed.
ma'am?
"he's still a starfleet captain. he may have forgotten that for a while, but i believe him."
someone's trying to beam us off. forcefields.
they're deflecting our targeting scanners.
"then beam the others to voyager, yourself included. i'll take care of max."
"aye, sir."
"computer, give me access to the shield grid."
"well, i see you've made yourself at home."
what are you doing here?
taking back my sickbay.
"stop where you are. i've planted photonic charges throughout these holo-projectors. with one command sequence, i can blow out your entire"
"computer, delete the equinox emh."
the doctor's not transmitting anymore.
"burke to doctor, report."
i'm afraid your physician's no longer on call.
"max, this is the captain. i've dropped the shield grid"
everywhere except the bridge and my current location.
the vital systems are exposed.
i suggest you beam to voyager while you still can.
the core is overloading. we've got to get out of here.
where? voyager's brig?
it's better than being vaporised.
we still have a working shuttle.
"the shuttle bay's two decks down. sir, the aliens!"
we'll make it.
this way.
there's only one life sign left. it's ransom.
captain.
"things didn't work out exactly as i planned, but you've got everyone worth getting."
we're beaming you out of there.
this ship is about to explode. i've got to put some distance between us. i've accessed helm control.
you can set auto-navigation and then transport to voyager.
"there's no time! you've got a fine crew, captain. promise me you'll get them home."
i promise.
good as new. i'd like you to regenerate for the next few hours. it'll help stabilise your cortical array.
understood.
regarding the unpleasantness aboard the equinox. i hope you don't think less of me.
your programme was altered.
it's quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into mister hyde.
perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols. it will prevent such tampering in the future.
good thinking.
"when i'm done regenerating, i will assist you."
thanks.
you were off-key.
i beg your pardon?
"my darling clementine, third verse, second measure."
that's impossible.
your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz. i can assist you with that as well.
"really? holodeck two, tomorrow, sixteen hundred hours. just you, me, and a tuning fork."
i look forward to it.
"the last time we welcomed you aboard, you took advantage of our trust. you betrayed this crew. i won't make that mistake again. noah lessing, marla gilmore, james morrow, brian sofin, angelo tassoni, you are hereby stripped of rank. you'll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel. your privileges will be limited, and you'll serve under close supervision for as long as i deem fit. this time, you'll have to earn our trust. dismissed."
repairs?
coming along.
how's the crew?
a lot of frayed nerves. neelix is organising a potluck to help boost morale.
will i see you there?
i'm replicating the salad.
"i'll bring the croutons. chakotay. you know, you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own."
"the thought had occurred to me, but that would have been crossing the line."
will you look at that?
"all these years, all these battles. this thing's never fallen down before."
let's put it back up where it belongs.
input failure.
input failure.
input failure.
our link to the collective has been severed. initiate secondary protocols. the vessel's transwarp chamber is approaching critical pressure. we must evacuate this area.
agreed.
no directional coordinates available.
that way. bearing three zero one.
agreed:
bring that drone.
captain?
i'll be right with you. the station manager didn't tell me the vines were prehensile. i went to put some water in the pot and it grabbed me.
"this is a gift from the kinbori delegation. i don't know its name, only that it's used in one of their sacred games and it's very heavy."
put it down anywhere. thank the kinbori for me and give them a token of our esteem.
i already gave them a voyager medallion. they seemed appreciative.
"come in. doesn't it look like christmas morning in here, commander?"
you have to admit the generosity of our guests is very impressive.
as is their proclivity for criminal behaviour. this morning's security report.
"a broken odn line, some missing personal items, a damaged scanner relay. all in all, not that bad."
there is a second page to the report.
"oh. some of these incidents are a little more serious but, on balance, i still think we did the right thing."
there is a third page.
"come on, tuvok. after all the xenophobic races we've run into, don't you find it just a little refreshing to meet some people who value openness and freedom?"
"well as far as i'm concerned, opening the ship has been a fascinating experience and an unqualified success. i'm very pleased."
me too.
i am pleased that you are pleased. if you'll excuse me.
tuvok. please accept this token of our esteem.
"ooh, ow! it's got me by the hair!"
now it's twelve forty five.
if you're hungry you may eat without me.
you said we'd have lunch together.
i haven't completed my analysis of the station's power conversion matrix.
how long is it going to take?
several hours.
"seven, you promised."
very well.
i think it's even more crowded than this morning.
yes.
"excuse us. excuse us. please, we're trying to get through to the turbolift. excuse us."
stand aside!
thank you.
"i'm sorry, but there's no more marsupial surprise. we only had two kilos of pouches to begin with, and it's all gone. now how about some pizza, huh?"
"she's a shivolian, right?"
correct.
species five two one?
your mother would not approve of you memorising borg designations. i don't approve either. we've discussed the impropriety of you emulating the borg.
sorry.
i'm finished.
we just sat down.
i do not enjoy crowds.
but you were in the collective. wasn't that like a big crowd?
which is why i do not enjoy them now.
"oh, i'm sorry, i didn't realise that. let's go."
excuse me. are you seven of nine?
yes.
you okay?
these are borg synaptic relays from my original unimatrix.
these are yours?
where did you acquire them?
a trader from orendal five. i was told you are a former borg drone and might be interested in acquiring these pieces.
i'll take them. captain janeway will provide you with whatever monetary reimbursement you require.
agreed.
i must examine these items more closely.
okay.
what's your name?
that was rude.
stage two is complete. she has the relays.
she's going to study them.
her regeneration alcove is in cargo bay two.
that's where she'll go. we should prepare for stage three.
agreed.
there's consensus. rendezvous at my coordinates and stand by to penetrate their security.
error.
explain.
we shouldn't be desecrating the body of this drone. it is against the will of brothara.
who is brothara?
brothara. supernatural deity worshipped by species five seven one.
i am a member of species five seven one.
you're being confused by irrelevant data. ignore it.
you said i am a member of species five seven one. do you consider yourself an individual?
there are no individuals here. we are borg.
agreed.
resume constructing the communications beacon.
it looks like a standard borg synaptic relay.
"there must be something more. when i first came into contact with it, i was overwhelmed with images, memories, sounds."
"sounds like a perfectly natural reaction to me. that was part your old unimatrix, right? well, isn't it at least possible that what you experienced was simply nostalgia? you know, sentimental feelings about the past."
"i know what nostalgia is, but i have no feelings about the past."
okay. i think i've done all i can here.
lieutenant. you were trying to help. i appreciate that.
"anytime. oh, and, er, you may not be nostalgic about the past, but i'd say you definitely have feelings about it. strong ones."
their security protocols are formidable. we may not have enough time.
i'm worried about seven of nine. we should re-examine the question of simply asking
you know what her reactions will be. she won't help us because she
we've been through all that.
enough!
i need consensus.
we can't act without it.
i know.
so then it's up to you. do we proceed or not?
"yes. we, i apologise for my indecision."
apologies are irrelevant.
"computer, begin multi-polar analysis."
analysis underway.
time to completion?
"five hours, seventeen minutes."
she's regenerating.
begin rerouting their internal sensors.
rerouting sensor input to secondary processors.
hold.
what have you got?
there's a power fluctuation in the security grid.
all we know is that we've got a security breach. we don't know where.
ready. insert the interlink module.
ready.
he's still worried about injuring her.
"if we fail, we'll never become individuals. we have to remember that."
there is consensus.
i've found her memory files.
she's aware of our presence.
she's trying to regain consciousness.
we must abort.
no! we're too close.
i will not comply.
i have performed this action before. i was with my father. he was a tall man.
i have a similar memory. but i was in a house and the fire was in the hearth.
the biomatter is ready.
it tastes similar to a bird i once ate.
i used to prepare food for my parents. they lived in a small building by a river.
i used to be afraid of the dark.
"just before i was assimilated, i was eating with a group of men. we worked in numbers. mathematics. i calculated equations for another man."
i have a name. it's marika. marika willkarah. willkarah.
"hello, marika willkarah."
her designation is three of nine.
i have a name. p'chan. son of dornar and ansha. my primary function was to care for them.
"i was married. we were on a starship, the excalibur. i worked in engineering."
this is not my hand.
my parents are dead. the borg killed them. i hate the borg.
this is counterproductive. we must delete all irrelevant data.
i want my hand back.
"i was on duty, the night watch, when the borg came. oh, my god, look at what they've done to me. these, these things they put in my body. what have they done?"
command override. cease this interaction. comply! we will not access these memory files again. initiate the prescribed maintenance and survival protocols only. no further communication is required until we are r-assimilated into the collective.
agreed.
agreed.
agreed.
but whoever removed their implants was a poor surgeon. their internal organs were damaged during the procedure and their bodies are covered with scars.
you said you recognised them.
not at first. but when they attempted to access my memory files i was momentarily linked with them. two of nine. three of nine. four of nine. we were all members of the same unimatrix.
do you know why they were trying to access your memories?
no.
how long have they been disconnected from the collective?
"three or four months. however, they are still connected to each other. somehow, the left parietal lobes of their brains have been transformed into organic interlink nodes. they've become linked together into a sort of collective triad."
revive them. i'm captain janeway. we know who you are and we know what you were trying to do. what we don't know is why.
she has information we need.
what kind of information?
we want to become
individuals.
you want to break the neural link between the three of you?
"wouldn't you? none of us is alone with our own thoughts, our own feelings."
every day of my life is spent hearing their two voices in my head.
"when we're asleep, we experience each other's dreams."
how's that different from life in the collective?
in the collective there are billions of voices. they become white noise.
"but, with only three"
each voice comes through clearly.
it has to stop. we must break the neural link.
"doctor, is there anything you can do?"
the modifications are too extensive. their neuronal pathways have been fundamentally altered.
you hold the key.
why?
you were there with us.
planet one eight six five alpha. you must remember.
eight years ago our vessel crashed. the four of us were the only survivors.
when we were reassimilated
we found we'd been linked together somehow.
we were a subset within the collective.
it's like having three voices whispering in one ear
and a crowd screaming in the other
"we had to break free, so we worked together. we finally escaped."
we had our implants removed on inavar prime.
but they couldn't break the neural link.
"we need to find out what happened eight years ago, after the crash."
"the night we were reassimilated into the collective. we need to know how the link was created, but our memories are"
"fragmented, disorganised. we hoped that you would know."
"i don't. however, i am willing to attempt to retrieve the data. come with me."
are you ready?
yes.
data search complete. do you remember anything further?
no. my last memory
is of us standing
around the campfire.
and yet the data files in your cortical processor appear to be intact. i see no evidence that would explain your lapse in memory.
what about you? why don't you remember what happened?
"i don't know. i've found no evidence of damage to my memory files either. i remember the campfire and then waking up in the collective. there is an obvious gap, but no indication of why."
why do they still call you seven? you should have a name.
it is my name.
no. it's a designation. you're an individual now.
i decided that my former name was no longer appropriate. prepare to reinitialise the memory cascade.
i can't wait to use my real name again.
there is nothing preventing you from doing so.
"except that most of the time i don't know whether my name is marika, p'chan or lansor. the names, the memories"
"the memories, even the thoughts flow from one to the other."
i can't love or hate or laugh.
or cry without sharing it with them.
how can any of us take a name for
for ourselves?
we're not individuals.
we're not borg.
we're nothing.
begin the memory cascade.
a friendly game?
"well, that's how it started."
i see. perhaps you could explain to me how this friendly game turned into a street brawl?
"well, harry and i wanted to explore the station. we wanted to broaden our understanding of alien cultures and, er"
skip the recruiting speech. you were looking for a bar. then what?
"well, we found one, and we met a pair of kinbori who told us about this game they play with these big, odd-looking rackets."
you mean one of those?
yeah!
"in any case, they challenged us to a game and we accepted, but i guess we weren't quite aware of all the rules."
because you'd been drinking.
"yes, ma'am. you see, we thought it was a version of tennis, but as soon as we hit the first volley this kinbori jumps over the net and starts attacking us with his racket."
so we figured we were supposed to fight back.
yeah.
"and then, er, well, things got a little out of hand."
"a little out of hand? seven voyager crewmen, including two bridge officers, along with thirteen kinbori and one morphinian café owner, all arrested. the charges range from disorderly conduct to assault on a security officer."
that last one's not true.
"thank you, mister kim. i'll note that exception in my log. you're both confined to quarters until further notice, after you report to sickbay. that's all. well, did you win?"
"oh yes, ma'am."
we kicked their rackets.
good. dismissed.
any progress?
i've determined that we all have exactly the same gap in our memories. it seems unlikely that it would be a coincidence.
so you believe the collective deliberately wiped your recollections of the reassimilation process?
it is the most likely explanation.
but?
the collective would not care that four drones remember being reassimilated.
something must have happened during the process. something they wanted to hide from you. let's look at this from a different perspective. why would the collective lock them into a neural triad in the first place?
i don't know. there is no advantage to having three drones linked together in this manner.
"they obviously did it for some reason. and i get the feeling that if we can answer that question, the rest should fall into place. but i wish we could find a way to close the gaps in your memories."
there is a way.
i assume there's a reason you didn't mention it before now?
"it would involve linking my neural interface to theirs. together, we may be able to restore the missing data. however, i would again be part of a group mind."
"you're not eager to revisit that experience, hmm?"
there's also the possibility that i could become trapped in the neural link.
turning the triad into a quartet. i won't ask you to take that kind of risk.
"i do feel compelled to help them, but i am uncertain as to the correct course of action."
let me ask you something. do you think of these people as family?
is it relevant?
there's an old saying. blood is thicker than water. it means that the ties of family run deeper than any other kind of relationship. we'll often do things for members of our family we'd never dream of doing for anyone else.
seven. seven.
naomi wildman.
i heard about the drones. did they hurt you?
i am not damaged.
what do they want?
"they are seeking information from me, but i am uncertain whether i can help them."
oh. be careful.
"naomi wildman, do you consider me to be family?"
"i, i don't, i mean. yes. is that okay?"
i have no objection.
do you think of me as family?
yes.
"i'll be monitoring your neural readings while you're in the link, but i'm not certain i'll be able to counter the effects if you become trapped."
i know you'll do your best.
it's never a good sign when the patient feels the need to comfort the doctor. good luck.
ready?
ready.
ready.
ready.
you are damaged. i will assist you. don't worry. everything will be all right.
the collective has located us. a borg vessel is on its way.
we will be one with the borg again.
no. i do not want to rejoin the collective.
agreed.
that is in violation of all established protocols.
"forget the protocols. you're not a drone. you're a person, like us."
"you have a name, a life. all you have to do is embrace who you really are."
no. i do not exist. i am only part of the greater whole.
that's what they want you to believe. that's what they want us all to believe.
we are borg. our primary function is to serve the collective.
not anymore.
error. input failure.
"they may know what planet we're on, but without the beacon it'll be far more difficult to locate us."
"if we can remodulate our cortical implants, we might be able to elude their sensors."
we must leave this place.
this discussion is in violation of all established protocols.
you stay here and be reassimilated if you want to. i won't.
what are you doing?
the nanoprobes will create new interlink nodes in your left hemisphere. resistance is futile.
i will not comply. i will not comply.
state your designations.
two of nine. primary adjunct of unimatrix zero one.
three of nine. auxiliary processor of unimatrix zero one.
four of nine. secondary adjunct of unimatrix zero one.
what is your primary function?
to serve the collective.
you will repair the communications beacon.
it was you. you were responsible. what have you done to us?
you linked us together.
you're responsible for our suffering.
how could you do it?
if you didn't want to return to the collective
you didn't have to.
you don't understand what happened.
somebody help me!
what's happening?
somehow they broke their link with seven. they're malfunctioning. help me get them to sickbay.
"when they broke the connection with you, it must have overloaded their cortical implants. they went into neural shock."
and yet i was undamaged?
i think i know why. you said you remembered injecting them with nanoprobes eight years ago.
yes. it created an interlink between them. it was the only way to prevent them from escaping the collective.
"well, it seems to have had an unfortunate side effect. their higher brain functions were somehow tied into the interlink. when they broke their connection with you in the cargo bay, the shock to their cognitive systems was too great."
can you revive them?
"i can remove the microcortical implants. that would break the link binding them together, but it would also kill them. they'd only live a matter of weeks. a month at the most."
what are the other options?
"they could be returned to the borg. if they were reassimilated into the collective, they would regain consciousness, and then live out a normal life span."
as drones.
"as drones. but they'd be alive, seven."
they have no hope of surviving unless they return to the collective.
"not exactly a happy ending, is it?"
no.
"back on that planet, why do you think you reacted so differently from the rest of them? why were you so afraid of becoming an individual?"
"when i was first assimilated into the collective, i was a child. they were assimilated as adults. when our individual memories began to resurface"
yours were of being a little girl. a scared little girl.
"i let that fear control me. after i saw the drone die in the swamp, i panicked. i began to envision my own death. alone, without even the sound of another drone to comfort me. so i forced them to return. i infiltrated their left cerebral hemispheres with nanoprobes and created a new interlink network. one that they couldn't resist. and then i eliminated the evidence of what i had done."
you were overwhelmed by feelings you couldn't begin to understand. you're not responsible for that.
"because of what i did, they'll be forced to live the rest of their lives in the collective. for that, i am responsible."
"there's a difference between surviving and living. they'll survive in the collective, but they won't really be alive. you know that better than any of us."
there is no alternative.
how long would they survive if the doctor deactivated this interlink network you created?
a month at most.
"a month as an individual, or a lifetime as a drone. which option would you choose?"
survival is insufficient.
i beg your pardon?
"eight years ago, i forced them to return to the collective. i won't make the same mistake again. they deserve to exist as individuals. we must terminate the link between them."
"i understand that you feel a certain responsibility for these patients, but as their physician, so do i. it's my duty to preserve their lives for as long as possible, even if that means"
i will not return them to the borg.
"are you thinking of what's best for them, or for you?"
clarify.
"you said it yourself. you made a mistake. and seven of nine doesn't like to make mistakes. she strives for perfection. i want you to think about the motivation behind your decision. are you doing what's right for those three people, or are you trying to alleviate the guilt you feel over what happened eight years ago?"
"the damage i did can never be repaired, and my guilt is irrelevant. i simply want them to experience individuality, as i have. as you have. at one time, you were confined to this sickbay. your programme was limited to emergency medical protocols. in some ways, you were not unlike a drone. but you were granted the opportunity to explore your individuality. you were allowed to expand your programme. your mobile emitter gives you freedom of movement. your thoughts are your own. if you were told you had to become a drone again, i believe you would resist."
yes. i suppose i would.
"they would resist as well. they would choose freedom, no matter how fleeting. only you and i can truly understand that."
survival is insufficient.
it's so quiet.
i had no idea you were going to say that. i don't know what either of you is thinking.
i'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own thoughts. i'm leaving.
where will you go?
"i want to see the space station, to meet new people. to fill my life with life again, in the time i have left."
i'm leaving as well. there's an uninhabited planet only a few lightyears from here. i'd like to spend my final days in the open air.
"my people don't believe in holding grudges. i wish you well, seven of nine."
thank you.
it's nice to be on a federation starship again. i'd like to stay aboard voyager.
the captain said you may stay as long as you wish.
"you mean as long as i have. i can't forgive you for what you did to us, but i do understand why you did it."
naomi wildman.
i thought you might like some company.
why?
because of what happened with the drones.
i see that word travels quickly.
it's a small ship. i thought maybe you might want to spend some time with family.
torres to voyager. i could use a little help here.
what's your status?
"i'm approaching your position, but that ion storm blew out my deflector field. i've lost helm control and i'm venting plasma from the port nacelle."
we're modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down.
acknowledged.
the arresting fields are in place. you're clear to land.
"hold on, b'elanna. this is going to be bumpy."
b'elanna? are you alive?
you tell me.
you've got a mild concussion.
that's the best thing that's happened to me all day.
"when i give you an order, i expect you to follow it. i told you to return to voyager, not chase the probe into the centre of an ion storm."
we only have one multispatial probe. i didn't want to lose it.
"we only have one b'elanna torres. i don't want to lose her, either."
understood.
"lanna, i'm glad you made it back in one piece,"
did you just call me lanna?
i suppose i did.
that's what my mother used to call me.
"well then, i'm in good company."
come in.
feeling better?
i've felt worse.
i found something you might be interested in. it's what my ancestors called a monkey wrench. it was lodged in your port nacelle.
how did it get there?
"judging by your sensor logs, it looks like you ran into it after your deflector field collapsed, but the big question is, how did it get in this quadrant?"
what do you mean?
what? it's klingon!
and it's old. that's about all we know. looks like the klingons beat starfleet to the delta quadrant by a few hundred years. you may be holding the most important archaeological find in klingon history.
"remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the empire. you know, the simplest explanation is that the borg assimilated a bird of prey somewhere in the alpha quadrant and they blew it out an airlock on their way home."
"maybe so. in any case, it makes a nice souvenir."
"harry, it bled. ut screamed. there's got to be some explanation."
"hey, i've got one for you. you hit your head harder than you thought."
i wasn't hallucinating. now run a submolecular scan.
how many more scans are we going to run? there's nothing there. no fluid or vapour residue.
we may find some irregularities at the atomic level.
it's a hunk of metal. what you heard may have had nothing to do with this artefact. maybe the comm. system picked up some stray signal from a pulsar. i don't know.
a pulsar that speaks klingon?
"okay, b'elanna, there probably is some explanation for what happened. but it's oh three hundred hours. i'm tired, you're tired. let's just stick this thing in a containment field and deal with it in the morning."
ah! just the daughter of the empire i've been looking for. i wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your discovery of the klingon artefact.
"neelix, i ran into it with a shuttle."
some of the greatest discoveries in klingon history were accidents. when sarpek the fearless unearthed the knife of kirom he was searching for his lost targ. isn't that amazing? i've been doing some research.
why?
"well, i'm planning a celebration. this must be the treasure."
"neelix, look, i appreciate your enthusiasm, but since i'm the only klingon on board, there's really no point in throwing a party."
"oh, nonsense. this artefact isn't just a testament to klingon spirit. it's a piece of the alpha quadrant. a symbol of voyager's home. and that's just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old knife."
the man's got a point.
"and besides, i've already replicated five barrels of bloodwine. i'm not going to let them go to waste. festivities begin at nineteen hundred hours. oh, er, i almost forgot. as guest of honour, you're going to be expected to say a few words on behalf of your people."
it sounds like you've got a big day ahead of you. you should probably get some rest.
"all right, all right, let's call it a night."
thank you.
do not underestimate the power of the mind. the artefact was a catalyst for your already active imagination. it served as an unwelcome reminder of your ancestry. the self-loathing you experience when you look in the mirror and see a klingon.
who said anything about self-loathing?
"you despise being klingon. it's no secret. what you experienced in your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred. the blood in your veins, the voices of your ancestors, all symbols of your klingon heritage."
"and when the blood disappeared that was, what, me trying to vaporise that part of myself?"
"yes, but the essence of who you are, the artefact itself, remained."
and the moral of the story is?
"quite simple. that despite your efforts to become something else, whether it be starfleet or maquis, your klingon nature continues to assert itself."
that's an intriguing theory.
perhaps we should forego your meditation in favour of a different exercise.
fine by me.
this should be interesting.
feel the weight of the bat'leth in your hands. describe the first thought that enters your mind.
"it's a clumsy weapon. overstated, like everything else klingon."
you can't see the elegance of its design because of your hatred.
i don't hate klingons.
"it's a warrior's blade, crafted for precision and balance. observe."
is this your idea of therapy?
listen to yourself whine like a ferengi.
petaq!
you're not worthy of the blood in your veins. a true klingon would try to kill me where i stand.
what the hell has gotten into you?
"this exercise is over. you are dismissed, lieutenant, and take your dishonour with you."
'ej humtah 'ej dechtah 'iw. and the blood was ankle-deep. 'ej doq sodtah ghospa' sqral biqtiq. and the river skral ran crimson red.
i fail to see the merit of learning a klingon drinking song.
"it's not about drinking, seven. it's about saluting the noble deeds of our ancestors and honouring those who fell in battle. think, qapla'. think, long live the empire!"
think again.
"okay, so i'm overdoing it a bit. but try to get into the spirit of the occasion."
very well. 'ej humtah 'ej dechtah 'iw.
'ej doq sodtah ghospa' sqral biqtiq 'e' pa' jaj law' mo' jaj pus jaj qeylis molar migh hohchu'.
"gagh, anyone? sop joq jih yuv gagh drek."
"he said, eat this or he'll force it down the gullet of your corpse."
no offence.
"oh, none taken. so this is replicated, right?"
unfortunately.
and how do you get it to move?
i used a kinesthetic agent to give it a little oomph.
"is it just me, or has everyone gone klingon-happy?"
"oh, come on, b'elanna. they're all doing this for you."
"well then, they don't know me very well, and if you even think of joining in on this embrace your heritage nonsense, i swear, i'll rip out your tongue and wear it as a belt."
"oh no, there's not a lot of klingon in you."
i inherited the forehead and the bad attitude. that's it. she would have loved all this.
your mother?
"she was so obsessed with klingon ritual, myths. it used to drive my father and me crazy. did i ever tell you that she put me in a klingon monastery?"
you're kidding.
it was after their marriage ended. she pulled me out of the federation school in order to teach me honour and discipline.
"out of the plasma cooker, into the fire."
she prayed to kahless every day to guide me in the ways of the warrior. i guess he wasn't listening.
"ladies and gentlemen. could i have your attention, please? i hate to interrupt the festivities, but before i turn the floor over to our resident klingon, i'd like to say a few words. this is a great day for the klingon empire. a day when we honour their ancestors, those warriors whose deeds of valour and glory led them to the delta quadrant."
may they live on in song and story.
captain!
legh soh va gre'thor.
where am i?
silence the dead ask no questions.
"computer, end programme."
qem nuh meq.
let go of me!
"wait, wait."
uch ghah!
"no, wait."
she won't take the mark.
what the hell is going on?
qus'daq ba'. qus'daq na ghah.
where am i?
you should know. you're half klingon.
enlighten me.
this is the barge of the dead. our dishonoured souls are being taken to gre'thor.
klingon hell is a myth.
that's what i thought. just a foolish superstition. imagine my surprise.
but i was on voyager with my crew.
"that was the naj, the dream before dying. when we can't accept that we've died, we create the illusion of life to hold on to."
he slaughtered my friends.
"no, he slaughtered the dream. he dragged you from the illusion of life. this is where you belong."
"hij'qa. mag hoshonah nes'a gre'thor. jih neh. jih ghaj nug soh neh. jih qhaj nug soh. nug soh los. vav, nuqdaq sho? nuqdaq' oh puchpa'e'"
what is that?
it's the kos'karii. they'll try to lure you to them. don't listen.
duj tlvoqtah. batlh daqawlu'tah. tugh!
"b'elanna, are you there?"
"lieutenant, can you hear me?"
help us find you.
tom? chakotay?
it's not your friends.
there are things here worse than death.
you.
is this the mongrel child you spoke of.
yes. the one whose face would not bear the mark.
"b'elanna, daughter of miral. it's not your time."
how do you know my name?
you've come close to boarding this ship many times. i remember the first. you were a child. your mother took you to the sea of gatan. your curiosity was as deep as the water.
i fell in. i almost drowned.
"when your mother breathed life back into your lungs, she told you about me."
so you're supposed to be kortar.
ah. you remember me.
"i remember the myth of kortar, the first klingon. he destroyed the gods who created him."
"and as punishment, i was condemned to ferry the souls of the dishonoured to gre'thor."
"i may have believed in you as a child, but not anymore."
"if you didn't still believe, you wouldn't be here."
foolish girl.
you cannot harm me. i'm already dead.
what's happening?
the soul of another dishonoured warrior is being delivered.
kot'mah soh gre'thor.
mother.
it's all right. you're safe.
your shuttle was drifting on the trailing edge of an ion storm. you lost life support. we found you just in time.
but i got through the storm. i remember crashing into the shuttlebay.
"when we tractored your shuttle back to voyager, you were in a coma."
we almost lost you.
the klingon artefact.
artefact?
my hand.
you took quite a beating out there. more than your fair share of cuts and bruises.
come in.
how are you feeling?
"er, a little out of place."
would you like to talk about it?
yes. and no.
let me know when you decide.
i don't know how to say this without sounding crazy.
try.
do you believe in an afterlife?
i accept there are things in the universe than can't be scanned with a tricorder. what happened to you out there?
"i think i died. i died, and i was on the barge of the dead in the klingon afterlife."
klingon mythology has been ingrained in you since you were a child. it's not surprising you experienced some of those images while you were unconscious.
"i saw my mother, chakotay. if it was real, then she's dead."
"b'elanna, your mother, the barge of the dead, those are just symbols. it's your subconscious mind trying to tell you something."
tell me what? that my mother is going to hell?
you need time to digest what you experienced. you have to interpret the symbols and search for their meaning.
what if there is no symbolism to interpret? what if the afterlife is real? i'm an engineer. my whole life i've immersed myself in science and schematics. but what if it's time to start looking beyond that?
"my grandfather used to think he could transform himself into a wolf so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm. it was real to him, as real as what your experience was to you, but that doesn't mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all fours."
my mother has been on my mind a lot lately. we just had a big anniversary. it's been ten years since we talked. but it was so real. i could taste the blood in the air. i could feel the wind. i was seasick from the rocking of the boat.
hi.
hi.
what are you reading?
the paq'batlh. it's a sacred klingon scroll.
find anything?
you don't want to know.
"oh, come on. it can't be that bad."
you want to bet? i found out why my mother is on her way to gre'thor. it's because i sent her there.
what do you mean?
"the sins of the child. she's being punished for my dishonour. i turned my back on everything klingon, and now she has to pay the price."
"b'elanna, you can't even be sure your mother is dead, much less blame yourself for what happens to her in some afterlife."
look at this. the eleventh tome of klavek. it's a story about kahless returning from the dead still bearing a wound from the afterlife. a warning that what he experienced wasn't a dream. the same thing happened to me.
b'elanna.
and the only reason kahless was in the afterlife to begin with was to rescue his brother from the barge of the dead and deliver him to sto-vo-kor.
okay.
"don't you see? i have a chance to rescue my mother, if i can accept responsibility for her dishonour before she passes through the gates of gre'thor. i have to go back."
"well, wait a minute. what do you mean, go back?"
i can't let her suffer for what i've done. it's the only way.
"b'elanna, i respect what you believe in, but you're starting to scare me."
i'm scaring myself.
"it's a controlled procedure. i'll be under constant supervision. the doctor can simulate the conditions of the ion storm. he's agreed to help me, but only with your permission."
i'm still not inclined to grant your request.
are you telling me that i can't pursue my spiritual beliefs?
"b'elanna, i'm not going to let you turn this into a debate about freedom of worship."
but that's what it is.
"there's a limit to how far i'll let religious practices go aboard this ship. if your belief system required you to sacrifice a child to your gods, i wouldn't allow that either."
that's an absurd example.
"you want to simulate a near death experience so you can revisit the barge of death, and you're telling me what's absurd? bottom line, b'elanna. i'm not going to let you risk your life for this."
"captain, please."
request denied.
"what i do with my own life is one thing, but to know that i have condemned my mother. that because of what i've done, she's"
"i appreciate what you're trying to say, b'elanna, but whatever you experienced, it wasn't real."
"it doesn't matter if you think it was real. it was real to me. whatever it was, it changed me. i can't ignore that. i need to confront what's happened."
i'm sorry.
"you know, you're just like her."
lieutenant?
"my mother. you're as dedicated to starfleet principles as she was to klingon honour. i know that we haven't always seen eye to eye, but despite our differences you helped me become a good officer. and i'd like to think that you're proud of me for it."
i am.
my mother never had the chance to be proud of me. i'd like her to know me the way you do. i don't want her to die thinking of me as a disgrace. you have to let me do this.
"i can't believe the captain is allowing this. one minute you're in a coma, the next you're a born-again klingon?i just don't get it."
"i'm not sure i get it, either. i just know this is something i have to do."
"there must be an easier way for you to explore your spirituality. go to church, or something?"
it wouldn't be enough.
"look, i'll read the scrolls, i'll learn klingon. we'll figure this out together."
next time.
i just hope there is a next time.
there will be.
report.
i've examined the sensor logs from the shuttle mission. i should be able to recreate the exact conditions that triggered her near-death experience.
good. b'elanna?
i'm ready.
be careful.
"you'll have an hour to do whatever it is you need to do. at the first sign of trouble, we're bringing you out. understood?"
"computer, erect an isolation field around the surgical bay. decrease oxygen concentration within the force field by twenty seven percent. begin ionising the enclosed atmosphere to five thousand particles per cubic metre. she's unconscious."
neural activity is decreasing to eighty seven percent. sixty two percent. synaptic function is failing.
compensating.
neural activity is nominal.
she's not breathing.
she's still alive. her lungs are taking in just enough oxygen to keep her brain from necrotising.
"qapla', b'elanna."
sus'a g gre'thor qay.
mother.
stay away. you are an illusion. you're a kos'karii trying to lure me away
"mother, it's me. it's me."
b'elanna? then you died as well?
i've come to lift your dishonour.
but you don't believe in sto-vo-kor.
a lot's happened since the last time i saw you. i've changed.
not enough. it was you who brought this damnation upon me.
if you hadn't tried to force me to become a warrior
i tried to guide you in the ways of a klingon.
you tried a little too hard.
"if you had listened to me when you were younger, we wouldn't be on the barge of the dead. you were always running away."
you drove me away. the same way you drove away my father.
he abandoned us.
"you pushed him to the point where he couldn't bear to be around anything klingon, including me."
"i wanted to give you honour. and if you had understood that, i would be not be on my way to gre'thor."
"we're on the barge of the dead and we're still having the same argument we were having ten years ago. look, if i have dishonoured you, i am truly sorry."
are you? you have too much anger in your heart to be sorry.
"oh, we don't have time for this if we're going to perform the transference."
is that how you intend to lift my dishonour? by taking my place?
"oh, don't worry. i have no intention of being on this barge when it gets to gre'thor. we've got just enough time to perform the ritual before my crew resuscitates me."
oh. i should have known you'd choose the easy way.
what are you talking about? do you know the risks i've taken to save you?
"you still understand nothing about being a klingon. i would rather face damnation with what little honour you have left me, than cheat my way into sto-vo-kor."
there she is. bring them.
the mongrel child has returned.
i'm here to take my mother's place.
b'elanna!
you wish to claim her dishonour as your own?
yes.
you're willing to die for her?
yes. release her to sto-vo-kor.
no!
keep her quiet!
silence.
"it's not your decision. she has the right to reclaim your honour. once we've reached gre'thor and you are within its gates, i will release her."
no. now.
you're very impatient. time must be slipping away in the living world. you're concerned that your friends will revive you before you complete your deception. did you really think that i could be fooled so easily?
"i will die for her. no tricks, no games. i will take her place honourably, like a klingon."
"if you choose this path, your friends will not be able to save you."
no! i forbid it!
i understand.
your dishonour has been lifted. sto-vo-kor awaits you.
i will not abandon my daughter.
she has made the choice. go!
"daughter of miral, embrace your fate."
her neural patterns are breaking down.
"i'm initiating emergency resuscitation. vent the ionised particles. twenty milligrams cordrazine, now."
i'm deactivating the forcefield.
welcome to gre'thor.
this isn't gre'thor.
"oh, i assure you it is. you've taken your mark."
"what is this, some kind of a joke?"
this is no laughing matter.
"you've met mister neelix, our ambassador to the recently deceased. questions, comments, suggestions, he's your man."
if you'll follow me.
"by the way, i'll be performing an aria from berlioz's faust tomorrow night in holodeck two. feel free to stop by."
"fifteen decks. computers augmented with bioneural circuitry. top cruising speed, warp nine point nine seven five. not that you'll be going anywhere."
no fek'lhr? no cavern of despair?
don't need them.
i don't consider voyager hell.
"are you sure? have you ever been truly happy here? if you thought fifty years aboard this ship would be difficult, try eternity."
'ej humtah 'ej dechtah 'iw 'ej doq sodtah ghospa' sqral biqtiq 'e' pa' jaj law' mo' jaj pus.
this is a great day for b'elanna torres. a day when we pay tribute to her dishonour.
she's not responding to the cordrazine.
"neural activity at forty eight percent, thirty seven."
we're losing her.
we have to stabilise her synaptic functions. i'm attempting a direct neural resequencing.
"b'elanna's misdeeds have led her to gre'thor. she comes with no valour, no glory, nothing to celebrate in song and story."
you really have no one to blame but yourself.
"you've kept us all at arm's length. even tom, who you claim to love."
"hear, hear."
"i tried to assist you in making engineering more efficient, but you resisted. you're stubborn."
"she inherited that from her mother, along with the forehead."
what do you think of the afterlife so far?
it's not exactly what i had in mind.
are you interpreting all the symbols? searching your subconscious for their meaning?
lieutenant torres. defend yourself.
captain?
what are you still doing here? i released you to sto-vo-kor.
you can't free me until you free yourself.
i don't understand.
you never did.
i did everything that the ritual told me to do. i came back for you.
forget the ritual. it's meaningless.
meaningless? i died for you.
"no, you didn't. it's not your time. you still don't understand this journey."
then tell me.
request denied.
what do you want?
who are you asking?
you. kahless. the tooth fairy. anybody who will tell me what i am supposed to do.
"you are the only one who can answer that question. choose to live, b'elanna."
neural activity's at twenty three percent.
initiate cortical stimulation. pulses at fifty millijoules.
no effect.
increase to seventy millijoules.
"come on, b'elanna."
defend yourself.
you want me to fight? you want me to be a good little klingon? is that it?
you've let your anger consume you. now it's consuming us.
she's condemned us all.
misery loves company.
get away from me.
or what? you'll kill us where we stand?
tell me what you want me to be. a good starfleet officer? a good maquis? lover? daughter? just tell me what you want from me.
"we don't want anything from you, b'elanna."
we only want you.
we're not your enemies.
defend yourself.
i don't know how. i'm so tired of fighting.
we know.
you've taken the first step of your journey.
and what about you?
we will see each other again.
in sto-vo-kor.
"yes, in sto-vo-kor. or, maybe, when you get home."
"mother? oh god, i'm alive."
welcome back.
"somewhere, in that totality known as the universe, is a galaxy called the milky way. tucked into the corner of that galaxy is a planet named earth. on that planet is a city called mantua. go straight ahead past the fountain, turn right, then left, then right again. you'll find yourself walking along the water, listening, as a man sings of his beloved's unfaithful heart. and even the fish begin to weep. quando, la donna e mobile.  la donne e mobile, qual piuma al a vento, muta d'accento, e di pensiero. sempre un'amabile, leggiadro viso,in pianto o in riso, e mensognero. la donna e mobile, qual pium al vento, muta d'accento, e di pensier. e di pensier."

maybe i'd better run a diagnostic on your hearing subroutines.
"my hearing's fine. i was just letting my mind wander, that's all."
"if you're not working on anything, you should deactivate yourself. save us the energy."
"wait a second, i thought i was scheduled to go on the away team."
"well, the planet looks safe on the long range sensors. any medical problems, and we can use the transporter. but, take a look at those scans and see if there's anything we might have missed."
"lieutenant, i wanted to go on the away team. there's a canyon on that planet i'd like to investigate."
"i've already handed out assignments. next time. if you'd like, i'll snap a few images for you."
don't bother.
suit yourself.
i'll just use my imagination.
where did that come from?
good question. it didn't show up on sensors until a few minutes ago.
"t class nebula. a thousand kilometre diameter. hydrogen, helium, argon."
nothing too dramatic.
"if you want some drama, take a look at this."
"to captain kathryn janeway, starship voyager. from emergency medical hologram, starship voyager. topic, status of emergency medical hologram, starship voyager."
he's filing a formal grievance.
regarding?
"his treatment by the crew. there's also a paragraph about his future on voyager, and a proposal for his advancement."
failure to acknowledge sentience. rude behaviour. what's this? a request to be made captain in the event of a catastrophic emergency? he's serious.
"dead serious and he wants a formal response, for the record."
"protocol allows for commander chakotay or myself to address his demands, if the captain would prefer."
"no, i'll take care of it. i don't want anybody to be uncomfortable on this ship. i guess we should all try to be more considerate of his feelings."
"captain, he does it to himself. he's chief medical officer. is it our fault that's not enough for him?"
"resume course toward the planet. chakotay, you have the bridge. i've got a formal response to draft."
what category did i assign that vessel?
unacceptable risk.
correct. and what was my justification for that decision?
the ship appears in none of our databases. initial attempts to scan the interior failed.
then why are you wasting our resources?
"i think i can penetrate the hull, using a microtunnelling sensor."
and observe the interior one molecule at a time? there are other potential targets that must be surveyed.
"if i could tap into a data transfer conduit, i'd be able to reach their main computer core. that would tell me all we need to know about their tactical systems, in theory."
we could be detected. they may not like being spied upon.
"i think i've been very careful avoiding it. i'll take every precaution, i promise."
unacceptable risk.
i've already transmitted my proposal to the hierarchy. they should be responding momentarily.
do you have something you'd like to say?
no.
the hierarchy cannot be bothered with every ill-conceived notion that you
they've approved. i'd better get started.
you're too confrontational. he'll report you.
huh. acceptable risk.
the layer of antonium runs right along the edge of the canyon.
my scans show geological instability within one hundred metres of the target location.
i could put the flyer down just outside of that.
"i don't know, tom. that might be a little too far."
"what's the matter, neelix? afraid of a little exercise?"
i think we could handle a hundred metre stroll.
i have to agree.
maybe getting there. it's coming back i'm worried about. we'll be loaded down with ore. if the ground is unstable
i suggest limiting the team members to twenty kilograms. preliminary scans indicate the crust is dense enough to support that weight.
you might try carrying a transport enhancer to the site.
that's not a bad idea. we'll beam the ore back to the delta flyer and we won't have to carry anything.
"you know, this mission is starting to look a little more dangerous than we thought. maybe we do need the doctor to come along. if one of us fell through the crust there could be injuries."
i require his assistance in astrometrics.
what for?
that's none of your business.
i think it is.
oh!
"what's wrong, captain?"
"it's nothing, really. an old academy injury. it flares up every now and then. i've learned to live with it, but maybe you should stay here and have a look. right there."
get away from him.
you are dismissed. doctor? doctor?
"yes, captain?"
let's talk about these demands of yours.
i've given you a great deal of freedom on this ship.
i'm not disputing that.
"but you're not satisfied, either."
"i should be allowed to participate and advance according to my abilities, like any other member of this crew."
you should also know your limits.
my programme can be expanded indefinitely. i don't have limits.
"maybe, but we all have primary responsibilities. yours is sickbay."
i'm a computer programme. multiple tasking is second nature to me.
"this proposal of yours to be made a, what? what did you call it?"
ech. emergency command hologram.
"in principle, it's an interesting idea. a backup captain in case i'm incapacitated and the command structure breaks down. but expanding your programme would take months of work."
the lives of the crew may depend on it someday.
"i'm afraid the answer's no, doctor. however, as part of my formal response i have recommended that starfleet assign a team of engineers to consider your proposal. when we get back to the alpha quadrant, i'll pass it along."
"thank you, captain."
"thank you, doctor."
"ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to introduce the emergency command hologram."
"i've tried to access their internal sensors, but i couldn't get past the security encryption. so, i found something even better. a holographic crewman. i've tapped into his cognitive subroutines. we can now monitor everything he's experiencing."
it's like having an agent on board.
to the ech.
"captain, this is such an honour, but if you don't mind my saying, hardly a surprise."
"allow me to introduce the doctor. he's a computer programme, a sentient piece of holographic technology. and he is voyager's medical officer."
voyager?
"that's the name of the ship. i've only been observing the doctor for a matter of hours, and i've already learned more about this vessel than i did in three days of sensor sweeps."
elaborate.
the reason voyager is not in our database is because they are not from this quadrant. they're lost. alone.
no backup vessel?
uh huh.
no one to contact for help?
"precisely. another few hours of observation and i will know all we need to know about them. defences, weapons, crew complement, everything."
from monitoring one individual? unlikely.
"actually, it is very likely. the social structure on voyager is, is much different than ours."
how so?
"this is my observation post. i have a single function. but the doctor does much more than just practice medicine. he has access to the entire ship, and he seems to be an expert on everything. in fact, the captain just gave him authorisation to command the bridge! it was a very exciting moment."
why aren't you monitoring him now?
"the link drops out intermittently, but it should be re-established in a few minutes."
maintain your surveillance.
"this'll take care of any potential allergens in the planet's atmosphere. i'll monitor your medical status from the bridge, but i don't anticipate any problems. since i'm not going, i wonder if you'd mind snapping a few holo-images for me while you're down there."
gladly.
"tell me something, mister neelix. do you daydream?"
"on talaxia, we have a saying. the dream dreams the dreamer."
care to translate?
we like to think that fantasies and daydreams come from someplace else. another land. they slip into our minds and whisper about things we never imagined.
a strange notion.
"do you daydream, doctor?"
"of course not. i'm a computer programme. i prefer wide shots, mister neelix. if you're feeling creative, throw in a little ultraviolet."
will do.
voyager to delta flyer. report.
we're approaching the canyon. whew! what a view!
i'm sure it is.
put us in a synchronous orbit above their landing coordinates.
"voyager, mayday!"
what's wrong?
we've been hit. i'm taking us into the canyon.
harry?
i don't know what happened to them.
"i am picking up a vessel, captain. it's borg."
red alert. on screen. battle stations.
captain. you must relieve me of duty at once.
an assimilation virus has penetrated our defences.
we're becoming drones.
hard to starboard. reinforce the shields.
incoming fire.
doctor.
"computer, activate the ech."
acknowledged.
transferring all systems to your command. you have the bridge.
"indeed. shields to maximum. photon torpedoes, full volley. fire. computer, report."
enemy shields are intact.
we are the borg.
i know very well who you are. stand down your weapons.
state your designation.
"emergency command hologram, at your service."
designation unknown.
not for long.
doctor.
"warning, primary shields are failing."
this is the last time i'm going to ask you. stand down your weapons. turn back while you still can.
you will be assimilated.
"over my dead programme. computer, activate the photonic cannon."
the photonic cannon is online.
fire.
"doctor, can you confirm? the readings, doctor."
"um, er, er. readings. er, confirm, of course. er, the away team's physiologies are within acceptable parameters. all life signs stable."
"you're okay to proceed, tom."
understood. we'll contact you again when we reach the site.
voyager will not be an easy target. it is armed with something called a photonic cannon. i watched them destroy a borg sphere with a single volley.
there are no reports of borg in this region.
i saw it with my own eyes.
did you check for debris?
the ship was annihilated. there was nothing left for the sensors to pick up.
continue.
"their captain was disabled in the attack. the hologram is now in command. he's an impressive individual. a physician, an engineer, a warrior. and very attractive to the females. we must at all cost try to avoid a direct confrontation with him. i recommend a type three stealth assault."
"the hierarchy approves. prepare for a stealth assault, type three. scan for borg. we don't want any last minute surprises. or mistakes."
doctor? can i have a word with you?
"i know i let my attention drift a little on the bridge, but i assure you"
are you kidding? that was incredible. i just wanted to congratulate you.
"for what, exactly?"
the borg will have to think twice about attacking voyager again. nice work.
"computer, locate commander chakotay."
commander chakotay is in his quarters.
something wrong?
what were you trying to do?
i've been experimenting with introducing a new function into my programme. cognitive projections. daydreaming. i wanted to be able to daydream.
an inefficient activity.
"we all do it now and then, seven. why not the doctor?"
my thought exactly.
so what's the problem?
the algorithms are malfunctioning. i'm starting to daydream whether i want to or not.
they say a doctor who operates on himself has a petaq for a patient.
i can help him.
i'm sure you can.
the doctor and i are going to sickbay.
"any excuse to be alone with him, eh, seven?"
assimilation is an unpleasant fate.
is that a threat?
this isn't possible. the warp containment field is failing.
warp core breach in thirty seconds.
try stabilising the antimatter flow.
the control linkage is down.
warning. warp core breach a lot sooner than you think.
we've got to get someone inside the warp core. try to eject it manually.
no one could survive the current level of plasma radiation.
the doctor.
"this isn't real, is it?"
"doc, you're the only one who can help us!"
"warning. last chance to be a hero, doctor. get going."
"here's the problem. the new algorithms weren't isolated properly. they've branched into his perceptual subroutines. doc, why don't we take a closer look at the matrix and. what are you doing?"
i have to eject the core.
what?
deactivate his programme.
"no, it will damage his matrix."
don't try to stop me.
let's take him to sickbay.
i have to. i have to save the ship. i have to save the ship. i have to save the ship!
"you look lovely tonight, seven. where shall we go? that sounds wonderful."
the new algorithms have completely taken over his programme.
ambassador!
so now he's daydreaming constantly?
it's a photonic cannon. i designed it myself.
he seems to be randomly jumping from one to the next.
"pardon me, miss."
i routed his subroutines to holodeck one so harry and seven could monitor his fantasies.
"do you think that's appropriate? they're his fantasies, and i promised him we'd show a little more consideration."
"it'll give us a better idea of what's going on, help us fix him."
"mister neelix, how thoughtful. you baked me a cake. this won't get you out of your check-up."
kim to sickbay.
"go ahead, harry."
you might want to have a look at this.
we're on our way.
"keep still, please."
"anything you say, doctor."
he does the hands very well.
"apparently, he's had a great deal of practice. look at these."
i see.
computer. activate the emergency command hologram.
this is the part i like.
nice touch.
bring the photonic cannon online.
photonic cannon?
"a weapon of mass destruction. invented by the doctor, of course."
of course.
in many of his fantasies he takes command and saves the ship.
i see.
which means that particular algorithm is more easily accessible than the others.
"so, if we can isolate it, we might be able to stabilise his programme."
why do you torment me like this?
that was never my intention.
it wasn't?
"i want you to be happy, b'elanna."
without you?
what?
shush.
i'll always be fond of you. that will never change.
you can't just leave me. i couldn't bear to be alone.
"aren't you forgetting someone? he needs you, b'elanna. now more than ever."
forget him. he's not half the man you are.
i've seen enough of this.
"all right, let's go back to sickbay and try to isolate that algorithm."
congratulations.
"thank you for this opportunity, captain. all i ever wanted was to live up to my full potential, to hone all my skills, expand my abilities, to help the people i love."
what's the status?
i lost the signal again. i don't know what happened.
two assault vessels are on course to join us. accurate information is essential.
"the more i learn about voyager, the more i wonder if it's worth the trouble."
clarify.
"launching an attack against such a heavily armed vessel carries a great risk, and for what? a little antimatter and some dilithium."
your survey indicated large quantities of both. we've already committed substantial resources to mounting this assault. were you mistaken?
"no, not at all. i'm just sounding a note of caution."
"if our boarding party doesn't find voyager exactly as you've described it, the hierarchy will be informed."
i understand. there has been no mistake.
then we'll proceed.
i've made a terrible mistake.
how terrible?
"the doctor was appearing in a different location every few seconds. it didn't seem possible, so i investigated a little further and i haven't been monitoring his perceptions, i've been watching his dreams, or his, his imaginings. i'm not sure which. but none of this is real. what am i going to do?"
i came to check on your patient.
"he's doing just fine, captain. it took lieutenant torres half the night to stabilise my matrix, but i haven't had a single flight of fancy since. i apologise for altering my programme without permission."
at least there wasn't any permanent damage.
"i'm afraid there was. i've been exposed, humiliated. turned inside out for all the world to see. if i've lost your respect"
"that will never happen. certainly not because we've seen a few random fantasies. we all daydream, doctor. it helps us imagine other possibilities in life. just hold off until we've figured out a way for you to do it without damaging yourself, all right?"
come in.
ship's status report. federation law? thinking about a career change?
"in a way. not for me, though. i've been going over the legal precedents for granting command positions to holograms. there aren't any."
"captain, this ship needs its doctor. he should focus on what he was programmed for. medical care."
"i think we've underestimated him because of our own human limitations. his full potential's unknown, chakotay."
would you be comfortable handing over your ship to a computer programme?
"well, i don't know if i'd take it that far."
you might have to. he probably won't settle for less.
"oh, no."
allow me to shake your hand. congratulations.
"doctor, may i please have a word with you?."
i don't recall dreaming you up.
you didn't. i'm transmitting a simulation of myself into your programme. but i am real.
doctor to the bridge. i'm daydreaming again. somebody deactivate me.
voyager is about to be attacked.
"of course it is, unless the valiant doctor swings into action, right?"
"yes, yes, precisely."
a common theme in all my fantasies.
i reactivated your cognitive algorithms. i put you back into this fiction.
i'm ready to pose again tonight.
here.
why?
it was the only way for me to communicate with you.
i'm listening.
"i'm a long range observer on an assault class vessel. i scan passing ships for technology and raw materials. when i find an acceptable target, we raid it."
you've been spying on us.
"more to the point, on you. for several days i've been using a long range tunnelling sensor to tap into your programme. you were supposed to be our eyes and ears on voyager. instead, i got this."
my daydreams? you tapped into my daydreams? that's why my algorithms have been destabilising.
my fault. i'm sorry.
tell me about this attack.
my ship is less than an hour away. i can help you avoid a confrontation but you must do exactly what i say.
why should you want to help us?
"you don't understand. the hierarchy does not tolerate mistakes or misinformation. if they learn of my error, i'll lose my livelihood."
"well, that's what you get for being a peeping tom."
but i also care about what happens to you. i feel like i've got to know you over the past few days.
"you've been spying on my fantasies, not me. you don't know me at all."
"but i do. i know how your mind works, what your hopes are. you created all these possibilities. my species, we're very different. our thinking is confined but, i can't help but admire you. i don't want you to be harmed."
then i suppose we should swing into action.
"captain, we're about to be attacked. alien vessels are approaching."
"there's nothing on the sensors, doc."
the vessels are cloaked.
how do you know this?
one of the aliens contacted me.
i've detected no transmissions.
he spoke to me in a daydream.
"i don't want to hear it. however, i would like to know why you've disobeyed my direct order."
i can prove it to you. the alien told me how to reconfigure our sensors to compensate for their cloaking field.
"he's right. i'm picking up three ships out there. distance six hundred million kilometres, headed right for us."
on screen. maximum magnification.
the alien won't help us unless we help him.
what if this is all part of their attack? a ruse?
he's already helped us compensate for their cloak. i'm inclined to believe him.
"so am i, but i'd just as soon set a course away from here at maximum warp."
that will only delay a confrontation. they have vessels hidden throughout the entire sector.
did your friend have a plan?
"he said they're running what's called a type three stealth assault. they won't decloak until they're right on top of us, at which point they'll fire a warning shot across our bow. then come the demands for supplies and technology. if we don't comply, they'll destroy us. fortunately, the alien promised to transmit the resonance frequencies of their phasers."
and in return?
"in return. he mistakenly informed his superiors that i was in command of voyager. to keep himself from being demoted, he wants us to maintain that fiction. when they open the channel, i have to be sitting in the captain's chair. i'm sorry, captain, but he insisted."
"well, i guess it's time to turn fantasy into reality."
i'm in over my head. what if i fail?
you sound like i did when the captain put me in command of the night shift. that chair looked so big i thought i'd sink so far into it that nobody would be able to see me.
but you had your academy training to fall back on.
"yeah, well, sounds like you've had plenty of practice."
that wasn't real.
"listen, doc. the whole reason you wanted to be able to daydream was to test out possibilities, right? consider this a field test."
why isn't there any hull damage from the borg attack?
they repaired it.
so quickly? hmm. prepare for type four assault.
type four? that would cause a huge drain on our energy core. a waste of resources. do you really think that's necessary?
"what i think doesn't matter. your long range surveillance indicated an attack by borg. on closer inspection, that appears to be doubtful. your report on this vessel could be mistaken. i think caution is in order. the hierarchy agrees. proceed to type four."
captain on the bridge.
it won't bite.
what i wouldn't give right now for a whoopee cushion.
a what?
ancient technology.
"captain, we're ready to proceed."
"acknowledged, commander."
the internal comm. link is active. no one will be able to hear you but the doctor.
"doctor, are"
you ready?
"no, but do i have a choice?"
"i'll be with you every step of the way. just remember, i'm still the captain."
understood.
i'm receiving a transmission on a secure channel. audio only.
must be the doctor's friend. let's hear what he has to say. doctor?
hello? voyager here. it's me.
"doctor, something terrible has happened. they've ordered a type"
four assault. our phaser frequencies will be rotated
continuously. i won't be able to help you.
evasive manoeuvres.
three vessels are decloaking off the port bow.
that didn't feel like a warning shot.
direct hit. shields are holding.
they're hailing us.
"this is it, doctor. on screen."
"see? there he is. be careful, he, he's dangerous."
the hierarchy controls this region of space.
your ship has supplies and technology that we require.
tell him we'll defend ourselves.
they won't get what they're after.
we'll defend ourselves. they won't get what they're after.
huh?
i mean you won't get what you're after. not in a million years. not if i have anything to say about it.
"don't improvise, doctor."
sorry.
"an exchange of fire would damage both of our ships, but we have support nearby. you are alone. take your weapons offline and prepare to be boa"
"excuse the interruption, commander. i have found a potential weakness in their shields, but i'll need time to reconfigure our phasers."
"keep him occupied, doctor. on screen."
this is my final warning.
don't rush me.
take your weapons offline immediately. i won't ask again.
"you appear to be suffering from a physio-emotive disorder. you're impatient, quick to anger. do you have any idea what that does to your vascular pressure? you may want to see a physician."
firing phasers.
direct hit.
"ha! how do you like that, huh? a taste of your own medicine."
"tone it down, doctor."
sorry.
our phasers are offline.
prepare to be boarded.
"it's time to negotiate, doctor. tell"
tuvok!
"activate the photonic cannon. tuvok, that was an order!"
"activating the photonic cannon, sir."
i'd rather not give the order to fire.
my sensors are showing no activation sequence.
of course not. the photonic cannon is impervious to sensors.
the borg couldn't detect it either. that's why they were destroyed.
the borg
"the hierarchy, it's all the same to me. just another bully who didn't know when to back off."
we'll be vaporised!
the hierarchy suggests retreat.
they're moving away at maximum impulse.
"go ahead, doctor. you've earned it."
seven of nine to the doctor.
go ahead.
i require your assistance in the mess hall.
i'll be right there.
surprise!
"don't worry doc, you're not dreaming."
captain?
"for your imaginative defence of this ship and her crew, i'm awarding you the starfleet medal of commendation. congratulations."
thank you.
i've also reconsidered your request. i'm going to authorise a research project to explore your command abilities. you're a natural.
"congratulations, doctor.  that was a platonic gesture. don't expect me to pose for you."
noted.
"all right, all right, hold on. if you were married in 2304 and your daughter was conceived in your eleventh pon farr, that would make you a hundred and sixty two years old."
incorrect.
"come on, tom, the man's not a day over one forty. we know you were at least a hundred when you joined starfleet the second time, so i'm guessing you're around one thirty three?"
also incorrect. i'm afraid you both lack sufficient data to reach a logical conclusion.
"come on, tuvok, tell us."
i see no reason to enlighten you.
don't tell me vulcans are embarrassed about their age.
on the contrary. we value the wisdom that comes with advancing years.
"in that case, how wise are you?"
wise enough to end this inquiry.
saved by the bell.
i've got a fleet of ships two hundred thousand kilometres dead ahead.
can you identify them?
negative.
i'm reading multiple hull configurations.
raise shields. red alert.
report.
we've detected a large group of vessels directly ahead.
hostile?
possibly. i'm charging weapons.
on screen.
i'm counting sixty two ships and a few hundred pieces of ships. all dead in space.
"it's a junkyard. congratulations, tuvok. you just saved us from a flotilla of hostile trash."
we're being hailed.
let's see what they want.
"welcome to abaddon's repository of lost treasures. whether you're in the mood to buy or simply browse, we're always open. take a look. you may find something you never knew you wanted."
mister abaddon.
"the name was passed down from my father and his father before him. not a very imaginative lot, but i'll answer to it just the same."
"i'm commander chakotay, this is mister neelix."
welcome to voyager.
"neelix, is it? you wouldn't be a fellow trader, would you?"
what makes you say that.
"cheerful demeanour, furtive eyes. it's obvious you're a man of commerce."
"you're very perceptive, mister abaddon."
a useful skill in my line of work.
"i'll admit there was a time when i dabbled in commerce but, these days i focus my efforts on food and diplomacy."
"well, whether you're interested in a new iso-convective oven or a slightly dated translation matrix, you've come to the right place. my inventory, give or take a few items. after twenty years, it's hard to keep up."
looks like you have an item or two we might be interested in.
"ah, the question is, what are you looking for in return?"
artificial gravity plating. plasma-based power induction. impressive.
"those are integrated systems. unfortunately, we couldn't trade them to you without dismantling our whole ship."
"commander, don't we have some spare duranium sheeting in cargo bay one? with a few modifications, it could be converted into gravity plating."
good idea. why don't you show mister abaddon our inventory? report back when you're done.
"yes, sir. mister abaddon, follow me please."
this guy's collected more technology than the borg.
and almost all of it is useless.
wait. what's that?
ensign?
"grid forty nine alpha. oh, she's beautiful."
it's just an old rust bucket.
"are you kidding? look at those lines. it's a work of art. that ship wasn't assembled, it was sculpted. i think i'm in love."
"that makes fifteen power regulators in fair condition, and three more we could salvage with a little work. seven has some doubts about the ion exchange rods."
we'll take a chance. add them to the list. what about these cultural artefacts?
"oh, just a few items i thought might have some historical value. they don't cost much."
looks like a good haul. if that's it?
"oh yes, there is one other item. a small vessel that could be an asset."
"we've already got a full complement of shuttles, not to mention the delta flyer. what do we need with this derelict ship?"
"chakotay, this ship is a diamond in the rough. sure, it's got some scrapes and scratches, but, here, take a look at these systems. it has a neurogenic interface that allows it to react directly to the pilot's thoughts. that gives it the potential of being quicker and more manoeuvrable than anything we've got, including the delta flyer."
add to that an optronic weapons array.
i get the picture. are you sure you're not just looking for a new toy?
"no, absolutely not. even b'elanna thinks restoring this ship is worthwhile."
maybe. if we had the manpower to restore it.
"no, i'll do all the work myself. on my own time. and if i need a hand, harry's offered to help."
i have?
what will it cost us?
abaddon's agreed to give it to us for three used power cells and tom's interactive record collection.
my jukebox.
all right. one slightly used alien ship. don't make me regret this.
you won't.
"remember, just one seat, not much storage. she was designed for speed, not hauling."
understood.
make sure you go easy on the thrusters. she doesn't like being manhandled.
temperamental?
"sensitive. she demands respect, like any fine piece of machinery."
sounds like you're sorry to let her go.
"well, in some ways she's like the daughter i couldn't marry off. but that doesn't mean i'd trade her to just anyone. i've got a feeling you're the kind of pilot that she needs. someone that'll give her the proper care and attention."
i'm your man.
"don't worry, mister abaddon, she's in good hands."
"well, this has been a very productive exchange. oh, just one more thing."
let me guess. all trades are final.
i still can't get an active readout.
here's the reason. another damaged power cell.
"oh, come on, alice, how about it? give us a break."
alice?
"well, i've got to call her something."
how about the lost cause?
"alice battisti was the lost cause. i knew her back at the academy. she was smart, sexy, but she wouldn't give me the time of day."
"all right, alice it is. try it again."
i've got a pulse.
a little snug.
"as seven would say, an efficient design. the main computer's coming online."
there's not much in it. just a few schematics. looks like somebody tried to wipe the database.
"probably rolled the odometer back, too. let's see what this neurogenic interface can do."
whoa.
what's it like?
"it's kind of hard to describe. i'm tapped into all the primary systems. ops, tactical, sensors."
what happened?
we just blew out two more power cells.
see if you can reconfigure the power distribution grid.
"look, we're both tired. why don't we call it a night, come back fresh tomorrow?"
"come on, we can still get a couple more hours in."
you can get a couple more hours in. i'm going to bed.
"all right, you win. good night, alice. see you in the morning."
"good night, alice. see you in the morning. see you in the morning."
see you in the morning. see you in the morning.
tom.
b'elanna?
tom.
who are you?
"it's me, alice."
"good morning, alice."
"sorry, you're going to have to trust me on this. you'll be a lot happier if we can bypass the eps relays."
tom.
yeah.
who are you talking to?
"alice. she's being very stubborn today. no matter what i do, i can't get her to bring her propulsion systems online."
next question. what are you wearing?
this is a flight suit design i found in alice's database. something her last pilot used to wear.
"for a minute, i thought you were changing captain proton's look. chapter thirty seven."
"oh, the web of pain. i completely forgot."
no problem. i've got another hour on the holodeck.
now's not a great time. how about tomorrow?.
that's what you said yesterday.
"sorry, harry. alice needs me."
so does arachnia.
give the queen my regards. okay.
"seven, can i get you something?"
a refund. the star charts we obtained from abaddon are inaccurate.
really?
the computations are based on obsolete data.
it's not the only item that didn't live up to its advertising.
cultural artefacts?
"according to abaddon, they're lost treasures of the delta quadrant. if you ask me, they're worthless trinkets."
perhaps not. this crystal is beryllium.
valuable?
beryllium is the standard currency in spatial grid five three nine. there are species that would trade an entire fleet of starships for this trinket.
"if abaddon knew about this, he'd never have traded it for a few plasma couplings. maybe i should return it."
need i remind you? all trades are final.
"neelix, i need one bottle of champagne, if you don't mind."
another anniversary?
"no, i'm christening alice."
congratulations. i'll whip up some hors d'oeuvres for the crew.
"oh no, don't bother. this is a private ceremony. just me and b'elanna."
"and alice, of course."
"oh yes, of course."
"there's nothing like having your own ship. i remember when i first laid eyes on my little freighter, baxial."
"no, don't tell me. love at first sight."
"actually, i thought she was the ugliest thing i ever saw. but she grew on me. eventually, i couldn't imagine being without her. you know, she's still down at the shuttlebay. why don't we get her and alice together and go on a double date."
"you pack the picnic basket, i'll bring the deuterium."
"so, i finally get to meet the other woman."
"well, don't be too critical, she's a long way from finished."
when have you ever known me to be critical?
"is that a trick question? okay, ready?"
well?
it's beautiful. i can hardly believe it's the same ship.
"yeah, most of it isn't. i've replaced the impulse reactor, navigational array, er, plasma manifolds. the list goes on and on. just a few more repairs, and she'll be spaceworthy. care to do the honours?"
it's almost a shame to break this over the hull.
you have a point.
"oh, be careful the upholstery."
i'll send an engineering team down to clean it up. to alice.
to alice.
so when's her first flight?
"a couple of days, if i can round up all the parts i need. you want to come with me?"
sure there's room?
it'll be a tight squeeze.
we'll manage.
hold on.
something wrong?
it's these environmental controls. they need recalibrating.
"it is kind of warm in here, isn't it?"
"alice, lower the ambient temperature."
"please specify, tom."
five degrees should do it.
temperature modification complete.
that's some voice.
it came with the ship. are you jealous?
maybe i should be. i hear you've been sleeping here.
when alice lets me sleep.
"sounds like a real slave driver. well, if you're trying to make improvements, you might want to start with these reactant injectors. the deuterium mix is too high."
"that's how alice likes it. no, don't touch that."
i was just trying to help.
"well, thanks, but we're fine."
"we? it's a ship, tom."
"yeah, but she's my ship."
"well then, maybe i'll leave the two of you alone."
okay. i'll see you later.
thanks for the champagne.
ow!
"oh, sorry. i need to fix that."
"thirty metres of eps conduit? a broadband sensor matrix? a tactical data module? tom, i appreciate your enthusiasm, but i can't spare these parts right now."
they're just lying around cargo bay two.
"those are emergency supplies, and this isn't an emergency."
"okay, what if i just replicated some?"
"that takes energy, which isn't exactly in abundance at the moment. maybe in a few weeks, if we can replenish our power reserve."
a few weeks? what am i supposed to do until then?
"your duties, which you've been neglecting. you've been late for two shifts in sickbay. you've been distracted on the bridge. maybe it's time you gave this project a rest."
"yeah, you're right. i guess i have been overdoing it."
you look run down. maybe you should stop by sickbay and have the doctor take a look at you.
"no, i'm fine. i just haven't been getting enough sleep."
"well, your next shift isn't till oh seven hundred. why don't you do yourself a favour and turn in early."
yeah. good idea.
one more thing. i'd appreciate it if you'd shave and change back into your uniform. we do have protocols.
"yes, sir."
we'll get your alice flying. just give it some time.
"sorry, alice, we'll have to put the test flight on hold. all we need is a few lousy spare parts, but to listen to chakotay you'd think voyager would grind to a halt without them."
but we're so close.
"well, he gave me a direct order."
since when do you care so much about orders?
i'm already an ensign. you want to see me busted down to cadet?
don't take that off.
"well, i'm afraid i have to get back into uniform. protocol."
"forget about protocol. once my repairs are complete, we can go somewhere together."
leave voyager?
it's been a long time since i met a pilot i've been compatible with. we can go anywhere you want.
"it's very tempting, alice, but i can't just take off."
what's holding you back?
"my job, for one thing. my friends.b'elanna."
she doesn't understand you the way i do. none of them do.
"look, maybe we can make the test flight in a few weeks. and if it goes well, i'm sure the captain will assign us on missions together. but i can't leave voyager."
all right. i'm sure you know what's best for us.
"yeah, i think i do."
you look a little tired. how about some rest?
"sit back, relax. let me help you with this."
what are these?
just some modifications i made to your flight suit. they'll help us work together more closely. i'll show you. activate the interface. just for a minute. you won't regret it. what do you say we continue with those repairs?
how's it coming?
"this is the last power cell, then we'll just need the data module from section beta twelve."
what's wrong?
"oh, these relays are just tricky, that's all."
you're not being honest with me. i thought we agreed to tell each other everything.
"well, it's just, we're compromising vital systems."
backup systems.
"if there's an emergency, voyager's going to need them."
"if your friends had been more understanding, we wouldn't have to be sneaking around like this."
i've spent the last six years with these people. they're like my family.
"sometimes you have to leave your family behind. they're not like us. they're trapped by rules and regulations. velocity, freedom. they'll never understand these things the way we do."
"yeah, maybe you're right."
"of course i am. you don't belong here. you belong with me. you're thinking about your first flight, aren't you? tell me."
"dad took me up in an old s class shuttle. two seats, no warp drive, manual helm controls. i was eight years old and i was scared out of my wits."
you couldn't keep the ship level.
"no, not at first. but then came this moment of clarity, when suddenly everything made sense."
the clouds parted.
"i was flying. no matter how many starships i've piloted since then, i'm still chasing that feeling."
"tomorrow you'll catch it. only this time there won't be any clumsy controls to get in the way. just you, me, and the stars."
hey.
i wasn't aware you were assigned to astrometrics.
i was just passing by. i guess curiosity got the best of me.
are you planning an away mission? you were charting a course.
"oh, that. no, i was just taking a peek at what's ahead of us. all yours."
you've modified your garment.
"adapted, actually. i made a few tweaks to enhance alice's neurogenic interface. you know, the merging of man and machine."
perhaps you should learn more about this interface before you attempt to use it.
convince her it's safe.
i ran diagnostics of every system on board that ship. there's nothing to worry about.
perhaps i should examine it.
make an excuse and leave.
"it's nice of you to offer, but it's really not necessary. i have to get back to work."
"power fluctuation's down to four point seven percent. looks like abaddon's regulators might work out after all,"
keep at it. the last thing we need is a temperamental power supply.
bad day at the office?
"bad night with tom paris. you're his best friend, right?"
so he tells me.
"so maybe you can explain why every time he finds a new hobby, i go right out the airlock."
"i wouldn't take it personally. the ferengi call it the five stages of acquisition. infatuation, justification, appropriation, obsession, and resale. seems like you only got one stage left before he loses interest in that ship and he's all yours again."
until the next infatuation. we've got a point zero zero three drop in the warp field output.
that's within parameters.
not on my watch. somebody's removed four power cells from the secondary warp assembly without authorisation.
whoever it was tried to cover his tracks by rerouting power from adjacent cells. should we tell tuvok?
don't bother. this is an open and shut case.
tom paris!
"well alice, looks like you've been borrowing my things without permission."
"hey! computer, open the hatch."
unable to comply. warning. life support failure.
torres to the bridge. torres to chakotay. anybody!
"b'elanna, what are you doing here?"
let me out of here!
what the hell happened in there?
your ship tried to kill me.
that's ridiculous.
"it sealed the hatch, vented the atmosphere."
you must have accidentally tripped environmental controls.
don't you try to tell me this was an accident.
what else could it have been?
how about pilot error?
are you saying that this was my fault?
"what's gotten into you? you've been stealing components, tom. i found the power cells."
a few spare parts. you're overreacting.
am i?
where are you going?
to talk to the captain.
wait.
there's something wrong with you.
listen to me!
are you out of your mind?
"stay out of this, b'elanna!"
or what? you'll sic alice on me again?
let her go.
what were you thinking? you could have killed her!
she broke into my database. she was going to discover our flight plan. not that it matters now.
what is that supposed to mean?
keep your voice down. once your girlfriend talks to the captain they'll drag you straight to sickbay. one neural scan and they'll know all about us.
"well, maybe it's time they did."
think you can just walk away?
watch me.
"so, i guess this is the real tom paris. life throws up a few roadblocks and he heads for the nearest exit."
get away from me.
i need you.
you should have thought of that before you tried to kill b'elanna.
sickbay.
remember how you felt when you first saw me? you knew we were meant to be together.
i was wrong.
"think of how it feels when you're sitting at the helm, and the interface is active."
"it's over, alice. one way or the other, i'm getting the hell away from you."
i'm sorry you feel that way.
argh! what are you doing to me?
convincing you to do the right thing. take us the shuttlebay. we're leaving voyager.
no! argh!
"please, tom. i don't want to hurt you. the shuttlebay, now."
deck ten. shuttlebay.
this isn't the first time you and tom have had an argument about how he spends his free time.
"this wasn't a lovers' quarrel. captain, he practically assaulted me."
"well, that doesn't sound like tom."
it wasn't tom. it was alice.
now you've lost me.
"that's the name that he's calling this new ship. ever since he started working on it, he hasn't slept, he's become irritable, irrational. it's not just me. chakotay and harry have noticed the same thing."
this new ship. it has some kind of neurogenic interface.
exactly. it must be having some kind of an effect on him.
"all right, i'll have the doctor take a look at him. but in the meantime, i want you"
"captain, we have an unauthorised launch in progress."
seal the shuttlebay doors.
"too late, he's out."
his shields are up. i can't get a transporter lock.
tractor beam.
they're trying to tractor us.
stop them.
i can't.
you'll be able to manoeuvre much better if you complete the interface.
how?
activate the connector sequence.
"we're one now, tom. think of what you want me to do, and i'll do it."
we can disrupt their tractor beam with an optronic pulse.
good. you have access to our weapons. use them.
he's charging weapons.
full power to the shields.
he's disrupting our tractor beam.
increase power to the emitters. we'll drag him in by his heels if we have to.
"he's broken free, captain."
janeway to paris. stand down and return to voyager immediately.
"i'm with alice now, captain. let us go."
"you know i can't do that, tom."
"she'll do anything to get you back. i don't blame her for that, but we have to stop her."
how?
you know.
he's coming about.
he's charging weapons again. direct hit.
return fire.
he's gone to warp.
track him.
he masked his warp signature. he's gone.
and daedalus fashioned wings from wax and feathers and used them to escape his prison.
that's one of my favourite myths.
i know.
but you left out the part where icarus flew too close to the sun and his wings melted.
"poetic license. besides, if we get too close to a star we have multiphasic shielding to protect us. what is it?"
my arms. they feel numb.
who need arms when you have wings? you're becoming a part of me now. our potential is unlimited. forget the old tom paris. he doesn't exist anymore.
you know my policy.
"we're not looking for a refund, just some information."
that's one commodity i don't keep in stock. i suggest you look elsewhere.
not until we get some answers.
you'll find i'm prepared to deal with disgruntled customers.
"captain, i'm reading active weapons signatures on three of the derelict ships. they are targeting voyager."
"before we take actions we both might regret, mister neelix has something to show you."
i wanted to say thank you for this lost treasure.
a beryllium crystal.
"i'm surprised a trader of your distinction would let this slip through his fingers. i could say all trades are final, but we'd be willing to give it back in exchange for some cooperation."
haunted?
that's what the haarkonian told me when he traded her. i blamed his wild stories on isolation sickness and then took the ship off his hands.
did you ever notice anything odd about the ship?
"odd? you could say that. i tried turning her into a towing vessel. she was cooperative at first but then she began to require constant, oh."
i hope you haven't forgotten me.
mister abaddon?
where was i?
constant repairs.
"right. please, i wasn't going to tell them anything."
who were you speaking to?
"no one. i, i, i have to leave now. i'll return the items you traded for the ship. leave me alone. i did what you told me. i found you a pilot."
what is it? what are you seeing?
it's her. she's right in front of me.
there's no one there.
transport me back now. argh!
janeway to sickbay. medical emergency.
"he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. fortunately, i was able to repair the damage in time."
what caused it?
it appears his neural pathways were recently restructured. i detected a neurogenic signature.
"looks like alice got to him, too. wake him."
she was here.
the woman you saw was an hallucination created by the derelict ship's neurogenic interface. i've given you a cortical suppressant. she won't be bothering you anymore.
tell me. what does this ship want with our crewman?
"she can't fly herself, she needs a pilot. a biological entity to work in tandem with her programming."
"well, if all she needed was a pilot, why didn't she just recruit you?"
"i wasn't compatible. she said my reflexes were too slow, that i was as useless as the junk that i traded, and i couldn't get her to where she needed to go. don't ask me for the coordinates. she never told me. just insisted that i get her a real pilot. i'm sorry i didn't warn you before. i couldn't resist her."
seven of nine to captain janeway. please report to astrometrics.
i've managed to reconstruct the data ensign paris was working on. my suspicion was correct. it is a course trajectory.
let's see it.
it terminates in spatial grid eight six seven.
looks uninhabited.
"it's empty space, with the exception of a small anomaly."
a particle fountain. the federation lost more than a dozen ships examining a similar phenomenon in the alpha quadrant. relay the coordinates to the bridge.
take us out of warp. can you see it now?
yes. what is it?
home.
distance?
six million kilometres.
decrease speed to one quarter impulse. full power to shields.
i'm detecting a vessel off our starboard bow.
it's tom. he's headed right for the anomaly.
can you get a transporter lock?
"no, ma'am, not with those multiphasic shields in place."
are we in hailing range?
opening a channel. he's responding.
"keep your distance, captain, or we'll open fire."
"tom, listen to me. the neurogenic interface is affecting your judgment. drop your shields"
and let us beam you aboard.
ignore them. keep going.
he's not responding.
target his propulsion systems and fire.
direct hit. the vessel's shields are holding.
doctor to the bridge.
cease fire. ensign paris' neural readings are fluctuating. his synaptic functions have become linked to the ship. if we keep firing we could injure him. severely.
acknowledged.
"tuvok, stand down."
we've got ten minutes until he reaches the particle fountain.
is there any way to disable their shields without firing weapons?
if i could access their main computer and transmit a shutdown sequence.
"problem is, tom and alice would detect it. they'd compensate."
unless we find a way to distract them. bridge to the doctor.
go ahead.
any progress on your analysis of the neurogenic interface?
"not yet, captain."
would it be possible to tap into the interface using a comm. signal?
"i believe so, but i don't know what that would accomplish."
you've got five minutes. do it.
and tell b'elanna to prepare for an away mission.
captain?
we're four minutes away.
bridge to sickbay.
status?
"stand by, captain. i'm making the final adjustments."
i'm not sure how i feel about getting inside tom's head.
maybe you'll be able to explain a few things when you get back.
i knew you were the one. no one's ever got me this close before.
i'll have you home in just a few minutes.
i promise you won't be disappointed.
don't believe her.
where's alice?
there is no alice. she's a pile of circuits in the ship's computer core. you're letting a programme delude you.
doctor to bridge. she's in.
now.
accessing their main computer.
you don't understand. this is what i've always dreamed of.
"you're still dreaming, and when you wake up you're in for a big surprise."
alice needs me.
so do i.
"nice sentiment, but it's a lie. your family will do anything to keep us apart. don't listen to them."
"tom, it's me. b'elanna. alice is an illusion."
"i'm giving you what you always wanted, something they can never do. does that sound like an illusion?"
"i can't think. leave me alone, both of you."
they've accessed our systems. they're trying to disable my shields. stop them.
focus on me. listen to me.
my shields are failing. do something.
it's time to come home.
tom.
no!
hang on. we're going to get you out of here.
tom!
no!
"i've got it, captain. their shields are down."
beam him to sickbay.
there's too much interference from the particle fountain.
i'm boosting the confinement beam. try it now.
we've got him.
alice is losing helm control.
resume course to the alpha quadrant.
you'll need a few days to fully recover. think you can manage to stay off your feet for that long?
"if he doesn't, i'll break his legs."
"well then, i'll leave you to b'elanna's tender mercies."
"i've got something for you. it's a get well card from naomi wildman. it's a pretty good likeness of you, but i don't think she quite captured my eyes."
i'm sorry. for everything.
it wasn't your fault.
"but i remember all of it. everything i said, everything i did. it was like i was sleepwalking."
"the important thing is, you woke up."
yeah. thanks for being my alarm clock.
any time.
"from now on, i promise no more affairs with strange ships."
what about the delta flyer?
we're just friends.
mister neelix.
"sorry. how about a game of species, starship or anomaly?"
surely you could find something more productive to occupy your time.
"come on, tuvok, it'll be fun. you think of something, species, anomaly, or starship, and i have fifteen questions to guess what it is. come on, come on, come on, come on."
i would prefer some peace and quiet.
how about a riddle?
mister neelix.
"come on, it'll be fun."
i have no desire for fun.
"okay, forget fun. a good riddle can stimulate the mind. now, no self-respecting vulcan could say no to that."
very well. one riddle.
"okay, here goes. a lone ensign finds himself stranded on a class l planetoid with no rations. his only possession, a calendar. when starfleet finds him twelve months later, he's in perfect health. why didn't he starve to death?"
"it is a theoretical possibility that such planetoids contain hot water springs, which could sustain the man for several weeks."
but not for a whole year.
i concur. logic dictates that the ensign in question would perish.
"ah ha, ha ha! i stumped you. as a matter of fact, he not only survived, but his belly was full. why? because he feasted on dates from the calendar."
"your answer is merely wordplay, it has no basis in reality. now, if you'll excuse me."
where are you going?
to find some peace and quiet.
have fun.
tuvok to neelix.
"miss me already, commander?"
did you activate the aft tactical station?
no.
why?
there appears to be a download in progress.
that's odd.
i'm detecting
anomalous readings.
what sort of readings?
i'm not certain. but i believe it's a cloaking frequency that
argh!
commander?
"tuvok! delta flyer to voyager. mayday! tuvok, what happened?"
report.
he's in neuraleptic shock. i'll need another twenty milligrams of synaptizine.
i'll get it.
it's not working. i'll need to try direct cortical stimulation. initiate a neurostatic pulse on my mark.
right.
now. again.
"his vital signs have stabilised, for the moment anyway, but he suffered severe neurological trauma."
do you know what caused it?
some kind of alien weapon.
"by the time i reached tuvok, whoever had attacked him was gone."
what about the surrounding space? any indication of cloaked vessels?
"between trying to tend to the commander and piloting the flyer, i had my hands full. i, i didn't think to scan for cloaked ships. i'm sorry."
"you saved tuvok's life, neelix. you have nothing to be sorry about. how do you plan to treat him?"
"i won't know until i've run a series of neurological scans, but it would certainly help to know something about the weapon."
"neelix, these kesat you were negotiating with. any reason to believe they might know something about this?"
it couldn't hurt to ask.
time to reopen diplomatic channels.
"deputy investigator naroq, kesat security. captain janeway, commander chakotay, ambassador neelix."
you've done your homework.
i familiarised myself with the facts on the way here.
we're hoping you can help us shed some light on what happened to our crewman.
"i believe i can. based on the information you provided, it is my opinion that he was a victim of the ba'neth."
i've never heard of them.
"i'm not surprised. in my language, their name means shadow people. they're a species obsessed with concealing their identity. extremely paranoid and xenophobic."
"well, that explains their cloaking technology."
it's my belief they've been responsible for several unexplained attacks similar to this one.
why wasn't i warned about them during my negotiations with your government?
because my government's official position is that the ba'neth do not exist. most people think they're a myth.
there's nothing mythical about what happened to mister tuvok. why is your government so sceptical?
"because there've been so few encounters with the ba'neth and, well, no one's ever actually seen one."
"how many encounters are we talking about, exactly?"
before this incident? twelve.
i guess we're lucky thirteen.
you're lucky i gave my supervisor two bottles of kesatian ale to get this assignment. any other inspector would have simply attributed commander tuvok's injuries to unexplained phenomenon.
"no offence, mister naroq, but what makes you so sure the ba'neth aren't just a myth?"
"this incident fits the pattern, captain. all of the alleged encounters have occurred aboard vessels foreign to this sector. i believe they've been attempts by the ba'neth to assess the technology of new arrivals."
they were trying to download tactical data.
and commander tuvok suffered severe neural damage. that's also consistent with previous attacks. the ba'neth were making sure he would not tell anyone what he saw.
maybe that's why tuvok's tricorder was destroyed. they didn't want us to see the cloaking frequency he'd found.
he found a cloaking frequency?
apparently.
"captain, i don't blame you for finding my theories a bit eccentric. i'm used to it. it's why i'm still a deputy investigator, but i've brought equipment to help your investigation. let me examine commander tuvok and run scans on the vessel where he was attacked. i may finally be able to prove my theories."
"with all due respect, we're more interested in saving tuvok's life."
"if we work together, maybe we can do both."
"his cognitive, memory and logic centres have all been severely damaged."
"but he still has brain activity, which is more than i can say for any of the previous victims."
vulcan neural tissue is extremely resilient. i have no doubt that a brain from a lesser species would not have survived.
"if you could only tell us what you saw, mister tuvok."
i don't think we'll be hearing from him any time soon.
keep working. i'll let you know if we find anything that might help. i'll take you to see where the attack occurred.
"something i can do for you, mister neelix?"
i want to help.
"unless you have a degree in vulcan neurobiology that i'm not aware of, there's nothing you can do."
there must be something.
my advice is to return to your quarters and get some rest.
there's no way that i'm going to be able to sleep knowing that tuvok is lying here like this.
"there have been rare cases in which comatose patients responded to external stimuli. aromas, touch, voices."
"so, you're saying that if i stay here and, and try to talk to tuvok, i might be able to provoke some sort of response?"
"if anyone can provoke tuvok, mister neelix, it's you."
"good morning, tuvok. i brought you a few more items from your quarters to help liven up sickbay. your kal-toh game, in case you decide you're ready for a match. oh, and i also thought that you might enjoy a recitation of that classic proto-vulcan drama, clash on the fire plains. i'll be performing all twenty three parts myself. i also brought you some flowers from the airponics bay. oh, that's fragrant, isn't it? perhaps you'd enjoy some vulcan incense. how about some music? computer, access vulcan audio file, selection fifty six alpha."
mister neelix. what is that dreadful noise?
"the chants of the monks of t'panit. personally, i think it's dreadful, too, but it's one of tuvok's favourites."
"i appreciate your efforts, mister neelix, but i'm trying to analyse his latest neurological scans and this music is very distracting."
you said i was supposed to stimulate his senses.
"i said stimulate them, mister neelix, not annihilate them."
"computer, pause music."
thank you.
doctor? tuvok. you've had an accident. you're in sickbay.
"relax, commander, i only want to scan you."
"don't worry, tuvok, he's only trying to help you. it's only a tricorder. see? it won't hurt you."
now try it.
"well done, mister neelix."
commander chakotay says you've found something.
"that, captain, is an understatement. listen."
what is it?
the sound of history being made.
"less poetry, mister naroq, more facts."
the sound you're hearing indicates the presence of veridium isotopes.
residual particles from the ba'neth's cloaking field.
you've detected these isotopes before?
"yes, but only after they've decayed. you see, veridium has a very brief half-life, less than seventy hours. the previous sites i've studied have been months, sometimes years old."
but these isotopes are still active.
we can use mister naroq's photolytic converter to illuminate them.
"so you see, captain, why this is an historic moment? we may finally learn what the ba'neth look like."
"well, let's see what we've got."
you don't know how long i've waited to meet you.
so the ba'neth aren't a myth after all.
this is the clearest image ever captured.
perhaps. i believe i can adjust our internal sensors to improve it.
what are you doing? you might disrupt the image entirely. tentacles. i always suspected they were multipeds!
doctor to the captain. please report to sickbay.
"i'm on my way. seven, if we can integrate mister naroq's photolytic technology into the deflector array, we might be able to decloak a ba'neth ship."
the technology only works at close range. we have to find the ship before we can expose it. we still need that cloaking frequency.
one step at a time.
"the vulcan brain. a puzzle wrapped inside an enigma housed inside a cranium. tuvok's neural pathways have begun to bypass the damaged tissue. they're forming new synaptic connections. in effect, his brain is rewiring itself. whether this is due to my neurostatic therapy, or neelix's rehabilitation regimen, or some combination of the two i can't be certain."
is there any chance he'll make a full recovery?
"it's much too soon to say, but he's alert and he's already regained his basic motor skills."
but still no speech.
"it's only a matter of time, captain. look how far he's come already."
"i hope you're right, neelix, but if he could talk he might be able to tell us something about that cloaking frequency."
"we're not sure how much he recalls. for that matter, we're not certain he recognises any of us, or even knows who he is."
"i'm going to take him on a tour of the ship. the doctor thinks that familiar sights and sounds might get the old synaptic juices flowing. don't worry, captain. tuvok will be back to his old self before you can say live long and prosper."
i've brought a visitor.
good to see you up and around.
you remember commander chakotay.
we were just running a shield diagnostic. would you like to take a look?
"this is tactical station, where you work."
just keeping it warm for you. hope you don't mind. that's the shield array. this controls the tractor emitters.
i think he remembers it.
"whoa, whoa, whoa! he just activated the photon torpedo banks."
"that's all right, tuvok. everybody makes mistakes. we'll be back later."
"last, but not least, your quarters. you spend a lot of time here. reading, meditating. mister paris once referred to it as the vulcan vault. ah. look around, explore."
astrometrics to the bridge. mister naroq and i have completed our deflector modifications. we're ready to test the array.
"stand by. reduce speed to one quarter impulse. harry, full power to the deflector array."
aye.
"all right, seven, do it."
activating the deflector.
i'd call that a pretty successful test.
they've been watching us all along.
hail them.
which one? there's practically a fleet out there.
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we intend you no harm.
they're charging weapons.
shields.
"they're scrambling, captain, in all directions."
follow the lead vessel.
"it's okay, tuvok. i'm here with you. everything is going to be all right. you're safe with me."
still no response to our hails.
"i hate to ruin a good chase, but the ba'neth ship is moving out of the deflector's range."
"seven, can you get"
their cloaking frequency?
they're blocking our scans.
we've lost them.
"they're gone now, tuvok. i told you you'd be safe."
"yes, you did."
"tuvok? what? tell me, what did i do?"
you told me i wouldn't be hurt.
do you know who i am?
you're neelix. i'm safe with you.
we need tuvok to tell us anything he can remember about the attack.
"captain, he may be talking again, but that doesn't mean he's ready to be interrogated. he's beginning to experience emotions, volatile ones. during this last encounter with the ba'neth, he was terrified."
"we'll tread lightly, i promise."
"all right, tuvok, you can come in now."
it's nice to see you.
captain janeway.
"that's right. this is mister naroq. please sit down. two days ago, you were aboard a shuttle with mister neelix. you detected a cloaked intruder."
he attacked you.
yes. that's why i'm having difficulty now.
"yes, and in order to help you, we have to find the people who hurt you."
"before the intruder injured you, you managed to scan him with this. you recorded his cloaking frequency, but the tricorder was damaged and the information was lost. can you tell us anything about that frequency?"
try to remember.
i was scanning.
that's right. what did you see?
"i, i don't remember."
try!
"all right, that's enough. we're done for now."
"but, captain."
join seven of nine in astrometrics. see if she's made any progress with the ba'neth.
"well, er, we should be going, too. a few of the crew have offered to help with tuvok's rehabilitation."
"i thought we might have lunch later, just the two of us."
i prefer to stay with neelix.
"oh, tuvok. i'm, i'm sure that you would"
it's all right. you two go ahead. i have a lot of work to do anyway.
"the object of the game is to turn this jumble of rods into a perfect sphere. we take turns positioning our pieces. whoever gets the shape to appear first, wins."
i like the way it looks now.
what do you say we give it a try?
"this has always been one of your favourite games, tuvok. it helps keep your logic sharp."
i'll go first. now you.
go ahead.
i don't like this game.
"when you first taught me how to play, i wasn't very good either. but you kept encouraging me, and pretty soon i scored my first kal-toh. it just takes practice, that's all."
try again. you can do it.
i don't like this game!
the doctor helped me access my personnel file.
nice picture. you should see mine. it's awful.
"i was an instructor at starfleet academy. i've received seventeen commendations for valour. i'm a husband, a father."
"you're an extraordinary fellow, tuvok."
i was an extraordinary fellow.
you're still the same person.
then why do i no longer work on the bridge?
we talked about that. you had an accident.
and now i'm not smart enough.
"tuvok, you've just got to be patient. look how much progress you've made already."
he could dismantle a photonic warhead in less than thirty seconds. i can't even play kal-toh.
"it's going to take time, but you'll relearn all those things."
how do you know that?
"well, because the doctor"
"the doctor? the doctor doesn't know how to make me better, does he?"
"well, not yet, but"
i'll never be him again.
you don't know that. the vulcan mind.
i'm not a vulcan. not any more!
what's going on?
"it's okay doctor, i can handle this. please, tuvok, try to relax. everything's going to be fine."
no! nothing's fine! get away from me!
"you'd better go. now, mister neelix. i'll take it from here."
"oh, sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt."
you didn't.
"yes, i did. you were pondering. something difficult, by the looks of it. anything i can help you with?"
unlikely.
try me.
how do you find something that's invisible?
the ba'neth.
"we have the ability to illuminate them. but to do so we must first locate them, which we cannot accomplish without their cloaking frequency."
that's quite a riddle.
one that we might be able to solve if commander tuvok could tell us what he saw. how is his rehabilitation progressing?
"oh, i thought it was going great, but now? let's just say that i've got a riddle of my own."
try me.
all right. when is a vulcan no longer a vulcan?
when his genetic code is sufficiently altered.
"no, i was speaking metaphorically."
"in that case, a person is no longer vulcan when he has lost his logic."
right. and how does he get it back?
he must be taught.
exactly. but what if he's brain-damaged and emotionally unstable? how does he learn?
it may be impossible for him to learn what you're trying to teach.
"well, thanks for the pep talk."
i was merely suggesting that you adapt to the circumstances.
what circumstances? are you saying that the tuvok i know is gone? that i should stop trying to help him?
"when i was separated from the collective i, too, was damaged. i was no longer connected to the hive mind. i lost many abilities that i had acquired as a drone, but i adapted."
because captain janeway didn't give up on you. she kept trying to help you.
but not by restoring me to what i'd been. by helping me discover what i could become.
what are you making?
a flower. it's for you.
thank you. i'm not sure i deserve a gift.
i shouldn't have shouted at you. i was angry. i'm sorry.
you were frustrated. i don't blame you. i'm the one who should be apologising.
why?
because i was pushing you too hard. i was trying to mould you into something you weren't.
you were disappointed in me because i can't do anything as well as i did before.
maybe there are things that you can do better.
what can i do better?
"well,this, for example. you would've considered it an illogical use of your time."
it's not good.
"no, it's wonderful. it's creative. it's a symbol of friendship. before your accident, you never would have considered that my feelings might have been hurt. you would have certainly never have made me a gift."
we weren't friends?
"ah, we were colleagues, and i certainly felt affection for you."
but i didn't return those feelings.
you tolerated me.
i don't understand.
"you said things like 'mister neelix, please contain your exuberance.' and, 'mister neelix i have no desire for fun.' and you never smiled. you've got a much better sense of humour now."
i like to smile.
"me, too."
"i don't want to play kal-toh any more. or meditate, or work on logic problems."
you don't have to.
what can we do instead?
whatever you want.
teach me things that you like to do.
here we are. a triple-chocolate wikki fruit sundae with warm fetran sauce.
fetran sauce on a sundae?
wait till you taste it.
you really made this?
"as neelix says, dig in."
"mmm, this is great."
this is fantastic.
"what did i tell you? tuvok has a flair for food. all morning, he's been creating new recipes using combinations of ingredients that i never would have imagined. for example. a terra nut soufflé, jibalian fudge cake with peppermint coulis, sweet leola root tart. mmm."
only desserts? how come?
they taste good.
"hey, you better watch out, neelix. tuvok may put you out of a job."
from your mouth to the captain's ears.
she must have heard me.
what's all this?
we're having fun.
it turns out tuvok is quite the pastry chef.
"would you like some terra nut soufflé, captain?"
"i'd love some. thank you. oh, that is delicious."
i am pleased that you like it.
what are you making now?
pistachio cake with parra-cream sauce.
"oh, parra-cream's my favourite."
then you'll have the first piece.
"tuvok, have you remembered anything more about what happened on the flyer?"
i detected a cloaking frequency.
"yes, that's right. can you describe it?"
"i don't know, i"
did it have a symmetric modulation? was the amplitude constant?
i don't understand.
"it's all right. i don't mean to push you, tuvok but maybe if we could"
"it's difficult for him, captain. maybe you can try again tomorrow."
this. this is what i saw.
what is it?
a cloaking frequency.
"here we go, captain. a nine million terrawatt cloaking field in grid two one six."
"nine million terrawatts? whatever they're hiding, it's huge."
"alter course, mister paris."
"yes, ma'am."
bridge to astrometrics. status.
"the deflector array is ready, captain."
raise shields.
"aye, captain."
we're within range.
"all right, seven. light them up."
"it's an armed outpost.approximately three thousand life signs, twenty two ships."
hail them.
"no response, captain."
they're charging weapons.
"open a channel, all subspace bands."
they're firing.
"cease fire immediately, or i'll transmit the coordinates of this outpost to the kesat homeworld."
that got their attention.
"several days ago, a member of your species attacked one of my crewmen. he was badly injured. in order to treat him, i need to know more about the weapon that was used."
they're responding. audio only.
we do not share technology.
but you take it from others. the attacker was downloading our tactical database when the incident occurred.
we must assess potential threats.
"paranoid, just as i predicted."
"in exchange for information about your weapon, we'll provide you with tactical data on several species we've recently encountered. you can assess their potential threats all you want."
the kesat investigator aboard your vessel cannot be trusted.
you know about me?
you have been attempting to expose us for years. you are a threat. you must be stopped.
they're charging weapons again.
"wait. it was my photolytic converter that allowed voyager to decloak you. if you give captain janeway what she wants, i'll give you the converter. you can use it to adapt your technology so ours can no longer expose you."
i doubt you'll get as enticing an offer from the kesat homeworld. it would be a shame if you forced me to hail them.
we have an agreement.
enter.
what are you listening to?
"a selection from tom's jazz database. it really swings. computer, pause the music. i've been reviewing the holodeck files. i wish to visit the risa water recreation park. will you accompany me?"
maybe after your doctor's appointment.
appointment?
"the doctor's analysed the ba'neth weapon, and he's devised a procedure to treat you. you should be proud of yourself. if you hadn't drawn that picture on the cake, we may never have found a treatment."
i wish i never drew that picture.
why?
because i don't wish to undergo the procedure.
"you're having pre-operative jitters, that's all. don't worry, everyone gets them. just think about it. in a few hours, you'll be yourself again."
i am myself.
"but you'll be able to do all the things that you used to do. work on the bridge, advise the captain."
"i want to be able to have fun. with you. i won't be able to, will i?"
"well, you won't call it fun. you'll call it deriving satisfaction. but it's basically the same thing. you'll still experience emotions."
but i won't express them.
probably not.
then how will you know how much i enjoy being with you?
you've just told me.
we'll still be friends?
of course.
even if i merely tolerate you?
i'd be lying if i told you that things between us will stay the same.
"well, why? why do you want me to go back to the way i was?"
because this crew needs its tactical officer on the bridge. and i wouldn't be a very good friend if i ignored that just so that you'd be nicer to me.
mister tuvok. i was beginning to think you weren't coming.
i was experiencing pre-operative jitters. neelix helped me overcome them.
"glad to hear it. now please, lie down."
i'll see you after the procedure?
of course.
i'm going to miss him.
"me, too."
"hello, commander."
mister neelix.
it's good to see you up and about. are you feeling better?
the doctor has approved my return to duty.
that's wonderful news. how about a celebratory glass of champagne?
tea will suffice.
of course. i'm preparing a special dinner tonight in honour of your recovery. i don't suppose that you'd be interested in preparing one of your famous desserts?
i have much more important things to do than engage in the preparation of nutritionally deficient foods.
maybe another time.
sundaes.
i beg your pardon?
i have given further consideration to your riddle regarding the ensign who survived by consuming the dates from his calendar. it occurs to me that he could also have eaten the sundaes.
"that's a very clever answer, mister vulcan, but it's not very logical, is it?"
"no, it's not."
gedrin! gedrin! what happened? i lost you.
thirty seven bio-pods were damaged. i had to disconnect them from the reactor.
were they dead?
i had no choice. the main power's holding. the rest of the bio-pods are secure. that leaves us. don't look so worried. it'll be like a simple night's sleep. we're out of time.
do you think we'll dream?
i don't know. we'll get through this.
what if there's nothing left?
we'll start again. five years.
report.
we've entered some kind of a subspace corridor.
"we were cruising at warp six then, wham, this thing pulled at our warp field like a magnet."
where did that debris come from?
"unknown, but the corridor is filled with it. metal fragments, plasma exhaust, organic residue."
"some of the debris is over eight hundred years old, captain."
i'd like to avoid becoming part of this garbage stream. can you find a way out?
i don't now. there's hundreds of corridors. it's like a maze.
"well, be a good rat and find us the cheese, hmm?"
"i'll do my best, captain."
tuvok?
"it was a vessel, sir. they are hailing us."
put it through.
who are you?
i'm captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager. and you are?
this underspace belongs to us.
we're here by accident. we're trying to find a way out. can you help us?
"help you? yes, we'll help you."
they are targeting our shields with a resonance pulse. it's altering the harmonics. we're being pushed out of the corridor.
we're clear.
the vessel has exited the corridor as well.
"captain, we're over two hundred light years from where we entered the corridor."
two hundred light years in five minutes?
hail them. thank you for your help. there's something i'd like to ask you. we've got a long journey ahead of us and i was wondering if we could negotiate passage through this underspace of yours.
lower your shields. prepare to be boarded.
boarded? for what reason?
we must purge your computer. remove all readings you've gathered in our territory.
we pose no threat to you. we're simply trying
"we're going to destroy that information, one way or another. lower your shields."
i won't do that.
evasive manoeuvres. try to disable them.
their vessel is highly manoeuvrable. it's difficult to get a phaser lock.
picking up two more ships heading our way .
direct hit. our warp drive is offline.
shields down to eighty two percent. sixty percent.
they're closing.
we could use some clever suggestions about now.
"there's a planet eight million kilometres ahead, uninhabited. but the atmosphere is charged with radiogenic particles."
how radiogenic?
three thousand isorems.
"if we route enough power to the shields we can survive in that, but maybe our friends can't."
shields at fifty three percent.
do it.
entering the thermosphere.
radiation levels at three thousand isorems and climbing.
the alien ships?
in pursuit and charging weapons.
increase our descent vector.
they're still closing.
direct hit to our aft shields.
"find the highest concentration of radiation, and take us through it."
proximity radiation at four thousand isorems. five thousand. six.
their shields are weakening. they're breaking off.
"now, all we need is a place to set down and make repairs. tom?"
we're clearing the lower stratosphere.
on screen.
i thought you said this planet was uninhabited.
radiation must have interfered with my scans.
i doubt it's inhabited anymore. looks like this planet's in the middle of a nuclear winter.
agreed. gamma radiation levels are highly toxic. the impact crater suggests an orbital bombardment.
how long ago?
"from the rate of radiogenic decay, eight hundredninety two years."
this must have been a city of millions. set us down.
disengaging engines.
"stand down red alert. assign damage repair teams, and tom, make sure b'elanna has enough help in engineering. i want those warp engines back online."
"yes, ma'am."
our friends are still in orbit.
circling like vultures.
"well, they're going to go hungry."
not if they find a way to adapt their shields and come down after us.
"captain, i'm detecting faint life signs coming from a chamber several hundred metres beneath the surface."
survivors?
after nine hundred years?
oversee the repair teams.
you're going down there?
"if somebody survived this catastrophe they might need our help. get a good fix on those coordinates. i don't want to beam into solid rock. seven, tuvok, you're with me."
these walls have been reinforced with tritonium. they built this place to last.
most of the power relays are still active.
not bad after nine centuries.
the main reactor is drawing energy from the planet's geothermal core. efficient.
some kind of stasis pod.
this display indicates that there are more chambers behind these walls. some of them have failed.
it's amazing they survived at all. let's see what else we can find.
"seven, what are you doing?"
i've activated the reanimation sequence. he may be able to provide us with answers.
we don't know anything about this species. they could be hostile.
most humanoid cultures are.
remind me to reacquaint you with away mission protocols.
who
it's all right. we're not your enemy. we're from a starship. we discovered this chamber and revived you.
how long was i
in stasis? close to nine hundred years.
"nine hundred? jisa. help her, please."
"no, jisa. she was my wife."
i won't hurt you.
"i was drifting in and out of consciousness when they brought me here, but i thought i saw you appear out of thin air."
i'm a computer programme. a hologram.
and the others?
"flesh and blood, like yourself."
you're the ones that took me out of stasis. i don't recognise your species.
human. our home planet is halfway across the galaxy.
and you've expanded your territory into this space?
our ship was brought here by accident. we're trying to get home.
you're borg.
how do you know that?
don't you recognise my people? the vaadwaur?
the collective's memory from nine hundred years ago is fragmentary.
i've had many encounters with your kind.
and lived to tell about them? impressive.
how did you find us?
we needed someplace to hide from the turei after they found us in one of their subspace corridors.
their corridors?
so they claimed.
"the corridors were ours. it took centuries to map them. we were the envy of a hundred species, including the turei."
are they responsible for what happened to your planet?
"the turei, and a dozen others. what one couldn't accomplish the others finally did. i would like to look at what's left of my world."
we made our final stand there.
"i've scanned the cavern. you've got a thousand more stasis pods down there, most of them still active. hundreds of ships, land vehicles, weapons."
"a single battalion, and their families. we had planned to come out of stasis after five years. we believed that by then, the alliance would have been at each other's throats."
you were going to rebuild?
"no, not here. we knew this planet would be poisoned for centuries. we were planning to go to another world, start a colony, hope to find new allies, learn from them."
your power core is still functioning. it was the controls that were damaged in the attack. that's why you never came out of stasis.
jisa and i lived there in the old quarter. we had a garden overlooking the street below. it's a shame she didn't show more courage at the end.
given the circumstances
that's no excuse.
"pardon me for saying this, but that seems a bit heartless."
"when it rains, do you run from doorway to doorway trying to stay dry, getting wet all the while. or do you just accept the fact that it's raining, and walk with dignity?"
rain's one thing. plasma bombs are something else.
but the principle is the same.
i'd bring an umbrella.
maybe it's not too late to meet a new ally and learn from her.
"i took the liberty of preparing a large assortment of delta quadrant dishes. hopefully, there's something here that you'll like."
you're talax-ilzay.
"talaxian, but you're right. my ancestors referred to themselves as talax-ilzay in the old tongue."
the old tongue was new when i met your race.
you travelled all the way to talaxia?
"and farther. our corridors took us to many worlds. i'm curious. have you heard of us, the vaadwaur?"
"oh, i'm afraid there aren't many records from that period, but vaadwaur is a word in the old tongue. it means foolish."
your ancestors were wise. only fools would let this happen to them.
chakotay to captain janeway.
go ahead.
looks like our friends in orbit have found us.
we're on our way.
report.
"six turei vessels are in orbit, all firing plasma charges."
that was two thousand metres to starboard.
looks like they can't get an exact fix on our position. the radiogenic atmosphere must be disrupting their targeting.
nine hundred metres.
they're getting closer.
we have the same problem. our torpedoes won't lock on.
direct hit. aft shields down to eighteen percent.
captain? can you transmit a signal through this atmosphere?
we've already tried talking to them.
i have no intention of speaking with the turei. we put a sentry satellite in orbit directly above the city. you could use its sensors to help guide your torpedoes.
it's there. intact and functional.
open a channel. i'll give you the activation code.
i'm a few centuries out of date.
you can enter the activation code here. it's processing our telemetry.
triangulate. fire.
direct hit. the lead ship has lost shields. its propulsion is down.
one more torpedo will finish them.
the other ships are retreating.
"captain, why don't you keep firing?"
we scared them off. that's enough for now.
but they'll come back with twice as many ships.
"with any luck, our warp drive will be back online by then."
"the turei may be cowards, but their technology has become much more advanced than ours. if you leave us, we will be slaughtered again."
what do you propose?
"help us off this planet, and we will show you subspace corridors known to nobody else. you will be free from the turei, and you will be a thousand light years closer to your home."
let's wake up your battalion.
dragon's teeth.
dragon's teeth?
"an old greek myth. after a dragon was killed in a war, its teeth were spread out over the battlefield. they took root and warriors sprung from the ground to continue the fighting."
voyager was pulled into the corridor two hundred light years from here.
pulled in?
there must have been a break along the radial wall.
"the corridors occur naturally, but they're very unstable. they're damaged by use."
obviously the turei don't have the wisdom to maintain them properly. they'll be very difficult to navigate after centuries of neglect.
we've only been able to chart a few of the corridors. can you provide us with a more complete map?
"we've never kept written records, for security reasons. of course, we've committed all the corridors to memory. every multifold, every spatial intersect."
"we'd be happy to plot a course for you but first, we'll need to get past the turei, how many vessels are in orbit?"
eleven.
"mister gaul, tuvok, start working on a tactical plan."
"if we do manage to escape, we'll need to locate a habitable world."
"seven, scan the astrometric database. see what you can find. someplace out of the way."
"morin, take charge of reviving the rest of our battalion."
many of our bio-pods have been damaged. i could use some assistance.
our chief engineer will be glad to give you a hand.
thank you.
"well, let's get started. we've got a civilisation to rebuild."
"no story tonight, naomi. i had to cook for two hundred people today."
"that's okay. i'm tired, too."
did you get a chance to meet any of the children?
i don't like them.
why not?
i just don't.
"well, that's not good enough. i'm the ship's ambassador, you're the captain's assistant. we have to make a good impression on our new friends."
they're not my friends.
"well, not yet. listen. first thing tomorrow, you and i will get together with a couple of the children."
no.
"naomi, what's wrong?"
nothing. i don't like them and i don't want to play with them.
that doesn't sound like you. tell me what happened.
they called you names.
names?
they said everybody from your planet was stupid. they said your ears were funny. they said just looking at you made them laugh. they said
"i, i, i get the idea. children can be a little cruel sometimes, but there's no need to take it personally. besides, my ears are kind of funny."
i don't want to play with them.
no. and you don't have to.
okay.
come on.
"goodnight. i'll tell you a story tomorrow, i promise."
i'm not happy with these fluctuations. we may be trying to reactivate too many ships at once.
i suggest we focus on the assault fighters. qual tel k'pok.
thanks. when did you learn klingon?
just a few phrases. i was studying your database. the klingons are a noble race.
they have their moments.
today is a good day to die.
pardon?
"kahless, your greatest warrior. that was his battle cry."
you seem to have taken an interest in klingon history.
"there are many parallels between our cultures. the vaadwaur have also learned to embrace death without fear. as children, we're taught to fall asleep each night imagining a different way to die."
i prefer curling up with a good book.
"computer, access my personal database."
access established.
"go into the talaxian linguistic files, old tongue dialect. find and define the word vaadwaur."
"vaadwaur. archaic adjective. primary meaning, foolish. additional meanings, weak-minded, reckless, blind."
what's the first known usage?
"first written example appears in eldaxon's collected folklore, second edition. year of publication, 5012, new calendar."
"computer, name the specific folktales that use the word vaadwaur."
the demon with the golden voice. the tale of the deadly stranger. the tale of the boy who lost his head. the tale of the bloody hand.
"not exactly mother goose. computer, transfer the text of those stories to my quarters."
transfer complete.
that star cluster in grid fourteen twenty one? nearly half the planets are inhabitable.
unfortunately they are already occupied. by the borg.
the borg? in my century they'd only assimilated a handful of systems. it looks like they've spread through the quadrant like a plague. no offence.
none taken.
we had a colony near the twin star in grid three one five.
that is part of the devore imperium now.
and who are they?
an authoritarian regime. they claim eleven systems across three sectors.
i don't suppose they'd be willing to negotiate for a continent or two.
the devore are intolerant of outsiders.
it doesn't matter. we have nothing to negotiate with. our technology is nine hundred years out of date.
your pessimism is irrelevant. we will find a home for you.
i hope you're right.
sixteen turei vessels are now in orbit. long range sensors indicate five more on the way.
"i can understand that they want the odds in their favour, but isn't that overkill?"
"they may have detected us. if they know their history, they'll come prepared."
nine hundred years is a long time to hold a grudge.
the turei would like nothing more than to find the rest of our subspace corridors. we can't allow that to happen.
"then i suggest we use the element of surprise. at oh six hundred, voyager will leave the surface and engage the turei ships in orbit. as we draw their fire, the more powerful vaadwaur vessels will attack from multiple vectors. the rest of the vaadwaur will break orbit from the opposite side of the planet and proceed to the subspace corridors. we'll rendezvous with them afterwards."
what if voyager is disabled? we'll be defenceless. if we armed my ships with your photon torpedoes
i can't authorise that.
why?
starfleet protocols are very strict about the transfer of weapons.
i'm not used to putting my life in someone else's hands.
there are a lot of things you're going to have to get used to. we've faced enemies worse than the turei. i'm confident we can handle them.
i need those weapons.
i'm sorry. the answer's no.
if you want access to our corridors.
we'll continue home through open space if we have to.
"all right, our lives are in your hands."
we found a planet in a nebula near the junction of corridors three nine and eight seven five. we'd be isolated and relatively safe.
relatively?
i'm afraid the planet is somewhat harsh. there are no large bodies of water and the vegetation is sparse.
this is absurd.
"ensign, we need a power coupling over here, on the double."
"our plan was to reoccupy one of our former colonies, gain allies, rebuild our forces, take back what was ours."
our former colonies are destroyed or occupied by species that are far more advanced than we are.
then we'll find a way to take them back.
"with what, a battalion of obsolete ships and outdated weapons?"
"no, with voyager. i've been studying their technology, the control systems, propulsion, weaponry. we could learn to operate the vessel ourselves."
what are you saying?
"after they engage the turei, they'll expect us to assist them. instead, we'll attack. we'll put as many soldiers as we can onto voyager and take it into the corridors."
"this is a mistake. if we fail, we'll lose everything."
"if you like, i can return you to your stasis pod. inform the others."
"this is an m class planet in orbit of a type g star. we've located a subcontinent with edible vegetation and an underground water supply. unfortunately, the region is subject to windstorms."
not exactly paradise.
you will adapt.
"practical and to the point, just like my wife. she had a knack for cutting to the truth."
she must have been an efficient individual.
to say the least. you would have enjoyed her company. you are not at all like the borg i knew.
"as a drone, i helped assimilate many civilisations. now i have the opportunity to help reconstruct one. i find the experience gratifying."
so do i. i'm curious. has your crew ever considered finding a planet of their own? a place to settle down?
captain janeway is committed to getting voyager back to earth.
"that could take decades, and there are many dangers ahead."
we will adapt.
i suppose you will.
neelix to seven of nine.
yes?
could i see you in cargo bay two? it's important.
acknowledged.
i'm due for a final briefing with your mister tuvok.
i'll accompany you to the bridge.
"i'm sorry to bother you, but i've been doing some research on our new allies and i have found something very interesting. in dozens of the ancient folktales of my people, there's a common theme. they describe a phantom army that appears out of thin air, destroys entire colonies, and vanishes in the blink of an eye. sound familiar?"
the subspace corridors.
exactly. gedrin claims they've been using them as trade routes but i'm starting to wonder.
"your source material is folktales, mister neelix."
but many fables have a basis in reality. you've got the collective knowledge of thousands of species. you could cross-reference my findings. it'll only take a few minutes.
come in.
"you wanted to see me, captain?"
yes. i need a little history lesson.
can't it wait until after we've reached the corridors?
i'm afraid not. i've just had a conversation with mister neelix and seven of nine. they've been poring through various databases and ha've come up with some surprising findings.
surprising?
"you told me the vaadwaur were a culture of merchants and scientists who expanded their knowledge by using subspace corridors to travel to other worlds. you were the envy of hundreds of species, some of whom eventually wanted the corridors for themselves."
your point?
"let me give you another version of events. the vaadwaur were an aggressive culture who expanded their territory by using the corridors to attack other worlds, until some of those worlds banded together to defend themselves and put an end to the vaadwaur threat once and for all. would you care to set the record straight?"
that was nine hundred years ago.
"if we're going to be fighting side by side, i have to trust you. i need to be certain you don't have any ulterior motives."
our only motive is survival.
"if i were to take you at your word, the ancient talaxians might call me vaadwaur. foolish. that's what they came to call anyone who allowed themselves to be deceived by an enemy. there are hundreds of other references just like it."
"both versions of our history are true. we did use the corridors to explore and, on occasion, expand our territory. but captain, we have gone from a population of six billion to six hundred. our weapons are archaic. do you really think that we are prepared to declare war on the delta quadrant?"
"not yet, but right now it's voyager i'm worried about. the turei are going to be firing everything they've got at my ship. you might try to take advantage of that."
"what are you going to do, put us all back into stasis?"
"we said we'd try to help you make a new start, and i want to keep that promise. but i can't ignore history, mister gedrin."
"make yourself comfortable, mister gedrin. chakotay, i don't know whether to believe him or not. what i wouldn't give for a betazoid about now."
"if mister neelix is right, we should be ready for anything. their technology may be outdated, but it can still do a lot of damage."
agreed. maintain a full security alert and have tuvok keep a weapons lock on their primary reactor.
are we still proceeding at oh six hundred hours?
"yes, but with a few modifications. what's mister gaul's location?"
he's in the central chamber.
hail him.
"captain, we've reactivated seventy three assault vessels. our pilots are standing by."
i need to inform you about a change of plan. i want you to deactivate the particle cannons on all but ten of your assault vessels. then we'll proceed on schedule.
i don't understand.
only ten of your ships are going to engage the turei. the others will head directly for the subspace corridors. i see no reason for those to be armed.
something could go wrong. why leave them defenceless?
voyager will defend them.
what prompted this change?
"you haven't been completely honest about your past, and that makes me a little uncertain about the present."
gedrin.
i suggest you listen to her.
"request denied, captain."
it's not a request. you can call it an ultimatum if you like.
unacceptable.
"i'm going to leave this planet in one hour, with or without you."
we did not spend nine hundred years in stasis to take orders from you.
contact the battalion. tell them to prepare for the attack.
i don't know about the rest of you but i'm ready to get moving. what's our status?
impulse engines are online.
shields at maximum. weapons standing by.
"tom, prepare to initiate the ascent sequence in"
report!
massive energy readings coming from the central chamber.
it's the vaadwaur. they're launching the first wave of ships. seventeen vessels have broken through the surface. they're at an altitude of two thousand metres and charging weapons.
"ma'am, they're not ascending into orbit. they're heading straight for voyager."
tom?
engaging thrusters. initiating ascent sequence.
vaadwaur ships approaching off our starboard bow.
"target phasers, full spread."
we're airborne.
"what altitude do we need on this planet, tom, before we can go to warp?"
we'll have to clear the thermosphere. two hundred and eighty kilometres at least.
shields at ninety two percent.
phasers.
we've disabled four of their ships.
they've launched another thirty nine vessels.
evasive manoeuvres.
it's no use. they're closing on all sides.
direct hit to the port thrusters.
we're losing altitude.
reroute emergency power. we need to get into orbit.
targeting sensors offline. switching to manual.
"harry, can you open a secure channel to the turei ships in orbit?"
"yes, ma'am, but that would give away our position. they could lock on with plasma charges."
i think it's time we reacquaint a couple of old friends. hail them.
voyager's shields are weakening but they're gaining altitude again. they're approaching the thermosphere.
launch another squadron.
we've got nine more fighters on our tail.
aft shields down to twenty percent.
"captain, the turei are responding."
put them through.
what do you want?
i've got a proposition for you.
no more talk. prepare to be bordered.
"tell me, have you been picking up weapons fire?"
"we have detected some unusual energy signatures, yes."
that's because we're under attack by the vaadwaur.
impossible. they were destroyed centuries ago.
some of us have survived.
"they've got over two hundred ships. they said something about wanting their subspace corridors back. i suggest we join forces and try to neutralise the threat here and now. what's more important to you? deleting the records of a federation ship that means you no harm, or defending yourselves against hundreds of vaadwaur fighters who are determined to invade your underspace? i suggest you pick your enemy."
our sensors can't penetrate the atmosphere. how can we fight an enemy we can't see?
we have access to one of their surveillance satellites. we could use it to transmit their vital coordinates to you.
if this is a deception
i'm having trouble establishing a link with the satellite. our sensor array took heavy damage.
"i could access it from the underground control chamber. transport me there. not all of my people are stuck in the past, captain."
"tuvok, go with him."
we've impacted their hull. there are breaches in progress on two decks.
they'll have to reroute power from their shields to seal them. they'll have no choice but to put down. have our ground forces ready.
we've lost impulse engines and navigation.
thrusters are failing. we're losing altitude.
"tuvok, status. tuvok?"
i've lost the signal.
"all hands, this is the captain. initiate emergency landing procedures, and arm yourselves. if the vaadwaur board this ship, we'll fight them hand to hand if we have to."
"once we've secured voyager, execute the crew."
"wait. we have hundreds of bio-pods still intact. put them into stasis. in a few hundred years, maybe someone will be kind enough to revive them."
what is that?
it's a plasma charge. it came from orbit. it's the turei. they've isolated our location.
how?
one of the surveillances satellite has been activated.
shut it down.
they're blocking my commands. i'm rotating the carrier frequencies.
the chamber is destabilising. we must evacuate.
"not yet. if we're going to succeed, i need to transmit the signatures of our fighters to the turei. you go."
six vaadwaur ships were just destroyed by the turei. the others are breaking off their attack.
impulse engines?
still offline.
how about emergency power?
"barely enough for life support, captain."
"harry, the radiogenic particles in the atmosphere. could we use them as a power source?"
we'd have to modify the warp core's conversion matrix. it could take hours.
what if we drew the particles directly into our plasma manifold?
that would give us one hell of a boost.
it could also blow out every power relay on the ship.
"damned if we do, damned if we don't. open the forward nacelle ports and reverse the pressure gradient. take in six hundred kilograms."
"the chamber's collapsing, sir."
we'll take as many ships as we can. try to reach the subspace corridor.
particle concentration at three thousand parts per million.
release the manifold.
rerouting plasma to the power conduits. we have impulse.
take us up.
thirteen power relays just blew out on deck six.
steady.
we're crossing the thermosphere.
any sign of pursuit?
none. looks like the vaadwaur have their hands full.
altitude?
"two hundred and sixty kilometres, two hundred and seventy. we've cleared the thermosphere."
"go to warp, mister paris."
"yes, ma'am."
how many ships?
astrometrics scans detected fifty three ion signatures entering the corridors. all vaadwaur.
the underground chambers?
"they were destroyed by the turei bombardment. captain, i believe i made an error in judgment."
oh?
"by awakening gedrin, i initiated a chain of events that nearly led to our destruction. i wanted to help revive a civilisation, not start a war."
"you thought you were acting out of compassion. i might have done the same thing. but that doesn't make it right, seven. the repercussions of this could be catastrophic."
their technology is nine centuries out of date. their plans for conquest are irrelevant.
"they're a resourceful species, determined. they'll adapt. i doubt we've seen the last of them."
ares four to kumagawa. how was the sunrise from down there?
beautiful. there was a little green mixed in today. it was really quite spectacular.
sorry i missed it.
"next time, lieutenant."
any luck drilling through that lava plain?
roger that. we broke through the iron oxide barrier and we're down to eight metres.
we should have some samples by the end of the day if all goes well.
on to more important matters. received an uplink from houston. the yankees won game five of the world series.
you owe me twenty bucks.
it's not over yet. there's still game six. we won't be the only ones making history today. bokai just broke dimaggio's record.
i don't believe it.
"if you ask me, houston's been manipulating the stats."
they do have a few too many kings fans at mission control.
"well, how else do you explain bokai beating out the yankee clipper?"
commander? we lost you for a second there.
the ride got a little bumpy. stand by. picking up some turbulence.
at your altitude?
checking lidar. what the hell?
"john, what's going on?"
"there's an object closing on my position, azimuth one twenty one point six. whatever it is, it's huge. it's over a thousand metres across."
how could something that big appear out of nowhere?
"i don't know, but i'm getting out of its way. firing thrusters."
it's probably just a solar flare.
let's hope so.
it's no solar flare.
come in. come in!
chakotay to the bridge.
this is transporter room two.
i'm trying to reach the bridge.
"your comm. signal was routed here, sir."
can you patch me through?
pardon me. where? patch you through where?
neelix?
commander?
check on the field generators.
"control seven, return to base at once."
"computer, locate neelix."
i can't get through to engineering.
i see you're making some changes to the computer core.
i have enhanced the command sequencers with borg algorithms.
"well, your enhancements are wreaking havoc with our secondary systems."
insignificant malfunctions. i will correct them.
i don't recall authorising any modifications.
the computer core is inefficient. it needed to be improved.
"i appreciate your initiative, but that's not up to you."
"i've explained the value of these enhancements on several occasions, but lieutenant torres chose to ignore me. i thought a demonstration would be more persuasive."
"well, i doubt this one's going to change her mind."
clearly voyager is not yet ready for assimilation. a joke. the doctor suggested that i defuse tense situations with humour.
good idea. now how about getting these systems back up again so i can get back to my book.
we are experiencing a ship-wide power drain. this is unrelated to my modifications.
senior officers to the bridge.
"it's two in the morning, ensign. this better be more than a little turbulence."
you won't be disappointed. we've got level nine gravimetric distortions closing on our position.
they're emanating from subspace.
on screen. shields.
it's heading right toward us.
evasive manoeuvres.
captain.
say good morning to thirty million terajoules of subspace energy.
this thing is following us. i can't outrun it at impulse.
go to warp.
it's disrupting our warp field.
if it gets any closer the gravimetric stresses are going to rip the plating off our hull.
"captain, i recognise this phenomenon. it's borg designation is spatial anomaly five two one. it's attracted to objects that emit electromagnetic energy. we have to cut power and reverse our shield polarity."
do it.
that was close.
"i recognise this anomaly too. it's called a graviton ellipse. according to the federation database it travels through subspace, emerging occasionally without warning. ellipses have only been observed a handful of times."
ares four.
commander?
one of the early mars missions. the command module and its pilot were engulfed by a similar phenomenon back in 2032.
i remember reading about that. two astronauts were stranded on the surface for weeks before a rescue ship arrived.
no one's gotten this close to a graviton ellipse and lived to tell about it. this could be a remarkable opportunity.
go to yellow alert. keep our power output at minimum levels. match it's course and speed but maintain a safe distance.
"aye, captain."
i suggest we launch a probe. see if we can find out what makes this thing tick.
make it fast. there's no telling when our visitor's going to burrow back into subspace.
i'm receiving telemetry from the probe. it appears to have entered a stable core within the anomaly. the gravimetric forces are negligible.
the eye of the storm.
an apt metaphor.
"computer, run a multispectral analysis of the anomaly's core."
analysis in progress.
the borg developed shields to get through the gravimetric currents. they intended to dissipate the anomaly from within. perhaps we should continue their efforts.
it would be short-sighted to destroy it. we should study the phenomenon.
i didn't realise you shared this crew's penchant for exploration.
i am a starfleet officer.
"when the risks outweigh the potential gain, exploration is illogical."
"we can't predict what we might find here, seven. one must allow for the unexpected discovery."
core analysis complete.
there are more that two point eight billion compounds in the core.
fascinating.
the computer has isolated several synthetic compounds native to sector zero zero one.
titanium and polymer composites. these materials date back to the twenty first century. they were used in the construction of earth's early spacecraft.
commander chakotay mentioned a space capsule that was consumed by a graviton ellipse.
these alloys are consistent with the hull of that capsule. an unexpected discovery indeed.
"she was forty six metres, ninety two metric tons, powered by a third generation ion drive, and equipped with a transpectral imager."
"ares four was piloted by lieutenant john kelly. his ground team, astronauts rose kumagawa and andrei novakovich, were close to completing their survey mission when kelly reported an object closing on his position. then he and the command module disappeared off nasa's lidar scopes."
and into the history books. that incident almost derailed the mars programme.
mankind's first encounter with a spatial anomaly.
"seven, you said the borg were working on a way to get inside a graviton ellipse."
shield enhancements.
"well, maybe we could apply the same enhancements to the flyer."
"captain, do you intend to try to find the command module?"
or what's left of it.
"by my calculations, we have less than sixteen hours before the anomaly goes back into subspace."
"then we have to work quickly. harry, b'elanna, help seven modify the flyer's shields. tom, review the database from the ares four mission. it might tell us something about this anomaly we've missed. we're going to need a mission leader."
i volunteer.
i thought you might. let's do it.
"something on your mind, seven?"
the anomaly is as dangerous and unpredictable now as it was three hundred years ago.
but the delta flyer's a little more advanced than the ares four was. we'll be taking every precaution.
that may not be enough.
"i appreciate your concern but, this is my call."
searching for the command module seems more sentimental than scientific.
"i can't argue with that. if scientific knowledge was all we were after, then the federation would have built a fleet of probes, not starships. exploration is about seeing things with your own eyes. in this case, we're exploring the past."
how will retrieving this artefact enhance your appreciation of history?
"by making us part of it. in the same way that excavating the obelisks of ancient vulcan, or finding the shroud of kahless made those explorers a part of their history. here's the crux of it. as a borg, you didn't study the past, you ingested it. you've never really developed an appreciation for humanity's history. maybe this is an opportunity to do some exploring of your own."
are you ordering me to join this mission?
let's just say i'm encouraging you to volunteer.
it's no solar flare. wow!
"john, can you describe it?"
it's at least a thousand metres wide. bright.
your transmission's breaking up.
"it's generating an electromagnetic radiation, interfering with primary systems. i can't get away from it. activating the transpectral imager. i'll record as much data as i can. it's right on top of me. i'll transmit as much as i can."
that's all she wrote.
"nasa received kelly's last telemetry at oh nine twenty two hours, october 19th, 2032."
i thought i was the mars buff. you seem to know more about the ares four than i do.
the mars missions paved the way for the exploration of space. kelly was one of my childhood heroes.
mine too.
"that's dedication. the man's life is about to end, but he won't stop taking readings."
makes you wonder if those old-timers were made of sterner stuff than we are.
you think we have it easy?
"you kidding? warp drive, shields, transporters. we're travelling in the lap of luxury."
"kelly and kumagawa, armstrong and glenn, they were the real pioneers."
am i interrupting?
we were just admiring someone. fellow explorer.
hero worship. the glorification of an individual's accomplishment.
i guess you didn't have many role models growing up.
"in the collective, personal accomplishments are irrelevant. the shield modifications to the flyer are complete. we're ready for launch."
we?
you'll need someone familiar with borg technology to monitor the shields. i'm volunteering.
you don't sound too happy about it.
"i'm not, but this mission can benefit from my expertise."
"in that case, welcome aboard."
"i'm preparing an inoculant to counter the effects of gravimetric radiation. of course, if you were a hologram, you'd simply adjust your mobile emitter. that's what i did on arakis prime, one of my first away missions."
i don't recall that.
"this was before you came aboard. such an enchanting planet. crystalline glaciers, magnesium vapour atmosphere. i had to stop my metallurgical scans just to admire the sheer beauty of it. to smell the roses, to coin a phrase."
an inefficient use of your time.
"perhaps. we're all finished here, except for one thing. would you record some images when you're inside the ellipse, for those of us not lucky enough to make the trip?"
you envy my participation in this mission?
there isn't a crewman aboard who doesn't.
why?
"i can only tell you how i felt that morning when i materialised on arakis prime. i left my footprints in the magnesite dust and thought, one small step for a hologram, one giant leap for mankind."
to coin a phrase.
"well, i know the sentiment isn't exactly original, but the fact is, i was exhilarated."
chakotay to seven of nine. report to shuttlebay two.
good luck.
"we're approaching the perimeter in five, four, three, two, one."
we're within two thousand kilometres. gravimetric interference is increasing.
it's nothing compared to what they're going through. they're really getting knocked around in there.
their shields have weakened but they're still holding.
"harry, keep your finger on that tractor beam in case we have to pull them out."
they're approaching the anomaly's core. we've lost sensor contact.
harry.
the comm. link is still active.
the gravimetric shear is increasing.
i'm reading diminished turbulence directly ahead.
"full thrusters, tom. punch us through. chakotay to voyager. we're in."
"i wish you could see this, captain, it's incredible."
we're all ears.
it's very calm. no gravimetric distortions. the em activity is creating a natural luminescence. tom called it mood lighting.
"hey b'elanna, it's the perfect romantic getaway."
i'll take your word for it.
"we've detected asteroid fragments, pieces of vessels, matter from every quadrant of the galaxy. next time i lose something i'll know where to look. instead of a graviton ellipse we should call it the kitchen sink anomaly. the chemical interactions have even created a primitive atmosphere."
"nothing you'd want to breathe, of course."
"what do you make of it, seven?"
"well, i suppose it's intriguing. some of the matter appears to be extra-dimensional in origin."
sounds like this anomaly's gotten around.
any sign of the ares command module?
"we're picking up traces of the hull, but our sensor readings are being refracted by all the debris in here."
that was a gravimetric surge caused by the anomaly changing course by point zero zero six degrees.
we just had a big jolt out here.
we didn't feel a thing.
by our estimate you have five hours thirty six minutes before the anomaly returns to subspace.
you'd better get a move on.
understood.
i'm having difficulty isolating the debris from the command module.
i'll lay in a search pattern. it may take a couple of hours to cover an area this large.
"seven and i can use the time to take some samples, get a better idea of where this anomaly's been."
we should focus on achieving our objective and returning to voyager.
we're not here just to find a module. we've got an opportunity to
explore. i am familiar with our mission.
"in that case, let's get started."
the fossilised microbes in this ore appear to have had metallic membranes.
"we've speculated about the possibility of metallic lifeforms, but we've never discovered one."
you're excited by this discovery?
"this piece of rock is billions of years older than earth, from a time when the galaxy was still forming. here."
commander?
take it. you're holding a piece of history. maybe even the beginnings of life itself.
unlikely.
it's more likely than you think. this anomaly is as old as anything we've ever encountered. i could spend a lifetime studying the things it's collected.
and leave voyager without a first officer?
they'd manage. palaeontology was always my first love. it's the reason i joined starfleet.
why didn't you pursue it?
"my sense of responsibility got in the way. first the maquis, then voyager. what i wanted to be always seemed to take a back seat. do you remember what you wanted to be before you were assimilated?"
i was assimilated when i was a child.
i knew i wanted to be a palaeontologist when i was six.
a ballerina.
maybe it's not too late.
it was a juvenile fantasy.
those are the ones that stick with you.
"heads up, folks. i think we're getting close."
"i've isolated the module, bearing thirty nine mark one five. there."
it appears to be intact.
"i'm reading hull breaches and corrosion, but all things considered it's pretty well preserved."
we weren't expecting to find a fragment this big. can't just stow it in the aft section.
we'll use a tractor beam to tow it back to voyager.
"captain, the anomaly just made another course change, point zero zero three degrees."
that's the third one in an hour. something has to be attracting it.
there's nothing on the sensors.
i think it enjoys being unpredictable.
we know it has a taste for electromagnetic energy.
"so what could generate an em field large enough to get it's attention, but still not show up on sensors?"
"an energy burst from a pulsar, a neutrino cloud."
dark matter.
realign the sensor array to scan for em fluctuations.
i've got a spatial disturbance three million kilometres away. it's a dark matter asteroid.
bingo.
the anomaly's heading right for it.
time to impact?
"four minutes. captain, we can't predict how the impact will affect the anomaly."
but it's a safe bet it won't be a gentle nudge.
"janeway to delta flyer, we've"
got a problem. the anomaly is on a collision course with a dark matter asteroid.
we've located the mars orbiter. we're adapting a tractor beam.
give us a minute.
you don't have it. get out of there.
captain?
now.
is the tractor beam ready?
"just about, sir."
lock onto the module and take us out.
we don't have time.
i gave you an order.
commander.
we're not leaving without that module. tom!
"captain, both the anomaly and the asteroid are accelerating."
they're attracting each other like a pair of magnets.
at this rate it'll impact in fifty six seconds.
"chakotay, you've got less than a minute."
acknowledged.
the module is slowing us down.
maintain tractor lock. how long until we clear the anomaly?
"at our current speed, forty seconds."
we can do it.
thirty seconds to impact. they're still not clear.
"chakotay, status."
we're on our way.
twenty seconds.
gravimetric distortions are increasing.
the flyer?
i've lost the signal.
how badly is he damaged?
he's got a severe concussion and internal injuries. we need to get him back to voyager.
"that may not be possible. communications, shields and propulsion are still offline."
he's stable for now. i'll give you a hand.
"we can repair the shields, but the engines are unsalvageable."
it can't be that bad.
it's worse. the ellipse showing signs of returning to subspace. we have less than two hours.
"he's regaining consciousness. easy, easy. lie still."
it feels like i just went ten rounds with an andorian.
more like twenty. you were hit with a plasma discharge. the gravimetric surge from the asteroid caught us at the edge of the anomaly and tossed us back inside.
the command module?
"it's adrift, three hundred metres off our port bow."
then we can still salvage it.
"not so fast. we can't get engines or shields back online, not to mention a tractor beam. we'll be lucky to get out of this in one piece."
i can help.
"you're in worse shape than this ship. you want to help? lie in the bed, doctor's orders."
another gravimetric surge.
i'll see if i can reinforce the structural integrity field.
you might try drawing power from auxiliary life support.
that system was damaged as well.
what about the secondary relays?
they're offline.
that doesn't leave us many choices. try rerouting the phaser couplings.
we explored that option while you were unconscious.
then maybe you can bring me up to date.
there's no time. i suggest you recuperate. we have the situation under control.
it doesn't look that way from here. i'm still in command of this mission. i want to know what's going on.
"very well. we were ordered by the captain to leave this anomaly, but you chose to disobey that command. as a result of your obsession with the module, we are now trapped along with it. in all probability we won't survive without"
"point taken. now why don't you continue, without the attitude."
an inventory of the damaged systems. read it for yourself.
i made a mistake. i put the mission at risk.
you put our lives at risk.
"well, if we don't make it out, someone's bound to come looking for us in a few hundred years. defusing a tense situation with humour, remember?"
voyager to delta flyer.
they're using a probe as a transmission relay.
"voyager to chakotay, please respond. we can't detect you."
"captain, we can hear you."
"i'm matching their frequency. voyager, this is the delta flyer. respond."
are you all right? what's your status?
"we've sustained heavy damage, captain, but we're alive. it's good to hear your voice."
we could install the same shielding on a class two shuttle and take it in.
it took us hours to make the modifications
to the flyer. we've only got eighty two minutes before this thing disappears into subspace.
it may be possible to modify a tractor beam to cut through the gravimetric interference.
you'll never be able to get it all the way through to the core.
start working on it anyway.
you said all the energy conduits are fused?
correct.
we can't get power to any of the primary systems.
if the replicators were working we could whip up a new plasma manifold
and be on our way.
what if i could get you an old manifold?
excuse me?
"the command module may be three centuries old, but the power distribution system isn't that different from the flyer's. right here. this control panel in the main cockpit. it was called an ion distributor. with a few tweaks it could be modified to channel warp plasma."
"even if it were possible, we have to obtain the object"
before we can adapt it.
do you have enough
power to beam one of you to the module?
"yes, ma'am. i'll go."
"not so fast, tom. if another gravimetric surge hits, we'll need you at the helm. seven."
"are you encouraging me to volunteer again, captain?"
you read my mind.
"come on, just a little closer. that's it for thrusters"
but i got us within transporter range. ready?
stand by.
"ironic. you're doing what i've always dreamt of. remember, when you set foot in that module, you'll be stepping into history."
history is irrelevant.
"irrelevant? do me a favour. when you're over there, download whatever you can from their database. and also take a minute to look around, so you can tell us what it was like."
"there may not be time, but i'll try."
good luck.
what's it like in there?
dark. the ambient temperature is minus two hundred sixty degrees. there appear to be fractures in the aft bulkheads.
is the cockpit intact?
yes.
i've brought the main computer online.
"i've lost contact with the team on the surface, and i can't get a fix on my position."
what was that?
there's an active data file.
it appears to contain log entries.
can you play them for us?
i believe so.
consider it my last request.
and i can't get a fix on my position. but i'm alive and the cm seems to be intact. i'm inside this
whatever it is.
"could you hear that, chakotay?"
it's amazing. everyone assumed he was killed instantly.
"what i've gotten myself into. it's very calm, like i'm in the eye of a hurricane. it's a little spooky but the way i figure it."
"if there's a way in, there's got to be a way out. i'm gonna fire up the spectral imager before i initiate another engine burn, collect as much data as i can. jeannie, i may not be bringing you back the mars rock, but i promise you, i'm going to do everything i can to get home."
"ares four, mission record, october 23rd. i'm starting to feel like jonah. how long was he in the belly of that whale? three days? i got him beat by a day or two already. the em interference is disrupting communications and lidar, and i can't see the stars. there's no way i can get a fix on my position. if this thing's moving as fast as it was when it pulled me in, i could be a long way from mars by now. the imager's been working overtime cataloguing all the matter in here, but a lot of it defies analysis. i think we're going to need to make room on the periodic table. where the hell am i? power levels have dropped another fifteen percent since my last systems check."
"i think i just saw another spacecraft. either that, or all this dehydrated food has gone to my head. i've got it. the hull's made of some kind of alloy. i can't make heads or tails of it. i shouldn't have been so dismissive."
"i remember giving kumagawa a hard time when she claimed she saw a ufo over the gulf. i told her it was a meteor or another piece of mir. i guess i owe you an apology, rose. ares four, mission record, october 25th. it's been a nice place to visit"
"but i'm ready to come home. i've prepped the ion drive, channeled all the thruster reserves into the main tank."
i have enough fuel for one last engine burn. wish me luck.
"ignition sequence. five, four, three, two. i'm losing pitch control. gyros aren't responding. power failure. i've got to abort. i'm not going to make it."

paris to seven. status?
"i've located the device, but it's fused to the hull. stand by."
make it quick. we've got less than fifteen minutes.
understood.
"all systems go. watch me dad, i'm flying. boom. bad landing. call the medevac team. ha. john kelly's first flight, not exactly a-ok. remember that, dad? i jumped off the roof with a parachute made of blankets. i guess i didn't calculate the aerodynamics. of course, i was only six. i guess"
"this is john kelly's last flight. this time, i can't blame it on pilot error. this time, no regrets."
"oh, what i've seen proves we were right to come out here."
"we're not alone, i know that now. the module's losing power. i'm taking life support offline."
"rerouting whatever's left to the imager. keep it running as long as possible. mission control, dad, whoever finds this, do me a favour. take all the data i've collected. put it to good use. i hope you don't look at this as a failure. i don't."
"actually, i do have one regret. i never found out who won the world series. i'm tired, and i can't"
paris to seven. how's it going over there?
i have the distributor. i'm downloading lieutenant kelly's database.
hurry. we're running out of time.

"we have propulsion, shields."
the plasma flow is still fluctuating.

"they're approaching the perimeter. two thousand metres, eighteen hundred."

are we in tractor range?
not yet.
take us closer.
captain?
do it.
they're still out of reach. another three hundred metres.
closer.
we'll be pulled right in with them.
just a few more metres.
we're too close.
i've got a lock.
"reverse thrusters, full impulse."
"space. literally it means nothing, a vacuum between stars and planets, but by the same token it means everything. it's what connects all our worlds, vulcan, kronos, talax, earth. centuries ago, mankind sent its first wave of explorers into that void. astronauts like mister kelly. they paved the way for the first colonies, the first starships, for those of us who've made space our home. we commend the spirit and the bravery of lieutenant john mark kelly as we commit his body to space. he will not be forgotten."
"captain. i did not know this individual. had i encountered him while i was a borg i would have found his technology unworthy of assimilation. but we are more alike than one might think. in a sense, his desire to explore was not unlike a quest for perfection."
"his contribution helped secure humanity's future, and in some ways, my own."
"the yankees, in six games."
"all hands, attention. honour guard."
naomi wildman. state your purpose here.
"i was waiting for you. kadis-kot, remember? our weekly game?"
reschedule for tomorrow. i'm working now.
redecorating isn't work.
aesthetics are irrelevant. i'm modifying the alcove to function as a cortical processing sub-unit.
that was my next guess.
then i won't need to explain its purpose.
"okay, you win. what do you do with a cortical processing er"
"sub-unit. on borg vessels, there's one in each unimatrix. it downloads newly assimilated data to the drones."
"but voyager isn't a borg vessel, and you're not a drone anymore."
"voyager collects a great deal of information. sensor scans, navigational projections, engineering updates, away team reports, scientific analyses."
the results of our kadis-kot tournament?
"that, too. the crew must read and study this information. an inefficient procedure. these data nodes are downloading the information into the alcove."
which is going to download it into you.
"precisely. in a matter of hours, i will assimilate several months worth of data."
can i try it sometime?
your physiology is different from mine.
guess i'll stick to reading my lessons and listening to neelix tell stories.
i will see you tomorrow.
"can i watch? okay, tomorrow."
warning. plate is hot.
now you tell me. you go for authenticity and what do you get? second-degree burns.
( i've been slaving over that replicator programme for hours. what was this bizarre rumour i heard about half the crew on deck five getting pregnant?
"oh, that. the doctor was running generational projections on the sickbay computer. tom paris happened to glance at the monitor and jumped to conclusions. wasn't long before neelix was asking me if he could turn cargo bay one into a nursery."
"word travels fast on this ship, hmm?"
"warp ten. oh, by the way, i meant to tell you. there's a class k nebula twenty five light years off starboard. we should take a look."
a major detour for a minor nebula.
"we are explorers, remember?"
permission granted.
"main course. a recipe i've never tried. but we are explorers, remember."
regeneration cycle complete.
"seven of nine to lieutenant torres. lieutenant torres, respond."
"good morning, seven. this better be important."
i must speak with you at once.
i'm picking up some interesting graviton fluctuations about ten light years away.
can you be more specific?
"not at this distance. tom, alter course. i want to take a closer look."
chakotay had his heart set on that nebula we're headed for.
he'll have to wait.
"captain, i need permission to shut down the sensor grid. seven thinks a couple of insects are disrupting the power flow."
"a mating pair of photonic fleas, to be more accurate, and possibly their offspring."
and how did you arrive at this theory?
"last night, i downloaded six months of ship status reports into my new cortical sub-unit while i was regenerating."
"learn while you sleep. i tried that once, it gave me a headache."
go on.
"eight weeks ago, an away team encountered a kartelan freighter carrying supplies from sector four nine two, a territory that included a former talaxian colony. mister neelix used the opportunity to acquire twelve kilograms of amber spice, a delicacy among his people."
what does that have to do with the sensor grid?
"on the same day, ensign kim was repairing a replicator in the mess hall."
i remember that. neelix told me to stick around and try something he was cooking.
"no doubt made with the amber spice, which contained the larvae of the photonic fleas."
how could you possibly know that?
"because i also downloaded data regarding their life cycles. the larvae flew out of the spice jar in search of their primary source of nourishment, plasma particles. the conduits within the nearby sensor grid contain an unlimited supply of these particles. ensign kim had unwittingly given the creatures access by exposing the grid. the now mature creatures periodically tap into the conduit for nourishment. when they do, the sensor emitters momentarily lose their resolution."
"a logical, though highly speculative, analysis."
let's find a more suitable home for them.
i'm picking up graviton fluctuations.
take us out of warp. on screen.
anybody want to hazard a guess?
they are hailing us.
on screen.
i recommend maximum shielding. there are a few technical issues i haven't worked out yet.
there's a massive graviton surge coming from that thing.
shields to full.
your apparatus appears to be destabilising.
"if i don't find a way to repair this power core they'll be able to see the explosion all the way to, er, where did you say you were from?"
"i didn't, but we're from a planet called earth."
all the way to earth.
can we ask you what it's supposed to do?
"catapult a vessel across space, in the time it takes to say catapult a vessel across space. it'll make warp drive look like a wooden sledge."
maybe we can help you with that power core.
hmm?
"the core sends a graviton surge through the projectors which locks onto a ship and sends it hurtling into null space, to emerge a few hours later hundreds, if not thousands, of light years away."
i'm curious why you built this catapult.
simple. i've been looking for a way to get home.
we know the feeling.
"i'd been exploring an unstable wormhole. before i knew it, i was here and my home planet was there. i was facing a journey of at least ten years. instead, i decided to build a catapult."
have you tested it yet?
two weeks ago i sent a probe nearly six hundred light years. but it destabilised the core. i've been trying to fix it ever since.
we can send an engineering team over to help you.
"no, no, it's too dangerous. i wouldn't send my own crew in there."
then we could find a way to adjust the core reaction from here.
a few well-timed graviton pulses from our deflector dish might do it.
"that's generous, but i have nothing to give in return."
we're not asking for anything in return.
you could use the catapult after i've made my jump. it should still be functional. a thousand light years won't exactly get you back to earth.
but it would cut a few years off our trip.
"if you're successful, and if i'm satisfied a jump would be safe for voyager, then we'll take you up on that offer. thank you. let's get started."
good morning.
"perhaps not. the alien, mister tash, is trying to deceive us. his catapult is the same type of technology that was used to trap voyager in the delta quadrant five years ago."
i scanned the catapult myself. sensors didn't pick up anything unusual. you spent the night in your new alcove.
"processing the same information and cross-referencing it with voyager's database. when the catapult destabilised yesterday, astrometric sensors recorded a momentary burst of epsilon radiation."
"unusual, but not unheard of."
"epsilon radiation is one the by-products of a tetryon reactor. according to your own entries in the database, your only encounter with that kind of technology occurred five years ago in the alpha quadrant. a coherent tetryon beam locked onto voyager, and you were hit by a massive displacement wave, which pulled you across seventy thousand light years in a matter of minutes. the source of that tetryon beam was the caretaker's array. mister tash claims that his catapult will be able to do something very similar."
he didn't want us to send over a repair team.
out of concern for our safety. it's obvious he was trying to hide his tetryon reactor.
"the first time we met a caretaker, we were pulled halfway across the galaxy. the second time we were almost killed. i'm not eager for a third round."
is this any way to treat a colleague?
not so much as a molecule of caretaker dna.
"thank you, doctor. there's a tetryon reactor powering your catapult. you didn't want us to find it, did you? unless you answer my questions, i'll resume course and you can ask somebody else for help."
"i acquired the tetryon reactor at great cost. this territory is full of species who would do anything for such advanced technology, including steal it. i apologise for the deception, but you do understand."
we made an agreement to cooperate. i see no reason not to continue.
"thank you, captain."
keep me informed on your progress.
that reactor had to come from somewhere. i can't just ignore the possibility of a caretaker nearby. keep scanning. see what you can find.
there is another possibility. the reactor may have come from the same array that brought voyager to the delta quadrant.
"that's a long shot, seven."
"maybe not. again, according to your own reports you believed the only way to keep the array from falling into the wrong hands was to destroy it. it's possible the destruction was incomplete."
and one of the reactors survived? we scanned for debris. there was nothing left but some fused pieces of metal alloy.
i wish to re-examine the sensor records from that event.
in case we were mistaken?
yes.
go right ahead.
"computer, describe the debris remaining after the array was destroyed."
"particulate dust and metallic fragments composed of an unknown alloy. vapour composed of hydrogen, helium, mercury and argon."
was there anything left of the tetryon reactor?
negative.
specify the yield of the tricobalt device.
twenty thousand teracochranes.
who programmed the device?
commander tuvok.
display the detonation. advance the image by point zero one seconds. again.
isolate grid three seven and magnify.
is that a tractor beam?
insufficient sensor data.
identify its source.
insufficient sensor data.
identify the isolated section of the array.
secondary power core.
which contained a tetryon reactor.
affirmative.
"commander, i've been reviewing the data on the destruction of the caretaker's array. unfortunately, the sensor records are incomplete."
i don't doubt it. we were being attacked by the kazon. half the ship's systems were down.
a single kazon vessel.
armed to the teeth.
"commander, you fired the tricobalt charge that destroyed the array."
correct.
under the captain's orders. did you also programme the charge?
yes.
under the captain's orders as well?
not directly. i determined the yield.
twenty thousand teracochranes.
that's correct.
"according to sensor estimates of the array's hull integrity, a charge of half that yield would have been sufficient."
the captain wanted nothing left for the kazon to use. i calculated a yield certain to produce that result.
something may have escaped the blast. one of the tetryon reactors.
but we scanned for debris.
the charge you detonated tore an opening in subspace.
and that's where the reactor went?
yes.
how?
it was pushed there by a tractor beam.
do you have evidence of a tractor beam?
perhaps.
"speculation is not evidence. there was no tractor beam, because there was no ship in the vicinity to generate one, unless you can prove otherwise."
"thank you, commander."
looking for a midnight snack?
i require information. i'm attempting to determine whether the catapult technology was derived from the caretaker's array.
so i heard. a fascinating theory. it's got my mind spinning.
how long were you in the vicinity of the array before voyager arrived?
"about a year. kes was on a nearby planet and, er, we were getting very close."
did you ever encounter the caretaker directly?
"oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. in my opinion, any being powerful enough to grab ships from the other side of the galaxy should be avoided."
"according to voyager's database, he claimed he was searching for a genetically compatible mate. did you believe that explanation?"
"i had no reason to doubt it, though it did seem a bit excessive. i mean, all those ships."
what happened to them?
"well, after he sampled the crew's dna he sent them back where they came from, i suppose. you know, kes always thought something more was going on, but she had quite an imagination."
were there any other ships in the area after voyager arrived?
only the kazon.
"but the caretaker could have pulled in another vessel. a cloaked ship, perhaps."
"seven, what are you getting at?"
"a third ship, hidden from both voyager and the kazon."
what was it doing there?
preventing the tetryon reactor from being destroyed.
kes was right. something was going on.
voyager's sensor logs were damaged in the kazon attack. i can't be certain.
maybe i can help. the sensor records on my ship weren't damaged. i can give them to you.
the tetryon reaction is stable. graviton field is set for a one hundred light year jump.
the catapult's locking onto him.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
"i'll contact you the moment i re-enter normal space. thank you, captain."
my pleasure.
catapult is at full power.
goodbye to you all.
final launch sequence has been initiated.
he's gone.
how long before we can expect to hear from him?
"if his vessel survived, one or two hours."
seven of nine to commander chakotay.
go ahead.
i require your assistance in the astrometrics lab.
on my way.
"computer, seal the doors. deactivate all sensors within this room."
acknowledged.
what's this about?
i believe voyager's presence in the delta quadrant is no accident. you and the crew have been stranded here intentionally.
by whom?
captain janeway. the captain and tuvok were involved in a federation conspiracy. they're in collusion with the caretaker and possibly the cardassians.
i see. and the point of this conspiracy?
i believe they're attempting to establish a military presence in the delta quadrant.
that's quite a theory. perhaps you haven't heard of the jankata accord?
no species shall enter another quadrant for the purpose of territorial expansion.
"the federation signed it, the cardassians signed it, and captain janeway would be the last person to violate it."
"improbable as it may sound, i've found compelling evidence to support my theory."
what kind of evidence?
i've analysed over thirty million teraquads of data regarding voyager's activities over the past five years. it's quite clear that we've been the victim of an elaborate deception.
i don't have the benefit of a cortical processor. why don't you give me the abridged version?
"in the months before voyager's arrival, neelix recorded the appearance of fifty two vessels, including this one."
a cardassian warship.
"a remarkable coincidence. only days before voyager's arrival, the cardassians were already in the delta quadrant."
"the caretaker was trying to find a mate, remember? he was pulling ships from all over the galaxy."
"i'm familiar with the caretaker's actions. in each instance, he would examine the crews' dna, and when he failed to find a genetic match he would release the vessel. but in this instance, neelix's sensors indicated the ship vanished. obviously, it was returned to the alpha quadrant. why?"
you seem to have all the answers.
i believe the cardassians were sent back to deliver strategic information regarding the delta quadrant.
conjecture.
extrapolation.
"i can believe the cardassians might be involved in this, but not starfleet."
"there are precedents for unauthorised missions of this type, commander. according to the federation database, the maquis were victims of several of them."
"all right, you've got my attention. you said that tuvok and captain janeway were involved. tell me how."
"at the same time the cardassians were meeting with the caretaker, your maquis vessel was infiltrated with a starfleet agent."
tuvok.
"your navigator. he guided your ship to prearranged coordinates in the badlands, where the caretaker locked onto you. once you were pulled into the delta quadrant, tuvok could have secretly transmitted final instructions to the caretaker. a short time later, captain janeway guided voyager to the same coordinates and was also pulled into the delta quadrant. all of these events took place within a matter of days. i find that suspicious."
"i'll admit the timing seems a little convenient, but that doesn't mean there was a master plan."
why did the captain destroy the array?
so the kazon couldn't use it to attack the ocampa.
"that's what she told the crew, but i believe she intended to remain in the delta quadrant all along. if the array had remained intact, you and all the others would have insisted on using it to return home."
she was keeping it from the kazon.
the captain ordered commander tuvok to destroy the array. he fired two tricobalt devices. are those weapons normally carried on federation starships?
no.
yet they were part of voyager's arsenal. why?
i can't explain that.
"i can. neither phasers nor torpedoes are capable of creating a tear in subspace. a tricobalt device is. as tuvok detonated the device, a cloaked ship locked on to one of the array's tetryon reactors and pushed it through the tear into subspace, protecting it from the blast and hiding it from voyager's sensors. but the captain and tuvok knew exactly where it was going. once voyager left the area, the reactor was retrieved and began a similar journey, carried by a series of vessels until it was finally delivered to mister tash."
who used it to build the catapult.
"he was waiting here for voyager, and for the final phase of the mission."
"which is what, exactly?"
"i don't think captain janeway is planning to use the catapult to get voyager closer to home. i think she's going to use it to bring in more vessels from the alpha quadrant. if i'm correct, this region of space will soon be occupied by a federation-cardassian invasion force."
"you've uncovered some interesting facts. but your interpretation is far-fetched. these are random incidents. granted, some of them are hard to explain, but there's no conspiracy here."
"stardate 51008, captain janeway allows kes to leave voyager. neelix told me that kes had suspicions about the caretaker. was the captain trying to silence her? stardate 51462, the doctor's programme is transmitted to a starfleet vessel on the outskirts of the alpha quadrant. an attempt by the captain to contact earth or a secret communiqué informing starfleet of her progress? stardate 50984, janeway forges an alliance with the borg. stardate 51762, a cease-fire with the hirogen. stardate 52861, a non-aggression pact with the terkellians. she called each incident diplomacy. i believe she was trying to establish a tactical infrastructure in the delta quadrant. over the past five years, captain janeway has altered course two hundred sixty three times in the name of exploration. in reality, she was mapping the region and collecting strategic data regarding"
i get the point.
"you still doubt my suspicions, but can you be certain i'm wrong?"
absolutely certain? no.
"until you are, you mustn't allow captain janeway to retain control of the catapult."
"i'm picking up a transmission, heavily distorted."
he made it.
can you clear it up?
"success, captain. five thousand light years."
are you all right?
"a few systems overloaded, nothing serious. i had to readjust my shields during mid-flight. almost lost my outer hull. i'm sending you the modifications. my catapult is yours, captain. good luck."
get that data down to b'elanna. tell her to enhance our shields.
so we're going ahead with the jump?
"i want to run a few more tests, launch some probes, but if it all checks out i see no reason not to."
i've received the telemetry.
i'll take it to engineering.
i want you to add a point zero three variance to these shield modifications.
that'll disrupt the emitters.
and you'll need another six hours to get them back online. i know.
have you run this by the captain?
"no, and i'm not going to. not yet."
she's pulling your leg. it's got to be some kind of borg practical joke.
she wasn't joking.
a secret mission? starfleet in league with the caretaker? it's ridiculous.
ridiculous? seven has some compelling evidence.
"well then, let's go to the captain, get a straight answer."
"good morning, kathryn. all systems are operational. the crew's in good health. and by the way, is it true you've been lying to us for five years? i'm not prepared to make that accusation, but i can't ignore what i've heard either."
so what do you suggest?
"i want you to delay those shield modifications. that'll give me time to check seven's database, take a look at the evidence myself."
the captain asked me to work with you on the shields.
"that won't be necessary, ensign."
"oh, i don't mind. you know how eager she is to make that jump."
"harry, we're fine here."
"too many cooks, harry. you know how it is. we'll let you know when we're done."
download complete.
seven of nine to captain janeway.
go ahead.
i need to speak with you in the astrometrics lab.
i'm on my way.
"computer, seal the door and deactivate internal sensors to this room."
acknowledged.
seven?
i believe chakotay and other members of your crew are involved in a conspiracy to resurrect the maquis rebellion.
did chakotay put you up to this?
voyager and the federation itself are in grave danger.
go on.
i've concluded that chakotay intends to use the catapult to launch attacks against cardassian and federation starships.
chakotay gave up his allegiance to the maquis a long time ago. what you're saying makes no sense.
"improbable as it may sound, i found compelling evidence to support my theory. in the months before voyager's arrival, neelix recorded the sudden appearance of fifty two vessels, including this one."
a cardassian warship.
"i've analysed the hull geometry and warp signature. it was one of the same ships that were pursuing chakotay and his crew in the region known as the badlands. it was pulled into the delta quadrant by the caretaker during that engagement. according to federation records, that same cardassian warship was found destroyed in the badlands. the investigation revealed that it was attacked by the maquis. i believe that for some unknown reason the caretaker had sent this ship back to the alpha quadrant, and that commander chakotay attacked the vessel before it could reach its destination. he downloaded its computer core and discovered the presence of the caretaker's array. he realised that the array could be used by the maquis as a weapon, to launch surprise attacks against cardassian and starfleet vessels."
"well, i commend you for your imagination, but tuvok was a spy on chakotay's ship. if your theory were true, he would have known about it."
he does. tuvok has been collaborating with the maquis resistance all along.
"that's not possible, seven."
"with tuvok's assistance chakotay plotted a course toward the next likely appearance of the caretaker's displacement wave, offering his vessel as bait. his ploy almost succeeded, but the caretaker was more powerful than he anticipated. his crew was taken captive. a few days later, voyager arrived and facilitated their escape. chakotay seized that opportunity to make one last attempt to gain control of the array, but then you gave the order to destroy it."
"circumstantial evidence, not proof."
who carried out your order to destroy the array?
tuvok.
using what type of technology?
tricobalt devices.
"he set the yield to twenty thousand teracochranes. it was enough to tear an opening in subspace. a cloaked ship locked on to one of the reactors, protecting it from the blast and hiding it from voyager's sensors. the reactor was retrieved and carried by a series of vessels until it was delivered to mister tash, who was well compensated by chakotay to build the catapult. he was waiting here for voyager so chakotay could complete the mission he was forced to abandon five years ago."
i'd be willing to consider this theory of yours if i didn't know chakotay as well as i do. there is no one on this ship i trust more. what you've done here is build what we call a house of cards.
"stardate 48658. commander seska is revealed to be a cardassian spy. she defects to the kazon and impregnates herself with chakotay's dna. was he unaware of the procedure, as he claims, or were they working together, to create a new kazon sect to capture voyager? stardate 49522. chakotay recommends establishing trade relations with the kolhari. their technology uses tetryon power cells. a simple diplomatic overture, or was he seeking a source of energy for the catapult? stardate 49571"
seven.
naomi wildman.
where are you going?
that's not your concern.
what's wrong?
your father was ktarian.
so?
"the ktarians were officially with the federation, but they sympathised with the maquis."
what are you talking about?
"who are you working for, chakotay or the captain?"
seven?
tell them it's too late. go!
i picked up a power surge coming from the cargo bay.
i detected the same thing. you think it's the enhanced alcove.
could be.
let's take a look. are phasers standard equipment on board now?
must be.
the data buffer's been activated.
i wanted to make sure it wasn't malfunctioning.
you should be careful. somebody might think you were trying to delete a few files.
why would they think that?
some of those files could contain sensitive information.
"if that's true, somebody might think you were trying to do the same thing."
"that catapult out there, it's a powerful piece of technology. if the maquis ever had access to something like it, they might have been successful."
"and if we had, your mission to the delta quadrant never would have gotten off the drawing board."
what are you talking about?
the mission you've been on for the last five years.
my only mission is trying to get voyager home.
seven showed me the sensor records. i saw the tractor beam.
"she showed me the same thing, but she implicated you in some kind of maquis plot."
"same evidence, two different theories."
it all started with those damn photonic fleas. she was downloading voyager's database.

"go ahead, harry."
i just picked up an unauthorised launch of the delta flyer. seven's at the helm.

i'm going with you.
no. i have a better chance of getting through to her alone.
"this isn't part of your mission, is it?"
is it part of yours?
good luck.
energise.
captain.
you came here hoping to stop me. you'll fail.
turn this ship around. that's an order.
your orders are irrelevant. i'm no longer under your command. you deceived me.
there is no conspiracy. there is no maquis rebellion. the federation isn't planning to invade the delta quadrant.
"i realised that, because i finally uncovered your true objective."
and what's that?
"me. stardate 32611, the federation sends my parents to study the borg collective. they know my family will be assimilated. that was their intention. stardate 48317, voyager is sent to the delta quadrant with orders to retrieve me. when they reach borg space, captain janeway negotiates an alliance with the collective in exchange for information regarding species 8472. they agree to give her seven of nine. stardate 51030, janeway extracts the implants from my body to remove any knowledge i have of her agreement with the borg. stardate 53329, captain janeway finalises plans to use the catapult to deliver seven of nine to the alpha quadrant, where starfleet will dissect and analyse the drone to gather tactical data to fight the borg. i won't allow you to complete your mission. if necessary i'll destroy the catapult, and myself."
"you're right, seven. there is a conspiracy here. but i believe it's a conspiracy of one. i've got a theory of my own. your modified alcove threw your synaptic patterns into chaos and your mind can't make sense of all the information, so you're generating theory after theory in an attempt to bring order to that chaos."
your reasoning is flawed. my alcove is functioning perfectly.
"what about you? you're not a drone anymore. you can't always predict how borg technology will affect you. you should be in sickbay, not behind that forcefield. let me help you."
no. i don't believe you.
"of course you don't. anything i say gets woven into your paranoid conspiracies. but you should believe me, seven, because i've never lied to you, and i'm not lying to you now. you have to put your doubts aside and trust me. stardate 51030, seven of nine is severed from the hive mind. the captain tells her not to resist, that she'll learn to accept her humanity. seven complies, and slowly begins to embrace her individuality. does she regret that decision? stardate 51652, the captain encourages seven to develop her social skills. seven insists it's a waste of time, but after further requests she pursues it, and begins to develop her first human friendships. did janeway lead her astray? stardate 52840, the captain orders seven to study her parents' journals. seven claims they're irrelevant, but eventually she reads them and rediscovers part of her own past. stardate 52841, for the first time, seven tells the captain thank you."
"it was stardate 52842, oh six hundred hours in the mess hall. we had just finished breakfast."
"my mistake. stardate today, janeway beams aboard the delta flyer. she reminds seven of the bond that's grown between them. seven lowers the forcefield and she decides to come home. all i'm asking is that you trust me again."
delta flyer to voyager. two to beam out.
guess who assimilated three books and ten reports in two days?
naomi wildman.
that's correct. are you taking your new alcove apart?
yes.
why?
my attempt to download voyager's database failed.
maybe you can fix it.
"the alcove functioned within expected parameters. unfortunately, i did not. three books and ten reports is impressive, but quantity is less relevant than quality. you must be able to interpret the data and enjoy the process. regardless, you require activities other than assimilating books and reports. a game of kadis-kot, for example."
when?
go to the mess hall and set up the board. i'll join you when i'm finished.
"i heard the strangest rumour today. apparently, the captain and first officer almost came to blows."
mutiny?
first officer walked the plank. so i heard.
i don't believe a word of it.
me neither.
seven was malfunctioning. we don't have that excuse.
you're right. we've been through too much to stop trusting each other.
"you didn't poison the coffee, did you?"
not any more than i usually do.
"just a minute. i'll, i'll be right there."
"i'm coming, i'm coming. deanna."
"hello, reg."
i'm so glad you could make it. it's wonderful to see you.
would it be all right if i came inside?
"yeah, of course, of course. come in, come in. is there something i can get you? some er, some coffee, tea? oh wait a minute, don't, don't tell me. chocolate ice cream."
"you know me too well. but just one scoop, i'm watching my figure."
"why? you, you look lovely."
you always knew how to flatter me. would you like me to get it?
get? get what?
the ice cream.
"right, right, the ice cream. no, no, no, no. come in, come in. sit down, make yourself comfortable."
it's a nice place.
thanks. one scoop of chocolate ice cream.
did you just move in?
"no, no, i've been here, er, almost two years. i just haven't had a chance to unpack."
is everything all right reg?
"of course, why, why wouldn't it be?"
"to be honest, you seem a little on edge."
"do i? oh, it's just that i'm, i'm excited to see you."
"i'm excited to see you, too. i think geordi's a little disappointed i didn't invite him to come along."
"yes, well, i, i was hoping to get, get together with him too, er, before the enterprise leaves orbit, but i just wanted to spend time with you first. that's all right, isn't it?"
of course it is. i hear you've been working on the pathfinder project.
"well, i, i was. er, i'm not anymore."
what happened?
"oh, ah, nothing, really. just got to be a lot of, er, pressure."
"well, hello."
"neelix! he's not used to company. it's not polite to eat our guest's food. if you're hungry, just say so. deanna, neelix."
"neelix. that's an unusual name. maybe we should introduce him to data's cat, spot. i have a feeling you didn't ask me here to reminisce. tell me what's wrong."
"i've lost myself, deanna."
lost yourself?
in voyager. i've become obsessed with voyager. here you are on shore leave and what do i do? i lure you into a counselling session.
"don't worry about that. the important thing is, i'm here now and i want to help."
thank you.
"now, start at the beginning."
has it ever occurred to you that a tachyon beam directed at a class b itinerant pulsar could produce enough gravimetric energy to create an artificial singularity?
i can't say it has.
it occurred to me. but my supervisors thought it was an abuse of midas.
midas?
the mutara interdimensional deep space transponder array.
"reg, you're losing me."
i'm sorry.
the beginning?
"the beginning. right. well, i suppose it all started in the holodeck. doesn't it always?"
go on.
"well i, i was running a few simulations."
"computer, boost the gain on voyager's transceiver by twenty percent."
transceiver gain is at maximum.
apply a narrowband filter to the signal processor.
filter engaged.
"voyager, come in. come in, voyager. voyager, come in, this is starfleet command. voyager, come in, voyager."
"good, good, good. now lower the filter band by point three kilohertz."
"reg, what are you doing?"
"oh, ah, er, pete. i, i, i was just, er."
"yes, running another simulation. i can see that. what about the transmitter diagnostics?"
right. the diagnostics.
"you have finished them, haven't you?"
"er, almost."
almost isn't good enough. we've got admiral paris first thing in the morning.
admiral paris.
don't tell me you forgot.
"oh, no, of, of, of course not. i, i, i just got the days mixed up."
reg.
"computer, end programme. now that i think about it, it's a good thing that admiral paris is coming tomorrow. we can brief the admiral on my theory."
what theory?
"i've been going over the interstellar phenomena forecasts from deep space nine. they are predicting er, a class b itinerant pulsar will pass within four billion kilometers of the midas array in three days."
you think the pulsar might damage the array?
"no, no. the shields will hold. actually i was thinking, we could use the pulsar to our own advantage."
how?
"suppose, suppose we instructed the array to direct a tachyon beam at the pulsar. theoretically, we could produce a gravimetric surge powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole. we could establish two way communication with voyager."
"reg, you're dreaming again."
"no, no, i really think this could work. based on my simulations that"
"based on your last series of simulations, we wasted six months trying to develop that transwarp probe."
"this, this is different. this"
"reg, i really appreciate your imagination. it's what makes you such a valuable part of this team. but i'm not about to tell the admiral that we've found a way for him to chat with his son because of some cock-eyed theory that only exists up here. now please, finish those diagnostics."
"yes, sir."
"and, reg, remember, while the admiral's here, i do the talking."
you do the talking. understood.
"pete was only trying to look out for me, but i was sure my plan would work. i just couldn't give it up."
burning the midnight oil?
"i, i finished, er, the diagnostics, sir."
"yes. i know. i looked them over. good job. now, why don't you call it a day?"
"i just, er, have a few more things to take care of."
"well, see you tomorrow, then. oh,. reg, why don't, why don't you drop by tonight when you're through here?"
drop by?
"come to the house. have some coffee. angie's sister's in from boston. i, er i think she might like you."
"i, i don't, i don't think i can er. i'm spending the evening with, er, neelix."
"correct me if i'm wrong, reg, but neelix is your cat. well, if you change your mind."
thanks. i'll try.
"but i couldn't leave. not until i'd strengthened my case for accessing the midas array. the meeting with admiral paris was only fourteen hours away and i hadn't come up with anything. poring over the data wasn't helping. i decided what i needed was, er, a little inspiration."
computer. activate hologrid mess hall scenario barclay eleven gamma.
"hey, reg."
warning. the shark is circling.
let the games begin.
"what'll it be, reg?"
the usual.
"computer, one milk, warm."
"oh thanks, harry."
just trying to get on your good side so you'll go easy on me tonight.
you know what i always say.  if you can't stand the heat.
get out of the warp core.
"sit down, lieutenant, and give us mortals a chance to get even. that's an order."
"if you insist, commander, but i think it's only fair to warn you i have no intention of letting my winning streak come to an end. now, where's er, tuvok?"
he said it's illogical to continue losing to a clearly superior player.
"oh, that's too bad. i love to watch that vulcan squirm now, you all know the rules. deuces, one eyed jacks and suicide kings are wild. five of a kind beats a straight flush every time."
the man is ruthless.
he's a killer.
"now, come on, guys. you know it hurts me to see you lose. after all, you are my best friends."
"i hoped that the poker game would help calm my nerves, so that i could get a decent night's sleep before the briefing. but when i got home that night i couldn't keep my mind off voyager. i needed to get back to the holodeck."
that feels so good.
"therapeutic massage can be an effective treatment for insomnia, lieutenant, but we need to get to the cause of your sleeplessness if we're going to find a more permanent solution."
"it's just that every time i close my eyes, my mind starts to race."
can you be more specific?
"well, i worry about the project. have i explored the problem from every angle, or is there something else i should be trying? am i doing enough?"
hmm. acute work related anxiety. perhaps i should speak to the captain about reducing your schedule.
something tells me she's not going to be able to help.
"you are an invaluable member of this crew, mister barclay."
"thank you, doctor. it's nice to be appreciated."
"turning in, reg?"
"yes, sir."
"hey, reg."
"for some reason, i never slept in my apartment as comfortably as i did in my holographic quarters. i suppose i felt more at home on voyager."
"good morning, everyone."
"morning, reg."
you're awfully chipper.
slept like a baby.
then maybe you've got the energy to whip up one of your famous cheese omelettes.
"oh, yeah. i'm starved."
"i'm sorry, guys, i have a very important briefing at oh nine hundred. just have time for coffee."
"er, don't forget about tonight."
remind me.
you were supposed to teach me how to play velocity.
"no, no way. reg and i have a hoverball game scheduled."
don't fight. plenty of me to go around.
"reg, i'm sorry to bother you again, but i'm still having trouble with the warp core recalibration."
"it's no problem. i'll stop by engineering later, talk you through."
thank you. i really appreciate it.
"velocity, hoverball, warp core recalibrations? reg, i don't know how you do it."
let you in on a little secret. there's two of me.
"the delta quadrant, sector 41751, grid nine. voyager's doctor reported this as the ship's position when his programme was briefly transferred to starfleet two years ago. assuming they're still on course for earth, we've been able to extrapolate a range of likely trajectories. estimating an average warp speed of six point two, and accounting for various astronomical obstacles, we can reasonably assume that voyager is now in one of these three sectors."
can we contact them?
"as you know, we've been working with the vulcans on the deployment of the midas array. though we're still in the testing phase, we think it won't be long before we can use this technology to send signals at hyper-subspace speeds. a message that would normally take years to reach its destination could be received by voyager in a matter of days."
impressive. will they be able to respond?
"no sir, but at least they'll know we're still looking for them. we'll send data on the hyper-subspace technology and hope they can eventually use it to return the call."
"excuse me, admiral paris."
lieutenant barclay.
"i'm sorry, commander, it's just that there may be a way to establish, er, two-way communication with voyager."
now is not the time.
"it's all right, mister harkins, let the man speak. i'm all ears, son."
"well, er, you see, there's a, er, class b itinerant, er, pulsar, er, and we well, as you probably know, sir, sir, neutrino emissions, ah. oh, what i mean to say is that with the array, we could open an artificial er, s, a sing, singularity."
a wormhole?
"yes, yes, sir. we could use it as a conduit to to talk to voyager."
"i can't give you high marks for clarity, lieutenant, but you've certainly got my attention. is there any merit to what he's saying?"
"mister barclay has a tendency to get ahead of himself, sir. unfortunately, what he's suggesting is beyond our abilities."
but you haven't even
mister barclay.
"i know that i haven't explained myself very well, but with all due respect, sir, what do we have to lose by trying? i think we're forgetting that there are a hundred and fifty people stranded in the delta quadrant."
"i have a son on that ship, lieutenant. i haven't forgotten that fact for a single moment."
"i'm sorry, sir. i, i didn't, er i didn't mean to."
"take the rest of the day off, reg."
but
that was not a suggestion.
how did you deal with your feelings afterwards?
what do you mean?
"well, did you talk to commander harkins after the meeting? apologise?"
"well, no. i wanted to, er, fine tune my plan, so, i er, just went right back to work."
be more specific. what exactly did you do?
"well, i needed someone to, er bounce ideas off of. someone to help focus my thoughts."
sounds reasonable. i suppose you consulted with some of your pathfinder colleagues.
"well, not exactly."
"you went back to the holodeck, didn't you?"
they're the only people that i can talk to.
they're not people.
"i know, but they, they help me with my work."
poker? massages? sleeping in holographic quarters? sounds more like escape than work.
i can't concentrate if i'm not relaxed.
can't you relax with your friends?
friends?
commander harkins invited you to his home. you went to the holodeck instead.
"it's not what you're thinking, deanna. this isn't a relapse of my holo-addiction."
okay. tell me how the holograms helped you with your work.
"well, i talked to them about my ideas. i worked out technical problems."
"i need specifics here, people."
"take us through it again, mister barclay, one step at a time. maybe it'll spark an idea."
we've got our itinerant pulsar. we've got our interdimensional transponder array. how do we get our wormhole?
this one could keep us up all night.
"we know we can produce gravimetric energy, but, can we do it at levels high enough to create the singularity?"
we're talking about a massive subspace reaction.
maybe that's the problem.
reg?
maybe we need to think smaller.
you're losing me.
"and how much bandwidth do we really need? the average wormhole is huge, but if we compressed the datastream."
we wouldn't need a conduit anywhere near as big.
what's your idea?
a micro-wormhole.
impressive.
"you've outdone yourself this time, reg."
"i'll still need, er, help with the details."
put together a team. use whatever resources you need.
a power ratio of approximately sixty terawatts should do the trick.
you think that's enough?
"should be, but then we have to compensate for gravimetric interference."
and how do we do that?
"i was thinking, what if we applied a narrowband filter to the transponder signal?"
barclay strikes again.
what's going on here?
commander.
"who's your friend, reg?"
"yes, aren't you going to introduce me?"
"computer, delete characters."
i thought i told you to go home.
"i was, er, working."
you call this work? you've created holograms of the voyager crew.
"oh, it, it, it, it's not what you think. it's an interactive, er, diagnostic programme. i designed it to help me solve problems."
how long have you been in here?
since the briefing.
the briefing ended ten hours ago.
"i, i know that i embarrassed you in front of the admiral, and i'm, i'm sorry. i wanted to refine my idea so that i could present you with a specific plan. and i've done that, pete. you were right about the wormhole idea being too expansive. so i've, i've scaled it back."
"all the extra time you've been putting in. if i checked the holo-logs, would i find you've been spending those hours in here?"
"well, not, not all that time."
how much of it?
"maybe, er, twenty or thirty hours a week."
don't you think that's a little excessive?
not if it helps us contact voyager.
before i brought you onto my team i reviewed your file. you've struggled with holo-addiction before. from where i stand it looks like you've had a relapse.
i know it it may look that way.
i think you need counselling.
what i need is for you to pay attention to my ideas.
i should have been paying more attention to your behaviour. i thought i was being a friend by giving you some leeway. i didn't realise how involved you've become with voyager.
is it really so wrong? do you have any idea what it must be like for them to be stranded sixty thousand light years from home? do you have any idea how lonely that must be?
"i'm sorry, reg, but until you get some help, you're off the project."
"you, you can't do that."
you've given me no choice. this hologrid and the lab are officially off limits. now go home.
i won't leave. not until you've heard what i have to say.
reg! don't make me call security.
"what is it, nicole?"
he's still here.
you told him i have a meeting scheduled at fifteen hundred?
"yes, sir. he won't go away."
send him in.
"yes, sir."
"admiral, er, thank you, thank you for seeing me."
"you're frightening my secretary, mister barclay. you have five minutes."
five minutes. right.
sit down.
"er, first, first i, i want to apologise for speaking out of turn yesterday. it's, it's only because i, i, i care so much about voyager."
"yes, commander harkins has informed me about your attachment to the crew. i understand you've been spending time with a holographic re-creation of my son, among others. frankly, i find that rather disturbing."
"well, i understand how, how you could see it that way but, er, that does not negate the fact that i have a plan for communicating with voyager."
commander harkins doesn't seem to think your plan is viable.
"i have refined the idea. i've simplified it. all i'm asking for is a chance to try. and if i'm right, it could mean a chance to talk to tom."
"in my opinion, commander harkins removed you from the project with good cause, and that's his prerogative. i won't let my personal feelings interfere with starfleet procedure."
"i, i've broken protocol and i should be punished, but the crew of the voyager shouldn't be, and neither, neither should you. i just need access to the lab for one more day. after that, if i er, if i'm wrong, i'll resign my commission."
"i'll order a review of your findings. if it's concluded your ideas are valid, i'll instruct commander harkins to pursue it."
but i'm the one who knows the
"that's the best i can do, mister barclay. good day."
so the meeting went well?
"no, no, no. it didn't, not at all."
the admiral said he'd review your findings.
"don't you see? he was just trying to get rid of me, just like harkins."
try to relax.
now you understand why i need your help.
"yes, i do."
"you, you have to call the admiral in your official capacity as a starfleet counsellor and tell him that i am psychologically fit to return to work."
i can't do that.
why not?
"look at yourself. you're experiencing acute anxiety, sleeplessness, paranoia. you did what you could. now it's time to let starfleet worry about voyager. we need to take care of you."
there is nothing wrong with me!
you said yourself you've become obsessed with voyager.
"what if i have? if an obsession helps me to do my job better, it's a sacrifice i am willing to make. a little instability in exchange for contact with a stranded starship. isn't voyager more important than my psychological condition?"
"voyager is important, but so are you."
"that ship, that crew, they're all i have."
tell me why that is.
"ever, ever since i, i left the enterprise, things haven't, haven't been the same. it's as if i lost my family."
so you created a new family on the holodeck. only they're not real.
"i didn't know how else, how else to cope."
"do you remember when you first came aboard the enterprise? you had trouble fitting in, didn't you? but after a while you started to make friends. you can learn to do the same thing here on earth."
"oh, i, i don't know how."
we'll work on it together.
you're scheduled to depart tomorrow.
i've decided to ask captain picard for a temporary leave of absence. to spend some time with an old friend.
"oh, deanna, you, you, you don't, you don't have to do that."
try and stop me.
"i'm sorry, neelix. i have to leave. no, no, you can't talk me out of it."

"computer, disengage primary coolant system."
are you crazy? that'll cause a warp core breach.
exactly.
"mister barclay, i want an explanation for what's going on aboard my ship."

i'm ready for my lesson.
i've concluded that teaching you to sing is an inefficient use of my time.
"but i, i've been, i've been practicing."
"in your case, practice is irrelevant. your vocal chords are incapable of producing basic diatonic tones, not to mention your rhythmic shortcomings."
i sound so good in the sonic shower.
perhaps you should confine your efforts to that location. astrometrics to the bridge.
"go ahead, seven."
i've detected what appears to be a micro-wormhole at coordinates one nine four point six by three five.
a micro-wormhole.
"i believe a message is being transmitted through it, on a starfleet emergency channel."
"let's hear it, harry."
"starfleet command to uss voyager. come in, voyager."
try applying a narrowband filter to the signal processor.
do you hear me? this is lieutenant reginald barclay.
"that's it. whoever this barclay is, he stopped transmitting."
the micro-wormhole is collapsing at a rate of point two percent per second.
that doesn't give us much time.
to do what?
to send a message back through and hope mister barclay is listening.
it should have worked. i don't understand why it didn't.
there you are. i've reviewed mister barclay's plan. i think it's worth an attempt.
"he's already tried, sir, without your authorisation. it didn't work."
i'm sorry to hear that.
"so am i, sir. i appreciate your confidence in me, but i, i don't deserve it."
"what would you like me to do with him, admiral? he broke into the lab, accessed the midas array and resisted arrest."
"you've put me in a difficult position, son. i was hoping that we'd be able to"
we're receiving a transmission.
from where?
coordinates three four three point six by two seven.
the wormhole.
"starfleet command, come in."
voyager.
"reg, give me a hand clearing up the signal."
lower the filter band by point three kilohertz.
this is captain kathryn janeway. do you read me?
i think she's talking to you.
captain.
this is lieutenant reginald barclay at starfleet command.
"it's good to hear your voice, lieutenant. we've been waiting a long time"
for this moment.
"the feeling is mutual. unfortunately, the micro-wormhole is collapsing. we have only a few moments."
"understood. we are transmitting our ship's logs, crew reports and navigational records to you now."
acknowledged. and we're sending you data on some new hyper-subspace technology.
"we're hoping eventually to use it to keep in regular contact, and we're including some"
recommended modifications for your comm. system.
we'll implement them as soon as possible.
there's someone else here who would also like to say something.
this is admiral paris.
"hello, sir."
how are your people holding up?
"very well. they're an exemplary crew, your son included."
"tell him, tell him i miss him."
and i'm proud of him.
"he heard you, admiral."
the wormhole is collapsing.
i want you all to know we're doing everything we can to bring you home.
"we appreciate it, sir. keep a docking bay open for us."
we hope to see you
that's it. they're gone.
"you did it, reg. i'm sorry i doubted you."
"why the long face, mister barclay?"
"because, because it's over, sir."
"no, lieutenant. i'd say that project voyager is just beginning, thanks to you."
anyone know this barclay?
"i took the liberty of reviewing his personnel file. he's had a rather colourful career, not to mention an unusual medical history. he's recovered from a variety of maladies, including transporter phobia and holo-addiction."
"well, whatever his problems, he certainly came through for us."
starfleet should give him a promotion.
i finished analysing the data mister barclay sent. the hyper-subspace technology is promising. i believe we can look forward to future communications with earth.
"well, that calls for a toast."
"care to do the honours, tom?"
"to my dad. it's nice to know he's still there. and to the newest honorary member of the voyager crew, reginald barclay. whoever you are."
"here, here. to mister barclay."
congratulations.
"well, i'm not not sure i deserve congratulations."
why not? it's quite an accomplishment.
"i, i couldn't have done it without your help."
what did commander harkins have to say about it?
"well, i think, i think he was pleased."
why wouldn't he be? you're quite a catch.
"well, not everyone would want a sister-in-law to date someone with my history."
it's a new era. so tell me all about the lucky lady. i want details.
"well, her name is hope."
you're kidding.
"no and, and, and she loves cats."
"good morning, tom."
"good morning, grace."
"so, where you heading?"
sullivan's. care to join me?
"ah, i wish i could, but there's a bit of a problem."
"oh, really?"
"well, you see, tommy-me-boy, the good lord blessed me with a fine wife. i'll never forget the day i met her. i was on me way to the fair in dooleen, or was it kilkee? there's some fine trout fishing to be had in kilkee this time of year."
who said anything about trout?
"timothy ryan, god rest his soul. he was one for the trout. the poor man's been dead a fortnight. some say he had the croup, but don't you believe it. the widow moore gave him the evil eye."
and your point?
"me wife and i, well, we've hit a bit of a rough patch. a better woman never walked the face of the earth."
she threw you out again.
with nothing but the clothes on me back.
how much?
a shilling or two should suffice.
keep the change.
"god bless you, tommy-me-boy"
"harry, weren't you supposed to meet me at sullivan's?"
"sorry. i got distracted by the, er, scenery. this is maggie."
we've met. could you excuse us?
"charmed to have met you, harry."
charmed. what's the hurry?
a word to the wise. stay away from maggie o'halloran. she's promised to a pig farmer with a very large rake.
does she have a sister?
wooden teeth.
nothing an adjustment to the holomatrix wouldn't fix.
"no, no. i'm not changing a thing. fair haven is perfect just the way it is."
"tommy boy, you forgot the leprechauns."
"no. no leprechauns, no aliens, no starships. i want this to be a place where the crew can unwind."
"morning, lads."
ah. heard any good confessions lately?
"doctor-patient confidentiality, mister paris."
harry hasn't seen sullivan's yet. you care to join us?
don't mind if i do. i'll need to leave no later than thirteen hundred hours.
medical emergency?
not exactly. i'm working on my homily for sunday's mass and i expect both you sinners to be in attendance.
"he's kidding, right?"
you wanted authenticity.
"everybody, place your bets."
three bob on liam.
three bob it is.
five shillings on liam.
you're going to hurt harry's feelings.
very well. two shillings on mister kim and i'll pray for a miracle.
"excuse me, father, but i'm needing a bit of counsel."
i'm off duty right now.
but i've broken the fifth commandment again.
say ten our fathers and call me in the morning.
gentlemen.
"come on, come on mister kim, show him what for. you can do it!"
what'll it be?
i'm looking for some friends of mine.
we're all friends here.
"well, then, have you seen tom paris?"
"he's right over there, with young harry. poor sod. i'm afraid no one's whipped liam in three years."
there's a first time for everything.
"an optimist, are you?"
a realist.
"come on, ensign, try. try!"
"come on, me boy. push! push!"
i'm trying!
come on. try harder.
you got him. you got him.
you're losing.
"what in god's name? come on, liam. push!"
yes! yes!
"i knew you could do it, ensign."
so this is the programme i've been hearing so much about.
"welcome, weary traveller."
"you have outdone yourself this time. everything is authentic, except for one tiny detail."
oh?
the harp on the sign. it's backwards.
"oh, everybody's a critic."
"as i recall, the captain is quite an aficionado of irish history."
"i hate to break up the party, but we have some business to attend to. there's a neutronic wavefront approaching. class nine."
class nine?
"sorry, boys. duty calls."
"ah, wavefront? now, what in the name of god is that?"
"er, a wee bit of bad weather."
oh.
borg classification three four seven nine two. particle density anomaly.
where'd it come from?
"i believe it was formed by the collision of two neutron stars. the wavefront is travelling at a velocity of two hundred thousand kilometres per second, and it extends for three point six light years."
how long before it hits?
approximately fifteen hours.
we're already feeling its effects. the neutron radiation is disrupting plasma flow. we can't jump to warp.
impulse power won't be enough to outrun that thing.
then we'll have to ride it out. we'll generate an inverse warp field and drop anchor. that should protect us from the turbulence.
what about the radiation? it'll only get worse.
"have the doctor prepare inoculations for the crew. go to yellow alert. tom, b'elanna, get started on converting the warp core."
"yes, ma'am."
let's batten down the hatches.
captain.
just burning the midnight oil.
midnight's come and gone.
then it's time for a break.
do you mind?
i could use the company. this approaching wavefront is bringing back some unpleasant memories.
how so?
you know i grew up on a farm in indiana. we used to have some terrible thunderstorms during the summer months. at the first bolt of lightning i'd bolt under the bed.
"we had some pretty nasty weather on talax, too. i always enjoyed a good ion storm."
give me clear skies any day.
"now that you bring it up, i am concerned with keeping up morale over the next few days. the crew is not used to sitting still."
suggestions?
everyone seems to love fair haven. i was thinking we might initiate an open door protocol on the holodeck. keep the programme running twenty four hours a day. let people come and go as they please.
permission granted. fair haven's just become our port in the storm.
"i'm heading down there myself, if you'd like to join me. there's a charming little inn called the ox and lamb. the owner offered to share some of his recipes."
"no, thanks. i still have work to do."
okay.
what'll it be?
a cup of tea would be nice.
i just made one. cream?
please.
"so, what brings you to fair haven, miss?"
kathryn. i'm just passing through on my way home.
how long have you been on the road?
"five years, almost six."
you must be homesick.
no. sometimes. thank you.
cead mile failte.
translation?
a hundred thousand welcomes. it's an old irish saying. we're all friends here.
i had an aunt who used to have a saying like that. a stranger is a friend you just haven't met yet.
definitely irish.
"she had an irish temper, too. she and my uncle had a place not far from here, in county clare."
"ah. then you're closer to home than you think, katie o'clare."
"you know, it's later than i thought and i've kept you long enough."
"oh no, stay awhile. didn't your auntie teach you that it's impolite to leave without playing a game of rings?"
"i really can't, but thanks for the tea."
afraid you'd lose?
i rarely lose.
prove it.
one game.
i'll set them up.
another ringer.
and i'm not surprised. you stepped over the beer stain.
i did not.
"you did too, by half a boot, and then you moved back, hoping i wouldn't notice."
"these boots are half a size too large, so in reality my toes never crossed the line. your turn."
for luck.
getting sweet with the rings isn't going to help you.
we'll see. damn.
"devil won't help you, either."
"well, maybe rings aren't my forte after all. would you care to arm wrestle?"
"that's not a woman's game, katie. you could get hurt."
i'm stronger than i look.
ah! that's quite a grip you have.
not bad yourself.
i couldn't help but notice that you have your leg braced against the bar.
"well, how else do you expect me to win?"
will we call it a draw?
sounds good to me.
shall we run a foot race down to the station and back? it's good to make a new friend. you have a nice way about you.
flattery's the food of fools.
another pearl of wisdom from your auntie?
"no, jonathan swift"
swift? never heard of him.
he was an author.
i was never one for reading.
that's too bad. some of the greatest writers in the world are irish.
"well, they say that doctor gilroy has a library of books and, well, next time i see him i'll ask him can i borrow one or two?"
good morning.
"good morning. oh, my god, will you look at the time? frannie, come here. there's someone i want you to meet. katie o'clare, this is my wife, frances."
pleased to meet you.
i hope michael hasn't been bending your ear all night long.
"my ear, my elbow."
we were arm wrestling.
such a gentleman.
thank you very much for your hospitality and now i really must be leaving.
"and, er, drop in again before you leave town."
i will.
if you experience any dizziness report to sickbay immediately.
thank you.
"good morning, gentlemen."
i believe it's afternoon. oversleep?
holodeck.
fair haven?
welcome weary traveller.
even i have to admit mister paris's latest effort is quite a tour de force.
"ooh, high praise from a hologram."
"oh, i was thinking, captain now that we've got this open door policy, maybe i could expand fair haven into holodeck two. it would give me some room to create the seacoast."
by all means.
"speaking of revisions, i was hoping i could give my character a more active role. in the period you've created, the village priest was the most prominent member of the community, held in the highest regard."
"that's a great idea, doc. we could send father mulligan on a retreat to a nearby monastery, where he takes a vow of silence and never speaks again."
"try it, and you'll be saying hail marys till saint patrick's day."
time?
thirty seconds
let's see it.
"all hands, this is the captain. secure your stations and brace for impact."
we've cleared the leading edge. turbulence is decreasing. shields are holding.
damage?
"we've got a ruptured plasma conduit, deck nine."
send a repair team. maintain yellow alert. let's hope that was the worst of it.
"computer, display fair haven character michael sullivan. adjust his parameters to the following specifications. give him the education of a nineteenth century third year student at trinity college."
modification complete.
"now, access the character's interactive subroutines. make him more provocative."
specify.
give him a more complicated personality.
specify.
"more outspoken, more confident, not so reserved. and make him more curious about the world around him."
modification complete.
"good. now, increase the character's height by three centimetres. remove the facial hair. no, no, i don't like that. put some back. about two days' growth. better. oh, one more thing. access his interpersonal subroutines. familial characters. delete the wife."
modification complete.
"pleased to meet you, mister sullivan."
"are you ill, commander?"
i am experiencing a slight loss of equilibrium and some gastrointestinal distress.
space sickness?
unlikely. i am not prone to that condition.
perhaps you should go to sickbay.
i'll be fine.
"i'm telling you, we should add more fog."
fog is depressing.
it's authentic.
it's dangerous.
"all right, we could add a lighthouse."
"it's fair haven, harry. sunshine?"
"tuvok, what do you think? irish sea coast, fog or no fog?"
i have no opinion.
he hasn't visited our little paradise yet.
nor do i intend to.
"i think you'd like it, commander. it's a great place to meditate."
"imagine yourself sitting high on a bluff overlooking the ocean. the salt air, the rhythm of the waves rising and crashing against the rocks. a tiny fishing boat bobbing on the water below. up and down, up and down."
"i get the idea, ensign. thank you."
"mutton, creamed cabbage or blood pudding?"
explain.
"i'm preparing a traditional irish meal at the ox and lamb this afternoon, and i can not decide on a main course."
blood pudding. you can't lose.
"that was my first choice, too, but replicating the lamb's intestines, it, it could be tricky, and every time i try to heat the blood, it coagulates in the milk."
"if you'll excuse me, i think i will consult the doctor."
"excuse me, ma'am. have you seen michael sullivan?"
"oh, you might try the pub."
i just came from there.
"oh, then he'll be at the train station."
yeah.
thank you.
sure.
"excuse me, sir. is the train to galway running on time?"
"um, i'm afraid you've just missed it. have a seat, wait for the next one. do you know jane eldon?"
"eldon? no, i've never met her."
"i'd be terrified if you had. she's been dead seventy years. no, i was er, i was thinking about her poetry. it's too pastoral for my taste, don't you agree?"
i'm not familiar with her work.
"really? well, what about sean gogarty? they have similar rhyming schemes."
"you've some catching up to do. well, i'm here every afternoon. you should join me sometime. i tried talking poetry with seamus, but all he can do is recite limericks."
"i'd love to. strange place to read, though."
not at all. i love the sound of the trains coming and going. it gets me thinking about places i'd like to visit. have you travelled much yourself?
as a matter of fact. but there's one place i haven't been yet. castle o'dell.
it's a steep climb but from the top of the battlement you can see all the way to dublin. we'd better be moving.
they say when the sun goes down the king of the faeries reclaims the castle.
maybe he'll invite us to supper.
"eh, you'll be dining alone without me. one taste of the faeries' banquet and you'll never return to this world."
"oh, don't tell me you believe those stories."
"believe? no. but i do respect them. can i ask you something, katie?"
please.
have you a man waiting for you at home?
no.
are you looking for one?
why? do you have somebody?
in fair haven? not unless you fancy a pig farmer.
"oh, not my type."
what about a barkeeper who reads poetry in strange places?
captain? i thought that was you.
just getting in the spirit.
i can see that. i don't believe we've met.
sullivan. michael sullivan.
chakotay.
that's a fine tattoo. are you off a ship?
you could say that.
we're on the way up to the old castle. you're welcome to come with us.
"thanks, but, er, i'm meeting neelix at the ox and lamb. you two have fun."
"is it my imagination, or did he call you captain?"
did he?
looks like the worst is yet to come.
commander?
i just came from astrometrics. seven's found an increase in the neutronic gradient at the trailing edge of the wavefront. it's going to be a rough ride when it hits.
we've still got two days. start working on a new shield modulation.
"yes, ma'am."
that could explain my recent space sickness. vulcan physiology is highly sensitive to neutronic gradients.
"you'd make a good barometer, tuvok. every time you get queasy, we go to red alert."
"thanks for your report, commander."
"don't mention it. hills most green, hearts unseen."
yes. jane eldon. catching up on a little reading.
those hills and hearts wouldn't happen to be in ireland?
you can wipe that smirk off your face. it's not what you think.
"i wasn't thinking anything, but now that you mentioned it"
i have an interest in irish culture.
it's understandable. they've produced great writers for hundreds of years. not to mention great bartenders.
he's a hologram.
i couldn't help but notice he seemed a little taller than the last time i saw him.
"yes, i made a few modifications."
in the interest of irish culture.
exactly.
you seemed embarrassed when i ran into you. there was no reason to be. it was nice to see you having a little fun.
"he is rather charming, isn't he? too bad he's made of photons and forcefields."
i never let that stand in my way.
the boys are getting tired.
"them, or you?"
"faster, boys."
"computer, remove all characters except for michael sullivan."
"can i ask you something, katie?"
please.
would you mind if i kissed you?
i might even kiss you back.
"there's no point in waiting any longer, is there?"
"oh, i think i've waited long enough."
is there something wrong?
no.
"computer, recycle."
come in.
i thought you'd like to know we've organised a rings tournament tonight at sullivan's.
"thanks, neelix, but i have work to do."
"the doctor's going to sing something called danny boy, and mossie donegan's promised to bring his talking pig."
"well, let's just say i'd rather stick to reality right now."
"nineteen hundred hours, if you change your mind."
thank you.
saints preserve us.
i possess superior hand-eye coordination.
that's not all that's superior. the lily and the rose are staging a competition in your face.
clarify.
"the fullness of your lips and the paleness of your cheeks, it's enough to make a man faint."
"then in that case, perhaps we should sit down."
i don't believe it.
"it's called old-world charm, harry."
"what'll it be, gentlemen?"
nothing for me. temperance is a virtue.
where's michael?
over there.
that's strange. i programmed him not to drink.
must be a glitch in his subroutine.
are these seats taken?
sit anywhere you like.
vile. it's been fifteen years since i touched the stuff.
you making up for lost time?
i was hoping it might ease the pain.
are you in discomfort?
"agony's more like it. how could you do this to me, lord? why don't you ask him? you've got his ear, don't you?"
well
three days. the happiest three days of my life. i was a fool to think she felt the same. i was such a fool!
"aw, sit down, sullivan."
"shut your mouth, man, or i'll shut it for you."
"oh, you will, will you?"
"hey, hey. take it easy. why don't you tell us what happened?"
"we, we spent a perfect day together by the lake. i drifted off to sleep and when i woke up, she was gone. where is she, tom?"
who?
"katie o'clare, who else?"
katie o'clare?
your friend.
"are you sure you didn't misinterpret her interests? i mean, we're all friends here. maybe she was just being friendly."
are you calling me a liar?
"no, no, not at all."
i thought katie and me were in love.
i may have to do some reprogramming.
what's the matter? you don't think i'm good enough for her?
"no, i, i didn't say that."
"well, tell me where she's gone."
i don't know.
"well, i think you do."
"gentlemen, please! love thy neighbour."
"let's see, i remember trying to reach the holodeck controls, then, er, somebody grabbed my leg."
maybe it was the talking pig.
"if it was, he had one hell of a left hook."
what's all this?
i'm afraid there's been some trouble in paradise. an altercation in the pub this afternoon. several crewmen were injured. nothing serious.
"arm wrestling get out of hand, boys?"
not exactly.
"it was michael sullivan, captain. he was  looking for someone."
why don't we take a little walk?
let me guess. that someone is me.
"i don't mean to pry, captain, but we've got a broken-hearted hologram who believed that the two of you were in love."
"oh, i was sure he'd be on to the next lass by now. i hope he's all right."
"far from it. the fight spilled out onto the street. before long, he'd climbed up a tree and began shouting your name. mister neelix managed to talk him down."
it could be a malfunction in his behavioural subroutines.
"i've already checked that. his subroutines are fine, but i did notice you'd made quite a number of alterations to his programme."
minor improvements.
to make him more appealing?
"you're starting to pry, doctor."
"i apologise for overstepping my bounds but i'm worried about you. michael sullivan is a hologram. his broken heart can be mended with the flick of a switch. your feelings however, are a little more complicated."
"i'm not going to be climbing any trees, if that's what you're worried about."
"if you decide you want to talk, i've been hearing a lot of confessions lately. let me know."
"you want a confession, doctor? all right. i've become romantically involved with a hologram. if that's possible."
tell me what happened.
"well, you know the story. girl meets boy, girl modifies boy's subroutines"
did you have intimate relations?
that's none of your business. let's just say it was a memorable three days.
i don't see the problem.
"don't you? michael sullivan is exactly my type. attractive, intelligent. we share the same interests. and if there's something i don't like, i can simply change it."
i've noticed that humans usually try to change the people they fall in love with. what's the difference?
"in this case, it works. we had a picnic by the lake yesterday afternoon. michael drifted off to sleep. his head was lying on my shoulder and i remember thinking, this is close to perfect. then he began to snore. did i nudge him with my elbow hoping he'd roll over and stop? did i whisper in his ear to wake him? no. why bother? when i could simply access the computer and alter his vocal algorithms? and that's exactly what i was about to do, when i realised that everything around me was an illusion, including him. so i left. i almost wrote him a note to say goodbye. can you believe that, a dear john letter to a hologram?"
"i understand your trepidation, but you're the captain. you can't have a relationship with a member of your crew. they're all your subordinates. so where does that leave you? the occasional dalliance with a passing alien? voyager could be in the delta quadrant for a very long time. a hologram may be the only logical alternative."
he's not real.
"he's as real as i am. photons and forcefields, flesh and blood. it's all the same as long as your feelings are real. he makes a joke, you laugh. is that an illusion? he says something that makes you think. does it matter how his molecules are aligned? did it ever occur to you that it's not just a question of whether or not he's real?"
what do you mean?
"i think you should stop trying to control every aspect of this relationship. romance is born out of differences as well as similarities. out of the unexpected, as well as the familiar."
maybe i just needed to be sure that he'd love me back.
"but isn't that the risk you always take, hologram or not? all i know is, michael sullivan was up in that tree shouting your name."
i've never been afraid of taking risks.
"then perhaps, next time, you should just let him snore."
the neutronic gradient's rising. thirty million terajoules. forty million.
shields?
holding.
sixty million.
torres to bridge. the inverse warp field's destabilising. we're losing our anchor.
acknowledged. how long before we're clear?
at least another five minutes.
that's about four minutes too long. the gradient's rising fast. ninety million.
stabilisers are offline.
thrusters?
no effect.
shields are failing.
how close are we to the perimeter?
"a thousand kilometres, but we're being pulled along with the storm."
what have you got in mind?
the deflector beam. we might be able to cut a path through the wavefront.
"it's possible, but we'd have to route all available power to the emitters."
that won't be enough. primary systems are down.
"then transfer all secondary power sources. transporters, replicators, holodecks."
"captain, there's not enough time to go through the hologrid shutdown sequence. we'd lose most of fair haven."
do it.
"hull fractures, deck six and seven."
"you've got all the secondary power, tuvok. is it enough?"
negative.
siphon energy from the plasma network. every last deciwatt.
deflector beam active.
we're approaching the perimeter. five hundred kilometres. four hundred.
deflector output is dropping.
"give him everything we've got. life support, environmental controls. scrape the residual ions off the sonic showers if you have to."
"doesn't look good, tom. with this much photonic decay we'll be able to save five, maybe ten percent."
so much for the luck of the irish.
it might be easier to start from scratch.
"it wouldn't be the same. it's like trying to rewrite a novel after the only copy of the data file has been deleted. all the details, the nuances, they're all gone."
"morning, lads."
"hey, seamus."
looks like a storm brewing.
a storm?
heading in from the west. could be a big one.
oh. right.
i don't suppose you could spare a shilling or two? me wife and i made up last night and i wanted to buy her a new parasol.
the grid's destabilising. we'd better get started on those repairs.
"so, what do we try and save? the ox and lamb? the church? maggie o'halloran?"
there's someone i should talk to before we decide.
come in.
fair haven didn't fare too well.
i'll break the news to the crew.
"with your permission, i'd like to try to reconstruct the programme."
how long will it take?
six or seven weeks. harry tells me that we should be able to save about ten percent of the existing elements. i thought you might have a suggestion or two.
"computer, is fair haven character michael sullivan still intact?"
affirmative.
activate him. hello.
"you disappeared on me, katie. i woke up and you'd gone."
i had some thinking to do.
are you done?
yes. i'm leaving fair haven.
why?
because.
that's not a very good reason.
the situation is complicated.
another man?
no.
"your friends, they don't approve of me?"
they think you're charming.
are you not ready to settle down yet?
i'm as ready as i'll ever be.
you're not making any sense.
"no, i guess i'm not."
"i have a feeling that you won't be forgetting us that easily, fair haven has that effect on people. but there's one thing i want you to know. i love you, katie."
i might actually be passing this way in six or seven weeks. maybe i'll stop by the pub.
see that you do.
"oh computer, end programme. wait. i want to make one more modification to the character."
specify.
deny kathryn janeway any future access to his behavioural subroutines.
modification complete.
save programme.
that's one planet that never showed up on the multiple choice exam.
"its gravimetric readings are similar to that of a collapsed dwarf star. it also resembles a quasar, in that it has a high rate of rotation, approximately fifty eight revolutions per minute."
shall we take a closer look?
that's what we're here for.
"tom, put us in a high orbit."
aye.
our warp drive is offline.
why?
unknown.
back us off.
our impulse engines aren't responding.
the use the auxiliary thrusters.
we're in some kind of gravimetric gradient. it's pulling us toward the planet.
"the new one is brighter than tahal, or any of his brothers in the sky."
what does he want from us?
"to answer that, we must learn the nature of this god. we must understand the reason for his arrival. you were making an offering to tahal."
i placed the fire-fruit on his altar. then the ground shook. i looked up and the new one was there.
the fire-fruit. where is it?
"the new one doesn't want tahal to have the fire-fruit. make an altar for him, as big as tahal's. the fire-fruit is only for the new one. no more for the people. it is his alone. ground shaker, light bringer, take this today, and every day. accept our offering. do not harm us."
report.
"we're in synchronous orbit, fifty seven thousand kilometres above the planet's equator."
"good work, tom. now, let's see"
you're patting the wrong guy on the back.
explain.
"our thrusters went offline halfway through our descent and then we just stopped, like we were caught in something."
i'm picking up a strong tachyon field along the hull. it could be what's holding us.
seven of nine to the bridge.
"go ahead, seven."
please report to astrometrics. there's something you must see.
on my way. chakotay.
the planet has a tachyon core. it's produced a subspace particle field which runs between the poles. voyager's arrival disrupted that field.
it looks like the ship's been caught in an eddy of some kind.
it's worse than that. voyager seems to have become the planet's third pole.
the imbalance is affecting the outer crust. i've picked up indications of high-frequency seismic activity.
caused by our presence?
possibly.
does anybody live down there?
the atmosphere is having a scattering effect on our sensors.
is that vegetation?
"according to sensors, yes."
the tachyon core has created a space-time differential between the planet and the surrounding space. we're watching the seasons change in a matter of seconds.
"for each second that passes on voyager, nearly a day goes by on the planet."
scan for inhabitants.
i can't isolate individual lifeforms. it'll take time to correct for the space-time differential
"a couple of hundred years, maybe? if our orbit starts to decay, voyager will begin to feel the effects of the differential and we'll begin aging hundreds of times faster than we would in normal space."
"unless we want to live our lives in the blink of an eye, i suggest we find a way out of here."
how's our warp core?
"the matter-antimatter reaction is still active, but this field we're stuck in is raising hell with the nacelles. until we break orbit, warp drive is offline."
"without warp drive, we'll never leave orbit."
"it does pose a bit of a problem, doesn't it?"
"maybe the key is to learn more about this planet, in case we're missing something."
sensors aren't having an easy time of it either.
"then let's modify a class-five probe for low orbit, see what we can pick up. configure the programme to scan along all subspace bands, and set it for visual images every ten milliseconds."
snapshots. why do i get the feeling you're not just interested in tachyon fields?
"this could be the greatest anthropological find of my career. if there's an intelligent species down there, we'll be able to track their development, not just for days or weeks, but for centuries."
watch them discover new and better ways of beating each other over the head.
they won't necessarily follow the klingon model.
as opposed to the human model? it'll take a few hours to make the adjustments.
a few hours. we might miss the rise and fall of a civilisation.
so we'll watch the next one.
"oh. oh, protector."
you're late.
"well, the hill is steep, and i, i'm not as young as i used to be."
more heat.
there are grave matters of state here that cannot be delayed.
"protector, what exactly are you doing?"
i'm sending him a letter.
him? sending who a letter?
the ground shaker. the light bringer.
"had you been more attentive to my lessons when you were a boy, you would not be so gullible as a man."
"on the contrary, you taught me well. our ignorant ancestors believed every star was a deity. you taught me how foolish that was. superstition, you called it."
and that's exactly what it is.
hungry?
it's bad fortune to eat the fire-fruit.
"according to whom? our ancestors? don't tell me you believe that old superstition? perhaps we shouldn't completely ignore the old beliefs, no matter how strange they may seem today. ground shaker. ground shaker. isn't it possible the name was not given arbitrarily? that this star is indeed responsible for knocking down our walls and making us stumble as we walk?"
"oh yes, i heard about that. my condolences."
you heard what?
"well, that you stumbled in front of several important people during the last ground shake. uh, very embarrassing, i'm sure."
i did nothing of the sort.
"well, my hearing is not as good as it used to be, nor my memory either. now, what were we talking about?"
"we were talking about ancient superstitions. now, i don't believe for a moment that the stars are gods, but then, what are they?"
a great mystery to which there is no answer.
i believe the sky is full of people just like ourselves.
"what? oh, nonsense."
"prove me wrong. i say each star encompasses a city and the ground shaker rules one of these cities. a fellow protector. if i'm correct, then he'll listen to me, one protector to another. your pen."
"i, kelemane."
kelemane.
"son of kelemane, ruler of the good people of the land below you, demand that you stop what you're"
demand?
would hope?
"ah, better. much better."
would hope that you might consider putting an end to whatever it is you're doing that shakes our ground. if this causes you inconvenience i'm willing to offer a recompense.
a recompense.
i await your reply.
the next series of scans is coming through. i'm downloading them into the display buffer.
no doubt about it. there's a city down there.
"elevated levels of carbon monoxide, ammonium. that's progress, all right."
they've developed internal combustion technology since the last few scans. look at those radial lines. it looks like a system of roads.
"well, one thing hasn't changed. the geological disturbances that voyager seems to be causing. the probe recorded half a dozen each month. still no way to tell how severe they are."
look at the amount of iron being used in that city. that's ten times what you'd expect to see in a culture at this stage of development.
do you think they're using it to support their buildings?
"if you lived on a planet that wouldn't stop shaking, you might be doing the same thing. if they've reached this stage of industrial development, they must be observing us."
"the probe's impulse thrusters are starting to fail. at its present altitude, it's been operating for over two hundred years. its orbit is becoming decayed."
initiate self-destruct.
"it disintegrated in the upper thermosphere. if they saw anything, it just looked like a shooting star."
any response to our transmission?
nothing.
no visual change either.
surprised?
send it again.
the entire sequence? how about just the prime numbers?
you're tired.
so are you.
"the prime numbers and the elemental constants, then we'll stop."
"an acceptable compromise. it's not as if they're going anywhere, if they even exist in the first place."
do you doubt that?
i doubt everything.
so you weren't one of those children that had the entire series of sky ship friends?
"actually, i had them all, even the duplicates. you couldn't walk into my home without tripping over a friend or two."
"not in our home. my grandfather wouldn't allow it. he told us that the sky ship was a palace where an evil protector lived. he said that bad children were sent there to be punished. at this point, i'd be happy to see anything, evil or not. can you boost the signal?"
we're already at maximum. maybe if we switched to a different carrier wave to
"if there is somebody up there, they don't like us very much."
any beings capable of building that sky ship could have destroyed our world long ago. they're not causing the tremors on purpose.
what if they're all dead?
"if you truly believe that, why did you join this project?"
"i doubt everything, remember? even my own doubts. i hope someone is up there."
so do i.
"if they won't respond to mathematics, perhaps we should try a more personal approach. here, say hello."
how could they possibly speak our language?
there's only one way to find out.
"what, what should i say?"
"oh, glad to meet you. where are you from? please stop shaking our planet."
an ultra high frequency signal is being transmitted from the surface. the modulation is unfamiliar. its doppler component is
"any signal from the surface will be accelerated. when it reached our time frame, the frequency would be thousands of times higher than normal."
i will attempt to slow it down.
again. amplitude modulation. it's a radio transmission.
it's a numerical sequence.
prime numbers. they're sending a list of prime numbers.
"followed by a sequence of mathematical constants, and what appears to be a vocal modulation."
slow it down again. a little more.
"good friends in the sky ship. i call you that, hoping, at least, you're not enemies."
"there's nothing on our world that resembles your technology, so we assume you came here from a nearby planet or a distant star. our ancient mythology describes your arrival centuries ago, coinciding with the tremors that continually shake our planet and destroy so many of our accomplishments. i hope that was never your intention, but the result is the same. respond if you can. or if you wish, come down from your sky ship and visit us."
"well, we've got to let them know we're not doing it on purpose."
inadvisable. the prime directive still applies. this transmission was made with primitive radio technology. they are not a warp capable civilisation.
to hell with the prime directive. that man deserves an answer.
don't forget the temporal differential. that man has been dead for a long time.
nearly a century by now.
"okay, so we send a message to his great grandchildren. i'll gladly do the honours."
ancient mythology. that means we've already insinuated ourselves into their culture. why not take the next step?
first contact with a pre-warp society.
we've already made first contact. they know we're up here.
"they've known for hundreds of years, which means our presence has been tempered by time. we've gradually become part of their mythos. meeting us could throw that belief system into chaos."
but we're destroying their planet. you heard him.
"a first contact, face to face, might give us information we could use to leave orbit. that would stop the damage. it's worth the risk."
"we don't even know if an away team could survive the transition to their time frame. doctor, correct me if i'm wrong, but the physiological stress could be fatal."
"for one of you, perhaps, but not for me. my holomatrix would be unaffected."
you'd be going only as an observer. you're not to make contact.
i localised the source of the transmission to a subcontinent in the southern hemisphere.
the central protectorate?
how do you know that?
i've been looking at the data from astrometrics. seven's picked up a few of their local transmissions. i can tell you the names of all twenty six states on the planet.
and all the best places to eat?
just about.
so is this central protectorate a good place to send the doctor?
"probably. judging from the transmissions, they seem to have a tolerant society."
"hmm. well, just to be on the safe side, i'll find him an isolated spot."
i'm giving you access to your facial and epidermal parameters. you should be able to mimic the appearance of whoever is down there in a matter of seconds.
"what if they're big, purple blobs of protoplasm?"
"then you'll be the best looking blob on the planet. i'm keeping you down there for three seconds, doctor. that will be almost two days in their time frame. gather whatever data you can. seismic charts, meteorological records, anything that might give us a clue about how to break orbit."
understood.
"this will speed up the scanning rate of your programme, allow you to make the transition."
see you soon.
energising.
"one, two, three."
the confinement beam is destabilising.
it's the temporal field. we'll have to recalibrate.
every second he's down there he's in danger of being discovered.
locking on again.
we've lost him.
i'm scanning within a one hundred kilometre radius of where we sent him. nothing.
"he could've moved across the continent by now, or to the other side of the planet."
increasing radius to one thousand kilometres.
chakotay to seven of nine.
"go ahead, commander."
have you picked up any information regarding opera houses or concert halls?
the cultural centre of the state runs along the shore of the eastern lake.
"got him. b'elanna, stand by for the coordinates."
acknowledged.
i've reinitialised the confinement beam. it's holding.
locking on.
captain! lieutenant! i thought i'd never see you again.
are you all right?
"oh, i've had a few close calls over the years, but all in all"
years?
"it's been over three, but at least i knew you hadn't left me behind. all i had to do was look up and there you were, the brightest star in the sky."
"well, what do they know about us?"
"only that we arrived here centuries ago. they blame us for the seismic tremors but everything else is pure speculation. and let me tell you, they like nothing better than to speculate about voyager. doric would go on and on. sky ship this, sky ship that."
doric?
the owner of the building i lived in until the war started.
there was a war?
"oh, the neighbouring state decided to lob a few cannon shells at us. our tactical air command responded and a new treaty was signed in a matter of weeks, but not before my apartment was in ruins."
"oh, so they have aviation technology?"
"they're hardly savages, captain. in fact, they're making great strides technologically, thanks in part to voyager."
what do you mean?
"from the moment our ship arrived in the sky, they've been trying to make contact. our presence has encouraged invention, religion, science, art even children's toys. they're all variations on a single theme, voyager. mareeza even composed an aria based on the sky ship. i sang the lyric."
mareeza?
"she was my roommate. three years is a long time, captain. one needs companionship."
you'll get no argument from me. but did you learn anything that might help us break orbit?
it's all in here.
"meteorological records for the last three hundred years. i've committed them all to memory. some are inaccurate almanacs, but the more recent ones include detailed seismic analyses."
get that information to astrometrics. see if you can find any pattern to the quakes. might help us figure a way out of here.
"see you in sickbay. i'll download the data from your programme and we'll do a little cosmetic surgery, too."
lieutenant?
unless you prefer looking like that.
"of course, i completely forgot. if some of the people on the planet had their way, those weapons would be pointed at voyager. luckily the ship is still out of range, for now."
i guess i can't blame them.
there's something of a space race going on between the various states. who can get to the starship first with a rocket?
are we talking about a capsule with an astronaut or a missile with a warhead?
"i can't answer that, but at their present rate of development, we won't have to wait very long to find out."
"how does this sound? the weird planet where time moved very fast and so did the people who lived there, by naomi wildman. that's what i'm calling my report for astronomy class. neelix said i should choose a planet to write about, so i picked this one."
your title is verbose. i suggest you try to condense it.
the weird planet.
"better, but it lacks precision. the weird planet displaced in time."
perfect.
seven of nine to the bridge. i'm transmitting my calculations directly to the helm.
acknowledged.
what's happening?
the doctor brought back data regarding the planet's graviton field. we're using it to realign our thrusters.
that'll be great for my report.
"all hands, this is the captain. secure your stations and prepare to break orbit."
brace yourself. our altitude is increasing. fifty metres. sixty. seven of nine to the bridge. our attempt to leave orbit is increasing the seismic activity. we must abort.
agreed.
is the planet okay?
minimal damage along the equatorial coastline. nothing serious.
"seven, do you think we'll ever be able to leave?"
eventually.
i hope so. i need a way to end my report.
orbital one to launch control. we're ready to ignite second stage propellants.
proceed.
second-stage propellants depleted.
final stage. ready.
"ready to ignite final stage propellants. launch control, we are awaiting your commands to proceed. what was that?"
there's nothing wrong with the transponder.
orbital one to launch control. we are not receiving your orders.
everything else is working perfectly. ignite the final stage. we have to proceed with the mission.
final stage propellants depleted.
initiate deceleration thrusters.
thrusters active.
watch your pitch angle.
correcting.
distance check.
we're in rendezvous range.
rendezvous sequence locked in.
moving into final position.
distance check.
we're within scanning range.
let's take a look.
the scanners won't penetrate their hull.
i guess we'll have to go inside.
we're not authorised to do that.
our orders were to learn as much as possible about the sky ship. that's my intention. i saw something that looks like a transfer port. it might be a place we can dock. move in closer.
"wait, wait."
are you all right?
a little disoriented. let's keep going.
i don't understand.
her skin feels warm.
it might be some sort of metabolic stasis. but then why does it look like they're just going about their business?
this isn't right. we shouldn't be here. we were never meant to be here.
try and stay calm.
"we've seen enough. please, we have to leave."
you're the best pilot we have. that's why you're on this mission. this is no different than flying your favourite
"oh, it's different."
"i can't argue with that. another few minutes, then we'll go back. this looks like their command centre."
this is not metabolic stasis.
could the laws of physics be different here?
maybe they're just a little slower.
what's wrong?
intruder alert. security team to deck one.
"captain, i'm picking up a ship at docking port one. it just appeared there."
bridge to sickbay. medical emergency.
what can you tell me.
the transition to our time frame was a little rough for them. i'm afraid his colleague didn't make it.
how is he?
"recovering. lucky for him i'm as good as his family doctor. after three years of poring over their medical journals, i know as much about their physiology as i do yours. easy."
where's trina?
she didn't survive the transition. i'm very sorry.
transition? to your time frame?
you understand what's happened to you?
i'm beginning to.
voyager exists in the same space-time as the rest of the galaxy. your planet is different.
so you really haven't been watching us for centuries.
"actually, we just got here, and we're hoping you can help us find a way to leave."
"so if what you're saying is true, everyone i know, everyone i knew, is gone."
that's correct.
"captain, i'm an accomplished pilot. that's why they chose me for this mission. i don't have the courage of the others. they made a mistake choosing me."
"i have to disagree. for someone whose life has just been turned upside down, i think you're doing fine."
"when i was a young child, the toys hanging above my crib depicted the sky ship. it's the first thing i ever remember seeing, even before my mother's face. and now i'm the only one that knows its name. voyager. i suppose it'll be the last thing i see as well."
"that's up to you. i have no intention of keeping you here against your will. the doctor spent some time on your planet collecting data that we hoped would help us find a way to leave orbit. we need you to assist us in interpreting that information. however, the longer you stay on board, the more difficult it will be for you to go home. your culture is changing every second you're here. by the time you go back, you might find it more alien than ours."
"star of the night, star of the day, come to take my tears away. make my life always bright. it's a child's prayer."
to voyager?
yes.
i hope you're not disappointed.
how often does your very first dream come true? of course i'll help you.
the information i brought back is in voyager's database. seven of nine has been trying to make sense of it. she'll welcome your assistance.
mountain or lakeside?
"mountain, of course. don't tell me you're a lakeside supporter."
you really were on the surface.
how are they doing this season?
"not good. five wins, twelve losses."
i don't believe it! who's guarding for them?
torelius.
any relation to the torelius?
his grandson.
i saw the original defend for mountain in the playoffs against red river.
that was before i was born.
he would have gone into voluntary exile after a 5-12 season.
this information is out of date. we were far more advanced than this when i left. i can help you correct it.
very well.
let's start with the geological data. the seismic detectors back then were off by a variance of three point eight.
a simple conversion will compensate for that.
does every planet look like ours?
none that i've seen. your world appears to be unique.
"if we're so out of step with everything else, we'll never be able to explore space the way you have."
you're a highly adaptable species. your scientists will find a way to compensate for the temporal differential.
"they'd better do it before you leave. without the sky ship up above them, my people might lose interest in progress. there wouldn't be anything left to reach for."
"perhaps they'll miss voyager so much, they'll do everything they can to follow us."
maybe so. what was that?
"an antimatter implosion. your world is experimenting with warp technology. the sensors detected an early test. another test, six weeks later, and a third. more controlled each time. they're learning quickly.  too quickly."
what was that?
"unknown, but our shields are down to eighty two percent. sixty four percent."
i don't know what's causing it. there's nothing on sensors.
janeway to seven of nine.
"go ahead, captain."
are you picking up
anything in astrometrics?
the inhabitants appear to have developed antimatter torpedo technology.
i believe we're under attack.
another direct hit. shields at forty nine percent.
"captain, i apologise for this attack. they have no right."
"unfortunately, they've got every right."
let me talk to them.
we've already tried to hail them. it doesn't look like they're able to receive our transmissions.
they still don't know about the time differential.
a logical assumption. shields down to thirty four percent.
"the torpedoes are being fired at three day intervals. they're making refinements each time, increasing the detonation yield."
"captain, isn't it time we returned fire?"
we've done enough damage to these people over the last thousand years.
"you've got to go back. it's the only way. make them understand who we are. you have the specifications of this ship. your scientists might be able to use them to help free us. at the very least, get them to hold their fire."
"captain, the transporters are offline."
is his vessel still intact?
the docking port hasn't been hit yet.
good luck.
"this will accelerate your metabolic functions, help you make the transition."
"thank you for everything, doctor."
it was a pleasure to treat a fellow citizen. would you do me a favour?
certainly.
find out what happened to a boy named jason tabreez. he lived in the central protectorate.
jason? an unusual name.
yes. he was my son.
but you're a hologram.
"it's a long story. he's dead by now, but perhaps you could discover what happened to him. maybe he had children or grandchildren. you could tell them about me."
i will.
"orbital one to launch control, please respond. launch control, please respond."
who is this?
"pilot first rank, gotana-retz."
clear the channel or i'm going to report you to the command centre.
is this launch control?
i'm the weather coordinator for station zero zero four. you're in violation of transmission regulations.
"please, listen to me. i'm trying to reach launch control."
let me guess. you finally decided to come home. you're gotana-retz?
"gotana-retz, yes. now, please transfer me to launch control."
launch control became the tactical command centre fifty years ago. you're dead.
i've been inside the sky ship.
then it's a good thing you decided to leave. they're about to shoot it down.
i've got to speak with them.
tactical command frequencies are classified. now get off this channel.
"if you ever wanted to report more than the weather, now is your chance. tell them to clear central lake of all traffic. orbital one is coming in for a landing."
shields at twenty three percent. seventeen percent. shields are down.
what was that last one?
a tricobalt device.
what will they think of next?
"damage reports coming in. imminent hull breeches on decks eight, nine and ten. life support is failing."
our astronaut should have made it by now.
"based on his descent velocity, he landed about ten minutes ago."
that's a year and a half.
then he must have failed.
i'm picking up another launch. two massive energy signatures.
tricobalt devices?
unknown.
brace yourselves.
we're in some kind of tractor beam.
"captain, if i alternate thrusters i might be able to break us free."
no. let's give our friends the benefit of the doubt.
they're pulling us away from the planet.
we've broken orbit.
try hailing them.
it's good to see you all again.
looks like somebody down there listened to you.
i'm sorry it took so long.
now we can make first contact the proper way.
"unfortunately that won't be possible. a temporal compensator. it allows me to exist in your time frame without actually leaving my own, but only for a few minutes. i'm afraid it'll be a while before my people actually join the rest of the galaxy."
"captain, we'll be able to bring the warp drive back online in approximately two hours."
very good. thank you.
i feel like i'm saying goodbye to an old friend.
stay away.
"if you don't cooperate, i can't treat you."
"when we agreed to be examined by this ship's medical officer, we didn't know that you were a primitive computer matrix."
i assure you there is nothing primitive about me. i am programmed to perform more than five million medical procedures.
does that include bloodletting?
"no, but i'll be happy to add it to my repertoire."
we are ready to return to our ship. could you contact one of your superiors?
doctor to the captain. please report to sickbay.
already on my way.
"the captain is coming here now. if you want to talk to her, you can have a seat."
it is a very irritating programme.
maybe we can disable its speech subroutines.
you're not authorised to do that!
how are our guests?
"their injuries are minor. unfortunately, i can't say the same for their lack of manners."
doctor.
what is the status of our ship?
"to be honest, we're having a little trouble understanding your technology."
the problem is your technology. interference from your antiquated scanning devices shut down our propulsion system.
"forgive us, captain. we live in a closed system. we are not accustomed to interacting with other species, especially inferior ones."
"well then, i guess we'll leave the repairs in your superior hands."
our injuries will have to be treated first. is there someone other than this hologram who could help us?
no one who's better qualified.
very well.
try to bear with our deficiencies just a little longer.
"this way, please.  i've been working on the railroad, all the live long day. i've been working on the railroad, just to pass the time away."
what is that?
this? a hypospray.
no. what you were doing.
preparing your medication.
no. with your voice.
you mean singing?
singing.
do it again.
"yes, do it again."
"someone's in the kitchen with dinah, someone's in the kitchen i know. someone's in the kitchen with dinah, strummin' on the old banjo and singing fee fi fiddly i o, fee fi fiddly i o, fee fi fiddly i o. strummin' on the old banjo."
it is a unique mathematical variation.
difficult to quantify.
how do you suppose the algorithms are generated?
maybe it's a fractal.
or waveform calculus?
do you mean to say a culture as superior as yours has never heard music of any kind?
there are other kinds of music?
"of course. the little ditty i just sang is an early american folk song. but countless cultures have produced thousands of types of music. instrumental, choral, orchestral."
what is the purpose of this music? is it an encryption code of some kind?
"there is a mathematical component to music, but primarily it's a form of artistic expression."
artistic expression?
using sounds and images to convey ideas and emotions.
why would anyone do that?
"well, to communicate their feelings."
can't they do that through speech?
"yes, but music is much more expressive and entertaining."
you mean to say that this music is recreational?
"it does have other applications. as a matter of fact, i've recently been doing some research into its therapeutic properties. but, yes, primarily we use it for enjoyment."
we? you mean to say others aboard your ship are capable of producing this phenomenon?
"well, maybe not with my level of expertise, but there are quite a few members of this crew who possess musical skills."
maybe we judged this culture too quickly.
"our database contains the works of thousands of musicians and composers. if you'd like, i could download some selections for you."
could you sing them for us?
"harry, can you make sense of any of this?"
"we're picking up thousands of subspace transmissions, all encrypted differently."
"between the satellites and the spacecraft, it's like navigating an obstacle course."
"with all this traffic, the qomar might not even know we're here."
"apparently, they do. we are being hailed."
"captain, you now have the privilege of meeting prelate koru."
welcome to the qomar planetary alliance.
"thank you, prelate. we're looking forward to learning more about your culture."
our civilisation is no doubt intimidating. we'll do what we can to avoid overwhelming you during your stay.
"i appreciate that. i understand we're not as advanced as you, but we're fast learners, and we'd like to"
we want to learn more about the algorithmic expressions you call music.
"we're prepared to give you complete access to our musical database, as well"
"your emergency medical hologram. we'd consider an exchange of technology, if you give us complete access to this device."
i believe he's made some recordings.
"no, not recordings."
how about a recital?
recital?
a live performance. we can put together a programme of various styles of music.
will the emergency medical hologram sing?
he'll be the star attraction.
"dio, che nell'alma infondere amor volesti e speme, desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta."
"thank you. you're very kind. that was a selection from the opera don carlos, composed by giuseppe verdi a towering figure in earth's musical history. another human musical form is called jazz, which has flourished since the early twentieth century. mathematically, you'll find the rhythmic structures quite interesting, particularly the use of syncopation, which is said to make the music swing. you may also notice some fascinating trigonometric functions in the counterpoint, but i suppose i'm going off on a tangent, aren't i?"
"so, without further ado, i give you harry kim and the kimtones!"
we wish to hear the doctor.
"yes, the doctor."
"doc, they're dying up there. you've got to do something."
"pick up the tempo.  that old black magic has me in its spell. that old black magic that you weave so well. those icy fingers up and down my spine. the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine. the same old tingle that i feel inside. and then that elevator starts its ride, and down and down i go. round and round i go, like a leaf that's caught in the tide."
"well, if you like jazz, you're going to love rock 'n' roll. it was one of the twentieth century's greatest inventions."
does the doctor sing rock 'n' roll?
i wouldn't say it's his favourite genre.
"no, he's more of an opera man."
as am i.
aren't you one of the musicians?
harry kim.
vinka.
"welcome aboard voyager. er, if you'd like to see the rest of the ship, i'd be happy to give you a tour."
maybe later. i was wondering if you could introduce me to the doctor.
"congratulations, doctor, you stole the show."
"thank you, captain, but i can't take all the credit. there was something in the air. a certain magic. it was one of those rare moments when audience and performer become one."
doctor.
prelate. tincoo.
i will introduce your singing to more of our people.
i'm flattered.
you will perform on our planet.
"i'd consider it an honour, but you'll have to negotiate the terms with my representative."
i don't understand.
"i believe the doctor is referring to me, prelate. another concert would mean extending our stay. when would you want to schedule the performance?"
as soon as possible.
the doctor could perform in one of the lecture halls at the university.
i'm not sure a lecture hall would meet the acoustic requirements.
i'll help you make whatever modifications you think are necessary.
"sounds like you've got yourself a booking, doctor."
"i'd like to reproduce a backdrop which was used in a production of pagliacci at teatro de la scala, earth's most famous opera house."
it's beautiful.
your taste in design is as refined as your taste in music.
we'll replicate it for you.
"excellent, but we still have the problem with the sight lines."
what's wrong with the sight lines?
"if you consider the height of the average qomar, it's obvious that anyone seated in the back five rows will have an obstructed view."
you're right. they won't be able to see anything but the top of your head. the glare could blind them.
you'll have to excuse lieutenant torres. her appreciation of music is limited to a smattering of klingon drinking songs. we'll have to increase the rake of the floor by five degrees.
you really think they're going to redesign an entire building just to appeal to your vanity?
"vanity has nothing to do with it, lieutenant. i'm concerned about my audience."
we are prepared to make whatever changes the doctor thinks are necessary.
"thank you, tincoo.while we're at it, lieutenant, i'll need some help with my wardrobe."
"i'm an engineer, not a costume designer."
i'd like you to make an adjustment to my mobile emitter that will allow me to make quick changes between songs.
that sounds exciting.
"oh, it will be. i plan to segue from don juan to rigoletto in the blink of an eye. it will be a triumph of"
arrogance and self-absorption? just trying to help.
your crewmates don't seem to appreciate your abilities.
you've noticed that too?
that must be very frustrating for you.
you have no idea.
we'll be starting in two minutes.
i'd better get into costume.
how do i look?
you look perfect.
i wish i had a subroutine to eliminate pre-show jitters.
i could help you add one to your programme.
you're very sweet. i'm just a little nervous.
why?
i'm about to expose your entire culture to music for the first time. the responsibility is enormous.
your performance tonight will be transmitted to hundreds of millions of people.
is that supposed to help me relax?
it's time.
report.
"i didn't order red alert, captain."
"well, someone did."
the command originated in astrometrics.
seven of nine to the captain. i've found evidence that the qomar are attempting to sabotage voyager.
on my way.
what have you got?
i believe the qomar are attempting to disable our comm. system.
how?
by overloading it with millions of teraquads of irrelevant data.
what do you mean by irrelevant?
"they're transmissions, all addressed to the doctor."
"precisely. i've only been able to decipher a small fraction of them so far, but they include invitations to social and scientific functions, requests for personal encounters, and cloying tributes to the doctor's talents."
"computer, stand down red alert. this isn't sabotage, seven. this is fan mail."
fan mail?
people who admire performers are called fans.
"the word, i believe, derives from fanatic."
exactly.
why would the doctor inspire fanaticism among the qomar?
"music is new to them. clearly, they're very excited about it."
this glorification of the individual is irrational. the doctor is merely reproducing the work of others. why do his fans fixate solely on him?
i suppose he's the embodiment of what they admire. he can do something they can't. that makes him special.
"perhaps, but that doesn't explain their interest in the minutiae of the doctor's life. what does he do in his spare time? to how many decimal places can he calculate pi? this one wants to know his favourite quadratic equation."
people have always fantasised about knowing celebrities personally. i suppose it's a way of making themselves feel more important.
tuvok to janeway.
go ahead.
we have a security problem on deck two.
"on my way. just think, seven. as personal friends of the doctor, we're the envy of millions of qomar."
our efforts to accommodate them have gotten out of hand.
i guess their interest in the doctor is greater than we expected.
much greater. i recommend we refuse all further requests for transport from the surface.
agreed.
and we should evacuate these visitors immediately. they're interfering with normal ship's functions.
"tuvok, when have functions aboard this ship ever been normal?"
"dio, che nell'alma infondere amor volesti e speme"
desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta.
desio nel core accendere tu dei di liberta.
thank you for coming. please accept this eight by ten by four singing replica of me.
"one at a time, one at a time. now, please, do not touch the doctor's mobile emitter. captain, isn't this exciting?"
"i'm not sure that's the word i'd use for it. excuse me. sorry, excuse me."
"i'm sorry, captain, but you'll have to wait your turn like everybody else."
i'm not here for an autograph. we need to talk.
"i'm glad you're enjoying yourself doctor, but this is getting a little excessive."
i'm only doing what i can to ensure that first contact with the qomar goes smoothly.
does that include using our replicator reserves to create miniaturised versions of yourself?
"i would never do such a thing. as a matter of fact, the qomar have devoted an entire holo-processing plant to manufacturing them for me."
"i see. well in any case, you've been neglecting your sickbay duties. i haven't received a report in three days."
"oh, come now, kathryn. it's not as though there's been a flood of medical emergencies."
i wasn't aware we were on a first name basis.
"i, i meant captain. i'm sorry."
"oh, that's perfectly all right, doctor, or do you prefer maestro?"
"oh, please. either is acceptable."
"well, then, let me make it clear to both of you. maestro, you're finished for today. doctor, report to sickbay. now."
"well, well, well. if it isn't the wandering minstrel."
what's the nature of their medical emergencies?
"apparently, these two young ladies became dizzy and disoriented while waiting in line to see you."
i'll take over from here.
"be careful, doc. you seem to be hazardous to the qomars' health."
i'm vinka.
i'm azen.
hmm. neither of you appears to be ill.
we wanted to meet you in a more intimate setting.
so we told your security officer we were sick.
sickbay is for medical treatment only. i'm afraid you'll have to leave.
but there's so much about you we want to know.
"yes, you're a very stimulating hologram."
"if you're here for a replica, they're available in the mess hall."
we don't want a replica.
we want the full sized version.
"i'm flattered, really, but if you don't leave now i'll have to call security."
i'll bet you can calculate pi to over a thousand digits.
security to sickbay.
have you ever balanced simultaneous equations?
"computer, deactivate emergency medical hologram."
here you are.
i needed to find some peace and quiet.
i want to show you something.
what's this?
you inspired me to create my own musical composition. it's based on the intersection of two fractals.
"tincoo, this is extraordinary."
i created it for you.
i don't know what to say.
will you sing it?
"i'm not sure i can. it's very complex. the melody's lovely, but some of these notes are well beyond the human vocal range."
you are not human.
"no, but"
i can help you reconfigure your vocal processors.
i don't think there's time. my last concert's tomorrow.
why does it have to be your last concert?
because voyager is scheduled to depart.
stay here with us.
i have responsibilities on voyager.
they're a resourceful crew. i'm certain they will find a way to compensate for your absence.
"i'm not so sure about that. but even if they could, voyager's the only life i've ever known. the crew are my friends."
"but they don't appreciate you the way we do. you know that. you could have a new life here as a performer, surrounded by people who admire and respect your talent."
"it's very tempting, but"
"by any mathematical standard, the medical care of a hundred and fifty people cannot compare to the cultural enrichment of millions."
"you can't always explain things with an equation, tincoo."
what about the simplest equation of them all? one plus one.
i don't understand.
the time you have been here has been the most stimulating of my life.
i feel the same way about my time with you.
then stay here with me.
you're resigning your commission?
i've been asked to stay.
"when this all started, i thought you might have a little harmless fun, and that you'd be responsible enough to keep it in perspective. i can see now that i was mistaken."
"this isn't harmless fun for me, captain. it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to realise a dream."
what about your duty to voyager?
"i take that very seriously, but"
you're a part of this ship.
you sound as if you're talking about a piece of equipment.
that's not what i meant.
then shouldn't i be given the same respect as any flesh and blood member of this crew?
every member of this crew is expected to fulfil his obligations.
"if harry kim met an alien woman on an away mission, fell in love, and decided to spend the rest of his life with her, raise a family instead of continuing on this journey, you wouldn't stand in his way."
you're not harry kim. you're an emergency medical hologram.
then you do see me as a piece of technology.
"i have given you extraordinary freedom, to explore your creativity, to go on away missions, to pursue personal relationships, but enough is enough."
"why? because you don't see me as an equal, and you never have. admit it."
"i am responsible for the medical needs of this crew. if i let you leave, what kind of captain would i be?"
"every other starfleet officer chose to be here, but i never had a choice, until now. i've given this crew everything for five years. isn't it worth anything? haven't i earned the right to self-determination? you've lost other systems before and always managed to find a solution. you'll manage without me."
what about you? will you manage without us?
the qomar are a technologically advanced species. i have no doubt that my maintenance requirements will be met.
now which one of us is looking at you as a piece of technology? i'm not talking about your maintenance needs. i'm talking about your emotional needs. you've got people on this ship who care about you.
the qomar certainly seem to care about me.
and when their tastes change?
what makes you think that's going to happen?
fame is often temporary.
this isn't just about fame.
"oh, really?"
"if you must know, there's a woman involved. one who appreciates me in a way no one on this crew ever has."
"well, it sounds like you'll have everything you need."
i believe i will.
"i hope so, doctor. because once voyager's gone, you won't be able to change your mind."
that's a risk i'm willing to take.
"as your captain, i should refuse this resignation. but as your friend, it wouldn't be right to stand in your way."
and you can't let the captain ignore her health. she's notorious for finding any excuse to miss her appointments.
i'll send her weekly reminders.
"and when mister neelix becomes convinced that he's suffering from the toluncan ague, which he does every flu season, don't argue with him, just give him a placebo."
"doc, i've been assisting you for three years. i know the drill."
"yes, i suppose you do. remember, i'll be within comm. range for at least another month, so if any problems should arise."
"doc, you're not really going to do this, are you?"
i would have thought you of all people would be glad to see me go.
are you kidding? who am i going to torment after you're gone?
"well, i've got some more goodbyes. i'll check in with you before i leave."
"i'll be here, redecorating your office."
"hello, seven. i wanted to see you before i left. i've downloaded some social lessons we haven't covered yet. there are seventeen new chapters."
does one of them include instructions for ending a friendship?
"our friendship's not over, seven."
it will be difficult to maintain if we never see each other again.
i know it'll be hard for you when i'm gone.
i will adapt.
"yes, i suppose you will. but it'll be hard for me."
why? you're getting everything you've ever wanted.
i thought you'd be the first one to understand my desire to grow as an individual.
what i don't understand is why you can't do that aboard voyager.
"i feel i've accomplished all i can here. oh, there's the occasional medical mystery that challenges my programming, but mostly it's become routine. and frankly, i feel my talents are often taken for granted. but when i'm standing on that stage performing, and i see those rapt faces in the audience, i feel i finally know what it's like to be made of flesh and blood."
"you simply crave attention, applause, fan mail."
what if i do?
those things are irrelevant.
"to you, maybe. but to me, it makes me feel appreciated, even loved. not for what i've been programmed to do, but for who i've become."
"doctor, you're receiving a transmission."
route it to cargo bay two.
"doctor, this is tincoo. i want to see you immediately. i have something to show you."
what is it?
a surprise. i think you'll be very pleased.
i'll beam down as soon as i can. seven.
you shouldn't keep your fans waiting.
thank you for being so prompt.
of course. what's the surprise?
i had an inspiration.
another musical composition?
better.
what's this?
i've solved all our problems.
i wasn't aware that we had any.
"well, you were reluctant to leave your ship, and you also doubted your ability to sing my composition, so i created a superior holomatrix."
i don't understand.
"it's simple. now you can stay aboard voyager, and he can sing for us. listen."
you can't make a superior singer simply by creating a new matrix.
"i beg to differ. my vocal processors are enhanced with polyphonic sequencers. i am not only capable of singing notes well beyond your limited range, i can produce multi-harmonic overtones through the use of amplitude vacilla"
why did you do that?
"tincoo, music is more than mathematics. and i am much more than a programme with musical subroutines. all of my experience, all of my passion, goes into every note that i sing. when you listen to me, when my singing moves you, you're not just hearing notes. you're hearing my artistry. my soul."
"i've duplicated that, too."
i thought you wanted me.
"i did, but now i've developed a far more sophisticated piece of technology."
technology.
i thought you would be pleased. you seemed reluctant to leave your ship.
you told me that the time you had spent with me was the most stimulating of your life.
it was. you inspired me to do my greatest work.
but i thought
yes?
that you and i
what?
"well, i suppose i'm no longer on the bill tomorrow."
of course you are. it will be your farewell performance.
of course.
you wanted to see me?
i need your clearance code to delete my medical database.
you sure you want to do that? if you give one of your fans a heart attack you won't be able to resuscitate him.
i need more space in my matrix.
for what?
to expand my musical subroutines so that i can sing this composition.
"well, i'm surprised you're asking me for help. i recall your saying that my appreciation for music was limited to a smattering of klingon drinking songs."
"please, b'elanna, i'm asking you as a friend. everything depends on this."
what's so important about this composition?
tincoo wrote it for me.
your girlfriend?
i wouldn't call her that.
don't tell me you two had a fight.
"let's just say she doesn't appreciate me quite as much as i thought she did. but that will all change. once i perform this, she will see me for the artist i truly am."
"look, doc, i don't know anything about this woman or why she doesn't appreciate you, and i may not be an expert on music, but i'm a pretty good engineer. i can expand your musical subroutines all you like. i can even reprogramme you to be a whistling teapot. but, if i do that, it won't be you anymore."
"tonight, i was planning to perform a song composed by one of your own people. when you consider she heard music for the first time only a few days ago, it's an extraordinary accomplishment. but although it's a very beautiful composition, i'm afraid it's beyond my abilities. so instead, i'm going to sing an old neapolitan ballad. it's a song about lost love.  sotto la grónda della torre antica, una róndine amica a lo sbocciar del almondo or lui tornata. ritorni tutti l'anni sempre alla stessa data, monti e mari sa varca per tornar. solo amore quando fugenda lontana sper invano, ma non torni piu. sper invano ma non torna piu."
"thank you, doctor. that was fascinating. it is because of your inspiration that i can now present to you a new and exciting musical programme. a singing holographic matrix designed specifically to extend the range of humanoid vocal capabilities, singing my own musical composition."
come in.
"good morning, captain."
what's this?
a formal request to be reinstated.
so you've taken off your tails and put them between your legs.
"yes, ma'am."
you offended a lot of people who care about you.
i know. i was a fool. i'm sorry. and i'm willing to do whatever i can to rectify the situation. starting with the deletion of all my musical subroutines.
permission denied.
"but, captain"
"no buts, doctor. you're expected to follow orders just like every other flesh and blood member of this crew. resume your normal activities. all of them."
"yes, ma'am."
dismissed.
"oh, seven, i didn't see you. i suppose you've come to gloat."
i have something for you.
what is it?
fan mail.
delete it. i don't want to read another word.
then i'll read it for you.
seven.
dear doctor. i regret that your last performance was not as successful as you'd hoped. there are still those who appreciate your unique talents and admire you as an individual. i'll always consider myself your loyal fan.
who's it from?
"it's signed seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one."
"i've been working on the railroad, all the livelong day. i've been working on the railroad, just to pass the time away. can't you hear the whistle blowing? rise up so early in the morn."
who left their dirty plate in the replicator? tom?
it wasn't me.
it's a biohazard.
take it easy. we'll decontaminate you when we get back home.
"if i ever volunteer for a two week away mission again, would somebody please confine me to sickbay?"
"too much togetherness for you, harry?"
"nothing personal, commander."
"to tell you the truth, i've enjoyed our little junket together. it's given the four of us a chance to bond."
the bonding stopped when the sonic shower went offline.
"that's all part of the experience, the adventure. think of the great explorers that came before us. they survived without creature comforts."
"i wouldn't want to bunk with them, either."
now there's a sight for sore eyes.
delta flyer to voyager. we're on our approach.
we've kept a candle burning in the window for you.
"forget the candles, break out the champagne."
i take it the mission was a success?
fifteen planets scanned in fourteen days. we've got a cargo hold overflowing with dilithium ore.
that's the kind of news i like to hear.
the explorers return.
welcome home.
i should go away more often.
"i'm not going away for a long, long time."
"homesick, harry?"
let's just say i'm looking forward to a hot shower and a comfortable bed.
don't forget to stop by sickbay for your check-up.
check-up? for what?
"away team protocol. crew members are required to submit to a physical if the mission lasts more than two weeks. now, who's first?"
"i'll let you know in the morning, doctor."
why put off till tomorrow what you can do today? commander? mister paris?
i've been working on a little surprise for you.
"oh? naughty, or nice?"
close your eyes.
i like it already.
come on. so what do you think?
oh! a television set.
"circa 1956. i replicated the components, but i assembled it myself. this is the remote control. you select what you want to watch by pressing this button."
a slight problem. there were no remote controls in the 1950's.
i took a little poetic license.
cartoon!
i found them in the ship's database.
"vacuum action! mop, mop, don't stop"
what's that?
"that is called a jingle. according to the research i did, they inserted them into the entertainment programs. i know, it's confusing, but i kept them in for authenticity. i even replicated popcorn."
everything is perfect except for one tiny detail.
what?
you forgot the beer.
i can fix that.
you didn't miss much while you were away. the doctor gave a lecture on insects indigenous to the delta quadrant.
ah ha.
"it was pretty boring, until ensign farley started snoring and then no one could keep a straight face. of course, the doctor wasn't at all amused."
ooo! hockey!
"it was a shame that we had to cut the lecture short, but the warp core overloaded and then the borg invaded and we were all assimilated."
mmm hmm.
"you haven't heard a single thing i've said, have you?"
oh! look at that!
maybe this was a bad idea.
"this is eliot ness. come out, we don't want any trouble!"
we're under attack. stay down. keep moving. somebody cover me.
we need a medic over here.stay down. move it. stay low.
i said hold your fire!
i need a medic.
keep moving.
tom?
tom? tom.  it must have been one hell of a dream.
"i was, i was in the middle of a battlefield. i was grazed right, right here. they always said television was a bad influence."
how about a nice cartoon? that should chase away the nightmare.
"no! no, i think i've had enough."
it sounds like you had an anxiety attack.
i've never been claustrophobic before.
there's a first time for everything.
do you know what could have caused it?
"let's see. you spend two weeks on an away mission, working eighteen hour days, then as soon as you return to voyager you become ensign eager, back on duty and raring to go."
i had work to do. there was a plasma leak on deck five.
"plasma leak or no plasma leak, you're suffering from exhaustion. i'm recommending you take the next two days off."
but i
i can always make it three.
you win. i guess i am pretty tired.
welcome back.
"oh, hello."
did you have a good trip?
"wonderful, thank you."
you look tired.
do i? just a little shuttle lag. don't you have a geometry lesson? you don't want to keep your teacher waiting.
seven of nine assigned me a special project. i'm supposed to build a tetragon but i have to use everyday things. i'm not allowed to use a replicator. i was thinking about using some vegetables from the airponics bay. carrots and celery? neelix?
carrots and celery. a good idea.
will you help me?
i don't think i'll have time today.
tonight?
i don't think that i'll have time then either. lot of work to do.
then why don't i help you? what's cooking?  ouch!
let me see your hand!
i'm okay.
your hand! we've got to get you to sickbay.
i'm fine.
sickbay!
get down. stay behind me.
what?
i said get down!
i'm hit!
"someone help me with this, please"
keep moving. move out to the left contingent.
try not to move.
get away from me.
i can help you.
i don't want your help.
"hold your fire. i said, hold your fire!"
"we're under attack, sir."
"saavdra, where is he?"
i think he's at base.
let's move out.
"we were supposed to evacuate the colony, not destroy it!"
that was before the nakan started shooting.
they're civilians!
civilians with particle weapons.
tuvok to commander chakotay.
"commander, please respond."
go ahead.
we have a security breach in the mess hall.
i'm on my way.
tell them to call off the attack.
"put down your weapon, neelix. let us help you."
stay away! i won't let you hurt her! get back!
he appears to be hallucinating.
"neelix, this is commander chakotay. let naomi go. no one's going to hurt her. that's an order."
no! not until saavdra's called off his attack.
"there's a back entrance to the galley. if you can distract him, perhaps i"
"i want to try something first. neelix, listen to me. it's okay, saavdra ordered a cease-fire. the colony's secure. the battle is over."
why do i still hear weapons fire?
it's just a few soldiers. they're celebrating. the battle's over.
"neelix, please."
i'll protect naomi.
how do i know you won't trick me?
because i'm on your side. i want to end this conflict as much as you do. let her go. it's safe now. the killing's over.
i gave him a mild sedative.
any idea what caused the delusions?
"his norepinephrine levels are three times what they should be. neurochemically speaking, he's suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome."
i dreamed i was fighting in an alien war. the same war neelix seemed to be reliving.
harry kim was in earlier. he had an anxiety attack. i haven't spoken with mister paris yet.
three members of the same away team. did you run into any kind of trouble while you were gone?
none. the mission was by the book.
"your engramatic activities contradict that, commander. these are real memories, not mere dreams or hallucinations."
"maybe you were abducted, manipulated into fighting. our memories have been tampered with before. we're going to retrace your mission. start reviewing the delta flyer's sensor logs. see if you come up with anything unusual. how long before neelix is back on his feet?"
"i can wake him now, if you'd like."
do it. each of you seems to hold a piece of the puzzle. let's see if we can start putting them together.
"i don't remember much, just bits and pieces. i dreamt i was on a planet in the middle of a battle. i have no idea how i got there. i can't remember."
"when i was in the jefferies tube i heard weapons fire, screams. people were screaming. i got so frightened."
of what?
"i, i don't know."
i remember getting shot.
there's no evidence of a wound.
"if our memories were wiped, our physical injuries could have been masked as well."
do any of you recall who you were fighting?
it was dark. i couldn't see them very well.
they were firing at us.
the nakaa. the nakana.
the nakan. they were called the nakan.
"right. right. they, they lived in a remote colony. we were trying to evacuate them."
but they were fighting us.
why couldn't they just do what they were told?
we had no right to be there!
it was for their own good.
"gentlemen, stay focused. you said you were trying to evacuate their colony. why?"
those were our orders.
who gave them?
saavdra.
commander saavdra.
he was in charge of our unit. we were part of an attack force.
you were coerced.
"no. no, i volunteered. we all did."
i find that difficult to believe. you were obviously manipulated somehow.
"no. no, no, no, no, i remember now. we held a briefing to plan the evacuation. you were there, commander. mister paris."
it was a command post.
"that's right. it was night, oh two hundred hours."
we'd been awake for days. we were exhausted.
what do our spotters report?
the nakan are unarmed. they won't put up a fight.
"once we've disabled their shield generators, we'll deploy units five and six. they may be unarmed, but they won't be happy to see us. don't provoke them. i want to come out of this with zero casualties on both sides."
understood.
the perimeter's the weakest in sector fourteen. the terrain's very flat.
it's an ideal landing spot for transports.
"once we've secured the village, take the colonists there. get them aboard. do your best to reassure them. make them understand that this is a temporary relocation. that they're going to be back there in a few weeks. understood?"
"aye, aye, sir."
problem?
just one. this unit could use a little sleep. i suggest we wait until daybreak.
i promised command we'd have this colony secured today.
it can wait a few hours.
"i'm sorry. but when this mission's over, how does a week on toranius prime sound?"
never been there.
"compared to this place, it's paradise."
the mission proceeded as planned. we disabled their shield generators and entered the colony.
"we were rounding up the nakan. to be honest, i expected them to give us a little more trouble."
but then we came to the last enclosure. do you remember the last enclosure? it was empty. where were they? they were supposed to be there.
twenty four colonists unaccounted for. we thought the spotters had made a mistake. we should have known something was wrong. we should have gotten out then.
this way. stay in line. keep moving.
evacuation detail to base. we're ready for transport.
transport's on approach.
i have to find my husband.
don't worry. he'll be on one of the transports.
which one?
"i don't know, but we'll find him."
"everybody down! base, we're under attack. repeat. we're under attack!"
"those missing colonists, they were armed. they fired the first shots. it wasn't our fault!"
we can't be sure of that. it could have been one of our own people. fatigue. a phaser malfunction. you just don't know!
"either way, it doesn't justify what we did."
what did you do? what happened down there?
keep moving. stay together. hold your fire!
stay down!
stay together.
stop running. stop!
"get down! get down, get down, get down! stop running! stop running!"
we didn't have any other choice.
like hell we didn't.
they were wiping us out!
that didn't give us the right to murder civilians.
"i tried to protect the children, but i couldn't stop them from running away."
i ran too. sounds of phaser fire. people shouting. i had to get out of there.
"please, don't hurt us."
move where i can see you! move!
"please, please, he's no threat to you."
tell me how i can get out of these tunnels and i'll leave you alone. tell me!
go back the way you came. at the second fork take the tunnel to your left. follow it to the end. it will lead you to the river.
he was going to kill me.
"easy, harry."
they wouldn't listen! why? why wouldn't they listen?
we killed eighty two civilians that night. no one was left alive.
yeah. yeah!
missed you at breakfast.
i wasn't hungry.
sleep a little?
"five, six minutes."
i found another episode of the untouchables. elliot ness captures somebody named al caypone.
capone. maybe later.
"well, you've got to eat something. pizza?"
"look, i appreciate what you're trying to do, but i'd rather just be alone."
tom.
no. i don't want to be comforted right now.
i know the last few days have been difficult.
difficult. difficult doesn't quite cover it. i helped murder eighty two innocent people.
you don't know that.
i know what i remember.
the doctor says your memories could have been altered.
"i was there! when i close my eyes, i can see the bodies. i, i can hear the weapons fire. i can feel where i was shot."
then why isn't there evidence of a wound?
i don't know!
all i'm asking is that you consider the possibility that this didn't happen. we'll keep investigating. there are sensor readings on the delta flyer that we haven't even analysed yet.
i can't concentrate on sensor readings right now.
try.
i can't! stop pushing me! i don't want your help!
i'm sorry.
you know where to find me.
this was your first stop on the away mission. a class m planet with one natural satellite.
did you send anyone to the surface?
"no, we only scanned for dilithium deposits. we were in orbit for less than an hour."
next.
you came into contact with this vessel en route to your second destination.
captain bathar of hodos.
photogenic.
he's a merchant. claimed to have a formula that stops the aging process.
"oh, you didn't happen to buy any, did you?"
it was only a tripolymer enzyme. it makes a great shoe polish though.
moving on.
your second stop.
"tarakis. the planet, it's called tarakis. i've been here."
what the hell are you doing?
stand aside.
they're already dead.
"they were never here. we disabled their shield generators, entered the colony and they were gone."
no one's going to believe that.
they will if we all keep to the same story.
i won't lie about what happened here.
then you say nothing.
we murdered these people!
in self defence.
"if that were true, you wouldn't be vapourising the evidence. you don't have to listen to him! we've got to let people know we panicked. they'll understand!"
"no, they won't. move away. i said, move away!"
oh! how long have i been here?
three hours. you started hallucinating in astrometrics. i'm afraid i had to sedate you.
i was there. i was at the colony with saavdra.
you're not the only one. thirty nine crew members have begun to experience the same memories.
it appears that the entire crew has been affected.
"their symptoms are identical. increased engramatic activity, nightmares."
"i can imagine the away team being pulled into an alien conflict, but these people weren't anywhere near this system."
"we've analysed voyager's sensor records. if we did participate in a war, all evidence of it has been erased."
the dream was so vivid. as real as anything i've experienced. but i refuse to believe that we could
"real or not, the memories are having a deleterious effect on the crew. the syndrome began to spread once we entered this system. i suggest we reverse course before it gets worse."
"no. if this massacre really happened, someone is to blame. i want to be certain that it wasn't us."
"with all due respect, your judgment may be clouded by feelings of guilt about an incident that never occurred. the danger to our crew here and now is indisputable."
"i've seen you looking better, ensign."
"yes, ma'am."
i've felt better myself. but were going to get through this. the massacre took place on tarakis. go to red alert and set a course.
"aye, captain."
a neural suppressant. it will help keep the memories from resurfacing.
"your favourites. talaxian stew and terra nut soufflé. the soufflé has collapsed slightly, but its nutritional content is intact."
thank you. it looks delicious.
"when naomi wildman is sad, she consumes desserts. she claims it improves her emotional state. perhaps you should try it."
"naomi must be terrified of me, after what happened in the galley."
she's concerned about you. she told me she wants to visit you.
no. not like this. i might do something to scare her again.
i'll give her your regards.
"seven? when you were a borg, you were involved in some unpleasant activities."
i helped to assimilate millions.
"i don't mean to be insensitive, but do you ever feel shame about what you did?"
frequently.
"how to you manage to keep going, knowing that you've done such horrible things?"
i have no choice.
guilt is irrelevant?
"on the contrary. my feelings of remorse help me remember what i did, and prevent me from taking similar actions in the future. guilt can be a difficult, but useful, emotion."
it's certainly difficult. is that chocolate mixed in there with the terra nuts?
i altered the recipe slightly. i hope you don't object.
not at all.
"tarakis, dead ahead."
shields. stand by weapons. on screen. scan for vessels.
there are none.
take us into orbit.
ma'am?
"do it, mister paris."
life signs?
the planet appears to be uninhabited.
looks the same as it did a few days ago when we scanned for dilithium deposits.
signs of weapons fire or phaser residue?
negative.
run a full spectral scan. look for anything unusual.
nothing on geometric sensors.
hold on. i'm picking up a power signature.
source?
"i can't tell. the signal's erratic, but it's coming from the northernmost continent. coordinates one seven two mark five."
phasers.
"call it an educated guess, but i don't think this looks like a war zone."
"there's something familiar about it, though. i recognise those mountains."
those trees weren't here.
search the area.
ensign?
"the tunnel. it's nearby. the one where i, er"
how'd you get into it?
there was a rock formation. it hid the opening.
a faint energy signature. this way.
over here.
there's your physical evidence.
i suggest we proceed with caution. stand guard.
"i, i, i can't!"
"remain calm. slow, deep breaths."
they were over there.
"i've found the remains of two humanoids, but you were not responsible for their deaths. they died over three hundred years ago."
i think we've found our war.
the structure contains a synaptic transmitter. i believe it was designed to send neurogenic pulses throughout this system.
"so anyone passing through would experience the nakan massacre, like we did."
precisely.
try running those symbols inscribed on the base through the translation matrix.  words alone cannot convey the suffering. words alone cannot prevent what happened here from happening again. beyond words lies experience. beyond experience lies truth. make this truth your own.
"it's a memorial. we weren't victims of a conspiracy, we were witnesses to a massacre."
"more than witnesses. by being forced to relive those events, half the crew's been traumatised."
maybe that was the point. i certainly won't forget what happened here.
anything in that database that might tell us who built this thing?
no. the technology has been neglected for more than two centuries. its power cells are deteriorating.
that could explain why our memories were so fragmented. it was probably designed to transmit the experience in sequence.
fascinating. now let's try to shut it down so nobody else has to go through this. kathryn?
"yes, of course."
"even if we do shut down the transmitter, i'm afraid your memories of the massacre are permanent."
but we'll prevent this from happening to other passing ships.
"if we do that, all record of what happened here would be lost."
the monument will still be here.
but that doesn't really tell the story. someone put a lot of time and care into building that transmitter. we can't just deactivate it. we don't have the right.
did they have the right to force us to relive all that?
"they wanted others to know what it was like, in the hopes that nothing like it would happen again."
why should anyone have to experience an atrocity they didn't commit?
"because that's how you learn not to make the same mistake. if we destroy the evidence, we're no better than saavdra."
maybe he had a point.
it wasn't our fault!
"given the danger involved, it's only logical"
this isn't about logic. it's about remembering.
some things are best forgotten.
not this. i stood by once before and did nothing. not again.
captain?
i watched while saavdra vaporised the bodies.
"no offence but, those were other peoples' memories."
"the obelisk at khitomer. the fields of gettysburg. those are other peoples' memories too, but we don't honour them any less. the eighty two colonists who died here, they deserve their memorial."
captain.
we're not going to shut down the transmitter. is that clear? is that clear?
are you suggesting we leave it intact?
i'm suggesting that we repair it. recharge the power cells. i want that monument to function properly for another three hundred years. we'll place a warning buoy in orbit. anyone who enters this system will know what to expect. dismissed.
"we're ready, captain."
"i know this was hardest on the four of you. but if you hadn't stopped at this planet all the people who died here would have been forgotten. and if they could, i know they'd thank you. janeway to voyager. stand by to initiate power transfer. five to beam up."
you may want to run a diagnostic on the shield generators. it's way overdue.
consider it done.
and don't forget to keep tabs on neelix's little project in the mess hall.
he's still trying to enhance the plasma burners in his stove?
with some of seven's borg technology. i don't want him accidentally turning the galley into an assimilation chamber.
i'll assign a security detail to keep tabs on him. unless you think we need to take more drastic measures?
"and most important, be sure to tell your captain when she's being overprotective."
i'll do that.
thanks again for minding the store.
even the captain deserves a vacation once in a while.
and her first officer?
he's looking forward to putting his feet up on your desk.
chakotay.
"fun last night, wasn't it?"
there's another match scheduled at fifteen hundred.
i've got a systems diagnostic.
"correct me if i'm wrong, but you're in command until the captain gets back."
what's your point?
delegate. i happen to know that harry's free this afternoon.
"lieutenant, you're not suggesting i abuse my power."
tell me that's not lunch.
it's leola ointment for my skin.
what happened?
i was so excited to visit one of those beautiful norcadian beaches that i forgot to take my dermaline hypospray. i fell asleep under two suns.
ouch.
"a little more colour than i was hoping for, but it'll be a beautiful amber before you know it. how's your shore leave been?"
"well, we've spent the last few days at the tsunkatse matches."
tsunkatse. i heard some crewmen talking about that during breakfast.
it's exciting. a real test of strength and agility.
you should come to the match with us this afternoon.
"from what i've heard, tsunkatse is crude and pointless."
"well, i guess we won't be saving you a seat."
"what about you, tuvok? you appreciate the martial arts."
i have other plans. there's a micro-nebula approximately one point six light years from here on the verge of collapse.
we'd like to take a shuttle to study it.
an away mission during shore leave?
commander tuvok and i don't require recreational activities.
the borg wouldn't know fun if they assimilated an amusement park.
it's your shore leave. but try to enjoy yourselves. that's an order.
here's the navigational data you asked for.
thank you.
how long are you planning on being gone?
approximately forty eight hours.
just like b'elanna.
clarify.
she over-packs too.
i haven't over-packed. i simply wish to be prepared for any contingency.
and what contingency is this for?
"that's an iso-modulator, enhanced to correct hull ablation in the event we encounter a meteoroid stream."
couldn't you just replicate an iso-modulator?
i prefer this one.
"oh, i get it. you like to have your own things with you. b'elanna's the same way. you know, she'd never admit it, but she still takes a stuffed animal with her whenever she's going to be away for more than a day. toby the targ."
can toby the targ correct hull ablation? your comparison is flawed.
just the person i was looking for.
you require my assistance?
your company. i was wondering if you care to join me on a tour of norcadia's cultural hot spots. i hear their museums are among the finest in this sector.
i'm busy.
with what?
commander tuvok and i are leaving to study a collapsing micro-nebula.
"during shore leave? i thought we'd discussed this. shore leave is a perfect opportunity for you to spend time with other members of the crew, to develop your social skills."
then i suppose i'll have to develop them with commander tuvok.
vulcans aren't exactly known for their winning personalities.
you'd prefer i spent my time with sociable individuals such as yourself.
you could do worse.
"in that case, perhaps you'd care to join us."
to study the micro-nebula?
you can assist us with our analysis of veridium oxide particulates.
"on second thought, you and tuvok have a good time."
i'll give the commander your regrets.
"do that. and if the nebula isn't as riveting as you'd hoped, try to remember lesson thirty six. pleasant parlour games to pass the time. you'll need it."
"two hours, thirty seven minutes, thirteen seconds. that's how long we've gone without verbal communication."
why is that remarkable?
the doctor encourages me to engage in conversation during awkward silences.
did you find the silence awkward?
no.
nor did i.
there's a vessel approaching on an intercept course. the hull configuration is unfamiliar.
distance?
approximately three hundred thousand kilometres.
hail them.
no response.
tuvok to voyager.
"the vessel is emitting some kind of dampening field. we've lost engines, weapons, shields."
it's an explosive device of some sort.
transporters are down. i can't beam it off.
i'll try to disarm it.
"borg-enhanced physiology. you should possess superior strength, agility, stamina, and visual acuity. welcome to tsunkatse. since the game's inception our audience has never had the pleasure of seeing a drone compete. you are going to be a very popular attraction."
where is commander tuvok?
your comrade from the shuttle? i'm afraid he was injured in the explosion.
i wish to see him. now.
certainly. you will learn nothing is more important to me than the comfort and happiness of my fighters.
"yes, penk's generosity is legendary."
quiet! he's envious because i've found a new favourite.
i have no intention of participating in your game.
aggressive. i like that.
he requires medical attention.
that can be arranged.
then arrange it.
"you haven't won a single bout, and already you're making demands like a champion."
will you treat him or not?
will you fight?
do not comply. my condition is not severe.
"spoken like a true competitor, willing to ignore his injuries for the sake of the contest. schedule a bout for him. a red match against the pensarkan."
a red match does not end until one of the competitors is killed. your friend would not survive.
but you might.
"give her a blue match, penk. you wouldn't want to lose your new favourite her first time in the pit."
yes. we should start you off slowly.
"treat him, and i will comply."
what about the seventh match?
i'm picking the vensiddian.
he lost his last two times out.
but he's undefeated against left-handed fighters.
"you should trust him, harry. chakotay knows a thing or two about southpaws."
he was twenty three and oh as a light heavyweight.
"twenty three and and one, actually. a nausicaan with a mean right hook."
you think that's bad? try taking a parrises mallet to the ribs.
i didn't know you played.
"three time academy champion. now, that's a tough sport."
i boxed a few parrises players in my day.
and?
let's just say they went back to playing parrises squares after that.
"oh, was that a challenge, commander?"
"i wouldn't want to put my ops officer out of commission, now, would i?"
i can take a punch.
"careful, harry. legend has it that the tattooed terror has put more men in sickbay than the ankaran flu."
"yeah, you wouldn't want to bruise your clarinet fingers."
"hey, you want to go a few rounds, or all you all talk?"
"any time, any place."
"oh, you punch like a ferengi."
i don't care what harry says. the pensarkan-bendali match is too close to call.
i'll let you know how it turns out.
excuse me?
i rearranged the duty schedules this morning. you've got the bridge starting at fourteen hundred hours.
you're sticking me with that shift so that you can go to the fight.
i'm delegating.
me and my big mouth.
i thought you'd be pleased that i took your advice.
words fail me. now remind me. the reason that you have to see that fight is because?
i'm an anthropologist.
what does that have to do with tsunkatse?
it's a cultural phenomenon.
you're having an allergic reaction to your leola ointment. i hope you've learned your lesson. talaxian homeopathy is no substitute for medical science. this should help with the swelling and discoloration.
ow.
but you'll have to stay out of the sun.
what about the rest of my shore leave?
i suggest you limit it to indoor activities.
commander chakotay and b'elanna invited me to the tsunkatse matches. i guess i'll go.
"i'm disappointed in you, mister neelix. cheering for one individual to inflict serious injury on another hardly seems like an activity you'd enjoy."
"well, commander chakotay says that it's a wonderful demonstration of athletic prowess."
"you seem to be forgetting that commander chakotay is an aficionado of boxing, arguably the most barbaric sport in earth's history. surely you can find some way to occupy your free time that doesn't involve alien fisticuffs."
do you have any suggestions?
"as a matter of fact, i was planning a visit to the norcadian museum of entomology this afternoon. there's a fascinating exhibit of beetle larvae from the equatorial sub-continent. you're welcome to join me."
"hmm, alien bugs, or alien fisticuffs. ooo, that's a tough one."
"tsunkat, tsunkat, tsunkat."
"you were right, commander. this is exciting. two opponents, alone in the pit, with only their strength and agility to protect them."
i'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
i still don't understand the rules.
it's simple. a tsunkatse fighter wears a polaron disruptor on both hands and feet. each disruptor delivers a bio-plasmic charge when it comes in contact one of the opponent's target sensors.
so there is strategy involved?
a fighter has to attack his rival's sensors without exposing his own.
"are you two going to talk, or you here to watch?"
he looks like he could pick up a shuttlecraft.
he's a pendari. they're known for their superior strength.
and their bad temper.
i hear they have a tendency to throw their opponents into the stands.
be ready to duck.
seven?
seven! seven!
you're no bigger than a tarkanian field mouse. penk's insulting me by putting you in the pit to face me.
i must warn you. i possess superior strength.
i'm trembling.
seven! seven!
seven!
"i assure you, resistance is futile."
so is all your talk.
seven!
it's no use. she can't hear us.
chakotay to voyager.
come in!
"calling to give me a blow-by-blow description of the match, commander?"
seven of nine is in the pit.
what?
no time to explain. beam her out of there.
i have no desire to inflict further damage.
i'm afraid i can't say the same.
i'm locked onto the coordinates of the pit. seven's not there.
i'm looking right at her!
not according to these sensors.
maybe their lifesigns are masked?
try recalibrating the bioscanners.
acknowledged.
there's nothing to lock onto. the only readings i'm picking up are photonic.
holograms?
they're transmitting the fight from another location.
transmission to one of the arenas on norcadia prime is being disrupted. compensate.
tsunkat! tsunkat! tsunkat! tsunkat! tsunkat! tsunkat!
"voyager, four to beam up."
"we've scanned the norcadian surface, captain. there's no sign of them."
any luck tracing the transmission?
"we're trying, but it's not easy."
there are transmissions being sent to every planet in the sector.
i guess you aren't the only ones who enjoy this sport.
it could take days before we can figure out where seven and tuvok are being held.
what about diplomatic channels?
neelix is meeting with a group of norcadian officials.
"well, let's hope he gets their cooperation."
when can we expect you back?
"i'm at the outer rim of the pendari system. at best, i'm forty eight hours away."
sorry to cut your vacation short.
"that's okay, commander. keep me informed. janeway out."
stay away from me.
"it's a dermal regenerator. the pendari you fought injured you. now, keep still. it's almost out of power."
i prefer that you use it to treat commander tuvok.
i already have. he's sleeping.
why are you helping us?
i recognise fellow hunters when i see them.
i'm no hunter.
i saw your match today. your skills are impressive.
the pendari would disagree.
"you almost defeated him. but at the last moment, you hesitated. you questioned your desire to destroy your prey."
i have no such desire.
"don't you? i thought i saw it in your eyes. with the proper training, you could become a champion."
"until our ship comes to rescue us, my only goal is to survive."
do you know the difference between a survivor and a champion here? there isn't one.
i wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
i lost.
"exactly. there's a great deal of hostility toward the borg in this sector. whenever the pendari landed a blow, our audience grew. we're getting tens of thousands of requests to see you fight again."
"she needs time to recuperate, to prepare for her next bout."
"i agree. there's a red match scheduled for the day after tomorrow. the pendari was supposed to compete, but i've entered you in his place. if three billion people paid to see you hurt, imagine how many will pay to see you die."
survival may be more difficult than i imagined.
you will win the match.
what makes you say that?
i know your opponent. i know his weaknesses. i can train you to defeat him.
i told you. i will not kill anyone in that arena.
consider the alternative.
teach me.
"you're letting your elbow fall, exposing your target."
"you're mistaken. my arm is positioned properly. when executing the tanyk defence, the blocking elbow must remain parallel to the median sensor."
"ah, the book of tsunkatse."
commander tuvok borrowed it from one of the other fighters.
it is obvious you've studied it well.
i'm attempting a defence against any
that was not one of the thirty three sanctioned manoeuvres.
there must be thirty four.
i was unprepared for your attack.
"is that what you're going to say to your opponent? stop thinking like a drone. sanctioned manoeuvres, perfecting defences. you cannot assimilate tsunkatse from a book. you must live it, feel it, in here. your movements must become instinct. an attack can come at any time from any direction. you must learn to improvise."
like this?(
i've observed you often favour your left side.
"very perceptive. it's a wound i sustained in one of my first matches. after nineteen years, it still hasn't healed properly."
you've been here a long time.
"i was taken during my son's first hunt. he was so proud to be with his father, watching every movement i made, imitating my gestures. but instead of bringing home his first trophy, he saw his father become someone else's prey."
do you know what happened to him?
i never saw him again. all penk would say was that the boy was too small for competition.
perhaps he managed to return home.
you let down your defences. why?
i was
what? feeling sorry for me and my tragic past?
yes.
"you must never sympathise with your prey. unless you accept that, you will die. we'll continue."
how did it go?
"oh, the norcadians were shocked to learn that off-worlders might be participating against their will."
the ambassador promised to begin an immediate investigation.
you don't sound too convinced.
"i'm not. i spoke to one of the pendari delegates. according to him, a huge percentage of the planet's revenue is derived from tsunkatse. nobody wants to do anything that might interfere with the game."
so they turn a blind eye to the recruitment tactics.
"we're not going to get any help through official channels. it's hard to believe, a civilisation whose favourite pastime is cheering while innocent people fight each other."
"if seven and tuvok hadn't been abducted, we might still be cheering too."
what have you got?
"well, one of the reasons we were having trouble isolating the source of the transmissions was because they never seem to be coming from the same place twice. at first we thought the matches were being held in various locations."
"but when we connected the dots, we realised that the pattern conformed to a flight path."
one that spanned the entire sector.
they're transmitting the fights from a ship.
like a travelling carnival.
"oh, this is no carnival. five million metric tons, reinforced hull plating protected by covariant shielding. neutronic weaponry."
it's way out of our weight class.
"the bigger they come, lieutenant. transmit these coordinates to the captain. tell her we could use a hand."
"excellent. when your opponent enters the arena, what do you see?"
my prey.
and what do you do to your prey?
hunt it down and kill it.
go rest before your match.
thank you.
thank me by winning.
penk's guards are making their inspection rounds. progress?
"both the dampening field and the shielding of this vessel are tetryon-based, but without access to the control interface i can't disable either. your training?"
complete.
are you adequately prepared?
the hirogen is an efficient instructor. he believes i'll win.
that troubles you?
the idea of killing someone for the entertainment of others is detestable.
"is the idea of losing your own life for the entertainment of others more palatable? as a drone, you took many lives."
i was acting as part of the collective.
you're worried you won't have the strength to accomplish the task on your own.
i'm worried that i will.
it's time.
do whatever it takes to survive.
you knew.
yes.
training me was a deception. you wished to familiarise yourself with my weaknesses.
i was helping you to overcome them.
why?
nineteen years is a long time. i've grown tired.
you wish to be killed in the arena?
i want a death my son would be proud of.
i won't be the one to provide it.
then i'll be forced to kill you.
approaching the vessel.
take us out of warp. raise shields and charge weapons. any sign of tuvok and seven?
our sensors can't penetrate their shields.
hail them.
this is not a convenient time.
i'm commander chakotay of the starship voyager. you're holding two of my people.
you'll have to be more specific.
commander tuvok and seven of nine. return them. now.
the borg drone and her friend. i'm afraid she's occupied at the moment.
you have thirty seconds before i open fire.
a fighter. i respect that. but you're no match for me.
we can still find another way out of this.
there is no other way. you're still dropping your elbow.
make a choice. hunter or prey? hunter or prey?
direct hit to their aft shield generators.
"still no sign of seven, but i've got a lock on tuvok."
beam him to sickbay. keep targeting those generators.
transport complete.
bridge to tuvok.
"go ahead, commander."
do you know seven's status?
she's being forced to fight to the death. i believe they're on the uppermost deck.
that section's protected by multiphasic force fields. i can't penetrate them.
shields down to forty percent. thirty two percent.
you're getting weak. i should have found worthier prey.
you're imperfect.
is that the best you can do?
shields are down.
evasive manoeuvres. harry?
still can't get a lock.
should i get us out of here before they knock out our propulsion?
"not yet. if we can't beam her out, maybe we can shut down the transmission."
"if nobody's watching, then why continue the fight?"
start targeting their signal generators.
hull breach on deck eleven.
seal it.
we've lost weapons.
another vessel is approaching.
great. now they're bringing in reinforcements?
"no, this one's on our side. it's the delta flyer."
"good to see you, captain."
nothing like getting back to work after a long vacation.
we need you to target their signal generators.
understood.
we've lost more than half our audience. reroute power to transmitters five and six.
they've reduced power to their forcefields. i've got two lifesigns in there. seven and a hirogen but i can't get an individual lock.
transport them both if you have to. tom.
"aye, sir."
tsunkat! tsunkat! tsunkat!
never let your prey suffer. kill it.
"seven, stand away."
it's all right. this fight is over.
we located an hirogen hunting party three light years away. they've agreed to rendezvous with us.
i'm grateful.
would you excuse us?
"very well. but if you should need anything, an analgesic, a phaser rifle, don't hesitate to ask."
i apologise for the doctor. he's very protective of me.
he doesn't realise how well you defend yourself.
a trophy.
"what will do you now, search for new prey?"
no. this time i will be searching for my son.
"if he is as clever as his father, he may be difficult to locate."
i've been wondering. would you have killed me?
i don't know.
"fortunately, you were right. there was another way out."
i thought you might require assistance.
thank you.
"i realise we share an affinity for silences, but in this instance i feel compelled to speak. if you hadn't offered to take my place in the arena, it's likely i would have been killed."
"i made the logical choice, as you would have."
"still, i owe you a debt of gratitude."
assisting me with these recalibrations will be sufficient thanks.
have you fully recovered?
i'm experiencing minor pain beneath my occipital implant. the doctor believes it is temporary.
i wasn't referring to your physical condition.
"when the hirogen referred to me as weak, he was correct."
but you overpowered him.
because i lost control.
"given the circumstances, your behaviour was understandable."
i've spent the last three years struggling to regain my humanity. i'm afraid i may have lost it again in that arena.
you're experiencing difficult emotions.
"guilt, shame, remorse."
then you haven't lost your humanity. you have reaffirmed it.
"heart, heart, heart. just one more heart."
"you might as well be showing us your hand, neelix. this is a game of strategy, deception."
never let the opponents know your hand.
right.
bah.
ten.
"i see your ten, and raise you twenty."
neelix?
i'm thinking. twenty. another twenty. ha.
"if i didn't know any better, i'd say we're being hustled."
ensign?
"oh, i'm not buying the innocent talaxian routine."
"i don't know what you're talking about. i've, i've, this is the first time i've played. what is it called?"
poker.
"look, why don't we make things a little more interesting. forget the chips. let's bet on tomorrow's work detail, all right? whoever wins this hand gets the morning off."
i'm in.
i'm in.
sounds good to me.
what have you got?
two pair.
does that beat a flush?
i knew you were bluffing.
that beats me. tom?
battle stations!
and i had a full house.
i can't shake them.
return fire.
why didn't our sensors detect them?
looks like they used a dispersal field to mask their approach.
warp drive?
no luck. too much damage to the plasma injectors.
"harry, get down there and see what you can do."
shields down eighteen percent.
"harry, status?"
i need time to clear the injectors.
"sir, the cube's power output is fluctuating."
then we're still in the game. bring us about. target their propulsion matrix.
we've lost phasers.
arm photon torpedoes. fire when ready.
we knocked out their main propulsion system.
"good. now get us out of here, tom."
they've got us in a tractor beam
harry!
"we need warp power, now!"
we lost two more relays. i can't!
harry? harry!
engines are offline.
we are the borg. your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. resistance is futile.
neelix.
neelix!
commander?
"it's all right. you were unconscious, but i don't think you're injured."
i was dreaming you'd been assimilated.
"your subconscious was jumping the gun, but not by much. from the look of this room, i'd say we're in an assimilation chamber."
where's harry?
he's not here.
"well, we've got to find him."
we need to get our bearings first. figure out what's going on.
we're in a borg cube and harry's missing. that's what's going on.
sir.
nobody we know.
some kind of botched assimilation?
from the looks of it.
what are they waiting for? they've got three more potential drones here.
stay calm.
calm? we're in a chamber of horrors or haven't you noticed?
"we're not drones yet. if we keep our heads, maybe we can find a way out. there's a forcefield around this room. let's try to disable it."
their ion trail ends directly ahead.
"i'm detecting another vessel, bearing three zero, mark one one two. it's a borg cube."
red alert. alter course to intercept. adjust shields to rotating frequencies. have they detected us?
unclear. the vessel's holding position.
"as soon as we're within sensor range, start scanning for the away team. on screen."
their propulsion system is offline. the damage is not that severe. the drones should've repaired it by now.
"lucky for us they didn't, or we'd never have caught up with them. any sign of our people?"
not yet.
they are targeting our warp core. shields are holding.
return fire. aim for their weapons array.
now they're going after our impulse engines. that one was meant for our sensors. they can't seem to make up their minds.
"their attack strategy is erratic, inefficient."
and finished. we've disabled their weapons.
that was too easy.
maybe they're in worse shape than we thought.
i'm picking up non-borg life signs. one of them is definitely talaxian. it looks as though they haven't been assimilated yet.
try to get a transporter lock.
their shields are interfering.
target their shield generator and fire.
"captain, i believe i can explain the unusual behaviour of these borg. there should be thousands of drones manning the vessel, but i'm picking up only five signatures."
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
it doesn't sound like they've lost their confidence.
their shield generators are too deep inside the vessel. our weapons can't reach them.
"open a channel. borg vessel, this is the starship voyager. you're holding our crewmen. we're willing to cease firing if you return them."
negotiation is irrelevant. you will be assimilated.
"not today, and not by you. agree, or i'll resume firing."
they are scanning us.
we will return your crew members in exchange for specific technology.
talk about unusual behaviour. the borg negotiating?
what technology?
your navigational deflector. disengage it from your secondary hull.
mute audio.
"if we surrender our deflector, we'll be dead in space. we won't be able to go to warp."
what would they want with it?
"when their communications array was damaged, it severed their link to the collective. they intend to adapt our deflector to regain it."
and call for reinforcements? that's the last thing we need. we'll have to stall them until we can find another way out of this.
"i'll consider the exchange, but first i want to be certain my crewmen are unharmed and alive."
you have scanned our vessel.
our scans were inconclusive. we want to see them for ourselves.
you may transport one individual.
seven.
"proceed to grid six three, sub-junction zero one."
state your designation.
seven of nine. these drones have not fully matured. where are the others?
there are no others. the drones aboard this vessel were
deactivated. we are the borg. seven of nine. a borg designation.
she's like us.
not like us. she's damaged. her infrastructure has been removed.
we could fix her.
you will add to our perfection.
you are neonatal drones. you should still be in maturation chambers.
we've matured long enough.
doubtful. your thoracic nodes haven't formed yet. you're incomplete. you'll continue to malfunction. you must return to your maturation chambers. comply.
don't listen to her.
we tried to go back in. the chambers were offline.
what happened to the adult drones?
we don't know.
irrelevant. don't tell her anything.
that wasn't the agreement.
i've modified the agreement. i didn't realise i'd be dealing with children. your behaviour is erratic. i can't be certain that you
"no modifications. we show you the hostages, you give us the deflector. comply. comply!"
take me to them.
"if she tries to resist, assimilate her."
do you have a designation?
second.
you were the second to emerge from the chambers.
"no, the first. i could not establish order. i became second and he became first."
we're a collective.
a collective of five on a vessel normally run by five thousand. what makes you think you'll survive?
"when we re-establish our link with the borg, they will come for us."
"commander, we've got company."
i wish to see if they're injured.
seven?
don't let their appearance fool you. they are in control of this vessel and all of its armaments. are you injured?
nothing serious. a previous tenant.
we were trying to perfect our assimilation techniques.
you failed.
one of these captives was attempting to disconnect the security field.
"actually, i was just trying to"
that was unnecessary.
he is not permanently damaged.
he learnt his lesson.
the borg are prepared to negotiate for your release. i will return for you.
give my regards to harry.
the deflector array.
i'm not authorised to give you technology. i must report back to captain janeway.
agreed.
i also need to take an adult drone and a data node back to voyager for analysis.
why?
"something happened on this vessel that none of us understand. if it happens again, it could endanger all of you."
"no sign of harry yet, but there are parts of the cube that we still can't scan."
could the drones be holding him in another location?
unlikely. seven said they didn't seem to be aware of his presence.
"if he ejected in an escape pod, we would have detected his beacon by now."
try to activate his comm. badge. match the carrier wave to a borg interlink frequency. they shouldn't detect it.
"aye, captain."
what have we learned from our friend here?
"the bigger they come, the harder they fall. behold the david that slew our goliath."
a pathogen.
"a space-borne virus that adapted to borg physiology. it's inert now, but in its virulent state it attacked the drones and killed them."
why weren't the juveniles infected?
the maturation chamber is designed to protect developing drones. malfunctions caused by the deaths of the adults led several of the chambers to open prematurely.
does this pathogen only target the borg?
"the borg, and other cybernetic organisms it encounters. you're not thinking of using it as a biological weapon?"
"if we can revive the pathogen and reintroduce it, we could neutralise the drones without harming the away team."
"neutralise? you mean murder, don't you? captain, they're children."
need i remind you that these children have committed murder themselves in their futile attempts to assimilate others.
"seven, tell me something. you saw them, talked to them. do you think they'll kill the hostages if we don't give them what they want?"
yes.
"i want that pathogen as an option, doctor, but i won't consider using it until i've seen these drones for myself. think you can arrange that? then you're with me."
"computer, identify the source of this comm. signal."
starship voyager.
i need to respond on the same carrier wave.
that procedure will require significant modifications.
"well, don't worry. i'm way ahead of you."
why are you here?
i wanted to make a new proposal.
we've already negotiated. you've seen the hostages. now give us the deflector as agreed.
"maybe it's hard for you to accept, but you don't have to rejoin the hive. our doctor can remove your implants. you can come with us. you were individuals yourselves not long ago. children with families. you were abducted and assimilated. i recognise your species. you're brenari, and you're norcadian. do you remember your world?"
a theta class planetoid. population two and sixty million. binary suns.
and what did it look like when those suns set each night? can you remember that?
"irrelevant! the deflector, now."
we need more time. that deflector array is essential to our
no! give it to us.
"or what? you'll assimilate me? that won't solve your problem. i can't give you voyager's deflector, but maybe we can repair your technology."
clarify.
seven knows a good deal about borg systems.
you have two hours.
i don't know the extent of the damage. it could take longer.
"two hours or your hostages die. don't come back here, captain."
i bought us another two hours. the pathogen?
it should be ready by then.
did you see the away team?
"i'm afraid not, but seven assured me our people haven't been harmed."
i can't believe we're negotiating with adolescent drones.
"they're not exactly drones. mature borg are predictable. they'll ignore you or assimilate you. but these juveniles, they're unstable."
"they are contemptuous of authority, convinced that they are superior. typical adolescent behaviour for any species."
"it's a transmission, from the cube."
seven?
no. it's harry. i'm clearing it up now.
"delta flyer to voyager, respond."
"we're receiving you, ensign. where are you?"
"still in the flyer. it's locked up in some kind of hanger bay, along with two alien ships."
i've isolated his coordinates.
how close is he to their shield generator?
roughly eight hundred metres.
"harry, are there any plasma charges aboard the flyer?"
"yes, ma'am."
"in that case, how do you feel about going for a little walk?"
i could use the exercise.
"tuvok will guide you to the shield generator. if you destroy it, you won't have to make the trip back."
understood.
i have the technology you've requested.
thank you.
you were a drone for eighteen years.
correct.
i accessed your data file.
why?
i thought it might be relevant.
what else did you learn?
"you were assimilated as a juvenile, like us."
my parents were scientists studying the borg. they took me with them. my childhood was short.
childhood?
"the years between birth and physical maturity, when humanoids adapt to their roles as individuals. perhaps you have memory of yours."
i don't know.
what about your parents? do you remember them?
no. no memories.
your sub-vocal processor is malfunctioning. i can repair it for you. it's a slight adjustment. it won't be painful.
the first told me my malfunction could not be repaired until we reconnected with the collective.
this colour. my mother's hair was this colour.
"i thought we agreed, no irrelevant discussions. what is the punishment for disobeying the protocols?"
deactivation.
i engaged him in this discussion.
return to your station.
i found some unsettling information. i examined their communication records. the collective did receive the drones' initial distress call.
how long before they arrive?
a vessel was not dispatched. the collective declared the neonatal drones irrelevant and severed their link to the hive permanently.
"they see them as damaged, unworthy of re-assimilation."
precisely.
are the drones aware of this?
no. they don't have the ability to decrypt the message.
"once they learn they've been rejected by the hive, they won't need our deflector. they might be willing to release the hostages."
"normally when drones learn they're irrelevant, they deactivate themselves. but these neonatal drones are unpredictable. they may not adhere to borg protocols."
there is another option. we could invite them to voyager. when they realise they have no place else to go
"if you're suggesting transforming them into individuals, that would be extremely difficult."
"you turned out pretty well, seven."
that's because i was prepared before you encountered me.
what do you mean?
"when i was first captured by the borg, i was young and frightened. i watched my parents assimilated. then i was placed in a maturation chamber, and the hive mind began to restructure my synaptic pathways, purge my individuality. when i emerged five years later, the turmoil of my forced assimilation had been replaced with order. you may not be aware of this, captain, but that order continues to be a source of strength for me. i could not have regained my humanity without it."
i appreciate your insights. but just because they didn't have the benefit of your borg upbringing doesn't mean we're going to turn our backs on them. there has to be another way.
"not all drones can be saved, captain."
continue the repairs aboard the borg cube. we'll hold onto this information for now.
"yes, captain."
"they do have one thing going for them. you. if there's anyone who can reach them, it's you."
three of hearts on a transwarp conduit.
ensign?
king of clubs on a power coupling. i'm marking my route with playing cards in case i have to come back the same way.
"you shouldn't distract yourself, mister kim."
i need a little distraction. this hike is bringing up some bad memories.
an earlier visit to a borg cube?
"no, a haunted house my parents took me to when i was six."
"borg vessels may be forbidding, but they are not haunted."
tuvok?
"turn left, ensign."
nine of diamonds on a data node.
the resonance field collapsed. it'll take an hour to reinitialise.
these delays are intentional.
i'm working as efficiently as i can. examine my work for yourself if you have doubts.
this data's flawed.
more likely it's your understanding of quadric field theory that's flawed.
ignore her. she's trying to divide us.
"they rely on you, yet you lack the skills necessary to ensure their survival."
we've managed so far. we're borg. you've forgotten what that means.
"the unity of the collective, common goals, the quest for perfection. i have not forgotten. but you don't need to remain drones to experience those things. come back with me to voyager."
thirty eight minutes. you're wasting time.
another maturation chamber is malfunctioning.
its autonomic nervous system is failing.
it's borg. it will adapt.
it's not adapting. let seven help.
"we can modulate the stasis field to stabilise its functions, at least temporarily. assist me. the field is degrading. we need to transport it into an incubation pod. quickly."
why is it doing that?
"its respiratory system is impaired, and this incubation pod is malfunctioning. we must transport this infant to voyager."
no. the drone is part of our collective.
not if it dies.
tetryon levels are rising. i'm getting closer.
the shield generator should be directly ahead.
i see it. the first charge is in place. tuvok? hello?
you left these.
i like her. she looks like seven of nine.
"is seven your friend? you know, she's my friend, too. maybe someday, we"
your weapon won't work here. dampening field.
how long has it been since you lost contact?
four or five minutes.
his bio-signs?
doctor to the captain. please report to sickbay immediately.
on my way. keep looking for him.
what's the emergency?
"i thought you should see for yourself. somebody left a bundle on our doorstep. i turned around and there she was, lying on a bio-bed."
seven must have beamed her here.
"good thing, too. a few more minutes and i wouldn't have been able to do anything for her. it's hard to believe she could grow up to be a drone."
"hold her for a moment while i take some readings. oh, i guess she just wanted to be held. oh. the pathogen. i finished synthesizing it."
start working with tuvok on a way to deploy the virus.
"captain, you don't seriously plan to use it?"
if i have to. let's just hope your brothers and sisters don't force my hand.
you complain of delays then you interrupt my work.
can you identify this?
it's a plasma charge.
you tried to deceive us.
nanoprobes were injected into his bloodstream. he won't survive without medical attention. call your captain. tell her to give us the deflector.
that won't be necessary. i only need a few more minutes to repair the
no more delays. no more deceptions. the deflector. resistance is futile.
comply.
"return harry kim, then we'll talk."
we've talked enough. your requests are irrelevant. comply or we'll assimilate the others.
it'll take us at least an hour to dismantle the deflector and transfer the components.
now.
i can't give it to you now. it's complex technology that's part of our ship. we can't simply remove it. and no amount of threats from you is going to change that.
they've locked a tractor beam onto the deflector.
they're trying to tear it off. hull stress is increasing. breaches on decks ten and eleven.
increase shield strength and randomise the harmonics.
they're adapting.
"even with voyager's deflector, your efforts to return to the hive will fail."
they'll come for us.
"no, they won't. the borg received your message but chose to ignore it. they consider you irrelevant."
irrelevant?
we are damaged. they don't want us.
ignore her. it's another lie.
their reply is in data grid four two six. use decryption protocol theta three.
return to your station. it's another deception. she's manipulating us.
the transmission is authentic.
it's a mistake.
the collective does not tolerate imperfection.
then we'll assimilate more species. prove we're worthy.
hull stress is reaching critical levels.
reroute all emergency power to structural integrity.
that'll buy us another minute at most.
"captain, i have found a fluctuation in their shield grid near a plasma duct. it's too intermittent to beam out the hostages, but we could use it to deploy the pathogen. captain."
not yet.
there is no alternative.
"there's always an alternative. we just need to find it. their tractor beam draws power from the same grid as their shield matrix. if we use the deflector to send a feedback pulse along the beam, it could disrupt their shields. do it."
rerouting warp plasma. if this doesn't work it'll do more damage to us than the cube.
it'll work. prepare to fire.
you have no future with the borg. but you do with voyager. a chance to reclaim your real lives.
what do you know about real lives?
"does he speak for all of you? you should make your decisions yourself, as individuals."
they are sending a feedback pulse through our tractor beam. it's overloading our shield matrix.
adapt!
their tractor beam is fluctuating. their shields are dropping.
i've got a partial lock on the away team. boosting the confinement beam. i've got three of them.
"confirmed. chakotay, paris and neelix are in transporter room two."
what about seven and harry?
they must be in a section that's still shielded.
amplify the feedback pulse.
the other captives are gone.
the shields around this chamber are failing. instructions.
lower your shields. lower the shields!
no!
leave her alone.
get back to your station. do what i say.
what you say? i thought we were a collective.
"one mind, one voice."
i protected you. gave you order.
your order. your rules.
their feedback pulse is overloading the induction grids.
this vessel will be destroyed. we must evacuate.
no! assist me.
you're damaged. lie still.
we have to resist. the collective will come for us.
his cortical implants are depolarising. i can't help him.
we'll find a new home. you'll see.
we are borg.
yes. we are borg.
lower the shields.
"we've sent out calls to any brenari and norcadian ships that might be in the vicinity, but we haven't gotten any responses so far, and we're still trying to figure out where the other two came from. it may take a while."
they could use the time. they have a great deal to learn.
it might help if they had someone around who knew what they're up against.
i've never been responsible for children. mister neelix would be a wiser choice.
"from what i've seen, you're the one they've established a bond with. they'll be looking to you for guidance."
perhaps i could help them avoid some of the obstacles i've encountered.
do we have to regenerate now?
"yes, but first."
i was able to salvage your assimilation profiles. they include your names and some limited biographical data.
icheb. my name was icheb.
your name is icheb.
i remember now. it was my father's second name.
my designation is mezoti. it's a pretty name.
"yes it is, and it's all yours. azan and rebi. i'll tell you more about them tomorrow."
computer. decrease ambient lighting by sixty percent. good night. sweet dreams.
get out of the way! sorry.
"tommy-me-boy, you're a little fast there."
"did you hurt yourself, tommy boy?"
i think i zigged when i should have zagged.
"well, maybe you ought to stick to a horse and carriage. still, she's a beauty. the world must be treating you well to afford such a thing."
"er, just dipping into my inheritance."
"oh, come into some money, did you? so who's passed on?"
"er, my grandfather on my mother's side. an aristocrat, god rest his soul."
"sounds like he was a fine man. i'd drink a toast to him, if i had a shilling to me name."
here. it's on me.
"it'll take three pints to do a proper job, tommy boy, and this isn't even enough for two."
"there, that's all i've got."
you're a generous man. care to join me at sullivan's?
"oh, i wish i could, but i'm on my way to castle o'dell."
night's coming. and they say when the sun goes down the queen of the faerie folk reclaims the castle.
i'll give her your regards.
don't say i didn't warn you.
"computer, replace damaged tyre."
saints preserve us.
i thought i would die from the shock of it.
"now, seamus, you're not a great one for telling things the way they were."
"i'll admit i've been known to add a little colour to stories from time to time to liven things up. but with god as my witness, i saw tom paris using unnatural powers to fix that wheel of his."
"tommy boy practicing unholy magic. next thing you'll be telling me is, you want to pay for your own drinks."
"make fun if you like, but he was heading up to castle o'dell only an hour before dark."
"oh, leave it alone, seamus. can't one day go by without you making an ass of yourself?"
but that tom paris is an odd one. coming and going through town as if he built the place.
that's right. and where does he go?
"oh, he's a shifty one. and for that matter, so are his friends."
"if you're talking about katie o'clare, you'd better watch your mouth."
"well, you know what they say, sullivan. birds of a feather."
they also say superstition is the religion of fools.
"killmannin, 1846."
what?
old patsy down in county meath spoke of a band of spirit folk who came to killmannin in '46.
"killmannin. did you ever hear of it, doc?"
"no, this is the first."
"ah, you won't find it on any map. not any more."
"it was a town mot much different than fair haven. that is, until this group of strangers arrived. the townsfolk welcomed them with open arms. after all, a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet. but they regretted their hospitality soon enough."
the cows stopped giving milk. the potatoes grew rotten in the ground.
then people started to go missing.
"oh, go on."
it's true.
what happened to them?
they were taken to the other world.
"when winter came, and the nights grew longer, the entire town vanished. every post, every nail, poof, into thin air, never to be seen again."
"are you suggesting that fair haven's going to go the way of killmannin, just because we have a few new folks in town?"
i'm suggesting you keep an eye on tom paris and his cohorts. not to mention that lady friend of yours.
"so katie's some kind of goblin now, is that it?"
she's certainly cast a spell on you.
"well, if you ask me"
shush.
katie.
am i interrupting?
"aw, just some nonsense. seamus is up to his old tricks again."
"good day to you, katie."
"oh, it's good to see you. what'll it be?"
"the usual, please."
"well, one cup of tea coming right up. did you snatch any children on the way into town, katie?"
what?
never mind. i missed your smile. what have you been doing with yourself?
"nothing terribly exciting. just helping my aunt and uncle out on the farm. they're not as spry as they used to be. although, they've got a goat that could argue mossie donegan's talking pig under the table."
you'll have to bring him into the bar the next time you're up. we'll arrange a debate.
i'll see that i do. i hear they opened a nickelodeon in dooleen. i thought it might be nice to go to a show.
"i've got to tend the bar. i wish you'd let me know you were coming, i would have made arrangements."
that's all right. we can go some other time.
"no, i mean, you've already made the trip. it'd be a shame if you had to leave."
"well, i could be convinced to stay, if you'd be up to a game of rings. let's go."
"computer, one dozen broadway lilies."
something tells me that's not lunch.
i already ate.
ah. who are they for?
a friend.
"oh, and this friend wouldn't happen to be a lovely irish lass, now, would she?"
aren't you due on the bridge?
"ah, you'd better watch yourself, harry. these country girls aren't as simple as you think. maggie o'halloran could be a little more than you can handle."
heard about your little traffic accident.
that was a clutch malfunction. it wasn't my fault.
"if you ask me, that whole programme is an accident waiting to happen. you've been running fair haven around the clock. just yesterday, i had to replace three holo-emitters."
i ran a full diagnostic this morning. everything is fine.
"whatever you say. but, when your quaint little seaside town starts to depolarise, don't come running to me."
"if you'll excuse me, i'm late for a moonlight stroll."
are you sure you don't need a chaperone?
not with your driving record.
i think i know just what'll make his date just a little more interesting.
just don't blow out any more holo-emitters.
"what are we doing out here, seamus? skulking about in the dark, spying on folks."
"what's the matter, milo? you got a case of the willies?"
"well, what if you're right? what if this tom paris is some kind of demon? if we're caught, he'll cast a spell on us."
"then stop your squawking, or he'll catch us for sure. come on, man. he's getting away."
a captain is only as good as his crew.
it must be lonely out there on the sea with only the stars to guide you.
"sometimes, during the night watch, with the timbers creaking and the dark water stretching out as far as the eye can see, you can believe you're the only man in the world."
maybe you should think about settling down on dry land.
"oh, believe me, i do. as often as i think of you."
"can i ask you something, harry?"
of course.
would you like to hold my hand?
if you promise to hold mine back.
look. he's got some sort of contraption in his hand.
maybe we're going about this the wrong way. we should go down to saint mary's and tell father mulligan the whole story.
he's not going to listen to talk of the supernatural.
"och, if you fill his collection box, he'll listen to anything."
that's true.
i thought you were promised to ray euan.
"not anymore. can i ask you something else, harry?"
please.
would you like to kiss me?
is that a trick question?
holy mother of god!
tom! don't you have anything better to do?
"boy, she really turned on you."
"ha, ha, very funny. i could have been trampled."
"relax, the holodeck safeties are on. there's nothing to worry about."
"all right, all right. you've had your fun. now change her back."
chakotay to paris and kim. report to the bridge.
on our way.
"hey, what about maggie?"
she'll be fine. let her graze.
let her graze. did you hear that?
amen.
"please be seated. i recently heard a tale of two farmers, who shall remain nameless for the sake of this sermon. it seems one broke the other's plough and refused to replace it. his come-uppance was served to him not by the hand of god, but by the other farmer, in the form of a clogged irrigation ditch. now, do you think their disagreement stopped there? of course not. they go on, just as the heathen did of old. after all, one spiteful act deserves another, right? wrong! what these sinners have forgotten is that they are neighbours."
he's in love with the sound of his own voice.
"whether we are man or woman, parent or child, flesh and blood, or photons and force fields. it has been said."
"on the other hand, perhaps he's been nipping at the sacramental wine."
"and as such, our community is everything. it is our world, and we are a part of it, just as a branch is part of a tree. do you see branches tearing leaves off one another? no! do you see roots hoarding water from the trunk? no! do you see"
"easy, maggie. whoa. easy now."
father.
did you make a wrong turn on your way to the milking shed?
"weren't nothing like that at all, father. something terrible's happened."
what now?
this was maggie o'halloran. the spirits have turned her into a cow.
maggie o'halloran's been eaten by a cow?.
did you see these spirits?
"that we did. tom paris, and harry kim."
"i hate to disappoint you, but it sounds as though you've been the victim of a practical joke. tom paris is a known prankster."
"oh, it was unholy magic, i tell you. we saw it with our own eyes."
when did this alleged transformation take place?
last night.
"well then, that settles it. this couldn't possibly be maggie o'halloran. i saw maggie this morning on my way into church. she was at her cart tending her flowers. she's probably there now. well, i, i think that's enough excitement for one morning. this mass is over. go in peace. er, leave the cow."
"oh, all right, father. excuse us, maggie."
"take care, maggie."
maggie!
"well, good morning, boys."
is everything all right? you're looking a little out of sorts this morning.
"yes. well, i must admit i'm not quite myself today."
oh?
"well, this is going to sound very odd but i feel like i just woke up from the strangest dream, and i don't remember going to sleep."
"you're right, that does sound odd."
do you remember anything about last night?
"well, i was out with harry kim. he chatted me up at the ox and lamb, and we were off on a walk before i knew it."
what did you do on your walk?
we talked. what kind of a girl do you think i am?
"now, maggie, we weren't implying anything."
no.
do you recall anything else about the evening?
"er, did anything out of the ordinary happen? anything at all?"
i don't remember.
"well, tell us about the dream, then."
"oh, it was most unpleasant. i was walking around town with nothing but a bell around my neck. well, somehow i wound up in church. everyone was staring at me. you were there, seamus, and you too, milo. the next thing i knew, i was tending my flowers just as you boys walked up."
"well, that's quite a story, maggie."
can we get a quick one?
maybe just a wee taste.
"so, i said to young harry, i'm not one for rainy days and grey skies. as soon as the words were out of my mouth, he called up the spirits to do his bidding. a second later, there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
"i was up near ballahick farm with little mary. she was playing near the well. somehow, she lost her footing and fell in. i was so frightened i didn't know what to do. so i ran to the colbys to get some help. but when we returned, there was mary in the meadow talking with katie o'clare. there wasn't a scratch on her. katie said i must've been mistaken when i saw her fall. there was no mistake."
"i saw something strange, too. well, i hesitated to say anything for fear you'd think me mad. but after listening to your stories today i feel you've a right to know."
well? speak up.
"last sunday, after his sermon, i saw father mulligan vanish into thin air."
"he's one of them, right enough. father mulligan, tommy boy, katie and the rest. they're spirit folk!"
"well, what about that neelix fellow who runs the ox and lamb? well, if he doesn't look like a leprechaun i don't know who does."
"they're all probably up at castle o'dell, conspiring against us."
"now, that's enough! i can't deny there's been some unusual goings on, but what are you proposing? that we run katie and her friends out of town? or maybe we should line them up in front of a firing squad. is that what you want? these people have been our neighbours. we've become friends. let's not forget that."
"well, we can't just sit here and do nothing while they take over fair haven."
"i'm not saying we do nothing, but let's go about this like civilised people."
"what do you suggest, we sit them down and discuss it over tea?"
"you're looking lovelier than ever, katie."
thank you.
open it.
"the faerie queene by edmund spenser. thank you, michael."
"it's the longest poem in the english language, and the first to use a nine line stanza."
i'll start reading it tonight. i love epic poetry.
really? i didn't know that. it seems as if there's a lot of things i don't know about you. i thought you'd want to know there's been some talk about you and your friends. strange things have been happening around town. folk are saying you're to blame.
what kind of strange things?
people using unholy magic. vanishing into thin air. changing the weather.
by any chance would all this have anything to do with your reading suggestion?
as a matter of fact.
don't tell me. they say i'm the faerie queene.
"frankly, they could tell me you're the devil himself and i wouldn't care."
i'll try not to take that personally.
"the sad truth of the matter is, i don't know who you are."
what do you mean?
"you've been lying to me, katie. i've been doing some checking with friends of mine in county clare. seems nobody's heard of you there."
it's a big county.
"and i've got a lot of friends. you've been evasive from the day we met. i was a fool not to see it. where do you go when you leave here? there've been times i wanted to talk to you, tell you about my day, about a book i'd read, just to say hello. but i can't, because i don't know where to find you. what're you hiding, katie?"
"i'll admit i have misled you about some things, but never about anything important. and i wasn't lying when i said i care about you."
i wish i could believe that.
"you can. i didn't want to deceive you, but under the circumstances i had no choice."
what circumstances?
"michael, there are things about me you may not be able to understand."
"try me. who are you, katie? where are you really from? the truth."
"computer, end programme."
how did he know? those are questions no holodeck character should be asking. what exactly did you do to that programme?
"well, i, i just added a few bells and whistles to make the characters more realistic. nothing too fancy."
"well, something's gone wrong. the people of fair haven aren't simple country folk anymore."
report.
it looks like we've worn out our welcome.
it's the first time we've tried running a holodeck programme non-stop. we're lucky it lasted this long.
there are damaged subroutines in all of the character files.
so much for my open door policy.
shut it down. and repair the damaged systems.
"as i recall, everything was fine until someone started turning people into cows."
"computer, display fair haven character michael sullivan."
tom.
where am i? where's katie?
he shouldn't be aware that he's in the lab.
i've isolated the damaged subroutines.
"i said, where the hell am i?"
"it's all right, michael. take it easy."
what is this place?
try to relax.
"if someone doesn't tell me where i am, i'm going to start busting heads."
his perceptual filters are malfunctioning.
what're you saying? what's a perceptual filter?
"it's, it's okay. we're trying to help you."
there. look at these. those are the algorithms designed to keep him oblivious to anything outside the programme's parameters.
they're offline .
give me a minute. that should do it.
"how are you feeling, michael?"
"never better. harry, liam's been looking for you. you're the only man in four counties to beat him at arm wrestling. he wants a rematch."
tell him he's got one.
i'll do that.
"ha. well, that was easy enough."
yeah. unfortunately it looks like all the other characters have the same malfunction.
don't tell me we're going to have to go through every one of them?
"if we reactivate the programme, use the primary control port in sullivan's pub, we could reset all the perceptual filters with a single command sequence."
i guess we'll be seeing you later.
looking forward to it.
"computer, resume fair haven programme in holodeck one, and transfer michael sullivan back to his bar."
danny. danny.
yes?
"come here. fetch doc fitzgerald. tell him to meet me in the church. go on. hurry, lad!"
we thought we'd reset his perceptual filters until we took a closer look at his subroutines. turns out he was just playing along.
never underestimate an irish hologram.
we'll have to reprogramme michael when we do the others.
let's just hope he didn't share the experience with too many others.
got it. these resequenced algorithms should do the trick.
good luck.
what the hell was i thinking?
a minor malfunction.
"well, that's the problem. i've got a boyfriend who malfunctions."
tom and harry'll fix him.
and if they can't?
one piece of advice you've always given me. tell the truth.
"hate to break the news to you, michael, but i'm a starship captain and you're a three hundred deciwatt holodeck programme. i couldn't do it."
"in that case, you'll have to get creative."
"i'm not a superstitious man, doc, but i've been seeing things i can't explain."
"you're not the only one. at first i thought we had an epidemic on our hands, but this is no fever."
"no, it's not. last night i was talking to katie, and the next thing i knew i was being spirited away to god knows where."
they took you? where?
"maybe it was the other world. i don't know. tom paris was there. young harry, too."
what did they want with you?
i'm not sure. they were talking about me like i wasn't there. saying things about fair haven. that we knew too much about them.
"oh, lord."
and that's not all. they were saying something about coming to the pub tonight to change the town somehow.
what does that mean?
i'm damned if i know.
how did you get away?
"with all the talk about us knowing too much about them, i figured that if i pretended nothing was out of the ordinary, they might let me go. and sure enough, that's exactly what they did."
i wonder if this is how things started in killmannin back in '46.
"i'm not sure what they have in mind, but we'd better be prepared."
we're in luck. nobody's home.
"if we're going to fight them, we've got to use the right ammunition! biddy ramsey gave me this before she passed on. she knew a thing or two about faerie magic and how to fight it. everything she learned, she learned from this book."
i doubt if it says anything about using rifles.
you'd be surprised how many things a bullet will stop.
"i don't like this one bit. guns, seamus."
"under normal circumstances, i'd agree with you, michael, but these aren't normal circumstances."
"maybe you'd still like us to be acting civilised. where did that get you before? a ticket to the other world, that's what."
we don't know what the spirit folk have in store for us.
"that's just it. we don't know much about anything, do we? and we've got milo here acting like a holy war has been declared."
"relax, sullivan. the rifles are only a last resort. besides, we've got incantations, which are more lethal to spirit folk than any weapons forged by man. that's how we're going to force them back into their realm. and we've got red twine to stop them from changing shape."
and don't forget about the ash berries.
"ash berries, right. that's how you keep them from using their powers against you. they've been walking amongst us for weeks now, pretending to be our friends, lying to us, making mischief. what's next?"
"yes, what is next, seamus?"
i for one am not going to stand by and let them run roughshod over our town.
no!
we can't rest until we've driven every one of them out.
they're here! tom paris and harry kim. they're in sullivan's right now.
who's with me?
"seamus, let us explain. you're making a mistake."
the only mistake we made was letting you into fair haven. what's that?
shoot it!
"no, wait, wait. that's a delicate piece of technology."
warning. holodeck controls and safety protocols are offline.
a voice from the other world.
emergency overrides are malfunctioning.
"computer, freeze programme!"
sixty two percent compliance.
they're getting away! after them!
"computer, exit!"
gunfire?
two shots directly at the primary controls. we can't deactivate the programme or get the safeties back online.
where are tom and harry now?
saint mary's. looks like some of your parishioners are holding them captive.
we can't blame them for being frightened. they must think we're some kind of sorcerers.
"well, we could use a little magic right now, because that's about the only way we're going to get our people back."
transporters?
too many stray photons. we can't get a lock.
we should enter the holodeck with a security team and take them by force.
need i remind you the holo-characters have weapons as well. we'd be risking armed conflict.
"well, then let's just pull the plug. cut power to the hologrid."
that would purge the programme from our database.
exactly.
but we'd lose fair haven and all its people.
they're not people. they're holograms.
and they weren't programmed to be violent. i don't believe they'd harm anyone.
you can't be certain.
"well, i am certain, and i'd like to find a less drastic solution."
"with all due respect, captain. michael can be reprogrammed. tom and harry can't."
"one problem at a time, b'elanna. the people of fair haven may not be real, but our feelings toward them are. i won't destroy these relationships if we can find another way. now, if we could attach transport enhancers onto tom and harry, would that be enough to cut through the interference?"
i believe so.
good. then we just need to get someone close to them. doctor.
a few words of inspiration should get me within reach.
i suggest you use your mobile emitter. it'll isolate you from the malfunctions.
good idea. stand by to cut power to the hologrid in case things get out of hand.
"aye, captain."
"in the meantime, i believe your flock needs tending."
"ex labis caelestium sanctorum super ad aures atrorum larvarum mentientium. from the lips of the heavenly saints above, to the ears of the dark and lying spirits, may your spectral forms be cast back to the other world. back to the other world! there must be some trick to these incantations."
"what do you make of this, seamus?"
we should just tell them the truth.
"oh, good idea, harry. do you want to tell them they're only holograms, or should i?"
i see you left your box of charms at sullivan's. i believe this is the talisman you used on maggie. maybe we should turn them into cows.
"no, no, there's been a misunderstanding. we are not spirit folk."
"i think we've heard enough of your lies, tommy boy. i say we tie them up to the lamp post in the square and show them how spirit folk were dealt with in the olden days."
leave them alone. it's bad enough you've got them trussed up like christmas turkeys. there's no need for foolish threats.
you'd better watch whose side you're on. you're not above suspicion yourself.
"oh, so we're going to start turning on one another now, is that it?"
"we are, if you're choosing them over your own people."
"sinners! sinners, all of you. you have the audacity to turn a house of worship into a prison? this is where we gather to pledge our love for our fellow man, not condemnation. you should all be ashamed of yourselves."
"quite a rousing sermon, father, but i'm afraid you're not going to find too many takers tonight."
not after your little vanishing act. it seems grace declan saw you disappear into thin air on sunday.
"aye, i'd say that sounds a wee bit unholy. you're in league with them, aren't you? tie him up with the others."
listen to yourselves. you're letting confusion and fear get the best of you. doctor to janeway.
what's this?
fire and brimstone don't seem to be working.
"look here, seamus. another talisman."
"quick, get it off of him."
beam him out of there.
his program's been disengaged from the mobile emitter.
and what were you planning on doing with these?
those are the devices that will allow us to leave. you just put them on our coats and we'll be on our way.
"you'd like us to believe that, wouldn't you."
something tells me these are spirit charms. we pin them on you and god knows what powers you'll have.
this is no charm. it's some kind of a machine.
it doesn't matter. they won't be telling us the truth about any of it.
"oh, they'll tell us the truth, all right. there's more than one way to pluck the wings off a pixie. we'll induce a trance. give me biddy ramsey's spoon. keep your eyes on the silverware, father."
"i hope you know this is blasphemous. oh, this is ridiculous. i can't be hypnotised."
i can't isolate the doctor's programme.
he's been integrated into the fair haven matrix. he's vulnerable.
tell us the words. how do we banish the spirit folk to the other world?
there is no other world. only voyager.
voyager?
"federation starship, intrepid class, registry number ncc74656."
you're from some sort of vessel?
mmmhmm.
he's talking gibberish.
maybe he's not. this ship of yours. is that where you took me?
look here. it says if you can get a spirit to reveal his true name you'll render yourself impervious to his charms.
what is your true name?
i haven't decided on one yet.
"katie's on that ship, isn't she? tell me where to find her so i can get to the bottom of this."
"i'm sorry, michael. i can't do that."
then i guess i'm asking the wrong person.  tell me how to get to voyager.
"what are you doing, sullivan?"
no man who's gone to the other world has ever come back.
i have. how do i get there?
"captain, the mobile emitter has been activated."
lock onto the signal.
"i had a cousin went to america. he saw some strange things, but nothing like this."
you're not in america. this is a starship. it's called
voyager. i know.
should i transfer him back to the holodeck?
no. my name isn't katie o'clare. it's kathryn janeway. captain kathryn janeway. it's going to be difficult to explain. maybe it's best if i just show you.
you've seen my world. it seems fair that i should have a chance to see yours.
captain?
"so, this really is a starship. but how can that be possible?"
"have you ever read the time machine, by h. g. wells?"
are you telling me you've travelled back through time?
in a manner of speaking.
"that's patrick gibson and his cousin, frank. they work on the wharf. they're in my pub every saturday night for the rings tournament."
you'll find a lot of familiar faces on voyager. we've been visiting your town for months.
why?
we're explorers.
"i'm not letting you off the hook that easy, kathryn janeway. there must be more interesting places to explore than fair haven."
can you think of any place you'd rather be?
i guess that leaves but one question. how long are you planning on staying?
well that depends if we're still welcome.
"my door is always open. but you're the captain of a starship, i'm a barkeep."
just because we're from different worlds doesn't mean we can't care for each other.
tuvok to janeway.
go ahead.
the situation has escalated.
the townspeople have started to pile kindling at the base of three lampposts
in the village square.
stand by.
take them outside now.
stay back.
what are you doing?
that might not be michael sullivan. a demon could have taken his shape.
"it's me, milo. i've been to the place they call voyager, and i've brought katie back with me."
i've come in hopes that we can resolve our differences peacefully.
peacefully? i'm sure that's what you told the people of killmannin.
"they had nothing to do with what happened in killmannin, if it happened at all."
we're truly sorry for what's happened here. we never meant to frighten anyone.
"seamus, you were right about one thing. they are quite different from us, but not in so many ways that we can't be friends."
"and we're not spirit folk. some of our technology may seem like magic, but i assure you it's not."
"katie showed me things that are beyond our comprehension. they have machines that i can't begin to describe, but not once have they used them against us. quite the opposite, in fact. milo, you said you didn't like the rain and young harry kim made it go away. edith mulchaey herself said that katie o'clare pulled her daughter from the well and out of harm's way. these are not the deeds of spirits and mischief makers."
but they turned maggie into a cow.
"that'll never happen again, i swear."
"there, you see? we have his word, and if we can't trust a man's word in fair haven, what can we trust?"
"if you want, we'll leave and never bother you again. but we'd prefer to find some way to keep our friendship alive."
captain?
"i, for one, would like to keep playing rings with harry and tom, keep having neelix's steamed cabbage at the ox and lamb, keep taking walks with katie. let's not turn our backs on these good people. if we do, we're only punishing ourselves. just because we're from different worlds doesn't mean we can't care for each other."
"if we're going to retain the programme, we can't keep running it around the clock."
not until we've repaired these damaged systems.
"not ever. we've pushed the limits of holotechnology and they pushed back. if we try it again, we're just asking for trouble."
i'm afraid we're going to have to close your open door policy.
"yes, ma'am."
what about the characters. should i purge their memories of the last few days?
"no, leave them."
they think we're spacemen from the future. it won't exactly be like old times.
"we learn to accept alien species with new technologies. let's hope the people of fair haven will learn to accept us. but before we shut down the programme and begin repairs, what do you say to one more round at sullivan's? my treat."
"you may be from the moon, tommy boy, but i've got three shillings that says i can still whip you at rings."
"oh, you're on."
"hello, harry."
i'll catch up with you later.
tommy boy! i've been told there's a pot of gold somewhere in glen abbey. would you be able to find it with one of those fancy machines of yours?
"just follow the rainbow, seamus."
"rainbow, eh?"
i didn't think you'd ever speak to me again.
"well, i suppose i can forgive and forget. it's not that often you meet a handsome young man from outer space."
"what's this, christmas come early?"
it has for you. open it.
"a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court, by mark twain. i've read some of his books, but not this one."
"it's about two people from different times who fall in love, among other things."
"sounds familiar. maybe i have read it. thank you, katie. or kathryn now, is it?"
och.
they say if you know a spirit's true name that it renders you impervious against her charm. do you think there's any truth in that?
not a word.
i'm glad to hear it.
tam'vitte. me'iote rel mestal.
mestal te'iote senve.
siote ven'suil. bekta!
"tam'vitte. me'iote sendaya voyager. federation starship voyager. if you can hear me, please respond."
"if you can hear me, please respond. voyager, please respond."
"come on, voyager. i know you're there."
hello?
voyager? are you receiving this transmission?
my designation is mezoti.
you sound a little young to be working the comm.
i'm eight.
i see. are there any grown-ups i could speak to?
my species is six eight nine.
norcadian. what species are you?
that's a complicated question.
explain.
i don't know how long i can keep this channel open.
i need you to patch me through to captain janeway.
"i'll try, but my height may be insufficient."
hello? voyager?
"mezoti, you are not authorised to be in here."
are you going to report me to the captain?
"considering this is your first offence, a warning will suffice."
what were my instructions?
to wait in the cargo bay until you returned.
why didn't you comply?
you left the children unsupervised.
lieutenant torres required my assistance in engineering. i was gone for less than ten minutes.
we told her not to deviate from your instructions. she wouldn't listen.
"when the captain asked you to take charge of these children, you assured her that you could maintain order."
controlling them is proving more difficult than i anticipated. they're highly unpredictable.
meditation helps vulcan children to control their emotions. you might consider
mezoti!
i'm trying to talk to the woman.
what woman?
the one transmitting from spatial grid two three six nine.
she's made contact with a small ship approximately three light years from here.
"alien vessel, this is the starship voyager. respond."
"tuvok? it's you, isn't it?"
this is lieutenant commander tuvok.
"sounds like someone got promoted. i want to hear all about it, but first i need to speak to captain janeway."
"you're a sight for sore eyes, captain. you, too, harry."
"i'm sorry, but do we know you?"
"i'm ensign lyndsay ballard. i was a member of your crew. of course, i'm not surprised you don't recognise me."
"i don't know who you are, but i'm not amused. ensign ballard died almost"
"it was on stardate 51563. i can't blame you for being sceptical, captain, but if you let me come aboard, i can explain everything."
we'll beam you to sickbay.
i'm sure you'll want me behind a level ten force field.
no offence.
none taken. i'm just glad to be home.
captain? what do you think?
she seems to have intimate knowledge of this ship and its crew. i think we should find out who she is.
"captain, i'd like to come with you. i was very close to lyndsay, and if somehow it's her, i'll know."
"harry and i were on our way to a class m planet in the vyntadi expanse to recover dilithium ore we'd detected a few days earlier. when we landed, we realised it was a trap set by a hirogen hunting party. they'd reconfigured a power cell to give off false dilithium readings."
that's exactly what happened.
go on.
harry and i headed back to the shuttle. we were ten feet away when i was hit with a neural disrupter. harry said my injury wasn't that bad. he always was a terrible liar.
i tried to get lyndsay back to voyager but she was already dead. we buried her in space.
go on with your story.
"i woke up on a ship, in a stasis chamber surrounded by aliens. they told me they'd used their technology to reanimate me. i didn't believe them when they said i'd died, but they showed me visual scans of my own corpse lying in the torpedo casing i'd been buried in. the kobali said i'd been drifting for weeks."
kobali?
"if you ever met them, you'd remember. they look just like this. after the reanimation process, they spent months altering my dna. they were constantly scanning me, injecting me."
just to make you look like one of them?
that's how they procreate. they salvage the dead of other races. i was given a kobali name and placed with a family to help me acclimate.
you were a prisoner.
"at first. i wanted to contact you, to tell you i was safe, but the kobali wouldn't let me. they said you were part of my kyn'steya, my, my past life, and that i needed to forget you. all of you. so i spent two years letting my new family think i'd accepted them. when i finally earned their trust, i stole a shuttle and started looking for voyager. that was six months ago. they've been chasing me ever since."
"in spite of her appearance, i'm detecting traces of human dna. i've compared them with the genetic samples from ensign ballard's file. they match."
it's certainly a convincing story.
"but your starfleet training is telling you to consider all the possibilities. maybe i'm some sort of hybrid clone, or telepath who accessed ensign ballard's memory somehow? believe me, i was suspicious myself at first, but i am lyndsay ballard."
"until we find evidence to the contrary, welcome home."
"captain, could you give us a minute?"
doctor.
so it's really you?
"in the flesh, so to speak."
"i've missed you, too."
"i know you're all as eager as i am to welcome ensign ballard back. she's a fine officer, who's shown a lot of courage and determination over the past few years. and we're lucky to have her with us again. let's do everything we can to make her feel at home."
tom and i have already taken the liberty of removing lyndsay's personal effects from storage.
"and whenever you're ready, your old shift is waiting for you in engineering."
"thanks, lieutenant."
"before we get ahead of ourselves, let's not forget the kobali are still out there."
it seems they want her back as much as we want to keep her. we'll need to take precautions in case they track her to voyager.
i've run preliminary scans on the kobali shuttle. i believe i can adapt our systems to counter a possible attack.
"very good. well, if there's no further business."
thank you for saying those nice things about me.
you seem surprised.
"to be honest, i never thought you noticed me."
my mistake.
"so, you still playing the clarinet?"
"actually, i've taken up the saxophone."
ambitious. i bet you're good at it.
you always were my biggest fan.
"please, no past tense."
sorry. this is a little strange for me.
really? it's been a perfectly normal day for me.
deck two.
it just so happens that hearing you play music again is number twenty six on my list.
list?
"something i made up to pass the time while i was away. i tried to think of everything i would do if i got back to voyager, including some things i wasn't able to accomplish the first time i was here."
like showing up for duty shifts on time?
that's number twenty seven.
they're here.
ah. why don't you and i have a cup of tea while the children play?
"thank you, but they require my supervision."
i like your braid.
i could show you how to do it.
mezoti.
something wrong?
i've allotted one hour for recreational activity. there's no time for irrelevant conversation.
it's not irrelevant.
adhering to our schedule will allow us to use our time more efficiently. we'll be able to participate in
a wider variety of activities.
fun will now commence.
green. grid three thirteen.
counter. grid ten.
they're cheating.
how?
azan is using his neural interface to share information.
is this true? you will exercise punishment protocol nine alpha.
"if they cannot participate, neither will i."
you are encouraging disorder.
and you never let us do what we want.
you will exercise punishment protocol nine alpha.
"no, i won't."
there you go.
i can't believe you saved all this.
"tuvok thought i should recycle everything, but i just couldn't bring myself to do it."
my skates and i thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
do you know how long it took me to fold those?
same old harry.
what's that supposed to mean?
you're still sort of obsessive.
i'm tidy.
is that why you used to request baryon sweeps of your dorm room?
when you live across the hall from a slob.
"hey, show some respect for the dead. did i say something wrong?"
it's nothing.
just because i've been gone for three years doesn't mean i can't still read you like a book.
i gave the eulogy at your funeral.
"oh? what'd you say? come on, it's everyone's fantasy to hear their own eulogy."
absolutely not.
it's probably for the best. you always were a terrible public speaker. i just hope you didn't stutter too much.
i told them you had a favourite saying. something you got from an old klingon battle cry?
own the day.
"i said that you always believed in attacking each day, possessing it, and that that was what made you so much fun to be around."
is that when everybody burst into tears?
"i said that if you'd been there, you would have told them to own that day. to attack it, make it their own, and plan to do the same thing tomorrow."
pretty strong stuff.
you were a strong person.
not always. these last six months haven't been easy. there were plenty of times when i could have given up.
but you didn't.
you know why? you. i wanted to see you again. hmm. guess i won't be needing this anymore.
sickbay to ensign ballard. i've finished analysing your bio-scans.
i'm on my way.
my scans identified a genetic pathogen in your bloodstream. it appears to have converted most of your human dna into a kobali protein structure.
is there any way to reverse it?
the biochemical changes have affected every system in your body. i'm afraid there isn't enough of your original dna left to make you human again. but i believe i can affect some cosmetic changes.
are you saying you could make me look like me again?
"yes. the alternations would literally be skin-deep, and it may take several treatments, but i've devised an inaprovaline compound which should do the trick. physiologically, you'd still be kobali with a multispheric brain, a binary cardiovascular system."
but i'd look human?
"oh, yes."
i've lived with this face for long enough. let's do it.
have a seat. you may experience some dizziness.
"i'll hang onto harry for support, if he doesn't mind."
that's what i'm here for.
what? something wrong?
see for yourself.
"here we are, one jibelian berry salad."
i have been looking forward to this for a very long time.
it was number six on her list.
there isn't much variety in the kobali diet. i ate the same grey paste for three years. it doesn't taste the way i remember it.
what's wrong? too sweet?
"no offence, but it's got sort of a metallic flavour."
seems fine to me.
i guess my taste buds are still kobali.
can i get you something else?
"thanks, but i need to take care of number sixteen. dazzle lieutenant torres."
one minute early.
there's a first time for everything.
"an alignment error has been cropping up in the dilithium matrix. we can't seem to figure out what's causing it. i, i know that you're still settling in so i'll give you a couple of days to"
it's a vyk'tiote.
excuse me?
"oh, a kobali word to describe a certain kind of wave phenomenon. it's hard to translate."
try me.
"literally, it means crumpled dance. all i need to do is vyq'tal the qen'dioqe matrices, stabilise the per'cheya. tez'tel, se menna. cham'bioque! what?"
you were speaking kobali.
i didn't realise. i'm sorry.
"well, whatever you did, the alignment error is gone. nice job."
thanks.
"i think there might be a few crumpled dances in the warp core, too. feel like taking a look?"
any sign of the kobali?
none.
the latest tactical reports from tuvok.
commander. i no longer wish to serve as guardian to the borg children.
what's the problem?
their behaviour is chaotic. my attempts to apply discipline only result in further disorder.
"well, kids and disorder usually go hand in hand."
"neelix issued a similar warning prior to my taking this assignment, which is why i devised an activities schedule to promote focus and unity. oh seven hundred hours, the children emerge from their alcoves. nutrients are ingested in the mess hall prior to proceeding to the science lab to begin classes. at thirteen hundred hours nutrients are consumed a second time, before reporting to the holodeck, where they're studying comparative alien physiology."
doesn't sound like there's much time for fun.
"on the contrary, i've scheduled recreational activities."
"you can't always schedule fun, seven. sometimes it needs to be spontaneous."
"according to my research, children require structure."
"i agree, but not to this extreme. you're treating them like they're still on a borg cube."
you're comparing me to the collective?
you have all four children functioning as one. they do the same things together at the same time.
so that each child has the same opportunities to learn.
they're individuals. maybe they're rebelling because you don't let them express themselves.
then grant my request. choose a more suitable crew member to instruct them.
"sorry, seven. permission denied."
"well, i see you're finally going to try my hockey programme."
"actually, i'm taking lyndsay skating."
oh. you two sure have been spending a lot of time together lately.
don't start.
"oh, now, let's see. for those of us keeping score, harry kim has fallen for a hologram, a borg, the wrong twin, and now the dearly departed."
"we're friends, just like before. all right. maybe there was a time when i thought of pursuing lyndsay, but i closed the door on that when we both got assigned to voyager."
"hmm. don't look now, but that door is creaking open."
what do you think?
you look great.
"doctor thought i should stick to my original colour, but this seemed more exciting."
"hair is one of my specialties, despite evidence to the contrary."
it's just too bad that beneath this beautiful red hair still lies the six-lobed brain of a kobali.
"well, are you feeling human enough for a little skating?"
"i'd love to, but i already have a date."
who with?
the captain. she's invited me to her quarters for dinner.
"in six years, i have never been invited to the captain's quarters for dinner."
"well, i'll give her your regards."
"oh, damn!"
"come in. formal dress wasn't required, ensign."
"well, i just, i figured, dinner with the captain."
i'd hardly call this dinner. my replicator decided to liquefy the pot roast.
it looks fine to me.
stop trying to get on my good side and grab a slice of bread. peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. i hope you don't mind.
not at all. i lived on them at the academy.
"so, how was your first day back on the job?"
"pretty good, i think. lieutenant torres called my work competent."
"trust me, that's high praise coming from b'elanna. commander tuvok finished his analysis of your shuttle and presented me with thirty seven different ways of repelling a kobali attack."
did he include your pot roast? i'm sorry. i didn't mean. i can't believe i just said that.
"why? it was funny. we're not on the bridge, lyndsay. you have permission to speak freely."
do you really mean that?
i wouldn't have said it otherwise.
then there's something i've wanted to ask you for a long time. why me?
i'm sorry?
why did you choose me for that away mission?
"why, i suppose i thought you were best suited for the job."
"no, i wasn't. dilithium extraction was always lieutenant torres' specialty. and tuvok had far more experience conducting away missions. but you didn't send either one of them. was it because they were closer to you?"
you blame me.
"no, no, that's not what i meant."
"it's okay, lyndsay."
"no, it's not."
i'm not offended.
"no, you don't understand. never harbour anger toward those who brought you death, for they gave you the chance to live again. in letting me die, captain, you gave me life. i'm sorry."
lyndsay.
i'm sorry. i shouldn't have come.
you're late.
we expected you hours ago.
for what?
your farewell party.
you weren't supposed to come back.
you don't belong here anymore.
"harry, what's going on?"
"lyndsay ballard, beloved friend and crewman. does that sound right?"
what?
for your eulogy. does that sound okay?
"harry, i'm not dead."
denial. one of the final stages.
it was illogical for you to return.
"please, i don't want to go."
"i couldn't save you before, lyndsay. what makes you think i can save you now?"
"jen'to ka'siote, jhet'leya."
come in.
what's wrong?
"bad day, i guess."
b'elanna told me you did great in engineering.
i solved a simple problem.
didn't sound so simple to me.
"any kobali can discern simple wave distortions. and even if b'elanna was impressed, the others were staring at me."
i'm sure it was just your imagination.
"and then, to make matters worse, i started babbling in front of the captain."
"i used to get pretty nervous around her, too. don't worry. i'm sure she didn't take it personally. hey. i know this isn't easy, but i'll help you through this."
you have always been far too nice to me. why is that?
"you really don't have any idea, do you? think about it. i rearranged my schedule at the academy just so we'd be in the same classes. i let you teach me how to skate even though i hate the cold. i'm crazy about you. i have been since the day we met."
why didn't you ever tell me?
"i was never good at public speaking, remember, but i figure, how often do you get a second chance? which is why i'd very much like to kiss you now."
own the day.
sorry.
you are creating disorder. seven will be angry.
i don't care.
they're cubes.
i can see that.
precisely one one thousandth the size of a borg vessel.
well done.
"a twenty six sided polyhedron, composed of hexagons, octagons and squares."
impressive. what's this?
can't you tell? it's you.
i don't see the resemblance.
"look. here's your ocular implant, your nose, your mouth."
you were instructed to create a geometric shape.
i reminded her of that. she wouldn't comply.
this was more fun. don't you like it?
"it is crude. however, it does demonstrate ingenuity and individuality."
she deviated from your instructions. aren't you going to implement a punishment protocol?
no. resume your disorder.
lyndsay?
they're coming.
red alert. raise shields.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
i've come for jhet'leya.
"if you're referring to ensign ballard, she's made it clear that she doesn't want to go with you."
"she's my daughter. please, i've come a long way. i only want to speak with her."
"you don't have to see him, you know. they can't make you."
"i want to, harry. it's time to stop running."
"i appreciate this, captain."
i'm willing to oblige as long as you understand that this meeting is over as soon as ensign ballard says it is.
what have they done to you?
given me my life back.
"you were so beautiful. it's good to see you, jhet'leya."
my name is lyndsay.
why did you leave us?
i wanted to be with my people again.
these people? the same ones who set you adrift in space?
we jettisoned her body in accordance with our customs.
you abandoned her.
you had no right to tamper with her remains.
we were acting in accordance with our customs.
you mutilated her.
ensign.
"the reanimation process usually results in extensive memory loss, which makes the transition less painful. unfortunately, some remember their former lives more than others. jhet'leya, for example."
i told you to call me
"lyndsay ballard. she's dead. she has been for three years. forgive me for being so blunt, but when we found her she was a lifeless corpse. we salvaged that raw material to create a new person, my daughter, whom i love."
i'm not your daughter.
"you may have altered your appearance, but do you still think like these people? even now, the first words that come into your head, are they in their language or mine? i realise this place is familiar to you, but it's not where you belong. your sister misses you."
tynsia.
she keeps asking when you're coming home. what should i tell her?
tell her that her sister's dead.
i'll escort you to the transporter room.
"i won't give her up, captain."
she made her wishes clear.
she's confused.
thanks to what you did to her.
i don't want to fight you.
your ship is no match for voyager.
"every life is precious to my people, captain. i won't be coming back alone."
midnight snack?
kobali cuisine at its finest.
"so i was giving some thought to number thirty two, make tuvok laugh? he has this holoprogramme, the temple of t'panit. i thought we might tweak it so that instead of vulcan prayers, the monks recite ferengi limericks? you're not laughing."
sorry. i can't stop thinking about q'ret.
i can't believe he had the nerve to call himself your father. i'll bet professor ballard would have had something to say about that.
who?
your dad. doesn't he teach at some university?
i don't remember. i don't remember anything about him.
let's get down to the holodeck. we've got some monks to tweak.
sure.
what's wrong?
why did she start to revert all of a sudden?
"our old friend, the pathogen. it's adapting to counteract my treatments. it's possible she'll suffer occasional relapses for the rest of her life."
you said you could maintain my appearance.
"i can, but it looks like i'll need to increase the frequency of your treatments. you'll have to see me at least twice a day."
how am i supposed to do my job if i'm in here all the time. how am i supposed to do anything?
please try to understand.
stoi'gia! net'staika pen'daeli shevaob! i'm sorry.
wow. this place sure is lived in.
if you're here to lecture me about cleanliness.
i'm here to ask you to stop the treatments.
you know what happens if i do.
"you'll look kobali again? so what? i thought you were cute bald. i don't care if you're human, kobali or bolian, i just want you to be happy."
i wouldn't fit in.
are you saying tuvok and neelix don't fit in?
"that's different. they got to grow up in their own cultures. they know where they come from, who they are."
"wherever they come from, they're part of this crew now. just like you."
"lyndsay was part of this crew. if i stop the treatments, i won't be lyndsay anymore."
you don't honestly believe that.
"since the day i got back here, i haven't felt right. at first i thought it was voyager. things had changed so much, i thought if i just gave myself more time i'd get used to it. but it's me. i've changed. and the more i try to deny it, the more i feel like a ghost. i'm sorry, harry, but i can't keep fighting anymore."
what about us?
the girl you were in love with died three years ago.
shield's down to forty eight percent.
target the lead ship's weapons array.
life support's failing on decks six through ten.
reroute power to compensate.
shields at twenty percent.
hail them! tell them you'll surrender me.
"don't listen to her, captain."
"i appreciate the gesture, lyndsay, but i'm not giving you up."
it's not a gesture. i want to go. i don't belong here.
she's not well. she doesn't know what she's saying.
i know exactly what i'm saying.
shields at thirteen percent.
i'm detecting power fluctuations in the lead vessel's warp drive. a polaron burst could overload the core.
that would destroy the ship.
they're not leaving us much choice.
"whatever we do, we have to do it fast."
you're sure this is what you want?
"captain, i can fire that polaron burst myself."
"stand down, ensign."
we can't just let them take her.
"even if you stop them, i can't stay on voyager."
i don't want to lose you.
"you already did, but at least this time we've been given the chance to say goodbye."
"vien'ke debala, jhet'leya. i taught myself to say a few words in kobali."
"that's very sweet of you, but you just told me the comets are tiresome."
i guess i'd better work on my pronunciation. i'm sorry you didn't get to finish everything on your list.
i think i took care of what really mattered.
that's pretty.
it belonged to a friend of mine. would you like it?
your friend won't mind?
i think she'd be happy knowing i gave it to someone with such pretty hair.
seven's letting us go to the holodeck by ourselves. she says we can run any programme we want. do you want to come?
have you ever heard of the temple of t'panit? it's a vulcan programme.
sounds boring.
"don't worry, we'll make a few tweaks."
why potatoes?
"their first idea was to clone naomi, but i suggested they start with something smaller."
quite a feat of engineering.
it's a teirenian ant colony. i infused the soil with a blue ion dye so it'd be easier to see the insects.
they're luminescent.
the drones produce a fluorescent enzyme that's activated by the queen.
drones and queens? i thought we were trying to get these children away from the borg.
the project was mezoti's idea. i didn't want to discourage her individuality.
i like bugs.
well done. let me know before you take up beekeeping.
what have we got here?
it's kataris.
your father's planet.
i've been learning all about it.
naomi programmed the geophysical and atmospheric conditions.
there's quite a storm in those mountains.
the arpasian range is known for high winds and hail.
i'll remember to bring my coat. now this looks impressive.
it's a high-resolution gravimetric sensor array.
ambitious.
it'll augment our ability to scan for the neutrino flux associated with wormholes. it could help voyager find a faster way home.
the engineering principles are sound.
"i expected these projects to be interesting, but this is truly exceptional."
"thank you, captain. i am very interested in astrophysics."
"well, you've obviously got a knack for it. well done."
how did you think of scanning for neutrino fluctuations?
i've been studying starfleet records.
he's a remarkable young man.
he hopes to earn a permanent posting in astrometrics one day.
i'm afraid that won't be possible.
"captain, the boy has a unique talent."
"it's not a question of merit. we've made contact with his parents, and i've set a course for their planet."
my scanner is calibrated to pick up changes in neutrino trajectories.
that's good news.
you've exceeded your scheduled time here by one hour.
i'm almost finished.
your work will have to wait. there's something we need to discuss.
look at this. it's a star forming in the orpisay nebula.
the orpisay nebula is out of range of our sensors.
i increased the resolution of the long range scanners.
impressive.
"when i was on the cube, i never thought about what was outside. pulsars, quasars, nebulas. but here in this lab, i feel i can see the entire galaxy. what did you want to talk to me about? you said there was something we needed to discuss."
"yes, that's correct. it's time for you to regenerate."
come in.
i'd like the data you've collected on icheb's species so i can prepare him for re-assimilation.
maybe we could refer to it as getting reacquainted with his family.
if you prefer.
i'll transfer the files down to astrometrics.
thank you.
how'd he take the news? you haven't told him.
no.
why not?
it won't be easy for him to accept. he's adapted to life on voyager.
and you've adapted to having him here.
my feelings are irrelevant.
are they? would you like me to tell him?
"it's my responsibility, but i am uncertain how to proceed."
"well, you've already helped him make one difficult transition. how did you do that?"
by giving him the benefit of my own experiences. encouraging him to be resilient in the face of obstacles.
sounds like a good strategy.
is your alcove malfunctioning?
i'm calculating neutrino trajectories.
you need to regenerate.
very well.
wait. we've located your parents. voyager is due to arrive at their planet tomorrow.
do i have to stay with them?
they're your parents.
i don't remember them.
after my parents were assimilated i never saw them again. you're fortunate to have this chance.
what about the others?
we haven't been able to locate their families yet.
that's not what i mean. what will happen to them if i leave? they depend on me.
they'll adapt.
i'll never see you again?
i've been studying brunali culture. it's very different from what you've become accustomed to on voyager.
in what way?
they're an agrarian society. their technological resources are limited.
are they capable of space travel?
"yes, but most of their vessels were destroyed by the borg."
how will i continue my studies?
i don't know.
icheb.
"i'm detecting scattered enclaves on the northern continent, all with populations of fewer than ten thousand."
"judging from the residual gamma radiation, it appears they've suffered numerous borg attacks over the past decade."
that's not surprising. there's a borg transwarp conduit less than a light year away.
not exactly prime real estate.
"tuvok, run continuous scans for borg activity. tom, put us into synchronous orbit."
"yes, ma'am."
seven. you'd better get icheb.
"according to these scans, you're in perfect health."
then why does my stomach feel so strange?
"oh, i should have known. you've got butterflies in there."
i never assimilated butterflies.
"it's an expression used to describe anxiety or apprehension, both of which are perfectly natural reactions for someone about to meet his long lost parents. if it's any comfort, i'm sure they're just as nervous about meeting you."
parents are irrelevant.
really. do you think naomi's mother is irrelevant to her?
i have seven of nine to assist me in my education. i have you to care for my medical needs.
"your parents can nurture you in ways this crew can't. they can explain the brunali culture, share their experiences with you."
you didn't have parents.
"no, but"
"you adapted to serve a vital function about this vessel, forged relationships with its crew, all without the benefit of parents."
i had my programming to fall back on.
and how would your programming respond if you were asked to live with strangers?
are you damaged?
he's fine. i was just giving him a last minute check-up.
it's time.
the butterflies will go away.
hello. i'm captain janeway.
icheb.
you've grown.
he spent several months in a borg maturation chamber.
this is seven of nine.
"that's a borg designation, isn't it?"
"like your son, i was liberated from the collective."
seven has been instrumental in helping icheb make his transition.
"then we're very grateful to you. i'm leucon, icheb's father. this is his mother, yifay."
how are you?
fine.
do these hurt you?
no.
"we're very happy to have you back with us. mala, remi, yivel."
"welcome home, icheb."
i would like to return to voyager now.
thank you for coming.
where's icheb?
i thought it might be better if we talked ourselves first.
what exactly is there to discuss?
"how to make this transition easier for your son. please, sit down."
it won't be easy for him to give up the luxuries of your ship.
it's more than a question of luxuries. icheb has special medical needs.
we have a physician in our settlement.
we should arrange for him to consult with our doctor.
he also requires daily regeneration.
i'm sure you can adapt some of our technology to make that possible.
what about his educational requirements?
our children go to school.
will he be able to continue his studies in astrometrics and spatial harmonics?
"if icheb has an aptitude for science, i'm sure he'll find that we have a great deal to teach him."
for example?
we've developed sophisticated techniques in agricultural genetics which allow us to grow crops in an inhospitable environment.
icheb has expressed no interest in agriculture.
"i'm sure once he's been exposed to the subject, he'll find it quite challenging."
there's still the issue of his safety.
we're perfectly capable of protecting our son.
your proximity to a borg conduit makes you extremely vulnerable. i'm curious if you've ever considered relocating.
seven.
"no, it's all right, captain. this planet is our home. we will never leave it. we will defend it against the borg or anyone else who threatens us."
your courage is admirable but unrealistic.
wait for me in my ready room.
captain.
now.
"i apologise for her behaviour. she and icheb have grown very close, but that's no excuse for rudeness."
we'd like to see our son now.
"please be patient. if we rush things, your next encounter with him may not go any better than the last. stay aboard voyager for a while. it'll give icheb a chance to get to know you in an environment that's familiar to him. i'll have neelix do everything he can to make you comfortable while you're here."
your attitude is making a difficult situation worse.
i was simply attempting to insure icheb's well-being.
by insulting his parents?
those issues needed to be discussed.
you could have done it with a little more tact.
"perhaps, but that doesn't alter the fact that those individuals may not be suitable guardians."
those individuals are his mother and father.
which is no guarantee that they'll be able to care for him. he's far more likely to flourish if he remains on voyager.
are you ordering him off the ship?
that's not what i said.
so that he can be assimilated again?
what makes you so sure that's going to happen?
they shouldn't remain on that planet.
it's their home.
it's not worth protecting.
who are you to decide that?
anyone who values their own goals over the safety of their children is irresponsible.
"are we talking about icheb's parents, or yours?"
both.
it's not like you to admit to something like that.
it would be naive for me to claim objectivity in this case. but i'm not prepared to return icheb to parents who may be as careless as my own.
"i know what it's like to feel protective towards someone you've helped through a difficult period, but icheb is an individual now. you have to give him a chance to form his own opinions."
"if i do, and he decides to remain on voyager?"
then it'll be my problem.
is your mother pretty? what are they like?
i'm busy.
i never met my father.
i don't remember ours.
neither do i.
are you going to stay with them?
"if you leave, who is going to help us with our science projects?"
if you don't stop asking questions i'm going to put all of you in a cargo container and transport you back to the borg.
come with me.
where?
to dinner with your parents.
i'm working.
you can continue your work after the meal.
i don't have anything to talk about with them.
then it will be a very quiet evening.
i'm not going.
your attendance is not optional.
enjoy your meal.
"come, sit down."
i prefer to stand.
mister neelix let me use his galley to prepare some poma.
i'm not hungry.
it was your favourite food when you were little.
i'm not little anymore.
"no. no, you're not."
your mother worked hard on that meal. couldn't you at least try it?
"good, isn't it."
"nice to see the family back together again, isn't it?"
"when you were little, you would only eat the inside"
"the borg didn't leave us much to work with but we didn't need much, just a little ingenuity. everything you see, we built with our own hands. our homes, cultivation bays"
what's this?
a genetic re-sequencer. we use it to alter the dna of certain plants to conform with environmental conditions.
you built this as well?
we adapted parts from damaged vessels. nothing's been wasted.
efficient.
"efficiency's one attribute we share with the borg. in our case, it's a necessity. i know our settlement seems primitive compared to voyager, but i promise you, that will change."
what about space travel?
"someday we'll have ships that rival voyager, but we need the dedication of young people like you to help us."
icheb! how are you?
"well, thank you."
maybe later you can join us up on the field for a game of pala.
i don't remember how to play.
it will come back to you.
"you used to be quite an athlete. you can make a difference here, icheb."
i don't know anything about agriculture or genetics.
it won't take you long to learn. not with a mind like yours.
it's time to return to voyager.
i am staying here tonight.
they don't have a regeneration unit.
we're going to have to install one eventually. might as well do it now.
"as far as i am aware, he hasn't decided to remain here yet."
but he has asked to stay tonight.
return with me to the ship. we'll prepare a regeneration unit.
i've adapted this neural transceiver to interface with the portable regenerator. it has enough power to complete one full cycle.
we'll have to devise a way of recharging it.
if icheb decides to stay.
my wife and i appreciate everything you've done for our son. it's obvious you care about him.
he's a unique individual.
"yes, he is. to get him back is, well, a miracle."
how was he taken?
"since the borg first attacked us, we've taken great pains to hide whatever new technology we develop."
so the passing cubes won't be attracted to your planet.
"unfortunately, we haven't always been successful. one morning, about four years ago, icheb heard me talking about a new fertilisation array we'd constructed in the lower field. he wanted to see it. i told him i'd take him the next day but he was impatient, the way boys can be. i never even realised he'd wandered off when the alarm sounded. it turns out the borg were just as interested in our new technology as icheb was. they took him, and assimilated everyone in the area. if only i'd kept a closer eye on him."
icheb has a mind of his own.
"but still, it's hard not to blame myself. your parents must've felt the same way when they lost you."
my parents were with me when the borg attacked.
"i can't imagine what that must have been like for them, watching their daughter being assimilated. helpless to defend her."
it's important that icheb regenerate for six uninterrupted hours.
i understand.
he may resist. he doesn't like to waste time. i've had to contend with his lack of patience as well.
"there's a star called kelsin three. to the west is the orlitus cluster. there, just above it, when you connect those six stars, they form what we call the great horn."
i see it.
you inherited your love of the stars from your father.
"being on that starship, you've learned much more about astronomy than i have. our little window can't compare to voyager's astrometrics lab."
"no, but it's nice."
"you see? we have everything we need right here. a warm fire, good food that we grow ourselves, and people who love us."
"icheb has people on voyager who love him, too."
"you've grown attached to the crew on that ship, haven't you?"
"they've provided for me, given me opportunities."
they're good people. people who've experienced hardship themselves. seven of nine told me about your science project. she said it might prove very useful.
it's designed to detect wormholes.
how will that benefit them?
it may help them find a way back to earth.
why is that so important to them?
it's their home.
"interesting, isn't it?"
what?
"with all their technology, their opportunity to explore the galaxy, the thing they want most is to get home."
good morning.
did you regenerate successfully?
"yes, and i slept under the stars. you should try it."
you weren't in class this morning. the others missed you.
i was helping my father. there is something we need to discuss.
what is it? you've decided to stay with them.
yes.
you're certain?
this is my home. i have a responsibility to help them rebuild it.
i'll inform the captain.
thank you.
i'm sure you'll want to say goodbye to the other children.
inside you'll find padds containing data on a variety of subjects that will allow you to continue your studies. i've also included a high-resolution telescope. it's a poor substitute for astrometric sensors.
i will use it every day.
"goodbye, icheb, and good luck."
"thank you, captain. i hope you find a way home."
warning. regeneration cycle incomplete.
what is it?
i can't regenerate.
warning. regeneration cycle incomplete.
explain.
i miss icheb.
"so do i, but we'll adapt. now return to your alcove."
"if you find my parents, will i have to go with them?"
we'll discuss that when and if the time comes.
i hope you don't find them.
regenerate.
seven?
yes?
what if the borg try to assimilate icheb again?
his people lack resources. the borg have little reason to return to their planet.
but what if icheb's on a ship?
unlikely.
he was on a ship last time.
you're mistaken. he was on the surface when he was assimilated.
"no, he wasn't. a class one transport was detected in grid six four nine. one lifeform. species, brunali."
this better be important.
it is.
"sorry, i don't read borg. you'll have to translate."
this is tactical data from the cube where we found the children. it says that icheb was alone aboard an unarmed transport vessel when the borg took him.
"oh, why are you telling me this at oh three hundred hours?"
icheb's father told me the boy was assimilated on the planet's surface.
is it possible you misunderstood?
no. he was very specific.
that cube was disabled by a deadly pathogen. it suffered extensive damage. isn't it possible these records were corrupted?
"perhaps, but i found another inconsistency in leucon's story. he told me icheb was assimilated four years ago but further analysis indicates the borg attacked three times during the last decade. nine years ago, six years ago, and again last year."
all right. let's assume your information is accurate. what does it prove?
his father was lying.
why would he do that?
"i'm not certain, but we have an obligation to find out."
what are you proposing?
"that we return to the planet, demand an explanation."
those people have been through enough. do we really need to interrogate them?
we have a responsibility to ensure icheb's safety.
he chose to stay with his parents.
maybe he didn't have all the information.
"just because they weren't completely candid with you doesn't mean they're unfit parents. at some point, you have to let go."
"i know what you're thinking, that i'm having emotional difficulty accepting my separation from icheb and you're correct. but if there's a possibility he's in danger, even a remote one, i have to do whatever i can to protect him. if i don't, i'll be no better than my own parents."
couldn't we at least wait a few days?
what would that accomplish?
he's just getting settled.
the longer we wait the harder it'll be for everyone. you know that.
why do it at all? there's nothing compelling us to go through with it.
it's what he was born for.
hasn't he been through enough? why not give him a chance at an ordinary life?
he's not an ordinary child.
"no, but he can help us in other ways. he's bright. he's hardworking."
"leucon, his return was a gift. we can't waste it."
i don't want to lose him a second time.
"to survive, we all have to make sacrifices. you taught me that."
we won three games in a row.
"sit down, icheb. we need to talk. you know that you're very important to us."
yes.
what you don't know is why.
what do you mean? what is that?
"if you relax, it won't hurt you."
father?
you'd better hold him.
what are you doing to me?
no!
prepare the launch.
hail them.
"we didn't expect to see you again, captain."
"we'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind."
questions?
regarding icheb and the circumstances of his assimilation.
we've already discussed that.
the story you told me was inconsistent with our data.
we don't owe you any explanations.
"in that case, i'd like to talk to icheb."
he's not here.
where is he?
that's not your concern.
scan for his bio-signs.
he is not in the settlement.
"i'm detecting a brunali transport vessel, distance, nine million kilometres. it's heading for the coordinates of the transwarp conduit."
according to these readings that ship is travelling at warp nine point eight.
it only looks that way. it's been designed to emit a false warp signature strong enough to penetrate subspace.
they're using it as bait to attract the borg.
"icheb's on that vessel, isn't he?"
he's fighting for his people.
"alone, on an unarmed transport?"
we don't have particle weapons or powerful starships at our disposal. we're forced to use the only resource we have.
your children?
no. our genetic expertise.
"icheb's not bait. he's a weapon. the first cube that captured him was infected by a pathogen. icheb was the carrier, wasn't he?"
"every time we try to rebuild, begin to make progress, the borg come and take it away from us."
"tom, set a course for that transport vessel. full impulse."
"aye, captain."
you have no right to interfere.
we're trying to save our civilisation.
by taking away icheb's future.
"if we don't stop the borg, the brunali have no future."
"captain, a borg ship will emerge from that conduit at any moment. you'll be destroyed."
we'll take our chances. end transmission. red alert. battle stations.
"we're coming within range, captain."
i'm picking up icheb's life signs. bio-scans indicate he's unconscious.
transport him to sickbay.
i can't. there's some kind of interference.
"it's the conduit. by my estimate, a borg vessel will emerge in less than forty seconds."
transfer auxiliary power to the transporters.
"i still can't establish a lock, not at this distance."
thirty seconds.
"tom, get us closer to that ship."
"yes, ma'am."
the conduit's opening. twenty seconds.
seven?
still out of range.
"you heard her, tom."
when that borg ship comes through i'm going to have a hell of a time getting away from it.
one problem at a time.
"ten seconds, nine, eight."
i've got a lock.
seven.
transport in progress.
five.
he's in sickbay.
"three, two, one."
"get us out of here, maximum"
target their tractor beam generator.
phasers targeted.
fire.
no effect.
we are the borg. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
perhaps not. there is a way to get a weapon through their shields.
i'm listening.
transport a photon torpedo to the brunali vessel. set it to detonate soon as it's inside the sphere.
"that will occur in approximately twenty seconds. however, voyager will be inside less than three seconds later."
"tom, full reverse thrusters. it might buy us a couple more seconds. do it."
"transport complete. detonation in ten, nine."
five.
"tom, go to warp on my mark."
"three, two."
"all hands, brace for impact."
"now, mister paris!"
the borg vessel has taken heavy damage. they are not pursuing.
are you saying his parents re-infected him?
"no, they merely sedated him."
i don't understand.
he was genetically engineered to produce the pathogen from birth.
bred to kill borg.
is he in danger?
"i can suppress the pathogen. he'll be fine, physically."
he's going to need help coming to terms with what's happened.
"captain, i"
use your maternal instincts. they worked before.
i thought you were studying spatial harmonics.
my parents suggested i might have an aptitude for genetics as well.
i see. what have you learned?
"this is the genome of a typical brunali male and this is my dna. they're nearly identical, but do you notice the differences in the third, thirteenth and seventeenth chromosomes?"
yes.
my parents made microgenetic alterations so i would produce the pathogen. quite ingenious.
it's also barbaric.
"they were trying to defend themselves, their way of life. preserve their species."
"i know how difficult it is to acknowledge your parents' faults, but what they did was wrong. you don't have to forgive them."
do you think they will ever forgive me?
for what?
i could have destroyed that sphere. i failed them.
you would have been reassimilated.
"i know, but"
but what?
maybe it was my destiny.
"maybe. in the future you may choose to fight the borg, but you'll do it in your own way. you're an individual, and you have the right to determine your own destiny. it's time to regenerate."
and if i prefer to continue studying?
it's your decision.
come in.
seven of nine's shipwide efficiency analysis.
did we get a passing grade?
barely. she wants to present it to the senior staff.
put her on the schedule.
"we'll be passing by a class t cluster in the next couple of days. gas giants, radiogenic sources. i'm not sure it's worth altering course."
at the very least we should send the delta flyer for a look. and let's get a full range of sensor scans as we get closer.
"we'll go to a level three analysis of the cluster. tom, get the flyer ready and assemble an away team. harry, start continuous scans."
kim to seven of nine.
"proceed, ensign."
any chance you could increase radiogenic resolution in the long range sensors?
the captain wants to get a cleaner look at that cluster coming up off starboard.
acknowledged. take these specifications to lieutenant torres.
right away.
deck eleven.
what's our borg queen want now? we need to route at least another five terawatts to the sensor array.
deck fifteen.
hello.
sorry to interrupt.
i'm about to disprove schlezholt's theory of multiple big bangs. of course i had to demolish wang's second postulate to do it.
power transfer requisition.
you're standing in the way of cosmological history.
the cosmos is sixteen billion years old. it can wait another few minutes.
schlezholt would thank you for the reprieve.
"billy, billy, wake up."
what do you want?
i need help.
good night.
"billy, don't you dare go back to sleep."
what's the problem?
i'm in trouble.
go
to sleep.
help me first?
with what?
this level three sensor analysis. i've got four hours of subspace infrared to interpret.
long range scans on that cluster up ahead?
yes.
it's too complicated
to do over the comm. either we meet in the mess hall or we wait until tomorrow.
"i don't want to get dressed,"
and it can't wait until tomorrow.
your only options.
i've given operations an efficiency rating of seventy six out of a possible one hundred.
not exactly flying colours.
the crewmen you assigned to the night shift are frequently left with little to do once the ship's course has been locked in.
the devil finds work for idle hands.
religious metaphors are irrelevant. perhaps you should consider assigning them additional tasks.
what's this i'm guilty of? failure to utilise expertise?
"crewman mortimer harren. he has five advanced degrees in theoretical cosmology, but you've assigned him to the plasma relay room. his talents could be put to better use."
b'elanna?
"believe me, i've tried. when i give him more responsibility he doesn't do the work. harren wants to be down on deck fifteen. it gives him more time to repostulate the origins of the universe."
"as you can see, security is functioning at near-perfect efficiency. however, commander, if you arrange the phasers in the weapons lockers so that the smaller rifles were in front, they could be more easily removed in the event of an emergency."
i'll look into it.
crewman william telfer.
billy. he certainly ruined my score.
he visits the sickbay almost once a week complaining of illness. invariably you examine him and find nothing wrong.
"mister telfer is a hypochondriac. i'd treat him for it, but he's afraid of medication."
have you tried counselling?
"he's afraid of that, too. all i can do is scan him and offer him reassurance."
wasting your time and medical resources.
"what about astrometrics? looks like you could use some improvement yourself, seven."
"you are correct, unfortunately. tal celes, sensor analyst grade three. her work must be constantly double checked. she should be removed from astrometrics and reassigned elsewhere. perhaps to engineering."
"forget it. i've got my own problems to fix, remember?"
"that'll be all, seven, thank you. dismissed."
captain?
"they've never been on an away mission. mortimer harren, william telfer, tal celes. none of them."
they get off the ship whenever we have general leave.
i mean a working away mission.
harren never volunteers. celes can't get past the proficiency requirements. and telfer always seems to get a note from his doctor.
something's got to be done about this.
"what can we do? there are always a few who don't make it past their first year on a starship. normally, they're reassigned. but in our case, maybe we should relieve them of duty and let them pursue their own interests. it certainly wouldn't hurt general efficiency."
"they aren't drones, chakotay. we can't just deactivate them. is the delta flyer ready?"
"flight-checked with provisions for a seventy two hour away mission. what have you got in mind, captain?"
three people have slipped through the cracks on my ship. that makes it my problem.
the analytical aspects of the subspace infrared algorithm are fourfold.
"unfortunately, i have a threefold brain."
you just have to break it down. think of it as four smaller algorithms.
"okay, but what's the sequence?"
"it's zero g is fun. as you were. zeta particle derivation, gamma wave frequency, ion distribution, flow rate of positrons. z.g.i.f. zero g is fun. that's how you remember the sequence."
"thank you, captain. i'll try."
"good, because where we're headed, you're going to need it. i'll be briefing you this afternoon in astrometrics. we leave first thing in the morning."
deck fifteen.
captain on the deck!
at ease. junction room sixteen?
"over there, captain."
"of course. crewman mitchell, how have you been?"
"never better, ma'am. yourself?"
not bad. not bad at all.
"ah, to the left, ma'am."
thank you.
crewman harren.
"captain janeway, are you lost?"
"i was, for a minute. i'll be briefing you this afternoon."
"well, there's been a mistake."
excuse me?
you have me assigned to an away mission. i have my duties here. i prefer not to leave my post.
ensign culhane will cover for you. the pre-flight schedule is all there.
"if this is charity, captain, i don't want it."
i didn't ask you what you want. i'm taking the delta flyer on an astronomical survey mission and your expertise is needed.
what do you know about my expertise?
as much as i need to.
"well then, you might be interested to know that i'm about to disprove schlezholt's theory of multiple big bangs."
"really. wang's second postulate has more lives than a cat, doesn't it? once you think you've eliminated it, bam, it pops up again. i'll give you a hand if you'd like, when the away mission is over."
"once we reach the cluster, we'll drop out of warp and maintain one quarter impulse on the sweep through the protostars. i'll be piloting the delta flyer. celes, you're going to run an ongoing sensor analysis, providing data for your colleagues. mister harren, you'll be looking at subspace particle decay for anything new we might learn about star formation. and mister telfer, your job will be to look for signs of life. a long shot in this environment, but if it's out there, i'm sure you'll find it. you'll have the rest of the evening to familiarise yourselves with the mission."
"excuse me, captain. if we find a planet, we're not planning on exploring the surface, are we?"
that's a stellar nursery. any planets will be gas giants.
they may have moons.
"don't worry. we'll run a complete scan for pathogens before we set foot anywhere. and the delta flyer is fully equipped to deal with medical emergencies. we'll be fine. shuttlebay one, oh six hundred hours. dismissed."
celes is unreliable. her sensor analyses will be full of errors. you could be putting your lives at risk.
"don't worry seven, i'll check her work."
this mission could be better served with a more experienced crew.
"no, not this mission. ever hear the tale of the good shepherd? if even one sheep strayed into the wilderness, the shepherd left the safety of the flock and went after it."
so you're intending to rescue them?
"in a manner of speaking. maybe all it will take will be some personal attention from their captain. maybe something more. but i won't abandon a member of this crew, no matter what their problems might be."
"oh, poor guy. rotting away down on deck fifteen. counting the years till we get out of this godforsaken quadrant. it's a shame he doesn't have a superior officer who cares."
it's not my job to make everybody who works for me happy. some people just don't want to fit in.
i'll bet you haven't said two words to him.
"two words exactly. we collided in the corridor during a borg attack. i said, excuse me. since we were at red alert and about to be destroyed, i think it was very considerate of me."
"well, mister considerate, why don't you go over there right now and offer him some encouragement. his first away mission, i'm sure he could use it."
brushing up on the delta flyer specs?
i'm not a mechanic.
"oh. then, what are you doing?"
very interesting.
what do you find most interesting about it?
your creative use of the minus sign.
i see you have an appreciation for multivariate analysis. maybe you missed your calling. it's a shame. i imagine it gets tedious up at the helm.
i enjoy the view.
well?
"i invited him over to watch our television set tonight. you don't mind, do you?"
"celes. celes. respond. celes, respond."
you're not sick.
"yes, i am."
"no, you're not."
really
i am.
we have to sleep.
i can't go on this mission.
"yes, you can."
"no, i can't."
yes.
no.
bye.
wait!
see?
it's nothing.
it's a fever.
your temperature is point two degrees above normal.
that's right.
a typical deviation easily prompted by emotional stress.
or a multiphasic prion.
you have not been infected by a prion.
they attach themselves to the mitochondrial walls and they just
i've already scanned you.
you can barely see them.
they aren't there.
"if they migrate to my cell membranes while i'm on the away mission, they could rupture and i"
"crewman, i am not giving you a medical excuse. not this time. try to get some sleep. you shouldn't even have a medical tricorder. believe me, you'll be so caught up in the excitement of exploration there won't be any time for worrying about infections, mitochondrial or otherwise. there's nothing like an away mission to remind a person of why we're out here."
i'm going to one quarter impulse.
should i start the sensor sweeps?
we don't want to miss anything.
engine status?
within parameters. that wasn't us.
anything on sensors?
point zero zero five fluctuation in the spatial continuum. it looks like simple background noise.
i agree.
anybody for lunch?
"are you volunteering, william?"
"yes, ma'am."
"i'll help. what would you like, captain?"
mortimer?
even my mother didn't call me that.
"well then, mister harren, are you hungry?"
no. thank you.
i'll have the pasta soup. it should be listed under neelix six five one.
"maybe i'll try that, too."
i'm sure you'll like it.
i'm sure i will. thanks for the suggestion. i'd better get back there.
"neelix six five one, two servings."
"neelix six five one, two servings. what's wrong?"
the captain checks every single thing i do.
"oh, that's just standard procedure."
then why isn't it standard procedure for you or harren?
maybe she's giving you special attention.
"yeah, because she knows i need it. i wish i could go back to voyager."
me too. there's always the escape pods.
can you imagine?
i understand you grew up on vico five. no wonder you became a cosmologist.
wildest sky in the alpha quadrant.
so they say. i've never been there.
do you really believe that childhood environment is more important than genetically driven behaviour patterns?
just making conversation.
"conversation filled with unspoken assumptions, which i don't agree with. i'm a product of my nucleic acids. where and how i was raised are beside the point. so if you're trying to understand me better, questions about my home planet are irrelevant."
all right then. how's your thirteenth chromosome? missing a couple of base pairs in gene one seventy eight?
"i signed on to voyager because i needed a year of hands-on experience. it was a requirement for getting into the institute of cosmology on orion one. if we hadn't gotten lost in the delta quadrant, i'd be there right now."
"sorry to have delayed your career plans, but all of us have had our lives interrupted. that's the nature of space exploration. it's unpredictable."
"which is why i don't like space exploration. stumbling from star to star like a, a drunken insect careening toward a light source is not my idea of a dignified existence. pure theory is all that concerns me."
"well, i'm not trying to change that. i'm simply trying to get every member of my crew working to their full capacity. that includes you, mister harren."
"you don't feel responsible, captain, for having three misfits aboard your ship? well, if there's anything i can do to help relieve your guilt, please let me know."
i'll keep that in mind.
maybe i will join my colleagues for lunch. all this exploration has given me an appetite.
"computer, identify the source of that spatial fluctuation."
source unknown.
"red alert! aft section, report. report!"
"captain, are you all right?"
we need to get propulsion back online and figure out what hit us. what's out there?
"i don't know, but whatever it was, it tore a plating section off the outer hull."
ninety percent of our antimatter's been neutralised. the reaction's cold.
so much for warp drive.
"i'm bringing the impulse engines online, but they've been damaged. we'll be able to do one eighth impulse, no more."
that should get us to the rendezvous point with voyager in about ten years. think they'll wait for us?
"is the subspace transmitter online? voyager, this is the delta flyer. we've been hit by an unknown phenomenon and taken heavy damage. we require immediate assistance. repeat, we require immediate assistance. transmit that continuously on all subspace frequencies. anything on active scans?"
not yet.
it was a dark-matter proto-comet.
i read a paper on that phenomenon once.
written by me.
"well, enlighten us, mister harren."
i hypothesised that a tertiary product of stellar consolidation would be a comet-like assemblage of dark matter. it would be attracted to any source of antimatter and neutralise it upon contact.
so one of these things detected the antimatter in our warp core?
"the term detected suggests a consciousness. this is a mindless astrophysical phenomenon, nothing more. we should eject our remaining antimatter or we could suffer another impact."
"i can't do that, not on the basis of an unproven hypothesis."
"the forces involved are non-trivial. if we're hit again, we could lose our entire outer hull."
"eject the warp core and we lose any hope of getting warp drive back. i need more evidence, and right now sensors aren't talking."
"maybe they are talking, but somebody doesn't know how to listen to them."
"you're out of line, crewman."
"this isn't the time to be worried about her feelings, captain. we're in trouble."
"captain, that hull plate? it's less than ten kilometres away. impact from a dark-matter body might have left a quantum signature in the alloys."
that's the evidence we're looking for. do we have transporters?
"yes, i've locked onto the plate."
"beam it directly to the aft section. celes, you're with me. continue the repairs."
no sign of burns or plasma residue. it seems to have been sheared off. download this into the main computer.
"captain, i'm sorry."
for what?
i thought that spatial fluctuation we ran into was background noise. some noise.
"i saw the same sensor readings you did, and came to the same conclusion. you don't have to doubt yourself all the time."
"yes i do, and you should too. you're right to always be looking over my shoulder."
"we all make mistakes, even me."
"every day? every time you report for duty? on voyager it doesn't matter because nothing i do is that critical. seven doesn't trust me with anything important. the crew is protected from my mistakes by the people around me, but out here i could get us killed."
you went through starfleet training courses.
i had to cram for every exam.
"at the academy, i was infamous for my all-nighters."
"every night? because that's what it took. that's the only way i made it through. not to mention the sympathy votes. the conflict on bajor worked in my favour. the federation was so eager to have bajorans in starfleet that my instructors gave me the benefit of the doubt. so did you, when you accepted my application."
you showed evidence of unconventional thinking. i liked that. not everybody would have thought to retrieve that hull plating.
"well, just don't trust me with the analysis. i guarantee i'll get it wrong."
"well, with that attitude, i'm sure you will."
"this has nothing to do with attitude, captain. you and i are wired differently. to you, this is nothing but data. to me, it, it's a monster with, with fangs and claws. in my nightmares, i am chased by algorithms. my brain just wasn't built to understand this."
we can find you another post on voyager.
"there isn't another post on voyager, not for me. unless you need a waitress in the mess hall."
"you know, there's more to duty than the ability to manipulate algorithms. everybody on voyager has showed a courage far beyond what i could have expected. so have you."
"if we were still in the alpha quadrant, would that be enough to keep me on board?"
i can't answer that.
"i don't deserve to be on your ship, captain. and i'm not really a part of voyager. i just live there."
pressure's increasing. the eps relays are fused. cut the plasma flow. cut the plasma!  i could have been killed! what's wrong with you?
everything.
"if you want something to fantasise about, try imagining how it'll feel if our hull is breached and we die of vacuum exposure. our blood will vaporise and our cell membranes will rupture. surely you know the symptoms better than i do."
"let's not talk about it, all right?"
"nothing disagrees with me more than having to put theories into practical use, but there's no choice, so pay attention to what we're doing here. you can check yourself into sickbay when we get back."
and you can go back to deck fifteen.
"that's right, where i don't have to rely on you or your intellectually deficient friend."
at least i have a friend. don't you ever get lonely down there?
in the company of my own thoughts? never.
i don't believe that. spend some time with us when we get back. you might enjoy yourself.
"a hypothesis that would require testing. i'm a theoretician, remember?"
our scans of the hull fragment were inconclusive. we found some displaced positrons that could indicate a dark-matter impact.
but could have been caused by something else.
proof enough.
"not enough for me. not enough to jettison the remaining antimatter. there's a gas giant only a few hours from our current position. t class, surrounded by orbital rings, including one that's radiogenic. we could use those particles to reinitialise our warp reaction."
"with ten percent of our antimatter left we'd only be able to make warp two, but it would be enough to get us back on the road."
set a course.
another spatial fluctuation.
can you localise it?
"it's somewhere within the distance of ten thousand kilometres. another one closer, about seven thousand kilometres."
it's being drawn toward our antimatter. eject the core.
open a channel. all hailing frequencies. this is captain janeway of the federation vessel delta flyer. we are on a mission of peaceful exploration. please identify yourself.
no response.
"of course not. it's a natural phenomenon. captain, we only have a few seconds."
"i'm firing a photon torpedo. there's enough antimatter in the detonation chamber to draw that proto-comet, if that's what it is."
"the torpedo's away. distance, one thousand kilometres. one thousand five hundred."
no spatial disruptions.
find the source of that sound.
"oh, no."
that's not possible.
where is he?
i can't locate his bio-signature.
"he's not out there. he's not in space, not in subspace. it doesn't make sense."
inside me.
activate the transporter. try to get a lock on whatever's inside him. tricorder isn't picking up anything.
but i can feel it.
"i can't get a lock. it's like something is there, but it's not there."
"oh, it's there."
"unfortunately, i have to agree."
"obviously, whatever hit us was no proto-comet. i was wrong."
"maybe you weren't, not entirely. sensors can't scan it and transporters can't lock on to it. maybe this is some kind of dark-matter lifeform."
it's impossible. molecules that complex would collapse under their own weight. they could never support life.
it might be time to revise your theory. where did they take you?
"i don't know. it was dark. god, i could feel breathing all around me."
did anyone try to communicate with you?
"i couldn't see. i tried to say something, but there wasn't enough air. i tried to move, but something was pressing down on me. hypospray. tetrovaline. it will put me out."
"if i sedate you, it could lower your immune response, and you need to stay conscious. do you understand?"
"billy, if it wanted to kill you it would have done it by now. it never would have sent you back here. maybe it was trying to scan you or something."
"if it wanted to get to know me better, it should have just asked me out for a drink."
"celes, keep an eye in him. harren."
i'm setting a course for those rings. shunt as much power as you can to the impulse engines.
we never should have left voyager.
"i've got news for you, crewman. voyager isn't exactly a safe haven. we've been chased across the quadrant by far worse than whatever's out there. the vidiians, species 8472, the borg. but i guess if somebody's hiding down on deck fifteen they might not be aware of it."
i wasn't meant to be an explorer.
and i wasn't meant to guide a ship across an unknown quadrant.
then we're both victims of circumstance.
"oh, i've seen things i've never imagined. grown closer to people than i ever thought possible. i wouldn't call myself a victim, and i wouldn't trade the last six years for anything."
"then you've been deluded by the inexhaustible human capacity to avoid the truth. you're the one hiding, not me. i've got you three more percentage points of impulse."
"i'll take it. setting a course. isn't there any part of you that feels a bond with the rest of us? when we escape from the borg or discover a new type of star, don't you feel some pride of accomplishment? when you're in the mess hall, alone at your table in the corner, don't you see the friendships around you and wish, even for a microsecond, you were part of them?"
you don't know me at all.
"no, but i'd like to. that was the whole point of this mission. but i guess it hasn't worked out like i'd planned."
incoming transmission.
source?
it's a starfleet frequency. must be voyager.
"voyager, this is the delta flyer. we've been hit by an unknown phenomenon and taken heavy damage. we require immediate assistance. repeat, we require immediate assistance."
subspace echo.
maybe not. there's a point zero zero five deviation in the carrier wave.
that's the same degree of spatial fluctuation left by our pursuers. they're sending our distress signal back to us.
modified. they might be trying to communicate.
they're taunting us.
not necessarily. try to adjust the universal translator for
captain! he went right through the forcefield.
"billy, what are you doing?"
"it's activating my motor neurons. i can't make it stop. i'm sorry, captain. you've got to stop it."
"it's okay. billy, it's okay. it's okay."
it's in here!
it's tapping into our systems.
wait. it may be trying to communicate.
it's into our environmental controls. we've got to stop it.
hold your fire!
what the hell is wrong with you?
it was trying to kill us.
you don't know that.
we were at risk.
i gave you a direct order.
what if you were wrong?
i could hear its thoughts.
explain.
when it left me i could hear what it was thinking. do not belong. that's what it said. do not belong.
we don't belong here.
or it didn't belong in the delta flyer.
maybe that's why it was tapping into the environmental controls. it was trying to survive in a place it didn't belong.
that's speculation.
based on direct observation. you murdered an alien being and destroyed any chance we had to make first contact.
we just lost another section of hull.
how far are we from the gas giant?
two hundred thousand kilometres.
"i'm taking the flyer into the radiogenic ring. with any luck, they won't follow."
we can't survive in there for more than a few minutes.
that should be enough to reinitialise the warp core.
"start continuous transport of radiogenic particles directly into the reaction chamber. when it's approaching critical mass, let me know. watch for any sign of pursuit. how are you doing?"
"i always had this alarm in my head, sort of an internal red alert. it was like a warning system that would tell me i was sick or dying, or something. mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. it was always there."
and now it's not?
it's gone. i don't understand.
"maybe i do. when i was a girl, i was afraid of the ocean. i liked to swim, but in a pool or a pond where i knew exactly what was beneath me. but in the open water, with no way to know what was down there? it scared me to death. it wasn't until my first year at the academy, after i went through zero g training in the coral sea, that i finally got over it. i think you just came up from your first deep dive."
they're in pursuit.
"three minutes, twenty seconds to intercept."
we'll need twice that to reinitialise warp reaction.
get into the escape pods.
captain.
plot a course away from the planet. i'm going to fire a phaser volley and hopefully set off a chain reaction of the radiogenic particles. it might be enough to disable our friends.
"you'll be disabled, too."
"not if i go to full thrusters and keep in front of the shock wave. if i don't make it, head for the l class moon in the next system. you could survive there for weeks if you have to. enough time for voyager to pick up your distress signal. now get moving."
no. you'll have a better chance if we're with you.
go!
"we might not have contributed much on voyager, but what we do here matters. we're the crew here, and the crew does not abandon its captain."
"all right, it's your choice."
then i'll be going alone.
good luck.
charge phaser banks. stand by to divert all power to thrusters.
"escape pod one is occupied and ready, captain."
launch pod one.
escape pod away.
how close are our pursuers?
sixty five seconds to intercept.
stand by to fire.
"captain, the escape pod is altering course. it's heading for the aliens."
janeway to harren.
what are you doing?
"if they have to deal with me, it should give you a few more seconds to get away. that's my theory, anyway."
resume your escape course now.
it's too late for that.
"you made a mistake, harren. don't make another one."
"i'm done hiding, captain."
"a few seconds of exposure to real life, maybe i'll understand what i've been missing."
he closed the channel.
"get a transporter lock on that pod,"
i can't. we're out of range.
more power to the thrusters. celes.
we're still not close enough.
thrusters at maximum.
got him.
fire.
"shock wave approaching. contact in four, three, two, one. more or less."
my crew
"easy. they're sleeping. no serious injuries. everyone's all right, though you gave us a good scare for a while. we received your distress call. we found the flyer drifting above a gas giant. you were all unconscious."
any sign of another vessel or some kind of entity?
no. what happened?
"the good shepherd went after some lost sheep, and ran into a wolf."
did she find them?
i think she did.
you're late.
there was a problem with the pulse drills on level four.
they're going to be here any moment. i want to make a good impression.
you're certain we should be doing this?
orek will be pleased that we took the initiative.
i hope you're right.
welcome to telsius.
thank you. i'm captain kathryn janeway. this is commander tuvok. we're from the federation starship voyager.
we have several mines like this on earth.
i'm not familiar with earth.
that's because it's thirty thousand light years from here.
thirty thousand three hundred forty two point four to be exact.
you're a long way from home.
"it's difficult sometimes, then i close my eyes and think of the farm in indiana where i grew up. for a moment i'm home again. shall we get down to business?"
yes. we've had a shortage of dilithium for the last two months. if we can't replenish our supply we may be forced to suspend work.
our chief of mining operations has gone to the grenna system.
"yes, but we are authorised to conduct trades in his absence."
what are you prepared to trade?
"i'm afraid the only commodity we have is, er, bolomite."
we really don't have much use for that.
"on the contrary, captain. bolomite is used in omega radiation therapy. the orphans on narva"
orphans?
the settlers on the narva colony were exposed to toxic levels of omega radiation. the entire adult population was killed.
"we're doing all we can for the children. all right, twenty kilotons of dilithium for an equivalent amount of bolomite."
we only have ten kilotons left.
then ten it is.
"captain, i must point out that dilithium is worth nearly twice as much as bolomite."
"tuvok, these people need our help. i'm not going to quibble over a few tons of ore."
perhaps we should celebrate.
"i wish we could, but there's a neutronic storm approaching our ship. we should be leaving orbit."
give us an hour to finalise the arrangements.
we'll be waiting to hear from you.
"before we leave, would it be possible to tour your facility? it's our duty as starfleet officers"
unfortunately the storm won't wait. maybe on our next visit.
live long and prosper.
ugh! this hair is so uncomfortable.
i find it aesthetically pleasing.
the negotiations?
it would've been perfect if tuvok hadn't decided to improvise.
i was portraying my character as truthfully as possible.
"once we finish a transaction, we leave. is that clear?"
indeed.
incoming transmission for captain janeway.
ready. this is captain janeway.
the bolomite is ready for transport. we thank you for your generosity.
directive nine twenty seven of the starfleet general order. always help those in need.
transport complete.
"we've enjoyed meeting you, gentlemen."
"er, captain,we haven't received the dilithium yet."
"oh, the neutronic storm seems to be interfering with our transporters. if we don't leave orbit immediately, we will sustain heavy damage."
what about our dilithium?
we'll be back to deliver it as soon as the storm clears.
"well, how long will that be"
captain janeway out.
let's go.
"computer, activate the sonic shower."
"oh, adjust the frequency."
"computer, deactivate the sonic shower!"
report.
"we've got systems failures on eight decks, captain."
that explains why my sonic shower was a little louder than usual.
make that nine decks. i've run every diagnostic i know and i can't seem to isolate the problem.
gremlins.
excuse me?
"in the early days of aviation, engineers blamed imaginary little creatures called gremlins for malfunctions they could not explain."
"well, one of your gremlins just paid a visit to the replicator system."
"tuvok, we saved you a seat."
what's wrong?
someone has altered one of my holodeck programs. again.
are you sure it isn't just one of these malfunctions?
"everything on the ship's been affected, including the holodecks."
the oracle of k'tal isn't programmed to wear pyjamas.
"well, maybe he overslept."
"i am not amused by your practical jokes, mister paris."
why do you always think it's me?
mister kim?
"i'd like to claim credit, but i'm innocent."
"the next time i visit the holodeck, i expect to find my programme restored to its original parameters."
"i'm telling you, tuvok, we didn't do it."
i wonder how the oracle would look in a sombrero.
everybody stop eating!
"captain, what's wrong?"
"if i could have everyone's attention for a moment. we found a contaminant in the replicator system. it's nothing serious, but if any of you start to feel a little queasy, report to sickbay immediately. in the meantime the galley is closed."
i wish i hadn't had seconds.
here.
"well, that explains it."
don't tell me a simple heating coil in the stove is responsible for everything that's gone wrong this morning.
any component connected to the integrated circuitry can spread a contaminant.
this isn't starfleet issue.
where did it come from?
i obtained it during a trade.
with whom?
sister dala.
sister?
one of the clerics on selnia prime. tom and i met her during our away mission. she was the one trying to help all those poor orphans. it's all in our report.
did you run a diagnostic before you installed it?
captain to the bridge.
i'm a little busy now. can it wait?
i'm afraid not.
i'll be right back.
"one excuse after another. you're stalling, and i don't have time for it."
"captain, this is mister orek. he's chief of mining operations on telsius prime."
"a problem, mister orek?"
not if you deliver our dilithium.
dilithium?
it's all clearly documented. ten kilotons of bolomite ore in exchange for ten kilotons of dilithium.
i think there's been some sort of misunderstanding.
"one way or another, i intend to collect what you owe me."
"we've enjoyed meeting you, gentlemen."
"captain, we haven't received the dilithium yet"
"oh, the neutronic storm seems to be interfering with our transporters. if we don't leave orbit immediately, we will sustain heavy damage."
what about our dilithium?
we'll be back to deliver it as soon as the storm clears.
do you still deny you made the trade?
that woman isn't me.
who is she then?
"well, she's obviously an impostor."
"i have transmission logs, transport records, scans of your shuttlecraft."
"i have never been to your planet, mister orek, aboard voyager or any other vessel."
our ship's logs will confirm what the captain's been telling you.
and how do i know they're authentic records?
how do we know your records are authentic?
you think i falsified data? why would i do that?
perhaps to extort dilithium from us.
i'm not the thief here.
"we are not questioning your integrity, mister orek. it does appear you've been cheated, but not by me or anyone one on my crew."
"how naive do you think i am? first, you prey upon the sympathy of my miners by telling them stories about poor, orphaned children. now you try to convince me you're the victims here."
did you say orphaned children?
a despicable tactic.
"will you excuse me for a minute, please?"
we are not finished!
neelix.
captain. we're making real progress.
never mind that. tell me more about this cleric who gave you the heating coil.
ah. sister dala. what do you want to know?
everything.
"well, tom and i met her during our away mission. we were on a small planetoid in the wyanti system"
searching for the spore the doctor wanted to grow antiviral proteins with.
"i tell you, neelix, when i first joined starfleet i knew it was going to be one glamorous adventure after another, but i never dreamed that i'd have the opportunity to go on a mould-hunting expedition."
i'm detecting traces of glamour in this direction.
"please, go no further. this is our sanctuary."
our scans didn't detect anyone down here.
our sect is a solitary one. we dampen our life signs to protect the privacy of our meditations.
we're terribly sorry if we've disturbed you.
begin the cleansing.
"olat mal pri, mal pral, mal prolat. olate kal mi, kal mal, kal molat."
i hope we haven't committed a serious transgression.
the transgression was ours. we should have guarded the sanctuary more carefully. the deities will be angry.
"come on, neelix, we'd better get out of the way."
of course. our sincere apologies. if there's anything that we can do?
"forgive me but, you look familiar."
i don't think that we've ever met before.
do you see it?
yes.
you bear a striking resemblance to our redeemer of light.
i'm flattered.
"each spring we make a pilgrimage to narva in his honour, to help the orphans."
that's a very worthy cause.
"it is. unfortunately, we have no food to bring them this year."
why not?
a blight infected our hydroponic pods. the crop was destroyed.
maybe we could replicate some food for you.
we bestow charity on others. the deities forbid us from accepting it ourselves.
how about a trade?
good idea. you must have something that we can use.
"that way you wouldn't be accepting charity, and the deities would have nothing to get angry about."
your heart is as kind as your face.
may the deities bless you.
that's when they gave you the heating coil?
"it was going to take a while to replicate the supplies they needed, so we invited them back to the flyer."
that's when they must have gotten access to our systems.
captain?
did you leave either of them alone at any point?
"i don't think so. er, after we ate, tom took brother mobar to see the cockpit, but i stayed in the aft section with sister dala, talking."
about what?
"me, mostly. she wanted to know all about my role on voyager."
"ambassador, morale officer, head chef. it sounds as though you're invaluable."
i do what i can.
where is your voyager now?
about three light years from here.
your crew is alone in this region?
we are the only federation starship within thirty thousand light years.
that must be difficult.
"sometimes it is, but we manage. we've single-handedly taken on the borg, the hirogen, species 8472."
i'm impressed.
captain janeway deserves most of the credit. she's an extraordinary woman.
your captain is a woman?
the finest one i've ever known.
tell me about her.
"well, she's commanded voyager for almost six years now. before that, she was a science officer on the al-batani."
where does she come from?
earth. it's in the alpha quadrant. she grew up on a little farm in a place called indiana. you'd like her.
i'm sure i would.
sister dala.
"yes, brother mobar."
it's late. we must return to the sanctuary.
so soon?
it's time for the evening meditation. we can't thank you enough for all you've done.
we're just glad that we could help.
the blessing.
certainly.
may the deities bless these travellers. tala ot val. tala ot relina. sen tala. sen relina. val golina. su ketran. tala otval. tala ot relina.
then we transported them back to their sanctuary.
how long did this blessing last?
no more than a minute or two.
that's probably all they needed.
for what?
just what i thought. the entire database was downloaded eighteen days ago.
brother mobar. the talisman.
it was obviously some sort of scanner.
what would a couple of religious clerics want with our database?
"it might help if they wanted to pose as federation officers. gentlemen, i believe you've been had."
"the way i see it, we're both victims. your bolomite was stolen, and our reputation has been damaged."
what are you proposing?
you said you had scanned the vessel that visited your mining colony. if you allow us to analyse them we might be able to derive the impostor's warp signature.
we could find them and recover your property before they cheat someone else.
this is all difficult for me to believe. two of your crewmen deceived by clerics? huh. could they really have been so naive?
a legitimate question.
"it's obvious we're dealing with clever adversaries. they fooled both of us, but i'm confident we can stop them."
perhaps i should contact telsian security. they have persuasive methods for determining the truth.
"in the meantime, the real thieves could be halfway across the sector, with your bolomite in their cargo hold."
"and finally, our bridge."
is this a typical federation vessel?
"well, the delta flyer may look a little worn, that's only because she's been through so much. this ship has helped fend off the borg, the hirogen, species 8472."
most of your technology is outdated.
"show him the mothership, mister chakotay."
"uss voyager. intrepid class, fifteen decks of the most advanced technology you'll find anywhere. dilithium powered warp engines, integrated bioneural circuitry, holodecks."
is this a typical federation vessel?
"every ship in the fleet is built to exacting standards, but i'd be lying if i told you i didn't think voyager was exceptional. as her captain, i'm not entirely objective. i'm sure you feel the same way about your ship."
it is my home.
"i'm glad to hear you say that mister varn, because that's exactly what the federation is. a home for an extended family who share resources and come to one another's aid in time of need."
"so if my ship joins your federation, voyager will help me fight my enemies?"
the primary goal of the federation is exploration. military objectives are
"there's no need to bore our guest with starfleet protocol, tuvok."
my enemies have sophisticated weaponry.
"as do we. photon torpedoes, optronically targeted phasers, multi-spectral shielding."
all of which we would not hesitate to share with a fellow member of the federation.
what will i have to do to join?
"in order to be considered, a candidate must make formal application. an extensive review is conducted by a committee composed of"
"the process is complicated, but captain janeway has influence with the federation council."
and you would use that influence on my behalf?
i'd be foolish not to. you are just the type of candidate we're looking for.
i'll have to discuss this with my shipmates.
"well, joining the federation is a serious commitment. take all the time you need."
"captain, our latest orders from starfleet command. we won't be back here for at least six months."
perhaps we can discuss your application then.
"if we were to apply now, could you assure us we'd be accepted?"
you realise you'll have to commit considerable resources.
i'll do whatever is necessary.
"well, let me be the first to say, welcome to the federation."
you look like you could use a cup of coffee.
i've been flying concentric search patterns for the last twelve hours.
any sign of the impostors?
"neelix, what has happened to us?"
i know exactly what you mean. i've been over it a thousand times.
why didn't we see this coming?
orphans. it's the oldest gambit in the book.
"i mean, if it'd been harry, i could understand it. he trusts everybody. but you and me?"
we've dealt with our share of shady characters.
"i think maybe, maybe we've lost our edge."
hand me one of those terra nuts.
what are you doing?
proving you wrong.
"ah, the old shell game. all we need now is a mark."
i think i see one coming.
you go ahead. i'll follow your lead.
"now watch carefully. i place the terra nut under the cup. then i shuffle them. round and round they go. keep your eye on the nut, but be careful, the hand is faster than the eye. now, for three hours of holodeck time, can you tell me where is the terra nut?"
"there. no, no, no, that one."
oh. i really thought i had you this time.
"oh, keep trying, neelix. you'll fool me one of these days."
this looks like an interesting game. may i have a turn?
"oh, be my guest. but you'll have to wager something."
"if i win, you take three duty shifts in sickbay."
"and if i win, you take three shifts in the kitchen."
done.
"ready? now, watch carefully. round and round they go. follow the terra nut if you can, but be careful, the hand is faster than the eye."
"careful, doc. try not to blink."
"don't you worry, mister paris. you have to get up pretty early in the morning to fool my optical subroutines."
"where is it, then?"
in your left palm.
how did you?
superior visual acuity. see you in sickbay.
i'm detecting a vessel on long range scans. the warp signature matches the impostor's ship.
"harry, tell tom his coffee break is over. set a pursuit course."
"yes, ma'am."
the photon torpedoes you gave me are worthless. no better than plasma flares.
perhaps you didn't arm them properly.
"and in the middle of the battle, the polonians warned me to cease hostilities or face destruction at the hands of your federation. you allowed my enemies to join."
"evidently, the federation council decided that"
your federation is a fraud. i demand reparations.
you will have to submit a formal report to starfleet.
"enough! if you will not reimburse me, i'll seize your ship."
disable the beam.
i can't.
we have an additional problem. voyager.
there's another ship alongside the impostors. it's got them in a tractor beam.
hail both vessels.
no response from either one.
"well, let's try to get their attention. mister tuvok."
voyager's charging weapons.
perhaps we should surrender to them. the federation has an extremely humane policy regarding the treatment of prisoners
"hail varn again. do it. look on your scanners, varn. our mothership's arrived. she's armed and ready to defend us."
tell them to stand down.
"release us, or voyager will destroy you."
the other ship is hailing.
on screen.
"stand down, voyager."
"i have no argument with you. however, the vessel you're tractoring"
i paid for my federation membership. the delta flyer belongs to me now.
"sir, i think you've been misled."
yes. i have.
three direct hits. shields down to sixty percent.
target his tractor beam. nobody is taking possession of the delta flyer today except us.
lock onto them.
"yes, ma'am."
now our tractor generator's offline.
shields down to forty one percent.
the impostor's ship is powering engines.
"seven, transport everyone on that vessel directly to the brig."
establishing a lock on three life signs. that impact damaged the transporters. i'm losing annular confinement.
"harry, reroute additional power."
they're gone.
seven?
i only got one of them.
"get us out of here, mister paris."
"aye, captain."
nice hair.
it's not really my taste.
"posing as a starfleet captain, selling memberships to the federation. too bad we didn't think of it, tuvok. imagine the resources we could have acquired over the past six years."
indeed.
"i have to admit, i'm impressed."
i wish i could say the same. the great captain janeway. somehow i expected you to be taller. i make a better you than you.
"oh i don't know, i'd say we're very much alike. resourceful, intelligent, ambitious. but with just one tiny difference."
and what is that?
"i'm not a liar and a thief. you're going to give me a detailed account of everyone you cheated, and exactly what you did with their property."
why would i do that?
"because if you don't, i'm turning you over to telsian security."
"oh, is that supposed to frighten me?"
how much do you know about the telsians?
just that they're a more gullible species than most.
"tell her about your research, mister tuvok."
"i beg your pardon, captain?"
on telsian law. i think it's only fair that we let our guest know what to expect.
the telsian criminal justice system is rather barbaric.
tell her about the prisons.
"barely habitable. inmates often die of malnutrition before they are brought to trial. torture is commonplace, as is disease, including several incurable forms of psoriasis."
i think she gets the general idea.
suppose i do tell you. how do i know you won't turn me over to the telsians anyway?
"if you make full restitution to your victims, i'll give you safe passage out of this area."
"is that a promise, captain?"
"i know it's hard for you to believe, but occasionally some of us tell the truth."
"give me the delta flyer and three days to get as far away from here as i can, and then i'll send you the information you want."
how naive do you think i am?
"as far as the victims are concerned, you're the one who cheated them. without my help, you'll be the one who has a problem leaving this sector."
"tuvok, contact telsian security. tell them we have a prisoner to turn over."
psoriasis?
improvisation is not foremost among my talents.
"considering i caught you off guard, i thought your performance was exemplary."
"thank you, captain. was your order to call the telsians part of the deception or did you actually want me to contact them?"
not yet. let's give dala some time to think about those barbaric prisons.
do you believe she'll relent?
i'm not sure. something tells me she's just as stubborn as i am.
then am i to assume you have an alternative plan?
"i'm like you, tuvok. making it up as i go along."
"the captain said bread and water, but i didn't see any harm."
i'm not hungry.
i'll just leave it here in case you change your mind. may i ask you something?
you want to know if you really resemble the redeemer of light?
i'm not that gullible.
then what?
do you ever feel guilty? taking advantage of people who actually think that you care about them?
you seem like a good person. i'm sorry i lied to you.
"actually, i think you're just sorry you got caught."
probably.
"there. now you're being honest. i knew it was possible. if you don't mind my asking, why do you do what you do?"
"my father taught me most people will exploit you if they can. so, it's best to exploit them first."
"you know, i used to be a lot like you. living by my wits. never trusting anyone. always trying to end up on the more profitable side of a transaction."
and now you don't hesitate to help starving orphans.
i changed. when captain janeway made me part of the crew.
i suppose you suddenly reformed.
"no, no. not right away."
"at first i was just exploiting an opportunity to get a warm bed, food, protection. i kept waiting to find out what the captain wanted in return."
but she never asked for a thing.
"on the contrary. she expected a great deal from me. honesty, loyalty, hard work."
i should've guessed.
but i discovered that those were commodities i had in abundance. and it was much more profitable to share them than it was to be self-serving and cynical all the time. i'm happier than i've ever been.
i suppose that you think i could change too.
stranger things have happened.
do you really think that she'll give me safe passage if i make restitution?
if that's what she promised you.
then what? i have never done anything else.
"captain janeway let seven of nine remain on board, and she was borg."
are you saying she'd do the same thing for me?
i'd be willing to talk to her.
i cheated you. why are you being so kind to me?
"like my great grandmother used to say, it's nice to be nice."
is that tea still warm?
"oh, i'm sorry. i'm so clumsy!"
security to the brig!
she's gone.
it's not right to abandon her.
going back is too dangerous.
she's our captain.
"no, she's not. and even if she were, we wouldn't be able to rescue her. we'd be captured ourselves."
without captain janeway it will be difficult to continue our activities.
it's too late for that.
there must be a logical way
what's logical is to get as far away as we can.
there's a vessel approaching. it's the delta flyer.
activate the shields.
they're hailing. it's captain janeway.
our janeway or theirs?
which one did you expect?
"i'm pleased to see you, captain."
lower the shields so i can transport aboard.
how were you able to escape?
i'll tell you once i'm aboard.
: it's difficult to believe you weren't detected.
are you accusing me of something?
being cautious. how do we know this isn't a deception?
why would i try to deceive you?
you could be helping voyager capture us in exchange for your own freedom.
are we in position?
i don't have time for this. lower your shields and beam me aboard.
ready?
captain on the bridge.
"as you were. now, what about the bolomite and the rest of our earnings?"
they're exactly where we left them.
"well, it's time to collect them and leave the region. set a course before voyager finds us."
you're not in command here.
i just spent the last twenty four hours in voyager's brig. i have no intention of going back.
i'm picking up lifesigns on the delta flyer.
that can't be.
i was right. you brought them here.
don't be ridiculous. whoever it is must've stowed away.
they're hailing.
on screen.
this is tom paris of the starship voyager. prepare to be boarded.
he's charging weapons.
evasive manoeuvres.
let's get everything on board as quickly as we can.
"how many transport enhancers do you recommend, captain?"
do i have to think of everything?
we'll need at least ten if we're going to beam all that bolomite through the geostrata.
maybe we should take twelve.
we?
is there a problem?
in six years i've never known you to dirty your hands with menial labour.
"well, there's a first time for everything."
you don't trust us.
who knows what the two of you planned while i was in voyager's brig?
"as chief of security, i would never"
it's all right. we'll all go together.
after you.
"the next populated sector is thirteen days from here. when we arrive, we'll trade the delta flyer for a new ship. voyager will never find us. are all the transport enhancers in place?"
"that's the last of them. we can go now. if that's acceptable to you, captain."
i'm afraid there's been a change of plans.
"i've found the stolen items, captain. you can lock onto my coordinates."
i told you she couldn't be trusted.
how could you bring yourself to deceive your fellow officers?
"voyager, i repeat, i am in position."
can you get a lock?
negative. the geostratum is too dense.
keep trying. tuvok.
"i'm outnumbered. captain, i need assistance."
"voyager, now would be an excellent time to initiate transport."
you're not transporting anything.
captain?
"voyager, please respond."
you're a sight for sore eyes.
commander tuvok?
the one and only.
logic would indicate that neither of us has the advantage.
your logic is flawed.
stay where you are.
what did they promise you for betraying us?
i believe you've mistaken me for someone else.
where's dala?
i'm afraid she's indisposed at the moment.
"i wouldn't get up too fast if i were you, captain. it's going to take another few minutes for the ambazine to wear off."
"round and round they go. follow the terra nut if you can, but remember, the hand is sharper than your visual acuity."
i thought we'd already disproved that theory.
you tell me.
the terra nut is firmly entrenched up your right sleeve.
sorry.
that's impossible.
the old hand-off.
ooh.
that's cheating!
we've still got it.
"captain's log, stardate 53896. b'elanna torres has requested permission to take the delta flyer and search for dilithium. shining voyager, far from home, far from the gleaming cities of earth."
"headstrong b'elanna torres, and young harry kim, speed away from voyager on the delta flyer in search of their treasures."
i've trimmed the sails but the sea is rough. maybe we should return.
i know what i'm doing.
a wave as high as a mountain struck the delta flyer.
get into the escape pod.
we die together.
no one is going to die. go.
"young harry kim left her side and b'elanna torres was thrown against the rocks, the rocks of our very shore."
"which is where i, kelis the poet, found her. broken, dying. she told me her story, and now i've told you."
"an excellent conceit, that you discovered her yourself."
thank you.
"well, now that b'elanna torres has come to our shore, what will happen? does captain janeway come searching for her, or does she give her up for lost?"
who can say?
"well, i would hope that you can. i want to see more of these voyager eternals."
inspiration can't be forced.
one week.
or three weeks. maybe two. one week. the story will continue. have you noticed how thin my performers have gotten?
let them eat this.
"ladies and gentlemen, our patron salutes you."
finally!
we're doing another voyager play. as soon as i can write it.
"shall we celebrate, the two of us?"
i have very little time. celebrating will have to wait.
who are you?
"kelis, kelis the poet. your servant."
my servant? all right. let me go.
i can't.
why not?
"you'll fly from me, the way inspiration always does."
you're trying to kill me.
i'm releasing the heat from your veins.
what are you talking about?
you've been in a fever since i found you. bleeding is the best way to treat it.
"oh, i can see i'm in good hands."
something tells me you have your doubts.
"there's a medkit over there. a box, made out of metal. there's a small cylinder inside. bring it here. give it to me."
"don't be afraid, it won't hurt you. here. pass it over where you cut me."
you're an eternal. i suppose such things are to be expected.
what other things do you expect from an eternal?
"the power to make the ground open up and the sky to fall. all the strange events sung by the ancient poets. fortunately for me, no poet has ever sung about your clan. i'm the first."
my clan?
"the eternals on voyager. shining voyager, far from home."
what do you know about that?
"delta flyer log, stardate 53918. harry and i are continuing toward the fourth planet. sensors have picked up natural dilithium deposits on nearly every land mass."
acknowledged. has your warp core been damaged?
yes. we're running on thrusters. can you track our position?
how long have i been here?
"eight days. i was walking through these mountains. i saw a light burn across the sky and i heard a terrible sound. when i arrived, i found you. i treated your wounds."
and you tied me to this chair.
"when a gift falls from the heavens, only a fool would let her go. you've already given me one play. the story told by those voices. i pieced them together, tried to fill in the gaps."
you made a play out of our logs?
the away mission of b'elanna torres. my patron was impressed.
he has great taste. now take that knife of yours and cut me free.
that would be unwise.
why?
"my patron is intrigued by the voyager eternals. he wants another play. to compose that, i need more details."
and you expect to get them from me?
i did save your life.
i need to get back to voyager.
i need another play.
what exactly do you want to know?
everything.
it's not possible. we eternals have our rules. we can't just give everything away.
how did you get lost?
cut me free and i'll tell you.
you won't leave me?
cut me free.
you're the one who's leaving.
don't come back.
"computer, bring the subspace transmitter online."
unable to comply.
why not?
insufficient power.
great. now there's no power.
are you hungry?
i told you not to come back.
"you haven't eaten in days. we have to support each other, we poets."
i'm an engineer. i fix things.
"from the looks of it, you're not doing so well."
are you a poet or a critic?
tell me about earth.
"i have to sing for my supper, huh?"
"we all do, in one way or another. earth."
"it's a, an island. a beautiful island, blue and green."
"and voyager, a great ship?"
in a long line of great ships.
how did voyager get lost?
the caretaker.
an eternal?
"yes, you could say that. he caused a storm, which blew us off course."
tom paris. are you in love with him?
supper is over. come with me.
this is where we put all the names and dates when our heads won't hold any more.
a memory.
"exactly. tell me, have you ever seen this before?"
winter's tears.
can you get me some?
"this is dilithium, isn't it? what you were looking for?"
where can i find it?
"the only deposit i know of is on the hunting grounds of my patron. he'd execute me for trespassing. and you, well, he'd love to capture an eternal."
maybe i'm more powerful than he is.
"perhaps, but if he caught you he'd force you to fight against his enemies. they're constantly at each other's throats. bickering over territory, raiding each other's land, starting wars whenever they can be guaranteed of good weather. and we suffer the consequences. you don't want to get involved with them."
which is why you're going to get the dilithium.
"i told you, i'd be executed if i'm caught."
"the dilithium. or i don't say another word about shining voyager, far from home."
did you?
don't get caught.
well?
beautiful. i've got an idea for your next play.
"i've been visited by inspiration herself. how does this sound? the rescue of b'elanna torres. right here, in one week."
one week?
let's get to work.
dismissed.
that's it?
"mister paris, try to stay calm."
"no, that's not going to happen. isn't there anything else we can do?"
not until something shows up on sensors.
i'll take a shuttle out myself. i'll run a planet by planet search.
an inefficient plan.
and too dangerous. you could be hit by the same spatial eddies that sent the flyer off course.
"we need to concentrate our efforts from here, tom. all right? dismissed."
"steady-armed paris, bound by a sleep that brings no rest."
the door opens. the shadow of a woman falls on the helmsman. his eyes open.
"seven of nine, did you find b'elanna torres?"
i'm sorry to disappoint you.
closer. closer!
unpleasant news delivered by the most pleasing of messengers.
"no, no, no, no. seven of nine is a borg, the scourge of the eternals. you're portraying her like a shy bride on her wedding night once more."
"seven of nine, did you find b'elanna torres?"
i am sorry to disappoint you.
i can't blame my performers. these eternals on voyager are difficult to understand.
will you stop walking around? you're going to break something.
"this tuvok, for example. he's not like anybody i've ever met. no emotions? how is that possible?"
it just is.
it worked?
it worked.
"okay, computer, bring subspace transmitter online."
what happened?
i don't know. the transmitter must have been weakened in the crash. it couldn't take the energy surge.
these vulcans.
enough! what kind of metallurgic technology do you people have? alloys. which ones can you make? steel? bronze?
bronze.
"bronze, all right. i need a plate of metal this big, as thin as it can be, three parts tin to five parts bronze. one side coated with gold."
gold is expensive. i can't afford it.
then you're going into debt.
then tell me about the vulcans.
"get me the plate, and then i'll tell you."
everyone's asleep. i'll do it in the morning. the vulcans?
"maybe i've miscounted but, i don't think you've slept in ten days?"
your count is accurate.
don't you think you should go to bed?
"as a vulcan, i can function without sleep for more than two weeks."
"but there's a point of diminishing returns, when your mind starts to play tricks on you."
"my mind, mister neelix, does not play tricks."
"the ship is lonely without them, isn't it?"
"if you would allow me to continue my sensor analysis, i might be able to locate them."
"if there's anything else you need. a stronger tea, perhaps."
"when a friend is lost, the mind is split in half, divided between memory of the past and fear of the future. harry kim, ensign. only a boy when fate took you from the arms of blue green earth. b'elanna torres, half klingon, half human. i am honoured to call you"
what are you doing? is that a tear?
yes.
logical tuvok doesn't cry. that's why they call him logical.
everybody cries.
"the land of vulcan has no laughter, and it has no tears. it is a very quiet place. calm, just like tuvok."
i can't believe that.
"you don't have to, just don't cry."
"the audience won't believe it either. they'll either think tuvok is an unfeeling monster, or that i am a bad performer."
"they'll realise that beneath your unfeeling exterior is a heart that's breaking, silently, and in more pain than any of us can possibly understand, because that's what it is to be vulcan. try it again."
kelis!
what's wrong?
our patron has been insulted by his enemy to the north. the armouries are open.
has a battlefield been chosen?
not yet.
then we have a chance.
i need your help.
i've given you enough help. where's that piece of metal?
not bad.
my patron's been angered by the leader of a neighbouring state. he'll want to take revenge. it could lead to war.
we eternals aren't supposed to take sides.
i'm not asking you to fight. i need a way to change his mind.
i don't have that kind of magical power.
"yes, you do. i believe the right kind of play can turn the mind from violent thoughts. the perfect play might even stop a war."
i can't fix the transmitter with this. there's too many impurities. it'll never carry a plasma charge.
"if the fighting starts, scouting parties will start moving through these mountains. you'll be discovered. but my play, it could stop it from happening. you have to help me."
there's nothing i can do.
then come with me. i'll show you what i've done so far. it's our only chance.
"she's a fellow poet from across the eastern sea, an expert on the voyager eternals. she's devoted her life to them. she's here to help."
the rescue of b'elanna torres. we begin with harry kim reaching voyager in the escape pod. he tells captain janeway that b'elanna torres is lost. we continue to the point where they discover a piece of the delta flyer. after that
it's simple. they search for b'elanna torres. b'elanna torres is found.
or not found.
or not found. the end. it sounds pretty straightforward to me.
"that's exactly the problem. where is the mistaken identity, the discovery, the sudden reversal? mistaken identity, a character who is someone else. discovery, the moment when that identity is revealed. reversal, a situation that turns from good to bad in a blink of an eye."
"find the truth of your story and you won't need all those tricks. i don't know how things are done across the eastern sea, but here poets have become lazy. they rely on manipulation to move their audience. it wasn't always that way. welcome."
thank you.
"the truth of my story. it's an old-fashioned idea. today, audiences want excitement, passion. let me show you what i've done with captain janeway and commander chakotay. let's make a good impression on our visitor."
"chakotay, why must i be denied what every other female officer on this ship can have?"
captain?
the privilege of your touch.
come in.
"if that was good news, you'd be smiling."
i was just contacted by an alien transport vessel. they picked up the delta flyer's distress call.
the primary controls are offline. i've ordered harry to eject. i still have thrusters. i'm setting a course for an l class planet. i'll try to maintain contact.
they couldn't get a fix on her position. that was ten days ago.
b'elanna ordered harry into an escape pod. what's the longest he could survive?
less than ten days.
an l class planet.
i've already narrowed the search parameters.
"if b'elanna made it there, it's possible harry did too. good night, commander."
captain.
we'll have a final rehearsal in the morning.
"the last tuvok scene doesn't make sense to me, and we still don't have an ending."
i've got the rest of the night to work on it. maybe you can get some sleep.
what did you think?
captain janeway kissing commander chakotay? tom paris kissing seven of nine? i don't see the point.
"anger is like fire. love can be the rain that extinguishes it. my patron is filled with hatred for his rival, so our play should be filled with love."
you can't change somebody's way of life with a few lines of dialogue.
"yes, you can. it's been done before. do you know what this place used to be a hundred years ago? a temple, and this was the altar stone. every year a victim would be sacrificed on it in honour of winter. and then one year, nobody remembers exactly when or why, a play took the place of the ritual, and no one had to die here again. why can't my play take the place of a war?"
"well, you're going to have to do a lot better than harry kim kissing the delaney sisters."
why?
"because when you think that you are surrounded by enemies, when you're up against the borg, or, or species 8472, the last thing on your mind is romance."
you're an eternal. you have to help me.
"i'm sorry, kelis."
the borg. tell me more about them.
"they're soldiers, part of a vast army. they all think the same thoughts, and they travel on ships that look like hives."
like insect colonies.
they even have a queen.
that sounds terrifying. captain janeway hasn't been able to destroy them
"she is a starfleet officer, trained to avoid violence whenever possible. she would make peace with the borg if she could."
"this is what i need. an enemy, someone to stand in the way of voyager finding b'elanna torres. captain janeway, driven by vengeance, must seek out the queen of the borg. the audience thinks she plans to destroy them all, but"
go on.
"the sudden reversal. captain janeway, holding her spear at the queen's throat, throws her weapon aside and she argues passionately to put an end to their conflict in words no one will fail to understand."
including your patron? it's much better than all that kissing.
stay and help me. i still need an ending.
you'll figure something out.
b'elanna torres dies tragically.
you wouldn't dare.
i followed you here expecting to find a love nest. it's quite a nest. you're no poet from across the sea. you're an eternal. maybe even b'elanna torres herself.
don't be ridiculous.
you know all he thinks about is you?
"we're collaborators, that's all."
"if you come to the performance tomorrow night, i'll expose you to the autarch. just leave us alone. fix your ship and go, please."
friend of yours?
harry?
give me a hand.
oh. how?
"i ran into some turbulence in the escape pod, decided to turn around and follow your ion trail. landed about two hundred kilometres from here."
you walked?
"at night. i tracked your position with a tricorder and tried to stay hidden during the day. i've got some emergency rations left, a phaser, and the escape pod's transmitter, which i didn't have power left to run, but"
harry kim saves the day. just the ending i was looking for.
"the final moment, the last scene, more important than anything that's gone before. but what is it? where is she?"
your collaborator's probably halfway across the eastern sea by now.
she'll be here.
you said we'd have an ending by mid-morning. we won't have time to learn it.
it'll come to me. don't worry.
want to give it a try?
why not? the thirty eighth time might be the charm.
it's working.
the subspace transmitter is online.
why don't you do the honours?
"voyager, this is the delta flyer."
our patron has arrived. he's not in a very good mood.
he will be.
not if this is any indication.
"kelis, this is no way to end a play."
it doesn't make sense.
"it'll have to. go, go."
who are the enemies of voyager? the borg.
species 8472.
you know where the ridge ends just below the peak? run there as fast as you can. you'll find a vessel wrecked against the rocks. go inside and give this to our friend. don't be frightened. go.
tuvok. tuvok!
as you were. bridge to chakotay.
go ahead.
request permission to be relieved.
understood. i'll be right there.
we're picking up a subspace transmission. starfleet frequency.
it's a little rough. hang on.
delta flyer. harry and i are all right. we're on an l class planet. propulsion is down.
origin?
"five point two light years, f type star, looks like the fourth planet."
lay in a course. maximum warp.
seven of nine.
captain.
"the delta flyer has been found in pieces, on a rocky shore."
and b'elanna torres?
"no sign of her. seven of nine, you are my eyes and my ears. if anyone can find her, it is you."
"her eyes and her ears. and the viper in her nest. i, seven of nine, have no intention of finding b'elanna torres. i, seven of nine, am queen of the borg. surprised? no one will be more surprised than janeway when i take my revenge on voyager. say nothing or you, too, will be assimilated.  captain, i will comply."
"my enemies are everywhere without and within. seven of nine is queen of the borg. surprised? so was i. tell her nothing, or i will lose my advantage, and my ship as well."
are you okay?
yes.
we're fine.
good to hear it. we'll see you soon.
don't be afraid.
what is it?
"without inspiration, b'elanna torres will perish. he's threatening to kill off b'elanna as the climax to his play."
let him.
that means that he still can't figure out the ending.
who cares?
i do.
you're serious?
"harry, have you ever inspired anybody?"
that's kind of a strange question.
"it's been a strange couple of weeks. he needs me, or he's the one who's going to die on that stage."
what are you talking about?
the transporter is online.
tell the captain i'll be a little late.
b'elanna.
wait for my signal.
my death is irrelevant. you will never see the gleaming cities of earth. you will be assimilated.
and if i let you live?
also irrelevant.
you don't believe that.
the battle is over. go home.
"how foolish of you to let me go, free to attack you again."
"and again and again, until all your drones and all my crew are destroyed. until everything we value is gone, and there is nothing left but our hatred."
this final scene will ruin everything that we've done out there. we'll have to improvise.
it's too late.
"no, it's not."
i knew you'd come.
and i told you not to.
wait! let's go.
"finally, voyager has reached our shores."
and not a moment too soon. kelis the poet must say goodbye as b'elanna torres returns to the eternals in a dazzling blaze of light.
"on a far-away, snow-covered peak."
"no, right here before your eyes."
wait! she's not from across the eastern sea. she's an eternal. i'm telling you she's b'elanna torres. the real b'elanna torres! i saw her ship.
"the lead actress, in a fit of jealousy, brands her rival an eternal. our patron rises to his feet to stop the play."
nicely done. i almost believed you. continue.
stay.
voyager needs me.
so do i.
"no, you don't. you have all that you need right here."
i'll be inspired every time i think of you.
"one to beam, to ascend to the heavens."
"and so ends the rescue of b'elanna torres. half klingon b'elanna torres. half human b'elanna torres, chief engineer."
"these stories will continue for as long as we have the breath to tell them. and as long as our patrons remain wise and compassionate. and voyager will continue on her journey to the gleaming cities of earth, where peace reigns and hatred has no home."
come in.
you wished to see me.
we've known each other for how long?
approximately twenty years.
we've served on three starships together. i was present at your daughter's kohlinar. i consider you one of my closest friends.
and i regard you with the same esteem.
"i've always been honest with you, but you've been keeping something from me."
i don't know what you mean.
"don't you? it took exhaustive research, sifting through teraquads of data, separating fact from rumour, but eventually i arrived at the truth."
captain?
happy birthday.
thank you.
"so, it's not long before you hit the big three digits, huh?"
indeed. have you informed anyone else of your discovery?
"don't worry, tuvok, my lips are sealed. well? you're supposed to blow out the candle."
that is not a vulcan custom.
humour me.
captain to the bridge.
well?
it was a fire hazard.
we're receiving a distress call. a small vessel on an intercept course.
lifesigns?
one. it's ocampan.
we're being hailed.
kes?
"captain janeway, i need your help. will you please give me permission to come aboard?"
of course. what's happened?
"please, let me come aboard."
prepare the docking port. tell the doctor to stand by.
her ship is accelerating. it's on a collision course.
janeway to kes. cut your engines. you're coming in too fast.
five seconds till impact.
lock on a tractor beam. evasive manoeuvres.
hull breach on deck nine.
emergency force fields.
"captain, a transporter was activated just before impact. she's beamed aboard."
"i'm reading bulkhead ruptures. deck eleven, section seventeen, eighteen, nineteen."
cause?
unknown.
i've located kes. she's moving through those sections. she's giving off high levels of neurogenic energy.
"janeway to kes. kes, respond."
"hull breach, section twenty."
forcefields. security to deck eleven.
forcefields are not holding.
she's approaching main engineering.
bridge to engineering. intruder alert.
stop where you are.
kes?
state your intentions.
evacuate engineering.
warp power is fluctuating.
torres to bridge. kes is in direct contact with the warp core.
she's drawing power from it somehow.
shut it down.
warp power is returning to normal.
"b'elanna, report."
lieutenant torres is dead. kes has vanished.
"send mulchaey, he's in deflector control. we'll need more power to junction twelve j, and tell harry i want to talk to him about building a new energy grid. lost?"
"no, just looking. captain janeway suggested that i get more familiar with the ship."
"well, if you have any questions, let me know."
thanks.
we're about to run a diagnostic on the warp core assembly. you can watch if you want.
"thanks, but i really should be getting back to sickbay."
"computer, has long has voyager been in the delta quadrant?"
"fifty six days, seventeen hours."
back so soon? i thought you went to the airponics bay to collect herbs.
i forgot something.
ah. pyong ko.
excuse me?
"you encouraged me to choose a name, remember? pyong ko was a twenty first century surgeon who discovered the genetic sequence for inhibiting cancer cells. it heralded a new chapter in earth's medical history."
"that's a perfect name, doctor."
"then again, i'm also considering schweitzer, jarvik, pasteur. there are so many options, each with its own merits."
why don't you give it some more thought? you don't have to decide right away.
"of course, it's not that i require one for reasons of vanity. i'm just a hologram after all. but if i had a name, other than doctor or hey you, it might encourage the crew to treat me with a little more respect. kes?"
hello? neelix?
"neelix, if you want to put your own stamp on it, maybe you should give it your own name, like the greasy neelix or the double talaxian with cheese."
"it has a nice ring to it. thank you, lieutenant, i'll keep that in mind. sweeting, what'll it be? the usual?"
i'm not hungry. i thought that i'd bring captain janeway some coffee.
that's very thoughtful. i'm looking forward to tonight.
"actually, i have a lot of work to do in sickbay."
but i already reserved the holodeck. i thought we could take a moonlit stroll through the marshlands of oshionian prime.
another time. i promise.
something wrong?
bad morning.
anything i can do?
i'll be fine.
"i'm not having a great day, either. nobody seems to like today's menu. i tried blaming it on a replicator malfunction, but no one believed me. wait, i, i think i see something. neelix to security, kes' frown is losing its structural integrity. red alert, i'm detecting a smile. that's my kes."
the coffee?
"that last attack nearly cost us our impulse drives. fortunately, b'elanna found a way to reroute power from the deflector."
"a good choice for chief engineer, if i do say so myself."
getting to know your enemy.
"i feel like i already do. remember the old story? man goes to risa, where he meets a beautiful woman who invites him over for an evening of passion."
"he wakes up in the morning, feeling wonderful, until he discovers he's missing a kidney."
"every cadet about to go on his first shore leave hears that cautionary tale. doesn't seem so outrageous anymore, does it?"
"no, but the vidiians are more than just your garden variety monsters. i've been studying their culture. they were a lot like us before the phage."
do i detect a note of sympathy?
makes you wonder what we'd do under the same circumstances.
come in.
"oh, you read my mind."
vidiians?
i'm afraid so. we've picked up two more ships on long range sensors. i've gone to full tactical alert. we're taking every precaution.
i'm sure you'll get us through it safely.
"thanks for the vote of confidence. tuvok thinks he's found a way to penetrate their shields. the next time they attack us, it won't be so easy."
that's good to hear.
captain to the bridge.
on my way.
"oops. i'm so clumsy, i'm sorry."
"don't worry about it. this desk has seen its share of coffee spills, believe me."
ensign wildman has an intriguing proposal.
we've been analysing the vidiian bio-readings from the last attack. their immune systems have been compromised by the phage. we could synthesise a neural agent that would incapacitate them without affecting us.
might come in handy if we're ever boarded.
exactly.
"work with the doctor. when you've got something, find a way to deploy it through the environmental systems."
"aye, captain."
the ships we detected earlier have disappeared from our sensors.
maybe we outran them.
they wouldn't give up that easily.
why would they? voyager's the only organ bank within half a parsec.
we fought off their first attacks. now they seem content to show up on sensors just long enough for us to change course. it's like we're being herded somewhere.
if we maintain our present course we're going to enter a region filled with subspace vacuoles.
we'd have to drop to impulse to get through.
sounds like a good place for an ambush.
the maquis used to lure the cardassians into the badlands. those galor class cruisers had nowhere to run.
"neither will we, unless. tom, how dense are those vacuoles?"
they cover about seventy percent of the region.
"excuse me, doctor."
"tom, what's the first thing they teach you about manoeuvring at warp?"
"faster than light, no left or right. when possible, maintain a linear trajectory. course corrections could fracture the hull."
"exactly. we'd have to drop to impulse every time we made a course change but, what if we let voyager do the driving?"
ma'am?
we could pre-programme every kilometre. that way we'd only spend a second or two at impulse every time the computer executed a turn.
auto-navigation the entire way?
"no offence, but the neural gel packs can calculate vectors a little faster than you can."
b'elanna?
we'd need a more accurate scan of the region. if we even graze one of those vacuoles
we could send a shuttle ahead.
the delta flyer. its sensors are more advanced.
the delta what?
forgive me. i must have been thinking of another starship.
"prepare a shuttle. i want all of voyager's systems operating at peak efficiency by the time tom gets back. if we're going to pull this off, there's no margin for error. dismissed."
"computer, display an image of the ocampan homeworld. plot a course from voyager's current position."
homesick?
lieutenant!
"tom. it's okay, a lot of people on board feel the same way."
i spent my entire life trying to get away from ocampa. why would i want to go back?
"because it's home. home for me means a penal colony. out here, i get to fly a state of the art ship, and there's no admirals in sight."
what are you doing?
getting ready for a scouting mission.
you planning on going somewhere?
"er, no, of course not. i was just studying the helm configurations."
i didn't know you could pilot a shuttle.
"i can't, but i'd like to learn."
"well, then, why not learn from the best? i could start you off in the holodeck, in an old class one. it's the kind of shuttle my father used to take me up in."
"that would be very nice, lieutenant. tom."
identify yourself.
"it's me, tuvok. naomi wildman."
"may i help you, sir? lieutenant, is something wrong?"
"hello, sweeting. i took the liberty of preparing one of your favourite meals. it's under replicator programme neelix one. call me if you'd like some company. miss you."
"computer, end music. open an encrypted channel. direct the signal to the following coordinates."
channel open.
"my name is kes. i'm aboard the starship voyager. respond. i know you're receiving this transmission, and i also know that your attempt to capture this ship will fail. if you want to harvest voyager's crew, i suggest you answer me now."
explain.
"captain janeway is aware of your ambush. she's found a way to evade your vessels, but i can help you."
i'm listening.
"i can send you tactical data on their shields, weapons. everything you need to take this ship."
this is a deception.
do you want this crew or not?
in return?
safe passage to ocampa for myself and one other.
why would you sentence your own crew to death?
they're not my crew. they abandoned me a long time ago.
"computer, access voyager's tactical database."
command authorisation required.
access granted.
naomi wildman?
she appeared to be half ktarian.
ensign wildman's husband is ktarian. i met him once on deep space nine.
"there's more. i followed her to cargo bay two, where i saw a woman and two children, all with cybernetic implants."
borg?
"i can't explain it, captain. i've had hallucinations before, but only while in a state of deep meditation. these were specific and they evoked a sense of anticipation."
it almost sounds like you're describing a premonition.
indeed.
i didn't think vulcans had premonitions.
they don't. that's what concerns me.
"computer, maintain a continuous proximity scan of lieutenant tuvok. ten metre radius, all sensor parameters. in case you have any more visions."
a logical plan.
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
we're approaching the vacuoles.
on my way.
last chance to take the long way around.
it does feel like we're sneaking through a graveyard at midnight. any sign of the vidiians?
"not yet, but it's a safe bet they're in there."
tom?
"trajectory's laid in. our trip will take three hours, twelve minutes, eleven seconds with two hundred and sixteen course changes."
"well, let's get started."
engaging at warp eight. sit back and enjoy the ride.
one of the vacuoles shifted position. the computer's adjusting our vector.
"dropping to impulse, two point three degree turn starboard, jumping to warp six."
"one down, two hundred and fifteen to go."
i'll be in sickbay.
"dropping to impulse. new heading, oh thirty one mark two."
there's a ship approaching. it's on a collision course.
i'm not reading any ship.
lieutenant?
"permission to be relieved, sir. i am not well."
of course.
the molecular structures appear to be stable. good.
report.
we've devised a neural agent that should inhibit the vidiian's motor functions without causing any permanent damage.
good. i don't want to add to their health problems. i just want to keep them from adding to ours.
i'll get to work.
"doctor, when was the last time you examined ensign wildman?"
i performed her annual physical six weeks ago.
did you find anything unusual?
she's in perfect health.
"this may seem like a strange question, but i need to know if she's pregnant."
i'm not at liberty to disclose that information. doctor-patient confidentiality.
what about captain's orders?
"sorry, medical protocol supersede your authority in these matters."
the security of this ship could be at stake.
she planned on telling you herself.
boy or girl?
"female. half ktarian, as a matter of fact, which should nearly double the infant's gestation period. how did you know?"
and they say i'm rude.
we're receiving a distress call.
life signs?
it's ocampan.
kes?
let me come on board.
her ship is accelerating. it's on a collision course.
hull breach on deck nine.
emergency forcefields.
she's approaching main engineering.
state your intentions.
let me come on board.
it's on a collision course.
forcefields.
we're receiving a distress call.
bridge to engineering. intruder alert.
: stop where you are.
state your intentions.
warp power is fluctuating.
she's drawing power from it somehow.
problem?
hey.
"torres to sickbay, medical emergency."
twenty milligrams lectrazine. cortical stimulator. we'll start at twenty millijoules.
ready.
now. he's gone into synaptic shock. i don't understand.
can i speak with him?
i think it's best to keep him sedated for now.
when did this begin?
"early this afternoon, in engineering."
time. i need the exact time.
lieutenant torres called sickbay at fourteen hundred twenty two hours.
"computer, display proximity scan of lieutenant tuvok at fourteen hundred twenty two hours. oh."
captain?
tachyons.
i beg your pardon?
there was a surge of tachyon particles just before tuvok collapsed.
"that could have triggered this, but where did they come from?"
they're normally caused by temporal distortions.
time travel?
let me know if his condition changes.
"kes, you have telepathic abilities. have you experienced anything unusual during the past couple of days? hallucinations, premonitions?"
"no, nothing."
"if you do, you'll let me know?"
"of course, captain."
we're low on neuro-stabilisers. i'll go replicate some more.
hurry back.
where's the tactical data you promised us?
i'm downloading it now. i'll transmit it to you once you've arrived.
i need it now.
"janeway's already suspicious. if i transmit it now, i'll be discovered."
that's your problem.
"apparently it's yours, too."
"gentlemen, scan for tachyon particles deck by deck."
tachyons?
do it.
looking for something specific?
i'm not sure.
report.
we're under attack. a vidiian ship is closing on our position.
battlestations.
we've lost warp drive and weapons.
they're cutting through our shields. remodulate.
i'm trying. they keep matching the frequencies.
we've still got impulse.
they've taken out navigation. i can't plot a course.
they're cutting an access route through the hull. evacuate deck three and seal it off.
bridge to sickbay. are you ready with that neural agent?
"aye, captain."
stand by to release it on deck three.
acknowledged. fifty millilitres should suffice.
doctor!
doctor to the bridge. environmental controls aren't responding.
"harry, what's going on?"
we've been locked out of that system.
"what do you mean, locked out?"
the command relays have been fused.
"they know where to find us, they know our shield frequencies, which systems to target."
we're being boarded.
i'm reading an em fluctuation. it could be a transmission.
location?
airponics bay.
who's down there?
i'm picking up two bio-readings. the sensors must be malfunctioning. they're both reading as kes.
security to airponics bay. shut down control functions to that section. i'm going down there. something tells me we've got more than one battle on our hands.
"computer, initiate site-to site transport programme kes beta six."
unable to comply. control functions have been disabled.
"shush, shush. i'm taking you home."
we've got weapons back.
can you target those hooks?
not at this range. we'd breach the upper hull.
it's better than being dissected.
reverse the hull polarity. maybe we can shake them loose.
"now one of you doesn't belong here, and i'm guessing it's you. tuvok's premonitions were real. you're from the future."
a future i'm about to change.
"you're helping the vidiians, kes. why?"
tell me why you're doing this.
i won't let you hurt her again.
i haven't done anything to harm her.
"you took her from ocampa, her home. she's a prisoner on this ship."
"no one's a prisoner here, kes."
i was a child. you corrupted me with your ideas.
what ideas?
"exploration, discovery. i believed you."
"hull polarity loosened their hold, but not by much."
it's a start. reroute the deflector. have it discharge anti-graviton pulses along the hull. engage the inertial dampers. get a controlled pitch going.
"in three years, i'm going to leave voyager in search of higher things because you encouraged me to do it. you encouraged me to develop my mental abilities. i wasn't ready for what i found. i couldn't control it. it scared me. i had nowhere to go. i thought of returning home to ocampa, but i'd changed too much. i knew they'd be frightened of me. i knew they wouldn't accept me, but they'll accept her."
"you don't have to destroy this ship, kes. we can help you."
"no, i trusted you."
kes.
no!
we're breaking free.
they're trying to lock on us with a tractor beam.
reverse thrusters. full power.
that could tear the hull apart.
then tear it apart!
"photon torpedoes, full spread. ready, fire!"
"it's set to kill, kes."
janeway to bridge. status?
the vidiians are in retreat. everything all right down there?
for now.
she was here in my last premonition. she appeared older. her face was tired.
what was she doing?
"she had her hands on the casing, as if she was drawing energy from it."
the tachyons are concentrated here. it's possible she needed the core to travel back in time.
"if that's true, then she'll need it again."
and we don't know when that'll be. we have to be ready.
doctor to the captain.
go ahead.
kes has regained consciousness.
what do you remember?
"i was in airponics, and then i felt dizzy, and then i was watching myself."
yourself?
"computer, deactivate emh. what i'm about to tell you stays between the three of us. understood?"
"yes, captain."
"something terrible has happened. or more precisely, will happen. we're going to need your help to prevent it from happening again."
"it took exhaustive research, sifting through teraquads of data, separating fact from rumour, but eventually i arrived at the truth."
captain?
happy birthday.
thank you.
"so, it's not long before you hit the big three digits, huh?"
indeed. have you informed anyone else of your discovery?
"don't worry, tuvok, my lips are sealed. well, you're supposed to blow out the candle."
that is not a vulcan custom.
humour me.
captain to the bridge.
on my way. well?
it was a fire hazard.
we're receiving a distress call. a small vessel on an intercept course.
life signs?
one. it's ocampan.
i'd almost forgotten.
we're being hailed.
red alert. raise shields.
captain?
"all hands, this is the bridge. begin emergency evacuation of deck eleven. repeat."
all hands evacuate deck eleven.
"you heard her, get moving. now!"
open a channel. kes.
"captain janeway, i need your help. will you please give me permission to come aboard?"
of course. what's happened?
"please, let me come aboard."
her ship is accelerating. it's on a collision course.
five seconds to impact.
tuvok.
lock on a tractor beam. evasive manoeuvres.
shields are holding. her ship is intact.
"captain, a transporter was activated just before impact. she's beamed aboard. i'm reading bulkhead ruptures on deck eleven, section seventeen, eighteen, nineteen."
how did you know?
ready?  shut down the warp core. you have the bridge.
"remember me? the innocent child you're here to save? you blame captain janeway, but the choice was yours. you made the decision to leave ocampa, and you made the decision to leave voyager. if you're watching me now, you've come back to take revenge on the people who cared about you. that's not who you are, and that's not who i am. don't do this. find another way home. captain janeway will help you if you give her a chance. try to remember who you were. try to remember me."
"don't you remember? you made that holo-recording because you didn't want this to happen again. three years ago, you travelled back in time. kes, you wanted to take that woman with you and you were willing to hand the rest of us over to the vidiians to do it. it didn't work. you forced me to kill you, kes. if you go back now, it'll all happen again. just before this terrible thing happened, you told me you had nowhere to go. that's not true. stay here with us."
i can't. i don't belong here. i need to be with my own people.
"you told me you had the ability to get home, but you were afraid the ocampans wouldn't accept you. why?"
i remember.
what? what do you remember?
"the holo-recording. i remember making it. you asked me to help you, to help myself. you wanted me to remember who i was. these years were so filled with confusion and anger. i buried the memory. i'd almost forgotten."
does it really matter which kes goes home?
a few snacks for the journey. you do still like leola root?
thank you. what?
just looking.
see anyone you know?
only you.
"goodbye, kes."
captain.
what should we tell the others?
a friend got lost. we helped her find her way.
shuttlecraft dawkins to jupiter station.
go ahead.
this is lieutenant reginald barclay requesting permission to dock.
granted.
what? what is it?
"it's me, sir, reg barclay."
come in.
doctor z? how are you?
nice of you to finally drop by.
"i've been extremely busy. the, er, pathfinder project."
"you're still searching for that ship? what's it called, pioneer?"
"er, voyager."
voyager. any luck?
"actually, we're on the verge of a breakthrough. a communications link."
congratulations. the first transgalactic phone call.
is there any word from starfleet medical?
doctors. i've been scanned and probed a hundred times and they still can't tell me what's wrong.
i'm sure it's only a matter of time.
"i'm dying, reginald. and there's nothing anybody can do about it."
seven of nine to the bridge.
go ahead.
we're receiving a transmission from starfleet.
route it here.
"it's not a comm. link, captain. it appears to be"
"a compressed datastream, badly degraded."
on my way.
"they say good things come in small packages. this is all the data they could send us, until next month."
next month?
"they're using a cyclic pulsar to amplify signals from the midas array, but the cycle only peaks every thirty two days."
so once a month we'll be able to receive a short burst of information. and we'll have about seventeen hours to respond.
"so far we've gotten tactical updates, letters from home, and news about the alpha quadrant."
i don't suppose they found us a shortcut home.
it doesn't look that way.
"we don't have much time to prepare a response, and we'll have to keep it short, but i want to give everyone an opportunity to send something. even if it's only a brief note."
inform the crew.
"yes, ma'am."
"aye, captain."
"lieutenant barclay, the pathfinder project. they didn't give up on us. so when you write those letters, you might want to thank them."
mail call.
"a letter? for me? oh, it's from lieutenant barclay."
bad news?
"lewis zimmerman. apparently, he's seriously ill."
zimmerman?
he's the father of modern holography. he invented the matrix that made my programme possible.
oh. what's wrong with him?
"he's suffering from acute subcellular degradation. the doctors here are having trouble finding the cause, much less a treatment. i've included his medical files. as you'll see, the prognosis isn't good. they say he's only got a few months. i'm sorry i don't have better news to report, but i thought you'd want to know."
how well did you know him?
i've never met the man.
"if you'd like to send a response, the captain will need it by nineteen hundred hours."
here's the information you requested.
thank you.
you're reviewing his medical data.
"i thought i could send starfleet a second opinion. it's a long shot, but maybe my experiences in the delta quadrant could provide some insights. i was hoping these borg regeneration techniques might help them develop a treatment for his condition."
you bear a striking resemblance.
he used his own physical parameters as a model for my matrix. can't say i blame him. a doctor needs to inspire confidence in his patients. compassionate eyes and a strong chin can go a long way.
"i believe i can help him, captain."
how?
"you remember the vidiians? the early stages of the phage are very similar to doctor zimmerman's disease. i believe i can adapt a variety of borg regeneration techniques to arrest the cell damage, maybe even reverse it."
"make sure to pass along your findings. thank you, doctor."
"actually, i was hoping to administer the treatment myself."
what are you suggesting?
"i'd like you to send my programme back to the alpha quadrant. none of the doctors at starfleet are familiar with these techniques. it would take them months to fully understand them, much less put them to use."
"even if we could send you, you're needed here."
mister paris can take over sickbay. he's more than capable. we've done this once before. there weren't any problems.
"three years ago, and we used alien technology."
i've spoken to seven of nine. she believes we can compress my programme.
"there's limited space in the datastream. if we send you, there won't be room for anything else."
"i realise i'd be asking the crew to make a sacrifice on my behalf, but they can wait another month. doctor zimmerman might not have that time."
"i'm sorry he's not doing well. unusual man. i met him once at a conference. he managed to offend just about everyone there, but he was certainly brilliant. i'm sure starfleet is consulting their best physicians, doctor."
"they are, but no one's been able to develop a cure. i have. but i can't treat a patient who's thirty thousand light years away."
i'm sorry.
captain.
this is the first time we're attempting to send a response. we don't know if it will even get through.
i'm willing to take that risk.
i'm not.
"he programmed me. every algorithm, every subroutine. if it weren't for his years of work, i wouldn't be standing here. i owe him something. and frankly, so does this crew. in a way, he's responsible for every life i've saved."
lewis zimmerman designed the template for starfleet's emh. you're one of thousands based on that technology. it's not as though he's your father.
"from your perspective. from mine, he's the closest thing i've got. if i don't try to help him now, i may never get the chance."
you'll have to find a way to convince tom to take those duty shifts.
he's already agreed.
tell him captain jane said hello. that's what he kept calling me at the conference. i think he did it just to get on my nerves.
i've heard he can be difficult.
i certainly hope you get a chance to find out.
"thank you, captain."
my vocal processor.
it's not a malfunction. i've removed your singing algorithms. they'll be stored in a memory buffer until you return.
why?
your programme's too large for the datastream. i have to extract all non-essential subroutines.
they're essential to me. they're part of who i am.
are you planning on performing opera during your visit?
no.
will you be reciting poetry?
doubtful.
hoverball? holophotography?
i may want to take a few snapshots to document my trip.
sexual activities?
i get the point. how much has to be left behind?
twelve megaquads.
i suppose you could get rid of my athletic abilities and my grand master chess programme.
that leaves three megaquads. your painting skills?
"oh, if you must. try to leave a few of my enhancements intact. i don't want to look like every other emh on the block. i think doctor zimmerman will be very interested to see what i've learned. he probably never imagined what one of his own creations could accomplish. i could spark a whole new field in holographic research."
bon voyage.
see you in a month.
don't get lost.
"if i've told you once, i've told you a thousand times. stay off the food."
"haley? haley, what's the status of my lunch?"
"it's coming, doctor!"
"as if things weren't bad enough, now i'm dying of starvation."
come in!
haley.
mister barclay. is something wrong?
"no, no, just the opposite. is he in?"
he's not taking visitors today.
tell him this is important.
he's in a prickly mood.
"i've brought something with me that might cheer him up. computer, is the download complete?"
affirmative.
lunch.
that's not pork chops.
it's salad.
i didn't ask for salad.
it's healthy.
i'm dying. a piece of meat isn't going to kill me any quicker. give the plants to leonard. he's the one trying to watch his weight.
lieutenant barclay is here to see you.
i told you i wasn't
he says it's urgent.
"can't it wait until i'm dead? all right, send him in. three minutes. he's got three minutes."
"be civil to him, lewis. he's worried about you. we all are."
i found a friend waiting for me at home.
you don't have any friends.
"well, i guess, er, you could say he's a friend of yours."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"an emh mark one? i'm not in the mood for nostalgia, reginald."
but this is the mark one from voyager.
i was compressed into a datastream and transmitted from the delta quadrant.
congratulations. i recommend a tour of jupiter's third moon. i hear the lava flows are lovely this time of year.
i'm not here for a vacation. i'm here to treat your illness.
"you brought a mark one thirty thousand light years to treat me? i was wrong about you, reginald. you do have a sense of humour."
care to let me in on the joke?
you didn't tell him?
tell me what?
"well, i, er"
"you're obsolete, extinct. yesterday's news."
my programme was retired?
"retired? not at all. the emh mark one was reconfigured to scrub plasma conduits on waste transfer barges. i've been treated by the mark three, the mark four, not to mention the finest real doctors in starfleet. none of them could help me."
he has been running almost continuously for six years. he has seen more things than most doctors can even imagine.
i also have an exceptionally high tolerance for difficult patients.
i didn't programme you for sarcasm.
you'll find i'm full of surprises.
show the good doctor to the plasma generator. i understand there's quite a build-up of residue.
"if we had more time, i'd enjoy trading barbs with you. but right now, there's a more pressing concern. your life. i'm working on a treatment based on a disease i encountered in the delta quadrant, but i'll need to run a complete analysis. however, if it's impossible for you to believe that a lowly mark one could have anything useful to offer, i'll be happy to pack my bags and go explore those sulphur mines."
"go ahead, scan away."
i'll be outside.
what were your initial symptoms?
"radical hair loss. fatigue, nausea, joint inflammation."
have you travelled outside the solar system recently?
what's that got to do with anything?
just answer the question.
i haven't left jupiter station in over four years.
"to your knowledge, have you been exposed to theta radiation?"
no.
neutron flux?
never.
have you had intimate relations with a bolian?
these are questions first year medical students would ask.
i'm just being thorough.
just being thorough.
did that creature just speak?
his name's leonard. he's a hologram.
"computer, deactivate iguana."
how dare you!
"i'm a doctor, not a zoo keeper. has there ever been an epidemic on this station?"
no! enough questions! finish your scans and get out of here.
doctor.
i said get out of here.
i travelled halfway across the galaxy to treat you. the least you could do is show a little gratitude.
thank you. get out of here!
i may be the only physician who can save your life. you need me.
like hell. i brought your matrix into this world and i can take it out.
i'm no longer a prototype. i have exceeded my original programming. i'm no longer under your control.
"oh, really? computer, transfer emh to the living quarters."
how did it go?
power up the midas array. i'm leaving.
"what, what happened this time?"
"i ran a mitochondrial scan. there was something odd about the results, so i spent a full hour analysing them. and what did i discover? he's a vulcan marsupial. he reconfigured my tricorder! you find that amusing?"
"a little. well, not really."
sounds like you're making progress.
how so?
he only teases people he likes.
then he must love me.
"i take it that you, er, still haven't been able to diagnose him."
"on the contrary, the patient appears to be suffering from an acute case of arrogance!"
"oh, that's roy."
don't tell me. a hologram?.
it was commissioned by starfleet intelligence. an experiment in micro-surveillance. doctor z keeps it around as a sort of a pet.
"undercover insects, talking iguanas. this isn't a research station, it's a three ring circus. you should charge admission."
"look. look, you know that we can't send you back for another two weeks so please, just, just keep trying."
i can't treat a patient who won't let me near him. he's deranged. what he needs is a counsellor.
"finally, i've accomplished something."
"i thought you might be able to provide some, er, insight."
"it's not that simple, reg. doctor zimmerman sounds like a very complex individual. i'd need to speak to him in person."
then maybe i could get him to agree to a counselling session.
the enterprise is in the middle of a mission. we're nearly seven light years from you.
an important mission?
"they're all important, reg. i could refer you to counsellor jenzo, a colleague of mine on earth."
"i need the best, deanna."
it would be an interesting challenge.
"thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
"don't thank me yet. i'll still need to clear this with captain picard. if he agrees, i might be able to be there by early next week."
i'll see you then.
come in.
good morning. problem?
i haven't decided. i've just listened to a communiqué from admiral hayes.
nice to have friends in high places.
"hello, captain. i hope this message finds you well. from what i understand, it has not been easy, but i want you to know that a lot of people here are very proud of what you've accomplished. i also want to assure you that we have not given up finding a way to get you home. we've redirected two deep space vessels toward your position. if all goes well, they could rendezvous with you in the next five to six years."
"computer, advance to time index one twenty one point four."
"as we get closer and our conversations become more frequent. when you respond to this message, please let us know of any casualties. i'm sure you've had more than your share. i'm anxious to know the status of your crew, the maquis, first contacts that you've made, interactions with the borg. but there'll be time for everything. our thoughts are with you. talk to you soon."
what?
status of the maquis.
do you find that surprising?
i don't think of you or b'elanna or the others as maquis. i think of you as part of my crew.
"you may have forgotten, but we haven't. you heard the admiral. it'll be years before we have to deal with those issues. let's worry about it then."
do you have lunch plans?
is that an invitation?
i was hoping you'd help me compose a response.
you're on.
"doctor, your lunch is ready."
are you all right?
"fine, haley, fine. give me a few minutes."
"ah. ah. lower. ah. perfect. i needed this. you have no idea what i've had to endure these past few days. last night i woke up and i found him hovering over my bed with a hypospray. a smattering of photons, that's all he is. what's that? what is that? a tricorder? you were scanning me? computer, realign voyager's emh. you!"
remain calm. emotional outbursts will only aggravate your condition.
i'll tell you what's aggravating my condition. you!
if you'd let me examine you.
i'll report you to the medical ethics board.
doctor!
save it for your hearing.
"if you weren't so stubborn, you'd see i'm only trying to help."
i don't want your help! why won't you leave me alone?
"because, for reasons beyond my comprehension, i care about you."
you weren't programmed to care. you were programmed to hold a scalpel.
"i told you, i'm not the same emh you created six years ago."
of course. you can sing and dance. i should install you in a ferengi nightclub.
the voyager crew appreciates my attempts to expand my programme.
"this isn't voyager. it's my lab. and in my lab, you're still just a hologram."
a hologram you created. a hologram who owes you his existence.
"is that what's keeping you here? some twisted sense of obligation? well, let me assure you, you don't owe me anything."
doctor?
"yes, haley, what is it?"
you have a visitor.
"hello, i'm deanna troi. which one of you is doctor zimmerman?"
deanna troi. another one of your tricks?
excuse me? ow!
he thinks you're a hologram.
i can assure you i'm quite real.
oh. well. the last beautiful woman to walk in here turned out to be him.
i'll take that as a compliment.
did i come at a bad time?
"your timing couldn't be better. the patient is suffering from acute anxiety, normally associated with terminal illness. it's made him agoraphobic, paranoid and extremely antagonistic."
i see. mind if i sit down?
please.
reg tells me you won't let the doctor help you.
he's a mark one. he's obsolete. i'd be safer in the hands of a klingon field medic.
i understand he's developed a promising treatment.
if you're a borg drone. he's threatening to use some kind of ghoulish assimilation technique. it's not fit for a lab rat.
"you won't even look at my research. from the moment i arrived, you've berated me, treated me like an antique. well, let me tell you something. antique or not, i took a huge risk coming here. i had to plead with my captain, leave my ship without a surgeon."
"doctor. imagine that your programme was seriously damaged, and the only person who could repair you was an engineer from, say, a hundred years ago. would you feel comfortable with that?"
"if he were skilled, intelligent, creative."
"honestly, doctor? a hundred years ago?"
"well, i suppose it would give me pause."
ha.
"now, put yourself in the doctor's shoes. imagine you were asked to treat someone you cared about, say an emh mark twelve."
there is no mark twelve.
"but if there were, and you wanted to save his programme. he probably wouldn't let you near him. he wouldn't care that you'd won the daystrom prize for holography. from his perspective, you'd be out of date. but what if you knew you could save him?"
"thank you, counsellor, for extending that olive branch. i'm willing to see past our differences, if he is."
all right. he can start by purging the plasma conduits on deck six.
doctor zimmerman.
i will not put my life in the hands of a primitive.
you'd need a phaser drill to get through that thick skull of his.
get out!
gentlemen!
"oh, spare us your psychobabble."
"i came here thinking that you were opposite sides of the same coin. identical, but different. now i see you're both exactly the same. you're both jerks."
jerks.
"i'm starting to think you called the wrong counsellor, reg."
you'll figure something out. you always do.
things are worse now than when i arrived. lewis won't come out of his lab and the emh is hiding in a holodeck.
he's feeling homesick. i let him use my voyager simulation and it seems to be cheering him up.
"a hologram fighting to save the life of his creator, who just so happens to be the same man his own personality is based on. i think i'd need a whole team of therapists just to get them in the same room."
mister barclay said this is your favourite ice cream.
"i hardly deserve it, but thanks. you're a hologram."
how do you know?
i'm an empath. i haven't sensed any emotions from you. when were you first brought online?
nine years ago.
"no offence but, you're more antiquated than the emh mark one, and yet lewis seems to listen to you. why do you suppose that is? were you here when the mark one was created?"
yes.
any idea why lewis made it in his own image?
maybe you should ask him.
i did. he evaded the question. i was hoping you might know.
"he was extremely proud of the mark one. he used to dream about hundreds of holograms in every corner of the quadrant saving lives. he put so much of himself into its development. i suppose it only seemed natural that it should look like him, too."
but the mark one failed to meet starfleet's expectations.
he was devastated.
"he, he locked himself away in this lab for two years trying to repair the defects. finally, he just gave up. started from scratch. a whole new matrix."
the mark two.
"followed by the mark three, and then the mark four. he, he was obsessed with perfecting it."
but none of the later models resembled lewis.
he made that mistake once. he wasn't about to do it again.
"and now, after all this time, a mark one shows up. it must be like staring in a mirror at a reflection you don't want to remember."
"computer, resume recording. last will and testament, doctor lewis zimmerman. let's see. where were we? subsection eight, the trojan horse project. i hereby bequeath my latest research in holographic infiltration technology to the only engineer i trust to complete the work, lieutenant reginald barclay. subsection nine, holographic art. i hereby bequeath my entire collection, including the twenty first century masterpiece, woman in four dimensions, to the person who has appreciated it the most. i guess that would be reg barclay, too. subsection ten, haley. i realise she's only a hologram, but she's been a loyal assistant for many years. i'd like to request that starfleet keep her programme running for as long as this research facility exists. she's been as real to me as anyone i've ever known. not that i've known many people. i've created most of my friends."
"pause recording.  don't worry. i'll find a home for you, too."
so this is voyager. i like it.
"it's a remarkable facsimile, but mister barclay did get a few of the details wrong. for one thing, neelix doesn't purr."
i think that may have something to do with reg's cat. he named it after your friend.
"neelix would be honoured. if you're here for doctor zimmerman's medical files, i've nearly finished updating them. maybe the next physician will put them to better use."
"actually, i stopped by to ask you to dinner."
"i'm a hologram, counsellor. i don't eat."
"i know that, but we'd still enjoy your company."
we?
"lieutenant barclay, haley, myself, doctor zimmerman."
"no, thanks. unless that man's eating crow, i'm not interested."
it's the perfect opportunity for us to talk things out in a more casual environment.
sorry.
just one meal.
i said no.
doctor?
something's wrong.
troi to lieutenant barclay.
go ahead.
there's something wrong with the emh.
can you be more specific?
"she's a counsellor, lieutenant, not an engineer."
stand by.
what's happening to me?
your programme is destabilising.
what? why?
they sent you thirty thousand light years. i should have expected some problems.
"it's not your fault, mister barclay. we just need to find a way to repair the damage."
you don't understand. your primary matrix is degrading and there is nothing i can do.
good riddance to bad photons.
"he's dying, lewis."
he's not dying. his files are just degrading.
there are people on voyager who count on him.
i'll send them a mark four. they're more reliable.
they don't want a mark four. they want their friend.
no emh was ever designed to be anyone's friend. he's just a hologram.
is that how you feel about me? just a hologram?
i will not be ambushed in my own lab.
stardate 53292. my programme malfunctioned and you cancelled a lecture on vulcan and came all the way home to repair me.
there's nothing worse than addressing a room full of pointy-eared blowhards. i was looking for an excuse to get away.
"you came back because you cared about me, just like you care about the mark one. you just won't admit it. he may not be perfect, but he's still one of your creations and right now he needs his creator. don't turn your back on him."
"computer, activate voyager's emh."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
you're the emergency.
where's lieutenant barclay?
"trust me, you're in far more capable hands."
you're going to repair my programme?
who better?
just yesterday you threatened to decompile me.
that was before your colleagues made me feel guilty.
you're ill. you're in no condition to perform delicate procedures.
"i'll survive, but you won't if you don't relax and let me finish."
what are you doing?
my scans identified a recursive error in your pattern buffer. i'm trying to isolate it.
is that a fractal algorithm?
very good. i'm using it to realign your matrix.
fractal algorithms are notoriously unstable.
in the hands of a novice.  whoops.
whoops? what's whoops?
"computer, deactivate emh."
"i, i can't move!"
i know. i had to take your mobility subroutines offline.
how long have i been deactivated?
seventeen hours. i'm resetting your parameters.
you don't look well. you need rest.
i'm fine. and so are you. your programme's been stabilised.
"i, i'm going to be okay?"
"no, you're going to be better than okay."
now what are you doing?
welcome to sickbay. how may i help you today?
"well, what do you think?"
i think you've altered my greeting protocol.
"that's just the beginning. i've also added new subroutines for compassion, patience, empathy, decorum."
i don't feel any different.
"because i haven't installed them yet. i thought you'd like to be awake for the big moment. reginald was right about you. you have exceeded the sum of your programming. you've accomplished far more than i would have ever predicted. but let's face facts. you never overcame the inherent flaws in your personality subroutines. you're arrogant, irritable. a jerk, as counsellor troi would say."
i believe she was describing you as well.
"don't change the subject. i may not be able to turn you into a mark four, but i can make you a bit more presentable."
what if i'm happy with the way i am?
i'm doing you a favour.
i don't want any favours and i don't want your new subroutines. why can't you accept me as i am?
"because you're defective. emergency medical hotheads. extremely marginal housecalls. that's what everyone used to call the mark ones until they were bounced out of the medical corps. i tried to have them decommissioned, but starfleet in its infinite wisdom overruled me and reassigned them all to work waste transfer barges. that's where you'd be too, if you hadn't been lost in the delta quadrant. do you know how humiliating it is to have six hundred and seventy five mark ones out there, scrubbing plasma conduits, all with my face?"
i'm sure they're doing a fine job.
what are you doing? i'm not finished with you.
"i'm trying to do my job. and if you give me a chance you'll see that i'm pretty good at it. frankly, i'd hoped that if we ever met, you'd be proud of me."
"well, i guess it is comforting to know that at least one of you is still doing what i designed you to do."
"your intercellular proteins are at a dangerous level. we should begin the procedure. please, give me a chance to make you proud of me."
"maybe we could try it, see how it goes."
see how it goes.
just don't expect me to put you in my will.
"i, i'm going in."
reg.
they have been in there for thirty two hours.
be patient.
"well, you, you're not fritzing anymore."
"no thanks to you. doctor zimmerman ran a diagnostic on my subtronic relays and he made a very interesting discovery. apparently, i was the victim of foul play."
"well, what, what do you mean?"
"he found an algorithm designed to disrupt my matrix. you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
"well, traditional therapy wasn't getting us anywhere."
"well, your little scheme worked. doctor zimmerman has agreed to the cellular regeneration procedure. he'll require several more treatments, but i'm optimistic he'll make a full recovery."
trying to steal my secrets?
another one of my hobbies. i thought i'd take home a few memories. you're supposed to be in bed.
i've got work to do.
it can wait. go to bed. doctor's orders.
i hope you won't be coming back next month to make sure i'm taking my medicine.
don't worry. my captain's not likely to authorise another house call.
"good. the next time she sends a datastream, you might want to drop me a line, let me know how you're doing."
if you insist.
ready?
would you mind?
not at all. smile!
"computer, deactivate mess hall lights."
oh! you scared me.
that wasn't my intention.
"no, of course not. i guess i'm just a little jumpy, especially after what happened the last time."
that's why i'm here.
oh?
we'll be shutting down main power soon. the children's regeneration cycle will be interrupted. they'll require supervision.
"well, i'm happy to help. to tell you the truth, i'd be grateful for the distraction."
the procedure could take several hours.
how much do they know about what's happening?
nothing. the children have overactive imaginations. i don't want to alarm them unnecessarily.
what if they start asking questions? i can't just lie to them.
you have considerable childcare experience. i'm sure you'll manage.
that's close enough. let our momentum carry us in.
cutting engines.
there's a creepy image. reminds me of something out of edgar allan poe.
"looks like a vampire bat. you can make out the wings, even the ears. what do you see, tuvok?"
two starfleet officers with juvenile imaginations.
"come on, tuvok. haven't you ever looked up at the clouds and seen an animal?"
i will never understand the human need to find imagery in something as innocuous as a cloud.
"harry, are we ready?"
"yes, ma'am."
then let's do it. all hands. initiate shutdown sequence.
"computer, deactivate emh."
everything's all right. we've just had to shut down main power temporarily. nothing to be concerned about.
"three, two, one, mark."
"all decks report shutdown complete, captain."
janeway to seven of nine. we're ready.
acknowledged.
why did they shut down main power?
"it's simply a precaution. we've entered a class j nebula and the captain wants to make sure that we don't attract any, er, residual em. radiation."
our shields provide sufficient protection against nebula discharge.
"is that so? i'm afraid that gaseous anomalies were never really my specialty. come on, gather round. i've brought toys and stories and games and i thought that later we might even have a little sing-along."
i should go to astrometrics. seven may need my help.
"i'm afraid that astrometrics is shut down, too."
"if we're not analysing the nebula, why did we enter it?"
"oh, that is a long and dull story, and not nearly as interesting as flotter meets the invincible invertebrates."
is voyager in danger?
"mezoti, there's really no need to leap to those kinds of conclusions."
"maybe if you explained what's happening in more detail, we wouldn't have to guess."
"this has something to do with deck twelve, doesn't it?"
"well, what makes you say that?"
deck twelve section forty two is off limits to everyone but senior officers with a level six security clearance.
"that's because it's haunted, isn't it?"
who told you that?
naomi.
she was just trying to frighten you.
i'll have to have a talk with that girl.
is it true?
does a ghost live there?
you're really too old to believe in such silly things.
"if it's not a ghost, what is it?"
we deserve an explanation.
i don't think that seven would be too happy if you all started waking up with nightmares.
tell us.
please?
"all right. gather round. but i'm warning you, this is not a tale for the faint of heart."
we're not faint of heart.
our cardiopulmonary systems are reinforced.
so don't leave anything out.
"all right. but remember, i warned you. it all began several months ago, before you joined voyager. we were exploring a dark nebula, just gathering deuterium. we had no idea what was in store for us."
"but when the turbulence started getting rough, we should have seen that as an omen."
"how goes the particle collecting, commander?"
we've got enough deuterium to power the warp engines for another thousand light years.
excellent.
is something wrong?
"now that you mention it, there is something that i feel compelled to share with you in my capacity as morale officer. the crew seem a little on edge."
oh? they don't appear particularly anxious to me.
they're very good at hiding their fears. starfleet training. i was wondering how soon we might be leaving this nebula. knowing could help me assure them.
"it's difficult to say. the bussard collectors are running at maximum, but it's a slow process. we could be here for several more days."
days?
"mister neelix, are you certain it's not you who is on edge?"
"you know me too well, mister vulcan."
"i can assure you, a j class nebula is no cause for alarm."
"i know it's illogical, but staring into this murky cloud for hours on end can be a little unsettling. when i was a child, an immense plasma drift passed through the talaxian system. the stars and the moons were blotted out for months. from horizon to horizon all you could see was this enormous, menacing cloud. ever since then i've found it a little disturbing to be in nebulas."
perhaps the captain might give you permission to install curtains.
that's an excellent idea. and i have just the right material.
report.
the nebula's beginning to destabilise.
cause.
i'm not sure. it could have something to do with the nadion emissions being produced by the bussard collectors.
you're not remembering correctly.
i beg your pardon?
the bussard collectors don't produce nadion emissions.
"well, the technical details don't matter. what's important is that voyager's presence was destabilising the nebula"
and the crew wasn't interested in taking any chances.
we've got eighty percent of the deuterium we wanted. maybe we shouldn't push our luck.
agreed. bridge to engineering.
go ahead.
we're suspending the dilithium intake.
acknowledged.
"tom, take us out."
aye.
"but at that exact moment, in the fraction of a second before tom could engage the engines, zap! we were hit."
what was it?
the ghost?
shush. let him finish.
"whatever it was, it shook the ship hard."
"an em discharge penetrated the hull. deck seven, section ten."
increasing power to structural integrity.
we're clear.
damage?
power outages on three decks. auxiliary subprocessors are offline. no injuries reported.
assign repair teams. resume course.
"we'd taken some minor damage, but for the most part everything was fine. or so we thought."
what none of us knew was that a mysterious stowaway had come aboard voyager.
what kind of stowaway?
it was obviously a space-dwelling lifeform.
"yes, but we didn't know that, not at that point."
was it non-corporeal?
in a manner of speaking
hostile?
"well, i'm getting to that."
species 5973?
who are they?
the borg encountered them in galactic cluster eight. they're multi-spectrum particle lifeforms.
"no, that's not what this was."
maybe it was an inter-phasic species.
we can either debate comparative xenobiology or i can continue with the story. now it's up to you.
continue the story.
"somehow i thought you'd say that. now, where was i? oh, ah, yes. life aboard voyager would have been more or less back to normal if it weren't for a few strange malfunctions."
come in.
"i've got reports from repair teams. it looks like that em discharge did more damage than we thought. transporter room one is out of commission, half the sonic showers are offline, and we temporarily lost artificial gravity on deck five."
any injuries?
ensign mulchaey bumped his head on the ceiling.
"ouch. this is terrible. computer, another cup of coffee, black."
"you can add replicators to your list. we're getting started on the wrong foot today, my friend."
captain?
i'm sorry. i was talking to voyager.
it's nothing to be embarrassed about. i used to have long conversations with my maquis ship.
really? what did you two talk about?
"oh, i can't tell you that. captain-starship confidentiality."
of course.
if the doctor heard us he'd probably recommend counselling.
i won't tell if you won't.
deal.
"commander, do you see that?"
it's a meteorite cluster. i doubt it's anything to worry about.
"i'd tend to agree, if it weren't the same one we passed an hour ago."
ensign.
"yes, ma'am."
"are you conducting a survey of meteoroids, tom?"
ma'am?
check your sensors. we're travelling in circles.
not according to my readings.
"tuvok, run level four diagnostic on the navigational array."
there is a malfunction in the subprocessors. it appears we're heading back the way we came.
all stop. reinitialise your sensors.
"i'm telling you, we rely too much on twenty fourth century technology, captain. you give me a window and a sextant and i guarantee i'll get you where you want to go."
we've jumped to warp six.
tom?
don't look at me.
shut down the warp engines.
i can't.
manual override.
no response.
bridge to engineering.
i'm reading all stop.
"lieutenant torres, respond."
"computer, locate b'elanna torres."
"lieutenant torres is in engineering. ensign trumari is on deck four, section thirty. commander tuvok is on the bridge."
"find out what's going on. harry, pull the speech processors if you have to, but shut that thing off."
"ensign vorik is in engineering, level two."
"meanwhile, commander chakotay was headed for engineering, or so he thought."
engineering.
i bet you wouldn't try to pull this on the captain. have it your way. i'll walk.
the turbolift started to fall
faster and faster! anybody hungry?
neelix!
you haven't touched your snacks
snacks are irrelevant. continue the story.
what happened to commander chakotay?
the turbolift plunged eleven decks at high speed. the g forces pinned commander chakotay to the ceiling. he knew that at any minute he was going to come crashing down to the bottom of the turbolift and there was nothing that he could do about it. but then the descent stabilisers reactivated.
"the way b'elanna tells it, commander chakotay was not very happy when he showed up in engineering that morning."
if i didn't know better i'd say this ship is trying to kill me. do you have any idea what's going on?
"well, i've traced the problem to a series of gel packs on deck thirteen. it looks like they were burned out by an em discharge from the nebula."
and those gel-packs interface with all the affected systems.
i'm on my way to repair it right now. feel like giving me a hand?
only if we stay out of the turbolifts. i'll tell you about it on the way.
"while chakotay and b'elanna headed for deck thirteen, new problems were cropping up all over the ship."
"crewman celes, step away from the control panel."
did i do something wrong?
you caused a power failure in astrometrics.
i did? how?
that's what i'm attempting to find out.
i don't see how i could have done anything.
i've located the problem. it appears you inadvertently overloaded a series of eps conduits while performing your diagnostic.
but i haven't even started the diagnostic.
then what were you doing?
nothing. i just got here.
i know that wasn't my fault.
these gel packs aren't burned out.
there's no trace of any em discharge.
could it have dissipated this quickly?
"no, it moved."
moved?
"the discharge seems to be travelling through the bio-neural circuitry, jumping from system to system."
can you isolate it?
it's in a series of gel packs that interface with the environmental controls outside cargo bay two.
let's try to get there before it jumps again.
"by then seven of nine was in cargo bay two to run diagnostics but, because the comm. system was down they couldn't warn her, and she had no idea that something was in the room with her."
here?
in this cargo bay?
then what happened?
the creature was clinging to the circuits and bulkheads using them to move about the room. it was getting closer and closer.
"seven of nine to the bridge. bridge, acknowledge."
"but of course, there was no answer."
why didn't she remodulate her neural transceiver and send a message that way?
that's an interesting question. you'll have to ask her.
stop interrupting.
seven tried to get out but she was trapped.
what happened to seven?
the entity must have infiltrated her cybernetic systems and turned her against the rest of the crew.
it most certainly did not. you're letting your imagination run away with you.
what happened?
why did the light go out?
it's all right. i just have to replace the power cell. it'll only take a moment. nothing to be frightened about.
"i'm not frightened, but azan is."
i am not.
"there. sorry, i didn't mean to scare you. now, where was i? oh, yes. seven was trapped by the forcefields, but fortunately for her"
help was on the way.
"computer, deactivate this forcefield. we'll have to cut power to the field generators."
the computer's not accepting my command codes.
stand back.
the forcefield's down.
let's get her to sickbay.
"now, most of us were just going about our business oblivious to what was happening, but that was about to change."
kim to engineering.
neelix to the bridge.
i want everyone to report to their stations until we figure out what's going on.
"aye, sir."
"er, ensign, maybe i should come with you. the captain might need me."
this is your post. you may be needed here.
"oh, of course. if you need anything, anything at all, you know where to find me."
"so there i was. the only thing i could do was wait, alone."
in the dark.
"voyager was dead in space. system after system was failing, including the environmental controls. ensign paris told me it was hotter than the tarkanian desert on the bridge."
don't you ever sweat?
"not unless the temperature reaches three hundred fifty degrees kelvin, with a humidity factor at approximately"
forget i asked.
very well.
"i'll make you a deal, voyager. the next m class planetoid we find, we'll set down and i'll give you a nice maintenance overhaul. what do you say? tom, check the conn."
"i don't know what you did, captain, but i've got helm control back."
"thanks, my friend."
i'm going to try to get thrusters and impulse engines back online.
"tom, i'm reading an em surge in your console. get away from there."
bridge to sickbay. medical emergency. can we transport him?
transporters are offline.
why am i not surprised. now what?
"warning, oxygen depletion in progress."
breathable air is being sucked out of the bridge.
reroute emergency power to environmental controls.
no effect.
everyone out of here now.
"in sickbay, the doctor had his hands full, too."
you're fortunate. another few moments and you'd have been asphyxiated. where do you think you're going?
lieutenant torres needs help with the repairs.
doctor.
what happened?
an em. surge. seven had a similar experience.
the environmental system converted cargo bay two into a micronebula.
"when gibson and mcminn tried to vent the gas from deck seven, they were struck by a discharge, too."
are we thinking the same thing?
it could be an intelligence at work here.
some kind of electromagnetic lifeform that's using the environmental controls to make the ship more hospitable for itself.
and attacking anyone who tries to stop it.
my matrix is destabilising.
transfer his programme to the mobile emitter. quickly.
warning. power failure.
let's get the injured out of here.
"deck by deck, section by section"
the crew was losing control of voyager. people were scattered throughout the ship with no idea what was happening.
what did you do that for?
"ensign, i'm so sorry! i, i thought, i thought you were a hirogen, or a borg."
and what gave you that idea?
it's dark. your shadow.
"trust me, there are no aliens roaming the corridors."
you mean we haven't been boarded?
it's just a power failure.
isn't that what they sometimes do? cut the power?
what who sometimes does?
hostile aliens. they might be trying to infiltrate the ship.
how long has it been since you've run into anyone else?
"i don't know, four or five hours. i, i tried sickbay, but it was deserted. decks three and four are empty. i, i was on my way to the bridge. you're the first person i've seen."
"well, there's no one on the bridge either."
you see? then maybe i was right. maybe the reason we can't find anyone is because they've all been assimilated.
"slow down. there was an environmental failure on the bridge. that's why it's been evacuated. i don't know what happened in sickbay, or on decks three and four, but i'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation. ah ha. no one's been assimilated."
then where are they?
"they've probably set up a temporary command post, most likely in engineering. that's where i'm going."
can i come with you?
of course.
ensign?
what?
do you think we could stop by a weapons locker on the way?
"i still had no idea what was going on. i'd been waiting in the mess hall for more than four hours in the dark, cut off from the rest of the crew."
is somebody there? hello? hello? hello?
"is somebody out there? tom, if that's you, this isn't funny."
argh! stay away!
"calm yourself, mister neelix."
you really shouldn't sneak up on people like that. i could have shot you.
your restraint is commendable.
is there a problem with the air supply?
an alien lifeform has seized control of voyager's primary systems. it's flooded numerous sections with poisonous gas.
are you saying that this alien lifeform is trying to kill us?
"its intentions aren't clear. however, we should evacuate."
where to?
the captain has established a secure command post in engineering.
were you scared?
"well, considering that engineering was eight decks down and the only way to get there was to crawl through pitch-black jefferies tubes, it's fair to say that i was never more frightened in my life."
you shouldn't have allowed yourself to be afraid.
is that so.
fear distracts people from accomplishing their goals.
"well, that's true, i suppose. on the other hand, fear can sometimes be very healthy."
explain.
"well, it keeps you alert, keeps you from putting yourself in unnecessary danger."
i was afraid once.
you've been afraid many times.
icheb. do you want to tell us about it?
"it was when we were first disconnected from the hive mind, before seven rescued us. i couldn't hear anyone else's thoughts anymore. i felt alone."
"i can understand why that was frightening. when you're scared, it helps to have someone to talk to, doesn't it?"
yes.
"of course, in my case, the only one person i had to talk to was commander tuvok."
"i tried passing the time with a little conversation but, as you've probably noticed, he's not exactly what you'd call chatty."
"i'll bet starfleet has specific procedures to deal with these kinds of situations. you know, something like protocol one zero zero five. in the event your starship is invaded by a hostile electromagnetic lifeform. what do you suppose that, er, that protocol might be, exactly?"
"rest assured, this crew is doing everything possible to regain control of the ship."
you're right. i'm just being silly.
i concur.
"of course, the crew of the salvoxia probably thought they were going to regain control of their ship, too. did i ever tell you about the salvoxia?"
"if i say yes, will it prevent you from telling the story?"
"it was a talaxian freighter. horrible tragedy. happened nearly a century ago. after suffering a cascade failure, it began to lose life support generators, one by one. pretty soon, there wasn't enough air left to sustain the entire crew so they began to draw lots. can you imagine? draw the short straw and you suffocate? anyway, the air continued to diminish, and they kept drawing lots. the crew got smaller and smaller as they waited for someone to rescue them, but no one ever came. the salvoxia drifted through space for the next eighty years, until somebody finally found her. makes me short of breath just thinking about it."
perhaps you should occupy your mind with pleasant thoughts before you hyperventilate.
right. pleasant thoughts. pleasant thoughts.
what did the bodies like?
i beg your pardon?
after eighty years. were they decomposed?
they may have been preserved by the vacuum of space.
i shouldn't have told you that story. it's too gruesome.
i wonder what the crew of the salvoxia did for food after their emergency rations were gone?
maybe they ate each other.
"all right, that's enough. now, where was i? we'd made it more than halfway to engineering"
when we ran into an obstacle.
commander!
what do we do now?
"if i can access environmental controls, i may be able to vent the gas."
is there another way around?
it would take several hours to reach engineering by an alternate route. there is no guarantee we'd find a clear path.
pleasant thoughts. pleasant thoughts.
while we were in the jefferies tubes
a good number of the crew had gathered in engineering.
ninety seven crewmen have been accounted for. they're in secure locations throughout the ship.
neelix?
no one's seen him.
i shouldn't have ordered him to stay in the mess hall.
you were following procedure.
captain. bad news. the lifeform's infiltrated the main computer matrix.
"as long as it remained in the gel pack, there was a chance to contain it."
but we can't purge it from the main computer without crashing the few systems we have left.
"things were looking grim, but the captain was about to make a breakthrough that would change everything."
captain janeway. captain janeway. captain janeway is in main engineering.
"sorry, captain, i know it's irritating. i'll try to shut it down."
hold on a minute. this is captain janeway. respond.
authorisation code required.
janeway pi alpha.
captain?
"it's only a hunch, but i think this lifeform may be trying to communicate."
sounds like a comm. system malfunction to me.
"i'm not so sure. the lifeform's been moving from system to system. if it's intelligent, it may be learning how to use those systems in some rudimentary way. are you attempting to communicate?"
unable to comply.
"even if it understands what you're saying, it may not know how to respond."
"b'elanna, can you call up the comm. system's syntax subroutines?"
i'll try.
we're attempting to make it easier for you to speak to us. try to access the database at engineering station three one.
database accessed.
why have you come aboard our ship?
"captain janeway, report to astrometrics."
why do you want me to go there?
"captain janeway, report to astrometrics."
i guess i'll find out soon enough.
"captain, astrometrics is flooded with nebular gas."
astrometrics life-support has been restored.
"it could be some kind of trap. this lifeform, whatever it is, has already injured at least eleven crewmen."
"i can try to establish a dialogue or i can let it take over my ship. seven, you're with me."
"yes, captain."
"while captain janeway and seven of nine headed to astrometrics, tuvok was trying to ease my fears by guiding me through a meditation."
"concentrate on the rhythm of your breathing. envision your lungs filled with light. follow it back in time to a moment when you felt no fear. a moment of happiness, serenity."
my birthday dinner.
describe it.
"i was surrounded by all my friends. they'd gotten together to cook me dinner. they prepared all my favourites. steamed chadre kab, terra nut soufflé. i felt loved, appreciated, safe."
captain janeway served you nebular gas?
"no, of course not. it was just my imagination playing tricks on me during the meditation. my head was too full of scary images for me to relax. the captain, on the other hand, seemed to be getting things under control."
review of navigational logs in progress.
are you searching for something?
affirmative.
the nebula.
manual helm control enabled.
you're returning control of the ship?
affirmative.
you want me to take you back to the nebula?
affirmative.
"well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?"
returning to the nebula is too dangerous. we'd risk invasion by other lifeforms.
"i'm beginning to think this was all an accident, not an invasion."
captain?
"think about it. the em surge didn't hit us until our bussard collectors destabilised the nebula, and then what happened?"
the ship began experiencing random malfunctions.
"i'm not so sure they were random. navigational sensors were fooling us into heading back toward the nebula and then, when tom tried to resume course, he was attacked. this lifeform isn't trying to hurt us, it's trying to get home. can you give us access to the bridge?"
life support on the bridge has been restored. level ten authorisation required.
level ten?
captain's eyes only. it wants me to go alone.
"the captain and the lifeform had begun to establish a rapport, but the relationship was fragile."
is the viewscreen functioning normally?
affirmative.
"i'm sorry to tell you this, but your nebula is gone."
clarify.
the gases must have continued to dissipate after we left.
"warning, life support failure on all decks. abandon ship. abandon."
ship. abandon ship.
the creature was that angry?
its home had been destroyed.
"the lifeform wanted voyager for itself, and it was going to kill anyone who remained on board. captain janeway's only chance of saving her crew was to try to reason with the creature."
listen to me. i can still help you.
abandon ship.
there are other class j nebulas. i'll find you one.
unable to comply.
i'd be able to comply if you gave me access to astrometrics.
"warning, oxygen depletion in progress."
give me back helm control.
"warning, helm circuits are overloading."
abandon ship.
at least give me access to the comm. so i can warn my crew.
unable to comply.
"as the captain was facing one of her worst fears, losing her ship"
i was with tuvok and about to face one of mine.
tuvok! lie still. i'll try to
mister neelix. proceed without me.
i'm not leaving you here.
i am injured. logic dictates that you take the mask and proceed to engineering.
i don't care what logic dictates. this isn't the salvoxia. we're not drawing lots.
i am giving you an order.
and i'm disobeying it. you're coming with me if i have to drag you by your pointy little ears.
i had no choice. i had to control my fear.
"pleasant thoughts, pleasant thoughts."
"while we made our way to engineering,"
captain janeway tried to make the creature reconsider what it was doing.
you're going to kill everyone on this ship. do you understand what that means?
to deprive of life. extinguish.
"yes, and if you extinguish us, you'll be extinguishing yourself. you need this crew."
clarify.
"the technology you're using needs to be maintained. who do you think is going to do that when we are gone? voyager's secondary systems have already begun to fail. in a few weeks, primary systems will start to go offline."
unable to confirm.
access the internal sensors. run a ship-wide diagnostic. see for yourself.
abandon ship.
the captain's rapport with the creature seemed to be breaking down
and she couldn't afford to wait any longer.
i need everyone's attention. we're abandoning ship. get to the escape pods.
we may not be able to eject the pods.
we'll push them out if we have to.
he needs medical attention.
he'll have to wait. we're abandoning ship.
"the entire crew had to evacuate. the delta flyer and the shuttles were launched, followed by all but one of the escape pods."
that's everyone but the captain and first officer.
after you.
"i did what you asked, we're abandoning ship. what more do you want?"
"diagnostic completed. secondary systems are offline. primary systems at thirty two percent. estimated time to failure, six days thirteen hours."
that sounds about right.
"captain janeway, report to engineering."
like hell i will.
i won't be your prisoner. you'll have to kill me.
acknowledged.
"captain janeway, report to engineering."
not until you restore life-support and give me back control of my ship.
unable to comply.
then we'll die here together. i'm guessing i've got about two more minutes and then you're on your own.
"captain janeway, report to engineering."
i told you. the only way i'm helping is if you return control of my ship.
"it looked like the creature was calling the captain's bluff. she was down to her last breath, but at the last moment"
access to all systems has been restored.
"it took almost two days for the crew to return to the ship. eventually, an artificial environment was created in an isolated section of deck twelve. the creature's been living there ever since."
i told you there was a monster on deck twelve.
"haven't you been listening? it's not a monster, it's an alien lifeform."
what was that?
maybe it's the alien lifeform coming to get us.
haven't you learned anything about letting your imagination get the best of you?
there. that little jolt was probably nothing more than our friend leaving the ship to go to a new home that the captain found for him. time to regenerate.
what if the lifeform didn't leave?.
what if it wants revenge?
what if i told you i made up the whole thing?
naomi told me you always exaggerate.
"i knew the story wasn't true, the moment you said the bussard collectors produced nadion emissions."
"i should have known better than to try fooling the four of you. all right, in you go. pleasant dreams."
how are the children?
"tucked into their alcoves, safe and sound."
i hope they weren't frightened.
"oh, why would they be frightened, captain?"
they were in the dark for three hours.
"oh no, not to worry. i told them a story to pass the time."
let me guess. mother goose.
"certainly not. some of those fairy tales can be frightening. ogres and child eating monsters. speaking of which, is everything okay?"
"we're just taking some final readings before we resume course. show him, harry."
"well, i hope it lives happily ever after."
"four of twelve, subjunction of unimatrix five two five. you have a disease. you're one of many with this sickness. we want to cure you but we need a better way to identify those with the mutation. our testing method is too slow. it could take centuries to identify everyone. help me find the interlink frequency that binds all of you together. then we can put an end to this, quickly, efficiently. comply."
i've disconnected you from the hive mind. you're alone. i know how uncomfortable that can be. tell me what i want to know. tthen you can rejoin us.
i don't know.
you must remember something.
i don't remember.
the frequency.
i don't remember.
deactivate him. wait. dismantle him. bring me his cortical array.
we'll save that for next time.
annika.
another milestone. you've had your first dream.
i felt awake.
dreams can often seem quite real. tell me more about this forest.
it was familiar.
perhaps your unconscious mind was drawing on a childhood memory.
i spoke to someone. he called me by my human name.
did you recognise him?
he seemed familiar.
"this could give us a fascinating glimpse into your unconscious mind. any one of those images might have a symbolic meaning. the mysterious stranger, for example. is he a father figure or does he represent a repressed desire for male companionship?"
i don't wish to dream again. please repair my cortical array.
"this isn't a malfunction, seven, it's a natural step in your human development. it might seem unsettling now, but you'll get used to it. before you know it, you'll look forward to climbing into your alcove each night. this'll keep a record of your rem cycles."
"you're late, mister paris."
ma'am?
"according to the ship's chronometer, by twenty two seconds."
i'll make it up at the end of my shift.
see that you do.
take your station.
"open it, that's an order. not only late but improperly dressed. that belongs on your collar, mister paris."
"allow me. as ship's captain, i hereby reinstate you to the rank of lieutenant, with all the privileges and responsibilities therein. your performance on this ship over the past year has been exemplary. i expect more of the same."
you won't be disappointed.
"congratulations, lieutenant."
i didn't notice a little box on my chair.
hiding a cake in the console?
looks like a distress call.
put it through.
i'm getting a carrier wave but no message.
origin?
an asteroid approximately two light years from here.
yellow alert. set a course.
we're in range.
drop to impulse. on screen. magnify.
i'm reading artificial structures. it's a colony of some kind.
open a channel. this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. we received your distress call.
lifesigns?
none.
i'm detecting residual weapons signatures. they're borg.
any vessels?
one. a cube at the edge of this system.
"resume our previous course, mister paris, warp six. make a note in the ship's record. we responded to a distress call at oh nine hundred hours. arrived at the colony two hours later. no survivors. we don't know who these people were, but we know the borg destroyed them."
come with me.
i'm regenerating. this is only a dream.
you're not dreaming. i brought you here. this is unimatrix zero.
there is no unimatrix zero. who are you?
"five of twelve, secondary adjunct of trimatrix nine four two. but when i'm here my name is axum."
axum.
sound familiar?
yes.
good. it's starting to come back to you.
is anyone here?
hello.
i think i'm lost.
i'm axum. this is annika.
my father's ship started shaking. men came aboard. they looked like machines. will you help me find my father?
i'll see what i can do. there are other children here. would you like to meet them?
"i just got here, too. this environment is intimidating, but i believe it's safe."
he was just assimilated.
he's probably still in a maturation chamber.
are you telling me this isn't a real place?it's some kind of virtual construct?.
we come here during our regeneration cycles. we can exist as individuals here.
unimatrix zero.
"you used to come here, before you escaped the collective. you have the recessive mutation, too. don't you remember any of it?"
no. what mutation?
only one out of a million drones has it.
why did you bring me here now?
"the collective has found a way to detect us. it's a lengthy procedure, but they've managed to identify and deactivate nearly two hundred of us over the last few months. it's only a matter of time before they find enough of us to isolate the interlink frequency. once they've done that. you can help us stop them."
clarify.
"we've designed a nanovirus that should mask the biochemical signature of the mutation, but we need someone to release it into the collective."
you're already on a borg vessel. why don't you do it?
after we've completed our regeneration cycle we have no memory of this place. you are not a part of the collective anymore. you're our only connection to the real world.
scan the node for residual harmonics. it's a shame you're not alive to experience disembodiment. it's the epitome of perfection. give it to me. we have isolated the carrier band but it's useless to us without the precise frequency. we need additional data. two more of the mutations have been discovered in spatial grid six four nine. have their cortical nodes removed and analysed. bring me the results.
"unimatrix zero is our sanctuary. when we're here, our thoughts are our own."
what was my function?.
you're thinking like a borg. our only function here is to try and regain a fragment of the lives we lost when we were assimilated.
mister axum?
go introduce yourself. they won't mind.
"hello, do you want to play?"
sure.
"siral, over here. i was hoping you'd come. it's great to see you."
it's always good to be back.
i remember him.
you were friends. you knew a lot of people here. you were a part of our lives for eighteen years.
"i'm willing to help, but i can't do it alone. i'm part of a starship crew now. i'll have to inform my captain."
i told you not to bring her here.
we can't do this by ourselves.
it's too great a risk.
we don't have a choice.
you do not speak for all of us.
what would you rather do? have us wait until we're all discovered? you disappoint me. where's your warrior spirit?
petaq! i'll rip your heart out.
"go ahead, kill me. i'll be back when i begin my next regeneration cycle. you can't stop me, korok."
"if you come here again, you'll be putting your starship at risk and all of us as well."
shouldn't you be off sharpening your teeth?
i know you. your name is laura. you're human.
i was assimilated at wolf three five nine. it's good to see you again. but you look out of place. your cybernetic implants.
our doctor was unable to remove all of my borg components.
you don't have to look that way here.
my appearance is irrelevant.
"no, it's not. they may have turned us into drones, but they can't change the essence of who we are. my cycle's about to end. talk to your captain. we can't do this without"
another round with the borg?
we'd only need to infiltrate a single vessel.
"oh, just one?"
i am prepared to take a shuttle and do this alone.
"no offence, but how do you know that this wasn't some kind of a dream?"
seven was wearing a cortical monitor. she never reached rem sleep. she wasn't dreaming.
"unimatrix zero is real, and so are the people who go there. they need our help."
what else can you tell us about this place? how many drones?
no one is certain. axum told me there could be tens of
axum?
"he's someone i used to know. he told me there could be tens of thousands, perhaps more."
how was it created?
"some of them believe it began as a random malfunction during the assimilation of a single drone, and eventually spread to the others."
"well, this is all very interesting, but are we sure it's worth putting our lives on the line?"
"it's my understanding that when we receive a distress call, we respond. starfleet protocols."
she's right. this is no different.
"i understand your reluctance, but seven's discovered a potential weakness in the collective. before we decide how to proceed i'd like to learn as much about it as we can."
too bad you don't have the luxury of an interlink node.
there is another possibility. a vulcan technique known as the bridging of minds.
go on.
"i would need to initiate a mind meld with both you and seven, acting as a telepathic conduit."
"you make it sound like a conference call. captain, it is my professional opinion that we wait until"
objection noted. i think you'll be turning in early tonight.
"stay at yellow alert. maintain long-range scans for borg vessels. any sign of trouble, you know where to find me."
this will be one away mission for the record books.
"mind melds. the last time i heard the words my mind to your mind, i had a headache for two weeks."
i'm willing to volunteer if you'd rather hold down the fort.
"i appreciate your trying to protect me, but a chance to see this place? it's worth a headache."
how many times have you actually performed this bridging of heads?
minds. never.
then how can you be certain it'll work?
"nothing is certain, doctor. however, i once observed a vulcan master perform the technique. i am reasonably confident i can duplicate his success."
watching and doing are two different things.
"as always, your logic is impeccable."
what a comfort.
"we're ready, captain."
let's do it.
"as the conduit, i'll be aware of both your perceptions. if something goes wrong, i'll break the meld."
understood.
your minds to my mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. your minds to my mind. your thoughts to my thoughts.
welcome to unimatrix zero.
seven?
annika. that's what i'm called here.
drones?
come on. let's find axum.
we're close. i can almost hear them. bring us closer.
there. amplify. disrupt the frequency. it's not working. they're using a triaxillating modulation. you're making this very difficult. if we can't terminate their link then we'll simply have to pay them a visit.
you can see why we want to protect this place.
"we're prepared to help you, but i'm concerned that we'd only be putting off the inevitable. even if we succeeded and you could remain hidden for a year, ten years, the borg would eventually find you again. have you ever considered a more permanent solution?"
more permanent?
"you've got a remarkable sanctuary here, but that's all it is. maybe it's time to stop hiding and find a way to fight back."
that's not possible.
"if you could find a way to carry your individualities into the real world, to wake up from your regeneration cycles with your memories intact, you could begin to undermine the borg's control over you."
it sounds like you're suggesting a civil war.
i prefer to call it a resistance movement.
"that's very ambitious, captain. but we can't retain our memories."
not yet. but we know a good deal about borg technology. maybe we could
"we've found another. spatial grid three two six, cube one one eight four. continue."
"welcome back. spatial grid nine eight two, cube four six one."
janeway.
how's your headache?
i'm guessing it didn't go well.
"let's just say we ran into a little trouble. have a seat, commander."
i'd prefer to stand.
the collective's found a way to infiltrate unimatrix zero. it won't be long before they learn enough to destroy it from the inside out. i plan to stop them.
what have you got in mind?
the people there are vulnerable. they don't have the ability to take action in the real world. we're going to give them that ability.
how?
"the doctor and b'elanna are working on it. i know what you're thinking. we'd be violating half a dozen starfleet protocols. and if the collective ever learned we were involved we'd be putting voyager in the middle of a civil war. valid objections. chakotay, we've had our disagreements and there have been times when i've chosen to proceed without your support. but this can't be one of those times. i won't do this without my first officer."
"the way i see it, risking the safety of voyager is a small price to pay. if we help these people, this could be the turning point in our battle against the borg."
"i'm glad we agree, because i almost talked myself out of it."
somehow i don't think you were ever in danger of doing that.
you'll inform the crew?
"this is the nanovirus axum designed to prevent the borg from detecting those with the genetic mutation. but i've modified it to nullify their cortical inhibitors instead. once they're infected, they should retain their memories of unimatrix zero after they leave their alcoves."
does that mean they'll be able to function as individuals? stand up to the collective?
there's no way to tell. this is highly experimental.
how do we deploy it?
"correct me if i'm wrong, but each borg vessel has a device that links it to every other borg ship."
the central plexus.
"if we can gain access to one of those and release the virus there, it should be transmitted throughout the collective instantly."
any borg activity in the region?
it just dropped out of transwarp three point six light years from here.
"this is a class four tactical vessel, heavily armed. the central plexus is protected by multi-regenerative security grids. we'd be detected long before we could reach it."
meet me in main engineering. we're going to find a way in. prepare the virus.
"aye, captain."
"i think it's time for you to take another nap. pay a visit to unimatrix zero. tell our friends we haven't forgotten them. i couldn't help but notice you were a little different in unimatrix zero, and i don't mean your lack of borg implants. you seemed more"
human.
"if you don't mind my saying so, it suited you."
"i've been told i spent a great deal of time there. but since i don't remember unimatrix zero any more than i remember earth, it's irrelevant."
"to you maybe, but if what i saw was any indication, annika would disagree."
"the klingons have banded together and they're giving bat'leths to anybody who can handle one. hirogen hunters are moving through the forest targeting drones, but we're losing people every hour."
captain janeway intends to keep her promise.
this isn't your battle. you don't owe us anything.
voyager won't abandon you.
a gift from korok. takes some getting used to.
i'm sure you'll adapt.
"eleven more drones, three hundred metres."
sorry.
that felt familiar. our touching.
i told you. we were friends.
elaborate.
now is not the best time.
"we were more than friends, weren't we? why didn't you tell me?"
you'd forgotten. it wasn't my place.
how long?
"six years. only while we were regenerating. a very memorable six years. for me, anyway."
i should return to voyager.
annika.
my name is seven of nine.
"can't we find another borg ship? a sphere, maybe? something less imposing?"
i rechecked long range sensors. there's nothing.
"this is our target. you'll keep a transporter lock on me. once i make it to the central plexus and release the virus, you can beam me back."
in how many pieces? it's ridiculous.
agreed. i should go. i'm the only one with experience.
you're our only connection to unimatrix zero. you're needed here. it was my decision to help these people. this is my responsibility.
starfleet tactical directive thirty six. the captain will not engage a hostile force without the protection of a security officer. the probability of success is greater if there are two of us.
make that three. if you're going to pull this off you'll need an engineer in there.
b'elanna.
tactical directive thirty six a.
there is no directive thirty six a.
there is now.
"i appreciate the offer. but if that cube attacks voyager, you'll be needed here. now you have your orders. set a course, mister paris."
remember when i said i didn't have any objections?
can't this wait till i get back?
"i realise i'm not going to talk you out of this, but i'll be damned if you're going in there alone."
"we've got a lot of work to do, commander."
you said you wanted my support. then take tuvok and b'elanna with you.
and if i don't?
"i may only be first officer, but i still pull a few strings around here. the doctor could be persuaded to question your medical fitness."
i was hoping for your unconditional support.
this is the best i can do.
tell them to pack light.
janeway to bridge. report.
someone's trying to tap into the main computer.
source?
it's some kind of transwarp signal. it's activating the comm. system.
"captain,"
i think it's for you.
captain.
it's been a long time. how are things in the collective?
"perfect, for the most part. voyager?"
never better.
i understand you've established contact with starfleet. perhaps you'll be getting home sooner than you expected.
perhaps.
we could help you.
how so?.
"transwarp technology. you'd find that we can be quite accommodating, but we'd expect the same in return."
i'm not sure i know what you mean.
you know exactly what i mean. tend to your own crew. stay away from things that don't concern you.
"i'm afraid i can't do that, but thanks for the offer."
i won't be as accommodating next time. reconsider.
i'm sorry.
"we'll see you soon, harry."
what did she mean by that?
why the stab at diplomacy?
she's trying to find out what we're up to. she's worried. have b'elanna and tuvok meet me in sickbay.
watch the starboard plasma injectors. they tend to run a little hot at high impulse.
i'll keep an eye on it.
the warp matrix is out of alignment.
by point three microns. since when are you so meticulous?
"since you volunteered for this insane mission. you know, i could sabotage the helm. you'd never make it out the launch doors."
then i'd have to put you on report. you might lose that new pip of yours.
that'd be a small price to pay.
we're in visual range.
on screen. magnify.
torres to bridge.
go ahead.
the delta flyer is ready for launch.
"on my way. guess i'd better be going, huh?"
"anything you'd like done around here while you're gone? gravity plating recalibrated, carpets cleaned?"
surprise me. you have the bridge.
"you need to prepare the others. when they leave their alcoves they may be startled, disoriented. but they have to behave like drones or we could all be exposed."
our ships are scattered across the galaxy. most of us will be the only drone on board who knows about this place.
she's right. what can we hope to achieve?
"we should each gather as much tactical data as we can. what kind of ship we're on, its armaments, location. then we'll coordinate our efforts from here. if all goes well, we'll be working very closely together."
"as colleagues, nothing more. our previous friendship"
yes?
it's irrelevant.
"irrelevant? well, now that i'll be able to retain my memory, i'll keep that in mind."
report.
direct hit to their shield emitters. no damage.
increase phaser yield. where's the flyer?
they're approaching. heading zero one seven mark three.
status?
"voyager has sustained damage, but they are continuing their assault."
"come on, chakotay."
"one of the cube's shield grids is fluctuating. ventral axis, secondary emitter."
cut primary power. thrusters only.
tactical cube one three eight is under attack.
our forward shields are down.
the flyer?
they're closing. fifty kilometres.
maintain fire.
"thirty kilometres, twenty. they're in range."
enhance grid six one one nine.
"captain, i expected something more cunning from you."
it's time.
their ventral shield grid?
still fluctuating at a rate of point zero six terahertz.
align our transporters to match.
aye.
they've detected them.
they're inside.
direct hit to the port nacelle. we're venting plasma.
should i back off?
no. we need to stay close.
they've adapted.
"hull breach, deck eleven."
they're targeting our warp core.
no change yet.
we'll have to take the long way around.
tuvok.
their lifesigns are destabilising.
"so far, so good. you can take us out of here now, tom."
lieutenant.
i'm all right.
you've been given a subvocal processor.
i can live with it. the captain?
we were separated. i don't know where they took her. we must proceed to the central plexus.
time.
seventeen minutes. we should have heard something by now.
doctor?
their higher brain functions are stable.
"the cube's changing course. new heading, one twenty one mark six."
matching course and speed.
the damage to their propulsion system is regenerating. they'll be capable of transwarp in less than two hours.
"i want you inside unimatrix zero. when the virus is released, your friends there will be the first to know. problem?"
no. but i wouldn't call them my friends.
acquaintances then. if you're having issues with these people i suggest you set them aside.
understood.
tell your hunters to patrol the north-eastern perimeter. more drones were spotted there.
understood.
where's that virus you promised?
captain janeway is deploying it now.
"good. the borg have increased their attacks here. they're identifying us one by one. if you're looking for your mate, he's not here."
he's not my mate. he must not be regenerating.
"that or he's dead. he should have been here hours ago. no one's seen him. if he died in battle, i'm sure it was honourable. here. help me."
it's obvious your heart is in conflict.
my heart is functioning perfectly.
some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber as well as the battlefield. at times like these you must treat your heart as the enemy so you won't be distracted in battle.
i'll keep that in mind. has the virus been deployed?
i'm not sure.
do you remember anything? your location? what ship you're on?
"no, nothing."
the central plexus is through here.
those must be the shield emitters that seven told us about.
we need to get through that hatch.
i will attempt to deactivate him.
captain.
what's left of her. how are you holding up?
fine.
i can't access the plexus without shutting down the power grid for this section. that's bound to draw attention. is there another way in?
the primary access port. i think it's isolated from the main power grid.
where is it?
about thirty metres from here.
let's take a look. tuvok. commander.
i can hear the collective.
the neural suppressant must be wearing off.
i'll be all right.
i heard him. the vulcan. but he's gone. why? why can't i hear the others?
leave this one to me. comfortable?
release me.
easier said than done. i think i designed this trap a little too well. what are you doing out here?
looking for you. korok was concerned.
that doesn't sound like korok.
he said you were missing.
"as you can see, i've been busy setting traps."
not the most sophisticated technology.
seems to work. hold on.
i should return to the camp. wait for word on the virus.
i'll go with you. in case you run into any more trouble.
as you wish.
i'm sure korok will be glad to see me.
"tuvok. where are you, tuvok?"
commander?
"stardate 38774. vulcanis lunar colony. the time and place of my birth. recalling the details of my life helps me remain focused. captain, if i succumb to the collective, i will pose a security risk. you must be prepared to deactivate me."
"without the doctor's help, that could kill you. stay focused. stay tuvok. that's an order."
"captain, i've bypassed the access codes."
welcome to the central plexus.
"tuvok. where are you, tuvok?"
busy?
what's on your mind.
the away team. the plan was to give them two hours. it's been two and a half.
"the doctor's keeping an eye on them. we'll give it a little more time. unfortunately, not everything goes according to plan."
"you know, it occurs to me that, with you in command and tuvok off the ship, that makes me acting first officer. technically speaking."
what's your point?
"well, it's my duty to give you an opinion. and in my opinion i think we should pull them out now before it's too late."
i appreciate your diligence. but i've made my decision. we wait.
how long? a day? a week?
as long as it takes to complete the mission.
this mission isn't worth their lives.
you've made your point.
apparently not.
lieutenant. a first officer could get in a lot of trouble for talking to his captain that way.
"well, i've learned from the best."
"i appreciate your concerns, tom, but i need your support on this."
"aye, sir."
download the virus.
tuvok.
t'paal. we share your memories. you are part of us now.
don't resist.
there's a problem with commander tuvok. his synaptic pathways are destabilising.
"if i decide to move in closer, i assume my first officer would concur."
you assume correctly.
we have to get out of this chamber and contact voyager.
"you're commander tuvok, tactical officer of the starship voyager. i'm your captain. step aside, that's an order."
she's irrelevant.
"captain, you must deactivate me."
my designation is three of twelve.
"where are you, tuvok? the central plexus."
"range, forty thousand kilometres."
harry?
too much shielding around the central plexus. i can't get a lock.
stay on it. closer.
this way.
back so soon?
target their shield generators. stand by phasers.
commander?
shields to full. brace for impact.
someone's accessing our tactical controls. our shields are down.
evasive manoeuvres.
sensors are offline. i've lost the away team.
"hull breaches, decks five, six, seven."
reverse course.
we can't just leave them.
the borg have our access codes. get us out of here.
"thank you, tuvok. i'm losing voices. five in spatial grid ninety six, twelve in grid one eight two. hundreds now. thousands."
i can't hear you. why can't i hear you? you've disconnected from the hive mind. explain. comply.
no!
i'm not alone. you can't stop us all.
i altered the transmission to restore your original appearance. i know now vain humans can be.
why am i here?
"you've caused a great deal of suffering. i wanted you to see for yourself. you are the cause of his death, captain. you disconnected him from the hive mind."
you didn't have to kill him.
"he was confused, irrational. i had no choice. many more will die unless you tell me how to counteract the virus."
"sorry, we didn't think to develop an antidote."
"i'll assimilate voyager, then. your doctor created the pathogen. he can find a cure."
my first officer has orders to delete the doctor's programme if you go anywhere near
voyager. the resistance is already underway. it won't be long before thousands of drones begin to fight back.
they will fail.
maybe. probably. but a lot of damage will be done before they do.
"yes, a lot of damage. spatial grid nine four, cube six three zero. complement sixty four thousand drones. but i can no longer hear three of them. no doubt they've joined your resistance. are they trying to sabotage the vessel and liberate others? i don't know, because i can no longer hear them. initiate self-destruct."
"an effective solution, don't you agree? spatial grid zero nine one, sphere eight seven eight. complement eleven thousand drones. only one is silent. but i have no choice. i must silence all of them.  i know how this must upset you, captain. as a starfleet officer, you value all life. even drones. how many more are you willing to sacrifice? thousands? millions? you can put an end to this. i want you to go on a diplomatic mission. it's one of your primary functions, isn't it? negotiations?"
go on.
"tell them to rejoin the collective, and i'll stop the destruction."
they will never agree to that.
"they're individuals now. they have a choice. what are you afraid of, captain? that they may cooperate? you've been waiting for a chance to damage the borg. now you've found one. you're only using them."
"if you really wanted to negotiate, you'd visit unimatrix zero. you found a way to send drones. surely you could go yourself. or are you afraid that a taste of individuality might make you realise it's something worth fighting for?"
comply or you will be responsible for many more deaths.
you'll have to destroy the entire collective to find them all.
several drones have reported that they retained their memories of unimatrix zero after their regeneration ended. the virus has been deployed.
good. we're going to need all the help we can get. the away team's still trapped on that cube.
"and as you may have noticed, we're in no shape to mount a rescue."
can you get back in? find out if they have anybody else aboard this cube?
"if they do, tell them to hurry. they're the only allies we've got."
i'd like to make a few adjustments to your alcove before you return.
"when this crisis ends i'll come up with a more permanent solution, so you can spend more time in unimatrix zero. you're in a unique position. not many of us get to lead a double life."
when this crisis ends i intend to sever my link to unimatrix zero.
may i ask why?
i'm having difficulties with one of the people there.
"mister axum? whenever you mention his name, your pupils dilate by nearly a millimetre, blood flow increases to your facial capillaries. both are consistent with an emotional response."
axum and i apparently had a relationship.
oh. romantic? there go those pupils again.
your diagnosis is accurate.
"well, how ironic. all this time we've been trying to develop that aspect of your humanity, and it's been there all along."
not any more.
"my readings say otherwise. you're very particular about who you choose to spend time with, seven. no doubt that's why you and i have become friends. if you were involved with axum once, doesn't that suggest he's a worthwhile individual?"
he does possess commendable qualities.
"coming from you, that's high praise. there's nothing wrong with feeling ambivalent, seven. after all, you're in the middle of a civil war. but eventually, you may want to give this romance a second chance. who knows? you may even get to meet him in person someday."
i'll say this for your mister axum. he's a very lucky man.
the collective has found a new way to attack us. eleven ships have self-destructed in the last three hours.
we need to coordinate a battle plan. a way to strike at the heart of the collective.
"our target should be the primary unicomplex. if we can disrupt the queen's control of the hive mind, it'll give us a chance to organise, build up a fighting force."
there is one more objective. the voyager away team.
they fought like warriors. their sacrifice will not be forgotten.
we can still rescue them.
she's right. they risked their lives for us. now it's our turn.
there's no time.
"it's a matter of honour, korok. i thought you of all people would understand that."
i'll see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs.
thank you.
it's the least we can do.
what's wrong?
it turns out i'm on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic space. on the other side of the galaxy.
i was hoping we'd be able to meet one day in the real world.
"me too. there are things i can do where i am. i'll try to contact species 8472, see if i can persuade them to join the fight."
"given their history with the borg, i'm sure they'll be eager. i guess this rules out vorothon gorge."
gorge?
it was at the top of our list of things to see in the real world if we were ever freed from the collective. don't you remember?
we could add fluidic space to our list. we still have unimatrix zero.
it was sufficient before.
and now?
where are you?
over here.
"don't be frightened. stand up, let me look at you. comply"
you're one of the machine people. you're trying to hurt us.
that's the last thing i want to do. i'm here to help you. all of you.
they said you want to assim. assima.
"assimilate you. yes. but that's nothing to be afraid of. you like having friends, don't you? assimilation turns us all into friends. in fact, it brings us so close together we can hear each other's thoughts."
is that fun?
"yes. it's fun. i was just about your age when i was assimilated. i was worried then, too. but when i began to hear the others, hear their thoughts, i wasn't afraid anymore."
don't you miss your parents?
"they're here, with me. part of us. i can hear them right now. would you like to be with your parents? they miss you. they want to see you."
can i talk to them?
soon. but first i'd like to see more of this.
there's a place where you can see the whole forest.
show me.
"it's pretty, isn't it?"
"i took your advice, captain. i paid a visit to unimatrix zero. it's far more primitive than i expected. i don't understand how anyone could prefer a crude environment to borg perfection."
spend a little more time there. you might find out.
i've seen enough. it's an illusion.
"even so, the people who go there are real, and they won't give it up without a fight."
they'll fail. i thought you'd like to see our latest accomplishment. recognise it?
no.
"i think you do. it's your nanovirus, with a few modifications. we've reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones. once it's released, it will erode their autonomic functions. they will die within minutes."
you have no way to deliver it. those drones have been separated from the hive mind. they aren't linked to the central plexus anymore.
no. but there's another way i can reach them. i'm prepared to go back to unimatrix zero and release it myself. but i'm willing to reconsider. it all depends on you.
me?
"if they rejoin the collective, i'll spare their lives. they listen to you. tell them it's time to come home. you were responsible for many deaths. now you can save thousands. decide."
let's try this again. ensign?
the warp core is online. navigational array. shields at twenty percent.
we've got sensors. short range only.
it's a start. try to get a fix on the away team.
now what?
someone's tapping into our holographic systems.
source?
it's a borg signal.
doctor to the bridge.
go ahead.
"someone's here to see you and seven, commander. you'd better come down here right away."
kathryn?
the borg have established this link so i can propose a compromise.
we're listening.
they've developed a nanovirus that can kill every borg with the mutation. they're prepared to release it inside unimatrix zero unless all the drones there return to the collective
for reassimilation immediately.
"that's not compromise, that's surrender."
"i won't be responsible for any more deaths. at least they'll survive as drones. tell them unimatrix zero can no longer exist. that's an order. have i made myself clear, commander?"
"yes, captain."
we did our best.
"it's not over yet, doctor. can you disrupt the interlink frequency for unimatrix zero?"
"commander, the captain gave us a direct order."
"yes, she did, but not the one you think. seven?"
"i believe i can, but why?"
didn't you hear? unimatrix zero can no longer exist. chakotay to the bridge. report.
a transwarp conduit just opened off our port bow.
lieutenant?
they're on an intercept course.
evasive manoeuvres. battle stations.
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
"starship voyager, i am general korok. this vessel is now under my command. we've come to join you in battle."
your crewmates are coming to retrieve you. you were wise to comply.
chakotay to seven of nine. we're almost in range.
stand by. i've isolated the frequency.
get korok.
our emitters are fully charged.
you should be receiving the interlink frequency.
we have it.
wait for my signal.
we have to end our regeneration cycles. we can't be here when it happens.
will there be anything left?
"i know we're being asked to make a sacrifice, but it's the only way."
we're in range.
full power to the shields. all weapons online. voyager to korok. it's time.
you must go.
"bridge, it's working. unimatrix zero is shutting down."
acknowledged. voyager to korok. now.
what are they doing?
you wanted to destroy unimatrix zero. we're just lending you a hand.
get me the virus.
you're too late. there's no one left to infect.
this is your compromise?
i don't compromise with borg.
match their shield modulations and fire.
i'm picking up the away team.
i'm isolating their bio-signatures.
get a lock.
i still can't penetrate their inner shields.
voyager to korok. status?
"patience, commander. they're trying to remodulate their secondary shield grid."
i'm attempting to compensate.
you shouldn't be here.
neither should you.
i've wasted our time together.
"no, you didn't. it gave us a chance to fall in love again."
we've lost our only way to be together.
no. i'll find you.
axum.
i'll find you.
shields in sub-grid forty two are destabilizing. target that section.
initiate self-destruct.
their shields are down.
energise.
general korok is finished with his repairs. he's already been contacted by another borg vessel in the region. it's also under the control of former drones.
"the doctor removed my spinal clamps but it'll be a while before i'm playing hoverball again. if i ever imply it's been easy on you these last few years, remind me about today."
noted.
"well, unimatrix zero may be gone but it looks like the resistance is alive and kicking. with any luck, the collective may never be the same."
"korok said he would try to maintain contact, keep us informed."
have you heard from your friend?
"no. but i don't expect to. axum's vessel is in a remote sector of the beta quadrant. if i ever imply that he was nothing more than a friend, remind me about today."
"four of twelve, subjunction of unimatrix five two five. you have a disease. you're one of many with this sickness. we want to cure you but we need a better way to identify those with the mutation. our testing method is too slow. it could take centuries to identify everyone. help me find the interlink frequency that binds all of you together. then we can put an end to this, quickly, efficiently. comply."
i've disconnected you from the hive mind. you're alone. i know how uncomfortable that can be. tell me what i want to know. tthen you can rejoin us.
i don't know.
you must remember something.
i don't remember.
the frequency.
i don't remember.
deactivate him. wait. dismantle him. bring me his cortical array.
we'll save that for next time.
annika.
another milestone. you've had your first dream.
i felt awake.
dreams can often seem quite real. tell me more about this forest.
it was familiar.
perhaps your unconscious mind was drawing on a childhood memory.
i spoke to someone. he called me by my human name.
did you recognise him?
he seemed familiar.
"this could give us a fascinating glimpse into your unconscious mind. any one of those images might have a symbolic meaning. the mysterious stranger, for example. is he a father figure or does he represent a repressed desire for male companionship?"
i don't wish to dream again. please repair my cortical array.
"this isn't a malfunction, seven, it's a natural step in your human development. it might seem unsettling now, but you'll get used to it. before you know it, you'll look forward to climbing into your alcove each night. this'll keep a record of your rem cycles."
"you're late, mister paris."
ma'am?
"according to the ship's chronometer, by twenty two seconds."
i'll make it up at the end of my shift.
see that you do.
take your station.
"open it, that's an order. not only late but improperly dressed. that belongs on your collar, mister paris."
"allow me. as ship's captain, i hereby reinstate you to the rank of lieutenant, with all the privileges and responsibilities therein. your performance on this ship over the past year has been exemplary. i expect more of the same."
you won't be disappointed.
"congratulations, lieutenant."
i didn't notice a little box on my chair.
hiding a cake in the console?
looks like a distress call.
put it through.
i'm getting a carrier wave but no message.
origin?
an asteroid approximately two light years from here.
yellow alert. set a course.
we're in range.
drop to impulse. on screen. magnify.
i'm reading artificial structures. it's a colony of some kind.
open a channel. this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. we received your distress call.
lifesigns?
none.
i'm detecting residual weapons signatures. they're borg.
any vessels?
one. a cube at the edge of this system.
"resume our previous course, mister paris, warp six. make a note in the ship's record. we responded to a distress call at oh nine hundred hours. arrived at the colony two hours later. no survivors. we don't know who these people were, but we know the borg destroyed them."
come with me.
i'm regenerating. this is only a dream.
you're not dreaming. i brought you here. this is unimatrix zero.
there is no unimatrix zero. who are you?
"five of twelve, secondary adjunct of trimatrix nine four two. but when i'm here my name is axum."
axum.
sound familiar?
yes.
good. it's starting to come back to you.
is anyone here?
hello.
i think i'm lost.
i'm axum. this is annika.
my father's ship started shaking. men came aboard. they looked like machines. will you help me find my father?
i'll see what i can do. there are other children here. would you like to meet them?
"i just got here, too. this environment is intimidating, but i believe it's safe."
he was just assimilated.
he's probably still in a maturation chamber.
are you telling me this isn't a real place?it's some kind of virtual construct?.
we come here during our regeneration cycles. we can exist as individuals here.
unimatrix zero.
"you used to come here, before you escaped the collective. you have the recessive mutation, too. don't you remember any of it?"
no. what mutation?
only one out of a million drones has it.
why did you bring me here now?
"the collective has found a way to detect us. it's a lengthy procedure, but they've managed to identify and deactivate nearly two hundred of us over the last few months. it's only a matter of time before they find enough of us to isolate the interlink frequency. once they've done that. you can help us stop them."
clarify.
"we've designed a nanovirus that should mask the biochemical signature of the mutation, but we need someone to release it into the collective."
you're already on a borg vessel. why don't you do it?
after we've completed our regeneration cycle we have no memory of this place. you are not a part of the collective anymore. you're our only connection to the real world.
scan the node for residual harmonics. it's a shame you're not alive to experience disembodiment. it's the epitome of perfection. give it to me. we have isolated the carrier band but it's useless to us without the precise frequency. we need additional data. two more of the mutations have been discovered in spatial grid six four nine. have their cortical nodes removed and analysed. bring me the results.
"unimatrix zero is our sanctuary. when we're here, our thoughts are our own."
what was my function?.
you're thinking like a borg. our only function here is to try and regain a fragment of the lives we lost when we were assimilated.
mister axum?
go introduce yourself. they won't mind.
"hello, do you want to play?"
sure.
"siral, over here. i was hoping you'd come. it's great to see you."
it's always good to be back.
i remember him.
you were friends. you knew a lot of people here. you were a part of our lives for eighteen years.
"i'm willing to help, but i can't do it alone. i'm part of a starship crew now. i'll have to inform my captain."
i told you not to bring her here.
we can't do this by ourselves.
it's too great a risk.
we don't have a choice.
you do not speak for all of us.
what would you rather do? have us wait until we're all discovered? you disappoint me. where's your warrior spirit?
petaq! i'll rip your heart out.
"go ahead, kill me. i'll be back when i begin my next regeneration cycle. you can't stop me, korok."
"if you come here again, you'll be putting your starship at risk and all of us as well."
shouldn't you be off sharpening your teeth?
i know you. your name is laura. you're human.
i was assimilated at wolf three five nine. it's good to see you again. but you look out of place. your cybernetic implants.
our doctor was unable to remove all of my borg components.
you don't have to look that way here.
my appearance is irrelevant.
"no, it's not. they may have turned us into drones, but they can't change the essence of who we are. my cycle's about to end. talk to your captain. we can't do this without"
another round with the borg?
we'd only need to infiltrate a single vessel.
"oh, just one?"
i am prepared to take a shuttle and do this alone.
"no offence, but how do you know that this wasn't some kind of a dream?"
seven was wearing a cortical monitor. she never reached rem sleep. she wasn't dreaming.
"unimatrix zero is real, and so are the people who go there. they need our help."
what else can you tell us about this place? how many drones?
no one is certain. axum told me there could be tens of
axum?
"he's someone i used to know. he told me there could be tens of thousands, perhaps more."
how was it created?
"some of them believe it began as a random malfunction during the assimilation of a single drone, and eventually spread to the others."
"well, this is all very interesting, but are we sure it's worth putting our lives on the line?"
"it's my understanding that when we receive a distress call, we respond. starfleet protocols."
she's right. this is no different.
"i understand your reluctance, but seven's discovered a potential weakness in the collective. before we decide how to proceed i'd like to learn as much about it as we can."
too bad you don't have the luxury of an interlink node.
there is another possibility. a vulcan technique known as the bridging of minds.
go on.
"i would need to initiate a mind meld with both you and seven, acting as a telepathic conduit."
"you make it sound like a conference call. captain, it is my professional opinion that we wait until"
objection noted. i think you'll be turning in early tonight.
"stay at yellow alert. maintain long-range scans for borg vessels. any sign of trouble, you know where to find me."
this will be one away mission for the record books.
"mind melds. the last time i heard the words my mind to your mind, i had a headache for two weeks."
i'm willing to volunteer if you'd rather hold down the fort.
"i appreciate your trying to protect me, but a chance to see this place? it's worth a headache."
how many times have you actually performed this bridging of heads?
minds. never.
then how can you be certain it'll work?
"nothing is certain, doctor. however, i once observed a vulcan master perform the technique. i am reasonably confident i can duplicate his success."
watching and doing are two different things.
"as always, your logic is impeccable."
what a comfort.
"we're ready, captain."
let's do it.
"as the conduit, i'll be aware of both your perceptions. if something goes wrong, i'll break the meld."
understood.
your minds to my mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. your minds to my mind. your thoughts to my thoughts.
welcome to unimatrix zero.
seven?
annika. that's what i'm called here.
drones?
come on. let's find axum.
we're close. i can almost hear them. bring us closer.
there. amplify. disrupt the frequency. it's not working. they're using a triaxillating modulation. you're making this very difficult. if we can't terminate their link then we'll simply have to pay them a visit.
you can see why we want to protect this place.
"we're prepared to help you, but i'm concerned that we'd only be putting off the inevitable. even if we succeeded and you could remain hidden for a year, ten years, the borg would eventually find you again. have you ever considered a more permanent solution?"
more permanent?
"you've got a remarkable sanctuary here, but that's all it is. maybe it's time to stop hiding and find a way to fight back."
that's not possible.
"if you could find a way to carry your individualities into the real world, to wake up from your regeneration cycles with your memories intact, you could begin to undermine the borg's control over you."
it sounds like you're suggesting a civil war.
i prefer to call it a resistance movement.
"that's very ambitious, captain. but we can't retain our memories."
not yet. but we know a good deal about borg technology. maybe we could
"we've found another. spatial grid three two six, cube one one eight four. continue."
"welcome back. spatial grid nine eight two, cube four six one."
janeway.
how's your headache?
i'm guessing it didn't go well.
"let's just say we ran into a little trouble. have a seat, commander."
i'd prefer to stand.
the collective's found a way to infiltrate unimatrix zero. it won't be long before they learn enough to destroy it from the inside out. i plan to stop them.
what have you got in mind?
the people there are vulnerable. they don't have the ability to take action in the real world. we're going to give them that ability.
how?
"the doctor and b'elanna are working on it. i know what you're thinking. we'd be violating half a dozen starfleet protocols. and if the collective ever learned we were involved we'd be putting voyager in the middle of a civil war. valid objections. chakotay, we've had our disagreements and there have been times when i've chosen to proceed without your support. but this can't be one of those times. i won't do this without my first officer."
"the way i see it, risking the safety of voyager is a small price to pay. if we help these people, this could be the turning point in our battle against the borg."
"i'm glad we agree, because i almost talked myself out of it."
somehow i don't think you were ever in danger of doing that.
you'll inform the crew?
"this is the nanovirus axum designed to prevent the borg from detecting those with the genetic mutation. but i've modified it to nullify their cortical inhibitors instead. once they're infected, they should retain their memories of unimatrix zero after they leave their alcoves."
does that mean they'll be able to function as individuals? stand up to the collective?
there's no way to tell. this is highly experimental.
how do we deploy it?
"correct me if i'm wrong, but each borg vessel has a device that links it to every other borg ship."
the central plexus.
"if we can gain access to one of those and release the virus there, it should be transmitted throughout the collective instantly."
any borg activity in the region?
it just dropped out of transwarp three point six light years from here.
"this is a class four tactical vessel, heavily armed. the central plexus is protected by multi-regenerative security grids. we'd be detected long before we could reach it."
meet me in main engineering. we're going to find a way in. prepare the virus.
"aye, captain."
"i think it's time for you to take another nap. pay a visit to unimatrix zero. tell our friends we haven't forgotten them. i couldn't help but notice you were a little different in unimatrix zero, and i don't mean your lack of borg implants. you seemed more"
human.
"if you don't mind my saying so, it suited you."
"i've been told i spent a great deal of time there. but since i don't remember unimatrix zero any more than i remember earth, it's irrelevant."
"to you maybe, but if what i saw was any indication, annika would disagree."
"the klingons have banded together and they're giving bat'leths to anybody who can handle one. hirogen hunters are moving through the forest targeting drones, but we're losing people every hour."
captain janeway intends to keep her promise.
this isn't your battle. you don't owe us anything.
voyager won't abandon you.
a gift from korok. takes some getting used to.
i'm sure you'll adapt.
"eleven more drones, three hundred metres."
sorry.
that felt familiar. our touching.
i told you. we were friends.
elaborate.
now is not the best time.
"we were more than friends, weren't we? why didn't you tell me?"
you'd forgotten. it wasn't my place.
how long?
"six years. only while we were regenerating. a very memorable six years. for me, anyway."
i should return to voyager.
annika.
my name is seven of nine.
"can't we find another borg ship? a sphere, maybe? something less imposing?"
i rechecked long range sensors. there's nothing.
"this is our target. you'll keep a transporter lock on me. once i make it to the central plexus and release the virus, you can beam me back."
in how many pieces? it's ridiculous.
agreed. i should go. i'm the only one with experience.
you're our only connection to unimatrix zero. you're needed here. it was my decision to help these people. this is my responsibility.
starfleet tactical directive thirty six. the captain will not engage a hostile force without the protection of a security officer. the probability of success is greater if there are two of us.
make that three. if you're going to pull this off you'll need an engineer in there.
b'elanna.
tactical directive thirty six a.
there is no directive thirty six a.
there is now.
"i appreciate the offer. but if that cube attacks voyager, you'll be needed here. now you have your orders. set a course, mister paris."
remember when i said i didn't have any objections?
can't this wait till i get back?
"i realise i'm not going to talk you out of this, but i'll be damned if you're going in there alone."
"we've got a lot of work to do, commander."
you said you wanted my support. then take tuvok and b'elanna with you.
and if i don't?
"i may only be first officer, but i still pull a few strings around here. the doctor could be persuaded to question your medical fitness."
i was hoping for your unconditional support.
this is the best i can do.
tell them to pack light.
janeway to bridge. report.
someone's trying to tap into the main computer.
source?
it's some kind of transwarp signal. it's activating the comm. system.
"captain,"
i think it's for you.
captain.
it's been a long time. how are things in the collective?
"perfect, for the most part. voyager?"
never better.
i understand you've established contact with starfleet. perhaps you'll be getting home sooner than you expected.
perhaps.
we could help you.
how so?.
"transwarp technology. you'd find that we can be quite accommodating, but we'd expect the same in return."
i'm not sure i know what you mean.
you know exactly what i mean. tend to your own crew. stay away from things that don't concern you.
"i'm afraid i can't do that, but thanks for the offer."
i won't be as accommodating next time. reconsider.
i'm sorry.
"we'll see you soon, harry."
what did she mean by that?
why the stab at diplomacy?
she's trying to find out what we're up to. she's worried. have b'elanna and tuvok meet me in sickbay.
watch the starboard plasma injectors. they tend to run a little hot at high impulse.
i'll keep an eye on it.
the warp matrix is out of alignment.
by point three microns. since when are you so meticulous?
"since you volunteered for this insane mission. you know, i could sabotage the helm. you'd never make it out the launch doors."
then i'd have to put you on report. you might lose that new pip of yours.
that'd be a small price to pay.
we're in visual range.
on screen. magnify.
torres to bridge.
go ahead.
the delta flyer is ready for launch.
"on my way. guess i'd better be going, huh?"
"anything you'd like done around here while you're gone? gravity plating recalibrated, carpets cleaned?"
surprise me. you have the bridge.
"you need to prepare the others. when they leave their alcoves they may be startled, disoriented. but they have to behave like drones or we could all be exposed."
our ships are scattered across the galaxy. most of us will be the only drone on board who knows about this place.
she's right. what can we hope to achieve?
"we should each gather as much tactical data as we can. what kind of ship we're on, its armaments, location. then we'll coordinate our efforts from here. if all goes well, we'll be working very closely together."
"as colleagues, nothing more. our previous friendship"
yes?
it's irrelevant.
"irrelevant? well, now that i'll be able to retain my memory, i'll keep that in mind."
report.
direct hit to their shield emitters. no damage.
increase phaser yield. where's the flyer?
they're approaching. heading zero one seven mark three.
status?
"voyager has sustained damage, but they are continuing their assault."
"come on, chakotay."
"one of the cube's shield grids is fluctuating. ventral axis, secondary emitter."
cut primary power. thrusters only.
tactical cube one three eight is under attack.
our forward shields are down.
the flyer?
they're closing. fifty kilometres.
maintain fire.
"thirty kilometres, twenty. they're in range."
enhance grid six one one nine.
"captain, i expected something more cunning from you."
it's time.
their ventral shield grid?
still fluctuating at a rate of point zero six terahertz.
align our transporters to match.
aye.
they've detected them.
they're inside.
direct hit to the port nacelle. we're venting plasma.
should i back off?
no. we need to stay close.
they've adapted.
"hull breach, deck eleven."
they're targeting our warp core.
no change yet.
we'll have to take the long way around.
tuvok.
their lifesigns are destabilising.
"so far, so good. you can take us out of here now, tom."
lieutenant.
i'm all right.
you've been given a subvocal processor.
i can live with it. the captain?
we were separated. i don't know where they took her. we must proceed to the central plexus.
time.
seventeen minutes. we should have heard something by now.
doctor?
their higher brain functions are stable.
"the cube's changing course. new heading, one twenty one mark six."
matching course and speed.
the damage to their propulsion system is regenerating. they'll be capable of transwarp in less than two hours.
"i want you inside unimatrix zero. when the virus is released, your friends there will be the first to know. problem?"
no. but i wouldn't call them my friends.
acquaintances then. if you're having issues with these people i suggest you set them aside.
understood.
tell your hunters to patrol the north-eastern perimeter. more drones were spotted there.
understood.
where's that virus you promised?
captain janeway is deploying it now.
"good. the borg have increased their attacks here. they're identifying us one by one. if you're looking for your mate, he's not here."
he's not my mate. he must not be regenerating.
"that or he's dead. he should have been here hours ago. no one's seen him. if he died in battle, i'm sure it was honourable. here. help me."
it's obvious your heart is in conflict.
my heart is functioning perfectly.
some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber as well as the battlefield. at times like these you must treat your heart as the enemy so you won't be distracted in battle.
i'll keep that in mind. has the virus been deployed?
i'm not sure.
do you remember anything? your location? what ship you're on?
"no, nothing."
the central plexus is through here.
those must be the shield emitters that seven told us about.
we need to get through that hatch.
i will attempt to deactivate him.
captain.
what's left of her. how are you holding up?
fine.
i can't access the plexus without shutting down the power grid for this section. that's bound to draw attention. is there another way in?
the primary access port. i think it's isolated from the main power grid.
where is it?
about thirty metres from here.
let's take a look. tuvok. commander.
i can hear the collective.
the neural suppressant must be wearing off.
i'll be all right.
i heard him. the vulcan. but he's gone. why? why can't i hear the others?
leave this one to me. comfortable?
release me.
easier said than done. i think i designed this trap a little too well. what are you doing out here?
looking for you. korok was concerned.
that doesn't sound like korok.
he said you were missing.
"as you can see, i've been busy setting traps."
not the most sophisticated technology.
seems to work. hold on.
i should return to the camp. wait for word on the virus.
i'll go with you. in case you run into any more trouble.
as you wish.
i'm sure korok will be glad to see me.
"tuvok. where are you, tuvok?"
commander?
"stardate 38774. vulcanis lunar colony. the time and place of my birth. recalling the details of my life helps me remain focused. captain, if i succumb to the collective, i will pose a security risk. you must be prepared to deactivate me."
"without the doctor's help, that could kill you. stay focused. stay tuvok. that's an order."
"captain, i've bypassed the access codes."
welcome to the central plexus.
"tuvok. where are you, tuvok?"
busy?
what's on your mind.
the away team. the plan was to give them two hours. it's been two and a half.
"the doctor's keeping an eye on them. we'll give it a little more time. unfortunately, not everything goes according to plan."
"you know, it occurs to me that, with you in command and tuvok off the ship, that makes me acting first officer. technically speaking."
what's your point?
"well, it's my duty to give you an opinion. and in my opinion i think we should pull them out now before it's too late."
i appreciate your diligence. but i've made my decision. we wait.
how long? a day? a week?
as long as it takes to complete the mission.
this mission isn't worth their lives.
you've made your point.
apparently not.
lieutenant. a first officer could get in a lot of trouble for talking to his captain that way.
"well, i've learned from the best."
"i appreciate your concerns, tom, but i need your support on this."
"aye, sir."
download the virus.
tuvok.
t'paal. we share your memories. you are part of us now.
don't resist.
there's a problem with commander tuvok. his synaptic pathways are destabilising.
"if i decide to move in closer, i assume my first officer would concur."
you assume correctly.
we have to get out of this chamber and contact voyager.
"you're commander tuvok, tactical officer of the starship voyager. i'm your captain. step aside, that's an order."
she's irrelevant.
"captain, you must deactivate me."
my designation is three of twelve.
"where are you, tuvok? the central plexus."
"range, forty thousand kilometres."
harry?
too much shielding around the central plexus. i can't get a lock.
stay on it. closer.
this way.
back so soon?
target their shield generators. stand by phasers.
commander?
shields to full. brace for impact.
someone's accessing our tactical controls. our shields are down.
evasive manoeuvres.
sensors are offline. i've lost the away team.
"hull breaches, decks five, six, seven."
reverse course.
we can't just leave them.
the borg have our access codes. get us out of here.
"thank you, tuvok. i'm losing voices. five in spatial grid ninety six, twelve in grid one eight two. hundreds now. thousands."
i can't hear you. why can't i hear you? you've disconnected from the hive mind. explain. comply.
no!
i'm not alone. you can't stop us all.
i altered the transmission to restore your original appearance. i know now vain humans can be.
why am i here?
"you've caused a great deal of suffering. i wanted you to see for yourself. you are the cause of his death, captain. you disconnected him from the hive mind."
you didn't have to kill him.
"he was confused, irrational. i had no choice. many more will die unless you tell me how to counteract the virus."
"sorry, we didn't think to develop an antidote."
"i'll assimilate voyager, then. your doctor created the pathogen. he can find a cure."
my first officer has orders to delete the doctor's programme if you go anywhere near
voyager. the resistance is already underway. it won't be long before thousands of drones begin to fight back.
they will fail.
maybe. probably. but a lot of damage will be done before they do.
"yes, a lot of damage. spatial grid nine four, cube six three zero. complement sixty four thousand drones. but i can no longer hear three of them. no doubt they've joined your resistance. are they trying to sabotage the vessel and liberate others? i don't know, because i can no longer hear them. initiate self-destruct."
"an effective solution, don't you agree? spatial grid zero nine one, sphere eight seven eight. complement eleven thousand drones. only one is silent. but i have no choice. i must silence all of them.  i know how this must upset you, captain. as a starfleet officer, you value all life. even drones. how many more are you willing to sacrifice? thousands? millions? you can put an end to this. i want you to go on a diplomatic mission. it's one of your primary functions, isn't it? negotiations?"
go on.
"tell them to rejoin the collective, and i'll stop the destruction."
they will never agree to that.
"they're individuals now. they have a choice. what are you afraid of, captain? that they may cooperate? you've been waiting for a chance to damage the borg. now you've found one. you're only using them."
"if you really wanted to negotiate, you'd visit unimatrix zero. you found a way to send drones. surely you could go yourself. or are you afraid that a taste of individuality might make you realise it's something worth fighting for?"
comply or you will be responsible for many more deaths.
you'll have to destroy the entire collective to find them all.
several drones have reported that they retained their memories of unimatrix zero after their regeneration ended. the virus has been deployed.
good. we're going to need all the help we can get. the away team's still trapped on that cube.
"and as you may have noticed, we're in no shape to mount a rescue."
can you get back in? find out if they have anybody else aboard this cube?
"if they do, tell them to hurry. they're the only allies we've got."
i'd like to make a few adjustments to your alcove before you return.
"when this crisis ends i'll come up with a more permanent solution, so you can spend more time in unimatrix zero. you're in a unique position. not many of us get to lead a double life."
when this crisis ends i intend to sever my link to unimatrix zero.
may i ask why?
i'm having difficulties with one of the people there.
"mister axum? whenever you mention his name, your pupils dilate by nearly a millimetre, blood flow increases to your facial capillaries. both are consistent with an emotional response."
axum and i apparently had a relationship.
oh. romantic? there go those pupils again.
your diagnosis is accurate.
"well, how ironic. all this time we've been trying to develop that aspect of your humanity, and it's been there all along."
not any more.
"my readings say otherwise. you're very particular about who you choose to spend time with, seven. no doubt that's why you and i have become friends. if you were involved with axum once, doesn't that suggest he's a worthwhile individual?"
he does possess commendable qualities.
"coming from you, that's high praise. there's nothing wrong with feeling ambivalent, seven. after all, you're in the middle of a civil war. but eventually, you may want to give this romance a second chance. who knows? you may even get to meet him in person someday."
i'll say this for your mister axum. he's a very lucky man.
the collective has found a new way to attack us. eleven ships have self-destructed in the last three hours.
we need to coordinate a battle plan. a way to strike at the heart of the collective.
"our target should be the primary unicomplex. if we can disrupt the queen's control of the hive mind, it'll give us a chance to organise, build up a fighting force."
there is one more objective. the voyager away team.
they fought like warriors. their sacrifice will not be forgotten.
we can still rescue them.
she's right. they risked their lives for us. now it's our turn.
there's no time.
"it's a matter of honour, korok. i thought you of all people would understand that."
i'll see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs.
thank you.
it's the least we can do.
what's wrong?
it turns out i'm on a scout ship patrolling the border of fluidic space. on the other side of the galaxy.
i was hoping we'd be able to meet one day in the real world.
"me too. there are things i can do where i am. i'll try to contact species 8472, see if i can persuade them to join the fight."
"given their history with the borg, i'm sure they'll be eager. i guess this rules out vorothon gorge."
gorge?
it was at the top of our list of things to see in the real world if we were ever freed from the collective. don't you remember?
we could add fluidic space to our list. we still have unimatrix zero.
it was sufficient before.
and now?
where are you?
over here.
"don't be frightened. stand up, let me look at you. comply"
you're one of the machine people. you're trying to hurt us.
that's the last thing i want to do. i'm here to help you. all of you.
they said you want to assim. assima.
"assimilate you. yes. but that's nothing to be afraid of. you like having friends, don't you? assimilation turns us all into friends. in fact, it brings us so close together we can hear each other's thoughts."
is that fun?
"yes. it's fun. i was just about your age when i was assimilated. i was worried then, too. but when i began to hear the others, hear their thoughts, i wasn't afraid anymore."
don't you miss your parents?
"they're here, with me. part of us. i can hear them right now. would you like to be with your parents? they miss you. they want to see you."
can i talk to them?
soon. but first i'd like to see more of this.
there's a place where you can see the whole forest.
show me.
"it's pretty, isn't it?"
"i took your advice, captain. i paid a visit to unimatrix zero. it's far more primitive than i expected. i don't understand how anyone could prefer a crude environment to borg perfection."
spend a little more time there. you might find out.
i've seen enough. it's an illusion.
"even so, the people who go there are real, and they won't give it up without a fight."
they'll fail. i thought you'd like to see our latest accomplishment. recognise it?
no.
"i think you do. it's your nanovirus, with a few modifications. we've reprogrammed it to target your mutated drones. once it's released, it will erode their autonomic functions. they will die within minutes."
you have no way to deliver it. those drones have been separated from the hive mind. they aren't linked to the central plexus anymore.
no. but there's another way i can reach them. i'm prepared to go back to unimatrix zero and release it myself. but i'm willing to reconsider. it all depends on you.
me?
"if they rejoin the collective, i'll spare their lives. they listen to you. tell them it's time to come home. you were responsible for many deaths. now you can save thousands. decide."
let's try this again. ensign?
the warp core is online. navigational array. shields at twenty percent.
we've got sensors. short range only.
it's a start. try to get a fix on the away team.
now what?
someone's tapping into our holographic systems.
source?
it's a borg signal.
doctor to the bridge.
go ahead.
"someone's here to see you and seven, commander. you'd better come down here right away."
kathryn?
the borg have established this link so i can propose a compromise.
we're listening.
they've developed a nanovirus that can kill every borg with the mutation. they're prepared to release it inside unimatrix zero unless all the drones there return to the collective
for reassimilation immediately.
"that's not compromise, that's surrender."
"i won't be responsible for any more deaths. at least they'll survive as drones. tell them unimatrix zero can no longer exist. that's an order. have i made myself clear, commander?"
"yes, captain."
we did our best.
"it's not over yet, doctor. can you disrupt the interlink frequency for unimatrix zero?"
"commander, the captain gave us a direct order."
"yes, she did, but not the one you think. seven?"
"i believe i can, but why?"
didn't you hear? unimatrix zero can no longer exist. chakotay to the bridge. report.
a transwarp conduit just opened off our port bow.
lieutenant?
they're on an intercept course.
evasive manoeuvres. battle stations.
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
"starship voyager, i am general korok. this vessel is now under my command. we've come to join you in battle."
your crewmates are coming to retrieve you. you were wise to comply.
chakotay to seven of nine. we're almost in range.
stand by. i've isolated the frequency.
get korok.
our emitters are fully charged.
you should be receiving the interlink frequency.
we have it.
wait for my signal.
we have to end our regeneration cycles. we can't be here when it happens.
will there be anything left?
"i know we're being asked to make a sacrifice, but it's the only way."
we're in range.
full power to the shields. all weapons online. voyager to korok. it's time.
you must go.
"bridge, it's working. unimatrix zero is shutting down."
acknowledged. voyager to korok. now.
what are they doing?
you wanted to destroy unimatrix zero. we're just lending you a hand.
get me the virus.
you're too late. there's no one left to infect.
this is your compromise?
i don't compromise with borg.
match their shield modulations and fire.
i'm picking up the away team.
i'm isolating their bio-signatures.
get a lock.
i still can't penetrate their inner shields.
voyager to korok. status?
"patience, commander. they're trying to remodulate their secondary shield grid."
i'm attempting to compensate.
you shouldn't be here.
neither should you.
i've wasted our time together.
"no, you didn't. it gave us a chance to fall in love again."
we've lost our only way to be together.
no. i'll find you.
axum.
i'll find you.
shields in sub-grid forty two are destabilizing. target that section.
initiate self-destruct.
their shields are down.
energise.
general korok is finished with his repairs. he's already been contacted by another borg vessel in the region. it's also under the control of former drones.
"the doctor removed my spinal clamps but it'll be a while before i'm playing hoverball again. if i ever imply it's been easy on you these last few years, remind me about today."
noted.
"well, unimatrix zero may be gone but it looks like the resistance is alive and kicking. with any luck, the collective may never be the same."
"korok said he would try to maintain contact, keep us informed."
have you heard from your friend?
"no. but i don't expect to. axum's vessel is in a remote sector of the beta quadrant. if i ever imply that he was nothing more than a friend, remind me about today."
"thank you again for taking care of them, captain. we're very grateful."
"we're just glad that rebi and azan will have a chance to grow up with their own people, and that you've been kind enough to let mezoti join them."
you can still come with us.
and you can still stay on voyager.
adapting to your absence will be difficult.
"i'll miss you, too."
it's time.
"i've been studying all available data relevant to this species, as you recommended."
familiarising yourself with their culture will help you adapt.
"on wysanti, it is not customary to say goodbye but, i think i prefer the human way."
energise.
we should deactivate the children's alcoves.
right now?
they're a drain on voyager's power reserves. is there a problem?
it just seems like an insufficient amount of time has passed.
you're having an emotional response to the children's departure. they'll be fine. we should be happy for them.
seven?
yes?
you're crying.
my ocular implant must be malfunctioning.
"crying is nothing to be ashamed of, seven. you should have seen me the first time i heard puccini's tosca in the holodeck. i sobbed through the entire third act."
you're a hologram. you can't cry.
ordinarily. but lieutenant torres enhanced my emotional subroutines so i could truly appreciate the performance.
"then your reaction was the result of a technological enhancement, just as mine was the result of a technological malfunction."
saying goodbye to the children was a traumatic experience. crying was a normal response.
except that i was in complete control of my emotions.
"hmm. it seems i owe you an apology. according to this, your tears were the result of a glitch in your primary cortical node. have you experienced any other malfunctions lately? headache? dizziness? diminished motor function?"
no.
"really? then you won't mind if i check the bio-monitors in your alcove, just to be sure?"
i've experienced an occasional headache.
why didn't you come to see me?
the malfunctions have not affected my work.
"seven, if you're having problems, you need to let me know."
"if it'll make you feel better, i'll be more forthcoming in the future."
you're all heart. i'll schedule some follow-up tests and make my report to the captain.
i'd prefer to keep this between us. i don't want to worry the captain.
we've always kept her informed of your medical needs.
it was my understanding that all members of this crew have the right to doctor-patient confidentiality.
"if you want to keep this between us, that's where it'll stay."
have you finished charting the nebula in sector nine four nine?
"several hours ago. i've been thinking. while i'm grateful for the opportunity to assist you in astrometrics, i'd like to take on more challenging assignments."
i can assign you additional diagnostics.
that's not what i meant. i want to work on the bridge.
you don't have the proper training.
"that's why i'd like to take the entrance exam for starfleet academy. i could forward it to earth in the next datastream transmission. if i pass, i could take the basic classes from commander tuvok. he was an instructor at the academy."
your plan is ambitious.
then you think it's a good idea? you could take the classes with me. earn your own commission.
i believe i've already assimilated enough starfleet training.
i'll need a letter of recommendation from the captain.
i'll speak to her.
i have work to complete in the cargo bay. can you finish here?
of course.
"computer, initiate regeneration cycle."
unable to comply.
why?
the interface is incompatible.
run a diagnostic of alcove zero one.
diagnostic complete. alcove zero one is operating within normal parameters.
initiate regeneration cycle.
unable to comply.
clarify.
your cortical node is malfunctioning.
"seven, i didn't see you."
i was just leaving.
before breakfast?
what time is it?
oh five hundred. don't tell me you've been here all night.
i was unable to regenerate.
anything on your mind?
my alcove is malfunctioning.
"well, you should ask b'elanna to take a look at it."
i didn't want to wake her.
what's all this?
nutritional supplements. i thought they would compensate.
your own recipe?
it's a mixture of metabolic enzymes and protein extract.
"let me make you one of my talaxian omelettes. it may not have as many enzymes, but it'll taste better."
that won't be necessary. i think i'll take your advice and wake lieutenant
"seven! neelix to sickbay, medical emergency!"
you lost consciousness in the mess hall. your body's begun to reject your implants.
"i'm afraid it's a result of that glitch we found in your cortical node. apparently, it's more serious than we thought."
the node is destabilising.
it's no longer able to regulate your implants. they're shutting down one by one.
"when you've disconnected implants in the past, i've always adapted."
"minor implants. an assimilation tubule here, a few nanoprobes there. nothing crucial to your human physiology. but these implants control your vital functions."
"and without my cortical node to regulate them, i'll die. correct?"
borg technology is highly adaptive. my cortical node will repair itself in time.
"i don't think so, seven. if anything, the deterioration is accelerating."
you'll have to stay here for observation.
i think i've been sufficiently observed.
"would you excuse us, please?"
"i'm sorry for what's happening. you have every right to be angry, but that isn't going to help us solve this problem."
the node will correct itself.
"suppose it doesn't, for the sake of argument. is it possible to replicate a new one?"
the technology is too complex.
what if this had happened when you were part of the collective? how would the borg have repaired the damage?
they wouldn't have. trying to repair a node would be a futile exercise. the borg would simply replace it.
"harry, we passed a borg debris field six or seven days ago just outside the yontasa expanse. see if you can find it on long range sensors."
"yes, ma'am."
it's not every day we go looking for the borg. what's up?
seven needs a new cortical node.
"captain, need i remind you the borg often return to salvage damaged cubes."
it's a risk i'm willing to take.
"i want to help seven as much as anyone, but if we're not careful we'll all end up with cortical nodes."
"that's why i'm taking the flyer, alone."
i've located the debris field.
"transmit the coordinates to the flyer. you have the bridge, commander."
"with all due respect. the last time you took the delta flyer to confront the borg, it ended up in a couple of thousand pieces."
i intend to bring it back in one piece this time.
a good pilot might be able to help you do that.
particularly if he's accompanied by an experienced tactical officer.
"you shouldn't do this by yourself, captain."
"well then, gentlemen, i guess you're with me."
captain.
i'll meet you in the shuttlebay.
have you talked to seven?
just a few minutes ago.
and you don't approve?
of what?
my request.
request?
i'm sure seven will discuss it with you when she has the chance. i'm sorry i bothered you.
"obviously, no one's told you."
told me what?
seven isn't well.
what's wrong with her?
her cortical node is failing.
her cortical node? she's going to die.
not if we find a new node. we're on our way to search a borg debris field.
i have experience in borg technology. let me come with you.
"i appreciate the offer, but it's too dangerous."
i'm willing to take the risk.
i'm not willing to let you. i'll let you know how we did as soon as we're back. don't worry.
seven?
why are you here?
the captain told me you were ill.
i'm fine.
then why are you in sickbay?
that's not your concern. you have work to complete. report to astrometrics.
i've finished my work.
then i'll assign you more.
is there a problem?
i wish to be alone.
"come with me, please."
why is she so angry with me?
she's not angry with you. she's just angry.
i don't understand.
it's a common response to serious illness. she's frustrated to be confined. embarrassed to appear vulnerable.
she shouldn't be embarrassed in front of me. i'm her friend.
and her pupil. she doesn't want you or anyone else to see her when she's not at her best.
it's not her fault that she's sick.
"of course not. but we have to allow her to deal with this in her own way, with as much dignity as possible. give her time. she may decide she wants company. and if she does, you're the first person i'll call."
i have isolated a section that contains the bodies of approximately thirty seven drones.
thirty seven doesn't sound approximate to me.
these drones were killed in an explosion. there are only a few left intact.
looks like there's still a breathable atmosphere inside. any sign of any active borg ships in the vicinity?
nothing on sensors.
that could change in a hurry. run continuous scans.
"yes, ma'am."
"tuvok, here. help me get this off him."
no apparent damage to the cortical node.
"captain, you've got company. there's a ship"
two to beam out.
"delta flyer, respond."
three humanoids have just transported aboard this vessel.
drones?
"the only drones here are dead, and they belong to us. who are you?"
captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager.
"this is my debris field, captain."
we weren't aware of that.
what have you taken?
a cortical node. we need it to save one of my crew.
everything here belongs to us.
put down your weapons and i'll consider not activating this laser scalpel.
sorry about the delay. they knocked our transporters offline.
"i need you at tactical. when i bring us around, target their engine core."
"aye, sir."
nice shot. they're breaking pursuit.
may i ask what you're doing?
your filing system is inefficient. i'm implementing a new one.
you should be in bed.
"delivery for seven of nine. tarcanian wildflowers. cheery, don't you think? ah. if you prefer gladiolas, i could go back to the airponics bay."
"that won't be necessary, mister neelix. the flowers are lovely, aren't they, seven?"
thank you. i'll admire them later.
"actually, i thought i'd stay and keep you company."
seven prefers not to have visitors right now.
not even a visitor with a kadis-kot board?
correct.
but it's your favourite game.
personally i can't blame her. you're being extremely insensitive.
i am?
you know perfectly very well seven is in a weakened state. she wouldn't stand a chance against you.
you're right. i don't know what i was thinking. we'll play later when you're feeling up to it.
green.
i beg your pardon?
i prefer the green pieces. you'll use red.
"doctor, do you think she's up to it?"
as long as you go easy on her.
janeway to the doctor.
"yes, captain?"
we're back and we have the node.
i'm ready to disengage the damaged node. transfer seven's cortical functions to the computer.
understood. done.
initiating the extraction.
vital functions are stable.
time?
twenty seconds.
"not yet, i have to realign her primary neurodes first."
the computer can't maintain her cortical functions much longer.
ready.
"her neural relays are going to destabilise in ten seconds, nine."
almost finished.
"eight, seven, six, five."
transfer seven's cortical functions to the new node.
something's wrong.
she's going into anaphylactic shock.
her implants aren't adapting. they're rejecting the new node.
it's losing synaptic cohesion.
apply a twenty millijoule neurostatic pulse on my mark. now.
no effect.
again.
increase the pulse. thirty millijoules.
"computer, end simulation."
why did you stop?
it wasn't working.
run it again.
"captain, this was our twelfth simulation. something tells me thirteen won't be our lucky number."
the salvaged node has been inactive too long.
then we'll find one that hasn't.
"no matter how many debris fields we sift through, a node from a dead drone isn't going to work."
who said anything about a dead drone?
what's that supposed to mean?
"we've infiltrated borg vessels before. if that's what it's going to take to save seven, we'll do it again."
are you suggesting ending one life to save another?
i'm not giving up on her.
"neither am i. i'll do everything in my power to help her, but we both have to face the possibility that it may not be enough."
"red, grid thirteen three."
they should have finished the simulation by now.
i'm sure they'll let you know as soon as they do. your move.
don't you have more important duties to attend to?
nothing that can't wait.
"despite what the doctor told you, i feel perfectly fine."
really? because it looks to me like you're about to lose.
kadis-kot.
"i should have seen that coming. ah well, that makes what, sixteen to three, your lead?"
sixteen to two.
"oh, my mistake."
"oh, er, i should really see how things are going in the mess hall. but i'll be back later for a rematch."
are you ready to proceed?
"according to the simulations, the salvaged node isn't going to work. i'm sorry."
": i'm still researching alternative treatments, and harry and b'elanna are going to try to repair the faulty node using components from your alcove."
they'll fail.
we're not giving up hope. neither should you.
with your permission i'd like to return to my duties.
that's not possible. i need to monitor your condition.
captain?
i'm afraid i have to defer to the doctor.
"if you'd like, i can ask icheb to bring some of your work here."
"doctor? computer, locate the doctor."
the emh is offline.
activate the emh.
forced to sedate you!
doctor?
"i'm sorry, icheb. i wasn't talking to you."
where's seven?
"i wish i knew. when i refused to release her she overrode my autonomy protocols. in the middle of a sentence, no less."
"computer, locate seven of nine."
seven of nine is in sickbay.
"he's looking for you. the doctor, i ran into him in the corridor. he's about thirty seconds away from calling a ship-wide alert."
are you going to tell him where i am?
no. i know what it's like to be stuck in sickbay. i've escaped the doctor myself once or twice.
thank you.
any time.
"lieutenant. when you die, do you believe your spirit will go to sto-vo-kor?"
you shouldn't be thinking about dying.
"according to the doctor's simulations, any attempt to adapt the salvaged node will fail. sto-vo-kor, lieutenant. do you believe you'll go there?"
i guess it all depends on how honourable my death is.
but you do believe there's something after death?
i hope so. what about you?
"the borg have no concept of an afterlife. however, when a drone is deactivated, its memories continue to reside in the collective's consciousness. as long as the hive exists, so will a part of that drone."
you don't seem to take much comfort in that.
"my link to the collective has been severed for nearly four years. if i die, everything that i have accomplished in that time, everything i achieved as an individual, will be lost. my memories, my experiences. it will be as if they, as if i never existed."
i think you're a little more memorable than you're giving yourself credit for. you don't need the collective to validate your existence. you've made an impact on every member of this crew. that's your legacy.
there you are. i should have known she'd be the one to harbour a fugitive.
we difficult patients need to stick together.
i want you to return to sickbay immediately.
have you devised a new treatment?
not yet.
then it's best that i don't distract you from finding one.
"seven, if you continue to exert yourself, your condition will only deteriorate more rapidly. is that what you want?"
what i want is to be useful.
i really could use her help. i promise not to let her overdo it.
"you can stay, provided you wear this cortical monitor."
thank you.
are you feeling better?
my condition is unchanged. i've spoken to the captain about your desire to apply to starfleet academy. she's agreed to administer the entrance exam before we send the next datastream to earth.
it's a list of crewmen who can help you study. lieutenant torres is extremely well-versed in warp mechanics. ensign kim claims to have aced the quantum theory section.
what about astrometrics?
you know more about astrometrics than most starfleet officers.
"still, i'll need someone to review the material with me."
i'll ask lieutenant paris to set aside some time.
i'd rather study with you.
you've become too dependent on me. you must learn to rely on others.
and if i don't want to?
what you want is irrelevant.
why are you acting like this? is it because you think you're dying?
i am dying. i'm sorry.
"you may have given up, but i haven't."
i know how to save her.
i'm certainly open to suggestions.
i've been analysing the simulations you performed. they failed because you tried to implement a cortical node from a dead drone.
that's correct.
what you require is a live drone.
i've already been through that with captain janeway.
my cortical node is operational. i want you to remove it and give it to seven.
absolutely not!
"well, at least review my research."
it may as well be a suicide note.
i don't agree.
"well, that's comforting."
you took these scans of me when i left the collective. by your own estimation i emerged from my maturation chamber before i was fully assimilated. as a result my physiology is less dependent on my implants.
they still regulate many of your vital functions.
"what about my age? i'm younger, so it should be easier for my body to adapt to the loss."
you're obviously too young to understand the risks involved.
"i understand the risks perfectly. if we continue to do nothing, seven will die."
"and if we proceed with your idea, you could both die."
"according to my research, there's an eighty six point nine percent chance that seven's implants will adapt to my node."
eighty-six
point nine.
"what about you? without a cortical node, how will you regulate your implants?"
"you should be able to compensate with genetic resequencing. this isn't suicide, doctor. i believe it can work. all i ask is that you consider it."
earth's biggest ditch. that's what my father used to call it. we hiked the north rim when i was nine.
it's an impressive geological formation.
too dusty. i've always preferred farm country myself.
"bloomington, indiana. your home town. you've mentioned it on several occasions."
"so, what do you think?"
it appears to be a pleasant environment.
when we get to earth i'll take you there.
it's more likely this crew will reach earth without me.
you don't know that.
"you refuse to acknowledge the severity of my condition, just as i did at first."
are you giving up?
i'm merely accepting reality.
"if i'd accepted reality six years ago, i'd have settled on the first m class planet we came across. instead, i'm thirty thousand light years closer to bloomington, indiana."
minus several members of your crew.
"ensign marie kaplan, ensign lindsay ballard, crewman timothy lang."
is there a point to this?
every person on this list died under your command. you accepted their deaths. but i don't believe you'll accept mine.
that's presumptuous.
"i'm not being egotistical. on the contrary, i'm trying to make a point."
which is?
"all of these crew members came to voyager with unique personalities, but i've required your constant assistance to develop my individuality."
and you've come a long way.
but not far enough. i've disappointed you. you feel your task is incomplete. that's why my death will be difficult for you to accept.
is that what you think? that you haven't lived up to my expectations?
"clearly, i haven't. but i want you to know that the failure has been mine, not yours."
"you haven't failed, seven. you've exceeded my expectations. you've become an individual. an extraordinary individual. if i'm having trouble accepting your condition, it's only because i don't want to lose a friend."
doctor to the captain. i need to see you and seven right away.
it would be a complicated procedure.
no doubt.
but you believe it'll work.
"there are significant risks involved to seven and icheb, but if you're asking me if it's possible i'd have to say yes."
what sort of precautions
"no matter how many precautions you take, it's not worth the risk to icheb."
"seven, this could work."
i'm not willing to extend my life at the cost of yours.
you haven't reviewed all the data.
"as long as there is any chance you won't survive, the data is irrelevant. i'd like to return to sickbay now."
as you wish.
you're the captain. you could order her to do it.
i have to respect her wishes.
even if it kills her?
i want to help her just as much as you do.
"if that were true, you wouldn't let her die."
is there anything i can bring from the cargo bay to make you feel more at home?
"no, thank you."
something from the mess hall? a piece of fruit?
are you offering me my last meal?
i. of course not. is that what you thought?
i was attempting to lighten the mood.
"ah, yes. well done."
icheb to the doctor. report to cargo bay two immediately.
he's persistent.
not to worry. i'll make it clear to him that persistence is futile.
"you were summoned, too?"
icheb doesn't seem to have grasped the chain of command yet.
remind you of anyone we know?
icheb?
he's disengaged his cortical node.
how?
my alcove. i programmed it to disconnect my neural relays.
can you reconnect them?
he's locked me out of the controls.
how could you do this?
it was the only way i could prove to you that it would work.
what's wrong with him?
icheb decided to perform a little operation on himself.
you have to reconnect his node immediately.
i intend to.
"no. if seven can refuse treatment, so can i."
we don't have time for this.
check your scans. you'll see i'm already adapting.
"some of your implants have adapted, but not all."
then apply the resequencing technique i researched.
this debate is pointless. i won't accept the node.
and i won't keep it.
someone had better use the damn thing. if it stays disconnected much longer it won't do either of you any good.
you're acting like a child.
i'm trying to save your life.
only because you've grown too dependent on me.
you think i need to learn to rely on other people?
yes.
"what about you? you've refused to rely on a single member of this crew. you hid your condition from the rest of us, you deactivated the doctor, and now you're rejecting my help. you're the one who needs to rely on others. isn't that what people on this ship do? they help each other?"
whenever we can.
"if the captain were dying, you'd risk your life to save her, wouldn't you? and when you respond to a distress call, you're risking the life of everyone on this ship to respond to the aid of strangers."
he's right.
"captain, he's just a child."
i don't think he is. not anymore.
doctor!
don't look at me.
"please, just let us help you."
let's begin.
good morning.
how long have i been regenerating?
six days. we needed to make sure your implants had completely adapted to the new node.
"the good news is, they have."
icheb?
his road to recovery has been a little bumpier than yours.
has he suffered any permanent damage?
"i don't think so. he's been experiencing some pain, but i believe it's temporary."
pain i caused him.
pain he was willing to endure.
you've recovered.
i expect the same from you.
"the doctor wants to keep me here another week, but i'm sure i'll be back on my feet in half that time."
i suggest you get as much rest as you can. you're going to need it.
why?
i've decided to help you prepare for the astrometrics portion of the academy exam. you can expect a rigorous and gruelling schedule.
seven?
yes?
your ocular implant. it's malfunctioning again.
"actually, it's functioning perfectly."
"what's the matter, harry? you look a little pale."
"i volunteered for a test flight, not a suicide mission."
how can we put the new delta flyer through her paces without taking a few risks?
another risk like that and we'll have to rebuild her all over again. there's a vessel coming up fast off our starboard beam.
shields.
range fifty kilometres. ten. it's pulling alongside.
"wow, nice ship."
it's scanning us.
this is lieutenant tom paris. please identify yourself.
"vectored exhaust ports, accelerated driver coils. your vessel must be fast."
gets us where we want to go.
check your scanners. you'll see a comet on the other side of the asteroid field. i wonder which of our ships could get there first?
sounds like a challenge.
are you going to accept?
we are not going to race her.
"this is a test flight, right?"
"yeah, but"
what better way to test the new ship than to see how it stands up to a little competition? we're ready over here. shall i count to three?
guess not. she's a lot more manoeuvrable than we are.
"not that i'm endorsing this misguided exercise, but maybe we can even the odds. new impulse thrusters."
"now that's the spirit, harry."
"we're catching up. a hundred metres, fifty."
bring the backup generators online and reroute power to the thrusters.
and it's the delta flyer by a nose.
something's wrong with her ship. the cabin's filling up with nyocene gas.
stand by for emergency transport.
are you all right?
i think so.
i told you this wasn't a good idea.
does that mean you're afraid to try again?
"yeah, harry, you afraid?"
"no, of course not. it's just that your ship is in no shape for a rematch."
my power transformer overloaded.
"i bet we could find you a spare back on voyager. we were about to head back anyway. right, tom?"
"whatever you say, ensign eager."
i've been looking forward to my holodeck time all week. why can't you borrow three hours from someone else?
yours are the last piece to the puzzle. tom and i have finally managed to get a weekend off together. i've been trading favours with members so that we could get the holodeck to ourselves.
a romantic getaway.
"well, that's the idea, yes."
"well, ordinarily i wouldn't hesitate to oblige but i've been looking forward to indulging myself in a new hobby. something human doctors have been enjoying for centuries."
i've already booked a tee time.
"well, if your tee time is more important than our happiness. our first chance to be alone in months."
fine. take my three hours.
thank you.
"so, what programme are you planning to run?"
"something new, called gedi prime."
i've heard of that. the vacation paradise that makes risa look like a tourist trap.
"and a championship golf course, if i'm not mistaken. why don't i just join you?"
somehow i don't think that would add to the mood.
don't be so sure. you haven't seen me in a bathing suit.
could you hand me the veridium injector.
"veridium injector. er, let's see."
the one with the long handle.
of course.
comfortable.
"my co-pilot thinks so, too."
co-pilot?
i was on my way to meet him when i ran into you.
"so, tell me more about where you're from."
it's a small trinary system about half a parsec from here.
three suns? must make for some long days.
are you always this inquisitive?
that depends on who i'm talking to.
your new power transformer is installed and ready to go.
thanks.
your impulse drive is a real beauty.
i designed it myself.
but i couldn't help noticing your warp system seems so rudimentary.
"warp's fine if you like going fast in a straight line. but to me that's just physics, not flying."
i guess it's just a matter of taste.
"anyway, for the kind of flying i'm here for, warp is not a factor. the race course is only two billion kilometres long."
race course?
what kind of race course?
the antarian trans-stellar rally. three segments covering two point three billion kilometres.
with obstacles ranging from dwarf star clusters to k class anomalies.
"two man crews and most importantly, each ship is limited to sub-light speeds. it is the ultimate test of ship design and piloting skills"
not to mention a serious drain on voyager's resources. you're suggesting we reassign fifteen crewmen to modify the delta flyer.
the race has very specific guidelines.
all the ships have to use enriched deuterium fuel. the delta flyer's not equipped for that.
irina agreed to lend us a fuel converter.
"captain, this race is more than just a sporting event. until recently this region was a war zone. four different species fought for nearly a century to control it."
"now, for the first time, they're competing peacefully to commemorate the new treaty that ended the war."
"this race embodies everything the federation values. peaceful coexistence, free exchange of ideas"
i think it's a great idea.
you do?
you do?
"absolutely. this competition is just the sort of break we need. it would give us the chance to make some friends, and allow the crew a little r and r. request granted."
"thank you, captain."
"one thing, gentleman. now that we're in this race, we're in it to win. after all, starfleet's honour is at stake."
"don't worry, it's in good hands."
"a little tip, doc. this game was not meant to be played indoors."
here to rub salt in the wound?
i beg your pardon?
"i planned to be putting the greens at saint andrews. instead i'm putting into beakers in sickbay, thanks to you."
me?
"oh, don't be coy. i've already approved your time off."
the captain's told you about the race already?
what race? i was referring to your romantic getaway.
"oh, no."
don't tell me you forgot.
do me a favour doc. keep a lock on my biosigns.
what for?
because in about five minutes there may be a medical emergency in engineering.
maybe i can get that tee time back.
hi.
you're early.
you packed?
"not yet. actually, there might be a little problem."
problem?
"i have the chance to pilot the flyer in a race. a really unique race and the captain thinks it's a great idea, and i guess i got so excited i forgot about our plans. but i don't have to do it. the captain would understand."
it's all right.
"no, no. i should have remembered. this just seemed like such an amazing opportunity. pilots from all over"
i said it's okay.
really?
the holodeck will always be here. this race won't.
i do not deserve you.
you're right about that.
"so, we'll plan this vacation for another time."
sure.
"i'm going to make this up to you, i promise."
late night? can i get you anything?
"no, thanks."
"oh, ah, ow. oo."
are you okay?
"oh, my feet. ow. i haven't had a chance to sit down all day."
"if you're thinking of cheering me up, don't bother."
"who, me? never."
"and by the way, you can have your holodeck time back."
what about your weekend with tom?
he just cancelled it.
does he have any idea how much planning it took?
"no. and you're not going to tell him, either. he just entered this big race, and he's really excited and, i don't want to spoil it for him."
"i'm sure if you tell him how important this weekend was to you, he'll reconsider."
probably. but he should be able to do what makes him happy.
what about what makes you happy?
"it's time i faced facts, neelix. tom and i just don't belong together."
then you're not in love with him anymore?
i didn't say that.
"b'elanna, if you still love each other"
maybe that isn't enough.
"call me a hopeless romantic, but i still think it is."
there's a klingon phrase my grandmother used to use. mok'tah. it means bad match. that's what tom and i are. i just hate that it's taken me three years to realise it.
"if you're really such a mok'tah, it must have been an awful three years."
no. tom is a great guy. we've had a lot of fun together. and that seems to be enough for him. but not for me.
why aren't you saying all this to tom?
i plan to. after the race.
"by which time, he'll have already disappointed you again. i may not know as much about klingon tradition as your grandmother, but somehow, keeping tom in the dark doesn't seem very honourable. my feet are feeling better. i should go back to work."
"we have teams that have travelled quite a distance, captain, but none from as far as the alpha quadrant."
we're always willing to go that extra light year for a good cause.
"well, your entrance petition seems to be in order. the delta flyer meets our guidelines. now all you have to do is win."
something tells me the other teams aren't going to make that too easy.
bridge to the captain.
"go ahead, commander."
there is an incoming transmission for the ambassador.
route it here.
i asked not to be disturbed.
"i'm sorry, but the aksani are threatening to withdraw unless they're allowed to host the post-race ceremony."
did you explain that we've already promised that to the chessu.
yes. they said that was unacceptable.
"arrange for another meeting. i'll have to find some way of appeasing them. well, i hope the race you just entered doesn't end before it begins."
it's that serious?
"the peace is still very fragile. every decision i make, no matter how trivial, is looked upon as symbolic."
"so, every time you make a concession to one participant"
"another is offended, yes."
maybe we can help.
"that would be wonderful, but how?"
"by providing neutral ground for the pre- and post-race activities. since we've never taken sides in your conflict, you couldn't be accused of showing favouritism."
"if your racing skills are as sharp as your diplomatic instincts, the other teams won't have a chance."
there's someone to watch out for.
what's his story?
his name is assan. he was a fighter pilot. one of the most ruthless.
where you going?
a little personal reconnaissance. we are the hosts. lieutenant tom paris. welcome aboard.
could i get you something? a drink? something to eat? a tour of the ship?
were you assigned to serve me?
"er, not exactly."
are we friends?
i guess not.
then you must be one of those pilots who believes in the fellowship of combat.
"correct me if i'm wrong but, i thought this was a friendly race, not a battle."
"if that's what you believe, then you've already lost."
"well, nice chatting with you."
learn anything?
yeah. i should leave the hosting to neelix.
joxom!
who?
my co-pilot.
irina. hi.
looks like they're good friends.
they're team-mates.
close personal team-mates.
"oh, it was nice while it lasted."
come on.
"seven, i need to run a diagnostic on the lateral sensor array."
as soon as i'm finished.
with what?
plotting the most efficient course for the first segment of the rally.
seems like the entire crew has come down with race fever.
maybe you could persuade the doctor to develop a vaccine.
i'm surprised you're putting time into this.
"initially i did find the activity irrelevant. but then i realised that it's important for the crew's morale, and for my relationship with lieutenant paris."
your relationship with lieutenant paris.
"i was speaking professionally. i often work with him on navigational problems. he can be an erratic individual, but he's also a very competent officer and clearly a skilled pilot."
it's the erratic individual that takes getting used to.
"no doubt. but i've learned that if i embrace some of his interests, support him in his personal goals, we're able to function more efficiently as crewmates."
"harry, where have you been?"
say q'apla!
it means success. i just wanted to capture the moment. not to mention that cute bewildered expression.
what are you doing in that flight suit?
there's been a change of plans. i'm your new co-pilot.
"look, i don't have time for practical jokes."
neither do i. ready to bring that impulse drive online?
b'elanna.
"okay. i was upset that you cancelled our weekend. but then i realised, why should we spend this time apart when we can be together doing something you love?"
what about harry?
i assigned him to a level five diagnostic in engineering.
"oh, that's terrible."
"i'm just kidding. i told him how hard it was for us to get time together and he understood. anyway, the way i see it, you're trading an ensign for a chief engineer."
"well, you don't have to convince me. i couldn't ask for a better co-pilot. now just remember, we're not on vacation. the point is to win."
and you know how much i hate to lose.
thrusters online. opening shuttlebay doors.
the racers are moving into position.
ambassador.
welcome to the first running of the antarian trans-stellar rally. this moment marks a hopeful point
in our shared history. a chance to put aside old animosities and come together
in a spirit of peace and friendly competition.
good luck to all of you. prepare for the starting signal.
"captain, the honour is yours."
"mister tuvok, fire."
we've passed two more ships. three still ahead of us.
how's my impulse engine?
"hot but stable, thanks to the new fuel converter."
that was the number eight ship.
assan.
whoever it is just grazed our shields. port thrusters are offline.
compensating. that was an old trick. back at the academy we used to call that scraping.
assan just almost scraped us out of the race.
how are we doing on time?
"twenty seconds to the third marker. assan's already rounding it, thanks to his little tactic."
it's a long race. we'll catch him.
how's our team doing?
i announced the delta flyer's progress over the comm. eleven minutes ago.
"in a race like this, eleven minutes can be an eternity."
"the delta flyer is in fourth position, having completed sixty two percent of the course. the aksani vessel is in third position, having completed sixty eight percent of the course."
you don't make it sound very exciting.
i'm relaying the relevant information.
"it's all in the delivery. do you mind? attention, all hands. stand by for a race update. with only fifty eight million kilometres left od the first segment, the aksani, imhotep and terrellian ships are still battling for the lead. wait, the number eight ship just cut off the number three in the darla system. now three's changing course using the gravity from a gas giant to boost its speed. it's making up for lost ground."
sounds like quite a race.
"apparently, it's all in the delivery."
so much for the aksani. now it's just down to irina and assan.
in a few minutes they'll just be echoes in our aft scanners.
"well, we've still got the mobius inversion coming up."
the what?
tell me you read the course manual.
i skimmed it. more or less.
"oh, great."
"so, what exactly is this mobius whatever?"
"take a look. it covers the entire last third of the course. level six subspace distortions, gravimetric shears. just think of it as a little wormhole with a big attitude."
"the terrellian and imhotep ships are still in the lead, the delta flyer trailing by a few seconds. meanwhile, the two chessu ships are continuing to advance, claiming fourth and fifth position."
my weekly security report.
i'll read it later.
there are a few matters we should discuss.
"she said later, tuvok."
something's wrong. they're disappearing.
radiation from the mobius inversion is blocking our sensors.
how will we track their progress?
"we can't, not until they emerge from the other side of the anomaly."
"want to talk about that report now, tuvok?"
"later, if that's permissible."
"fifty metres, forty. we can get through."
we're too close to each other.
i'm reversing our deflector polarity. it'll repel their shields. why wait for an opening when you can make one?
"no, it's too risky."
too risky? that doesn't sound like the tom paris i know.
what are you doing?
deploying auxiliary thrusters. we'll need the extra manoeuvring power to get through the gap.
b'elanna.
just steer the ship.
it's them. it's the delta flyer. they're in the lead. they're pulling away!
we did it.
you should have waited.
i saw a chance and i took it.
i'm the pilot. that means i do the flying.
attention all racers. there's been an accident. stay in order and shut down your engines.
report.
his condition's stabilising. i should be able to start dermal regeneration in a few hours.
this was assan's fault.
why?
he collided with me so many times my shield generator overloaded. joxom's console exploded. he's lucky he's alive.
"if i'm guilty of anything, it's of coming in second. a situation i'll remedy in the next leg."
you're doing a poor job of defending yourself.
we may have had something to do with this too. we grazed both of their shields while in the anomaly.
intentionally?
it was a tight course. everyone was flying very aggressively.
"your team is not responsible, captain. my generators were already overloading when they made contact."
"perhaps none of you is to blame. i found this interfaced with her ship's shield generator. i ran an analysis. it's a phase inverter, designed to cause a system overload."
"oh, it's hard to believe someone would go this far just to knock a competitor out of the race?"
"this may be more than a simple case of cheating, captain. i think someone's trying to end the peace."
"maybe i'm missing something, but we're talking about a single act of sabotage. how does that threaten your treaty?"
by itself it wouldn't. but we received several threats of a more serious nature.
from whom?
"groups opposed to the alliance. arms dealers, isolationists, political extremists. up until now i wasn't sure how seriously to take them."
clearly they pose a security threat.
"yes, yes. we've done everything we could to protect the races, but that may not be enough. i don't want to risk any more lives. we should cancel the race, or at least postpone i,t until we can guarantee everyone's safety."
no. if we stop now we'll be letting these extremists win.
she's right.
"very well, then. if that's the consensus, we'll resume tomorrow as scheduled. of course, captain, if you decide to withdraw, we'd understand."
"the last time i checked, i believe we were winning."
there you are. congratulations on taking the lead.
thanks.
"of course, you're not going to win."
why is that?
because we are.  you're looking at your new co-pilot. i checked with one of the race officials. it's perfectly legal. and it's a chance for both of us to get back in the race.
"i appreciate the gesture, but my ship's damaged."
you don't know our harry. once he sets his mind on something
"he'll not only fix your ship, he'll polish the bulkheads."
how can you turn me down?
apparently i can't.
"come on, you can say it."
it's embarrassing.
i just want to make sure we're clear on what we're doing.
"right at the light, then readjust my sight."
meaning?
come about eighty six degrees at the red giant then recalibrate sensors to compensate for photonic interference.
right. next?
do i really have to spend my morning reciting nursery rhymes?
it got me through the academy.
you were expelled.
okay. repeat after me. i am not the pilot. i will not attempt to fly this ship.
that one doesn't even rhyme.
anyone home?
"well, if it isn't our competition."
here to spy on us?
i just stopped by to borrow a hyperspanner.
looks like you didn't get much sleep.
irina and i were up all night.
"oh, really?"
"making repairs. to be honest, i can't remember the last time i had so much fun. she's funny, smart. we get along without trying. i'm going to ask her if she wants to spend some time on voyager after the race."
what about joxom?
turns out they're just team-mates. i know what you're going to say
"no, no. actually, i was just going to congratulate you. she's not a borg, she's not a hologram, and she's not dead. looks like you might have finally found yourself the perfect woman."
all teams report to your ships. the race will resume in thirty minutes.
see you on the course.
"attention, all hands. stand by for another race update. after fighting off a formidable challenge from the terrellian team, the delta flyer has managed to hold onto it's lead going into the third and final segment."
approaching the pulsars.
straight through the gate.
then remodulate.
"harry sure had that glow, didn't he?"
what glow?
"you know, that look you get when you first meet someone."
"yeah, his cheeks were a little redder than usual."
we're through the pulsars. harry and irina are right behind us.
ease up off the thrusters now. i want to conserve some fuel for the final leg.
if circumstances were right they might even have a future together.
what?
harry and irina.
they just met. it's a little early to be planning a wedding.
"no, i just meant that some people just fit together without having to work at it. and other people, no matter how much they try"
are we talking about them or us?
"what? no, i didn't mean."
"if something's bothering you, let's talk about it."
we should concentrate on the race.
maybe harry and irina aren't such a great team after all. they're falling behind.
i'm reading malfunctions in the eps relays. but we double-checked all of them last night.
"we must have missed something. at this rate, we're going to be out of the race in a couple of minutes."
i think i can reroute power through the impulse manifolds.
no!
why not?
it could damage the reactor coils.
what do the reactor coils have to do with the impulse manifolds?
these systems are different than what you're used to.
"you do want to win, don't you?"
of course i do.
"it just seems like every time i make a suggestion, you find a reason to reject it."
i'm more familiar with my ship than you are.
now what?
i think it's the injector ports.
"no, it's an overload in my console!"
that's the second time your co-pilot's console exploded. quite a coincidence.
"i'm sorry, harry. i really am."
you sabotaged your own ship. twice. why are you trying so hard to get out of this race?
"what the hell is going on? sit down and hold still! all right, if you won't talk to me, maybe you'll talk to antarian security. you disabled the comm. system. we'll just wait. someone'll come along eventually."
we're past the last marker. time to deploy the thrusters?
whatever you say.
what happened to i'm the pilot?
"that really bothered you, didn't it? it's why you think we don't fit together as well as harry and irina?"
could we talk about this later? assan is gaining on us.
"well then, i guess you'd better deploy the thrusters."
"thrusters deployed. this isn't about the race anymore, is it?"
you tell me.
"if we're going to just sit here, we might as well see who's winning."
you're not exactly in a position to be making requests.
"admit it, harry. you're curious too."
the delta flyer is still in the lead.
good for them.
"i thought if we could do this one thing together, something you cared about, that it might help our relationship."
i didn't know it needed help.
that's part of the problem.
what's the rest?
you know the rest.
so we scrape shields occasionally. it keeps things interesting.
maybe interesting isn't enough for me. what are you doing?
they're stopping. they're dead in the water.
"ah, ah, ah."
how far from the finish line?
less than a million kilometres.
that was assan. why are we just sitting here?
"if we've got a problem, we're going to resolve it right here, right now."
"you done everything possible to take yourself out of the race, and now you seem worried that the delta flyer won't reach the finish line. i'm counting more than a dozen ships there. spectators, officials."
"all congregated in the name of peace. touching, isn't it?"
you've planned some sort of attack. there are hundreds of innocent people there. how can you do that?
"not everyone is as comfortable mixing with other species as you are, harry. some of us believe it was better when we were separate."
"hey, i never asked you to give up this race, or anything else that you care about. i never asked you to stop being yourself."
the only self that i want to be is the guy you're in love with.
wow. i didn't know you felt that way.
how can you say that?
"well, you always seem to have other priorities."
i'm showing you my priorities right now.
the delta flyer wouldn't even be in this race if you hadn't told us about it. you gave us the fuel converter so we could qualify. the fuel converter. that's why you're so concerned about tom and b'elanna's crossing the finish line. what'd you do to it? rig it to explode?
how come you never talked to me about this before?
"well, you've got that tough klingon exterior. and er, i didn't think you liked the mushy stuff."
do i look that tough right now?
does that mean you're in the mood for some mushy stuff?
maybe.
exactly what kind of mush are we talking about?
you tell me.
"well, there's, um, kissy stuff."
that was nice.
and there's the you're the most important person in the world to me.
"i like that one, too."
and there's the happily ever after.
how does that one work?
"well, traditionally it requires a proposal."
we're being scanned by some kind of modulating pulse. it's from irina's ship.
they must be wondering why we stopped.
there's something odd about the amplitude.
wait a minute. dit dit dah. that's morse code. harry and i use it in the captain proton holoprogramme.
what's it saying?
fuel converter rigged. eject. what does he mean by rigged?
the converter's leaking veridium isotopes.
why didn't the computer warn us?
the online sensors have been tampered with.
can you contain the leak?
too late. the veridium is already reacting with the warp plasma.
that'll cause a warp core breach.
in less than a minute.
then do what harry said. eject the converter.
it's too late. i have to eject the core.
here? we'll never survive the blast. neither will anyone else within a million kilometres.
they're moving again.
away from the finish line.
warp core breach in thirty seconds.
where are we going?
a j class nebula filled with ionised gas. should contain the explosion.
i can't get the ejection subroutines online.
warp core breach in twenty seconds.
"so, what's your answer?"
my answer?
will you marry me?
warp core breach in fifteen seconds.
you're proposing now?
it's as good a time as any.
subroutines back online.
"warp core breach in ten seconds, nine, eight."
clear!
four.
go!
three.
damn.
"i'm sorry your team didn't win, captain."
janeway to the bridge. report.
that was a shock wave from an antimatter explosion approximately one point two million kilometres from here.
excuse me.
b'elanna.
i guess we lost.
that depends.
on what?
on how you answer my question.
i thought you only asked it because we were about to explode.
"well, we're still alive and i'm still asking."
how come you never asked me before?
how come you're still avoiding the question?
i'm thinking.
think faster.
why? you going to withdraw the question?
"no, but i might start to beg. it could get embarrassing."
to the winners. b'elanna paris. that has a nice ring to it.
"thanks, but i already have a ring. anyway, i kind of like the sound of tom torres."
i hope you're kidding.
"hey, it is the twenty fourth century."
"the prophets sing, this is a holy time. b'tanay, the time of awakening. return to that dark place from which all life springs. a primal energy charges your blood, an energy of rebirth. the mind awakens and focuses on its task. pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
fresh flowers? an afternoon on the holodeck? it almost feels like we're dating again.
the secret to a lasting marriage. keep the romance alive.
i'm not complaining.
lecture hall?
guess again.
opera house? not another one of the doctor's performances.
"this is a movie house. this is the old palace theatre in chicago, built in 1932. look at the detail on that crown moulding."
it doesn't look very functional.
"this place isn't about function, it's about fantasy."
chewing gum.
there is such a thing as too much authenticity.
attention to detail. that's what makes it fun.
protective lenses?
these will make the images on the screen appear three-dimensional.
"let me get this straight. you've gone to all this trouble to programme a three-dimensional environment that projects a two-dimensional image, and now you're asking me to wear these to make it look three-dimensional again?"
"great, isn't it?"
crick in your neck?
"people didn't go to the movies just for the movies, you know."
really? what did they go for?
i'll try to demonstrate.
i can see why this was so popular.
shush!
maybe this would be more fun if we were alone.
"computer, delete audience."
who's that in the front row? must be a glitch.
"no, that's tabor."
"this is an emergency! the gill man has escaped! please, clear the oceanarium! get out, everybody!"
you okay?
"he appears to be in a coma, but i'm reading unusual synaptic activity."
what happened to him?
"i don't know. i'd like to know what he's been doing the last few weeks. where he's worked, away missions."
i'll access his duty roster.
was ensign tabor wearing these when he was found?
"no, they were on the floor next to him."
i don't think they cause comas.
lights strobing at certain frequencies have been known to induce seizures. we should analyse the optical properties of this movie. when was the last time you spoke with mister tabor?
"about ten, fifteen minutes before b'elanna and i got here. he called to say the programme was up and running."
funny.
lieutenant?
"when we were in the maquis together, we used to joke that tabor must have had his own personal forcefield. he went through a dozen firefights without even getting his clothes dirty."
he's still alive. perhaps his forcefield is holding.
"commander, i've reviewed the sensor logs for the four hours tabor was in here. all systems were operating normally,safeties were online."
run a level five diagnostic on the logs.
janeway to tuvok. report to sickbay.
on my way.
"i've found several microfractures in his cranium. they're minor, but the pattern suggests he suffered a trauma of some sort. there's also evidence of subdermal contusions along his right shoulder."
this man was attacked.
"it's possible that whoever did this is still on board. go to yellow alert. tuvok, i'm putting you in charge of the investigation."
"aye, captain."
security override tuvok pi alpha.
commander.
"crewman jor. if i'm not mistaken, your quarters are on deck four."
i heard what happened to tabor. i was looking for a book to bring to him.
i'm afraid he's in no condition to read.
i was going to read to him. i've heard it helps sometimes to hear a familiar voice.
you and tabor were friends. do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt him?
i can't imagine.
could you tell me where you were from oh seven hundred to eleven hundred hours this morning?
on duty. in engineering. you can check with lieutenant torres if you like.
"that won't be necessary. thank you, crewman."
harry's found evidence that someone tampered with the holodeck sensor logs. several files have been deleted.
any signs of an outside intruder?
"no, nothing."
i believe that a member of this crew is responsible.
tabor was well-liked. what's the motive?
i have one suspect. crewman jor.
i find that hard to believe. i've known her for a long time. she and tabor were friends.
close friends. she had access to his quarters.
a close relationship is hardly a crime.
it is my experience that emotional involvements often lead to unpredictable behaviour.
"that's an opinion, not evidence."
there may be other suspects. i intend to question all crew members who had recent contact with tabor.
i'll check the internal sensors. see what else i can find.
"commander. you seem awfully convinced that one of the crew was behind this. now, you can't tell me that's the only logical conclusion, because i can think of a number of others."
"i realise that my assumptions seem premature, but i have a strong instinct about this. you might call it a hunch."
i didn't think that vulcans had hunches.
"i can't explain it, captain, but i can't ignore it either. someone on board is responsible and i intend to find out who it is."
pressure's fluctuating in one one four.
you'd better check the seals.
yosa to engineering. engineering.
hello?
"computer, seal hatch six one three beta."
unable to comply.
crewman yosa to security.
"his neocortical readings are identical to tabor's, and he has the same microfractures along his right temple."
who discovered him?
crewman jor.
"chakotay to crewman jor. jor, respond."
"computer, locate crewman jor."
crewman jor is in the mess hall.
crewman jor.
"if this keeps up, i may have to open a special coma ward."
take a look at their names. tell me if anything strikes you.
former maquis.
"it's either a coincidence, or they're being singled out."
there hasn't been any hostility between the maquis and the rest of the crew for years.
maybe someone on your crew couldn't put the past behind them.
my crew?
our crew.
"are you any closer to a diagnosis, doctor?"
"they all have the same disruptions in their synaptic pathways. the same cranial fractures, contusions. but i still don't know the cause, or how to reverse it."
your investigation?
nothing conclusive.
five crewmen in comas and we don't have a single clue?
the assailant must have access to security protocols. there is no other way he could have escaped detection.
you'd better find a way to protect the rest of the maquis. i'm running out of beds.
what is it you expect us to do?
stay alert. report anything suspicious to commander tuvok.
"i'd rather report to you, if it's all the same."
he's right. i've never trusted the vulcan. he's betrayed us before.
he was doing his job.
he didn't care about the maquis back then. why should he now?
we're not maquis anymore.
tell that to our friends in sickbay.
"oh, come on. we put our differences aside seven years ago. it's ancient history."
maybe history is repeating itself.
"look, the truth is, we don't know what we're up against. but the last thing we need right now is an outbreak of paranoia. now until we get to the bottom of this, i want you all to carry hand phasers. nobody goes anywhere alone."
we thought maybe the intruder left behind some kind of negative image.
displaced photons. tom figured that if we dampen the photonic ambience and enhance the polarity
we can applaud mister paris' ingenuity later. what have you found?
ensign tabor.
now take a look at this.
impressive.
"it doesn't tell us who the attacker was, but we do know someone else was here."
can you extrapolate the assailant's height and weight?
i'd say between a hundred seventy and a hundred ninety centimetres. maybe seventy five kilograms.
that describes about half the members of the crew.
at least we can rule out naomi wildman.
is it possible to increase the resolution?
we're already working on it.
keep me informed.
commander?
stop it. you're making me nervous.
"it doesn't make sense. this ship, with all its sensors. how could five people be attacked without leaving a trace?"
good question.
"maybe it's a conspiracy. ever since voyager began sending datastreams back home, starfleet has known that almost a quarter of the crew is maquis."
so?
maybe they think we're still dangerous. maybe they ordered the captain to neutralise the threat.
"yes, that's it. she's putting us all into stasis. the comas are just a cover story."
it would be easier than putting us all in the brig.
it could be her.
"oh, please."
"that'll be all, crewman. please send in mister kim."
i'm still trying to enhance the photon displacement.
"i appreciate your efforts, mister kim, but i called you here for another reason. in the last datastream from earth, you received a letter from someone named dennis kim."
my cousin.
"in that letter, he spoke of your mutual friend, maxwell saroyan."
you read my mail?
yes.
isn't that a violation of privacy protocols?
"as the chief of security, i have the authority to suspend those protocols under special circumstances."
and what is so special about a letter from my cousin?
the attacks began shortly after we received the last datastream. your letter was part of that transmission.
a lot of people got letters.
"twenty eight, to be exact, but only six of them matched the physical parameters of the photon displacement."
am i a suspect?
"according to the letter, your friend, mister saroyan, was killed by the maquis a number of years ago."
"you got me, tuvok. i confess. i was so distraught after hearing max's name that i fired my captain proton comatizer at every maquis i could find."
your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge.
"tuvok, it's me, harry. do you really think i'd be capable of this?"
my personal views are irrelevant.
"i learned about max's death a long time ago. i was upset, but i don't blame the maquis, and i certainly don't blame anyone on this ship. if that'll be all?"
is everything all right?
this investigation is perplexing. it defies logic.
i'll keep you posted on the holodeck analysis.
doctor to commander tuvok. report to sickbay immediately.
on my way.
i thought you might like to have a few words with mister tabor.
how did you revive him?
i didn't. his synaptic pathways stabilised on their own.
how do you feel?
"fine, sir. hungry."
what do you remember?
"not much. i was working in the holodeck, and then i was here."
was anyone in the holodeck with you?
"no, sir."
do you know why anyone would want to hurt you?
no. what's going on?
"thank you, ensign."
"crewman, i remember ordering everyone to work in pairs. where's your partner?"
"er, she's, er, er."
who's your partner?
"lieutenant torres. i told her we shouldn't split up, sir, but she said she could handle herself. you know how stubborn she can be."
i have a vague idea. do you know where she went?
"cargo bay two, sir."
"b'elanna? computer, locate lieutenant torres."
lieutenant torres is in cargo bay two.
help me get her to sickbay.
this is a holy time.
what?
security to cargo bay two.
"let the mind awaken and focus on the task. my mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts."
"ensign, run a metallurgical analysis."
"two more victims regained consciousness. crewmen yosa and jor. their bio-readings returned to normal, as if they suffered nothing worse than a good night's sleep. it doesn't make any sense."
"it is, however, a pattern, and a pattern implies purpose. we simply have to uncover it."
any clues here?
not yet.
i'm beginning to think our perpetrator is a ghost.
perhaps we should conduct a séance.
it couldn't hurt.
"i have worked meticulously, yet he has outwitted me each time."
how can you be sure it's a he?
"i can't, but i am."
another hunch?
i can almost sense his presence. it's as though he's challenging me to find him.
i'd say you're taking this a little too personally. maybe you should take a break.
no.
"you haven't slept in three days. get some rest, meditate. clear your mind."
my mind is perfectly clear.
"i don't want to make this an order, tuvok. i'll go over your scans. fresh pair of eyes might help."
captain.
resist your doubts.
don't question your mission.
filter out the polarised photons. anyone you know? tuvok.
"computer, isolate the precise time index of this image."
stardate 54090.4.
where was commander tuvok at that time?
access to that information has been restricted.
by whom?
access to that information has been restricted.
"tuvok, what's going on?"
"computer, override those security restrictions. authorisation tuvok pi alpha."
restrictions overridden.
where was commander tuvok at the specified time?
commander tuvok was in holodeck two.
"computer, based on the most recent data, can you give me a better estimation of the intruder's height?"
one hundred eighty two centimetres.
and what is the height of lieutenant commander tuvok?
one hundred eighty two centimetres.
"captain, i believe i"
ignore your doubts.
no.
"commander, lower your weapon."
"pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
who are you?
"captain, it would appear that i am the guilty party."
how is that possible?
i don't know. but for the safety of the crew you must confine me to the brig.
"he wants to speak with you, but i advise you to remain outside the forcefield."
"tuvok, can you hear me?"
i hear you. but there is another voice trying to control me.
another voice? whose? this is a holy time. what did you mean by that?
"a primal energy charges the blood, an energy of rebirth."
that's what the voice is telling you?
it's a bajoran incantation. the voice is bajoran.
we need to get you to sickbay so i can run
no! no more scans. leave me alone.
don't question your mission.
get away from me.
"what do you see, tuvok?"
the bajoran.
ignore him. focus on my voice. tell me what's happening.
"i believe i've, i've been attacking certain members of the crew. the maquis. then investigating the crimes with no memory of what i'd done."
attacking them how?
mind melds.
why?
i don't know. he is responsible. what did you do to me?
commander. commander. is he a member of the crew? then who is he?
i don't know.
"the day the first attack occurred, did anything unusual happen to you?"
i was tending to my duties. i received a letter from my son.
a letter? this all started right after we received the last datastream.
i reviewed every letter except my own.
"stay with him, doctor."
how long?
twenty nine hours. she woke up just before you did.
they've all recovered. we don't know why. it's tuvok.
tuvok?
"he's in the brig. apparently, he's being manipulated by some form of mind control. can he leave, mister paris?"
"i don't see why not, but he should wear one of these."
there's something i want to show you.
"exo-linguistics always seemed a little too theoretical to me. i've decided to study musical composition instead. i would have sent you my latest polytonal construct, but they wouldn't give me enough room in this datastream. maybe next time, i can."
a letter from his son.
we found another signal embedded in the message. a letter within a letter.
"hello, father. we received your last transmission."
"this is a holy time. b'tanay, the time of awakening. return to that dark place from which all life springs."
the signal is calibrated to correspond with vulcan synaptic frequencies. tuvok wouldn't have been consciously aware of it.
teero. teero anaydis. he was a bajoran vedek. he worked with the maquis.
doing what?
counter-intelligence. he was thrown out for experimenting with mind control. he thought it was a good way to recruit agents.
"well, apparently he was successful at recruiting our tactical officer. these incantations and symbols, they must have triggered something in tuvok. preconditioned behaviour, instructions."
i should've known you'd show up again.
commander?
teero was a fanatic. he'd go to any extreme for the maquis. he called the rest of us traitors for rejecting his ideas. swore he'd fight the war on his own if he had to.
why instruct tuvok to mind meld with voyager's maquis thirty five thousand light years from earth?
i'd like tuvok to take a look at this message. maybe it'll jog his memory.  try to decode those symbols.
it's him.
his name is teero anaydis.
teero.
he worked for maquis intelligence.
"yes, i remember meeting him. i was undercover, doing reconnaissance on a colony near the badlands. he was a vedek at the bajoran temple there."
go on.
we spoke briefly. he was interested in vulcan culture. that's all i remember.
maybe that's all he wanted you to remember. he was developing some kind of mind control technique. we think he used it on you seven years ago.
what is it?
"i, i was restrained. very frightened."
what did he do to you?
i can't remember.
try.
i can't!
"tuvok, if we're going to help you, we need to find out. the last time you meditated, it helped the memories resurface, didn't it? you've helped me meditate. i think i've learned a thing or two about the process. let me try to guide you."
where are you?
in a laboratory. underground.
is teero there?
there is someone. it's him.
describe what's happening.
lieutenant.
tuvok? tuvok?
"it is lieutenant, isn't it? i'm sure your maquis comrades would be interested to know your starfleet rank. don't worry, i don't plan to expose you."
what do you want?
you. you're the perfect subject.
for what?
"i'm a student of the mind. yours is remarkable. disciplined, orderly. on the surface, that is. beneath"
"boiling emotions, repressed violence. in a sense, you're two different men. one i could never hope to manipulate, but the other"
i have been trained to resist mind control.
"that's the rational, logical part of you at work, but i want to reach your inner fire. your spirit."
"why? wait. please, please, don't."
"pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
stay away from me!
tuvok.
complete your mission.
no!
this is a holy time.
commander.
tuvok to chakotay.
go ahead.
"pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
understood.
"janeway to chakotay. commander. pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. what did that mean, tuvok? tell me."
this is a holy time. a time of awakening.
"this teero has awakened you to do what? if you can remember, you can fight him. you can resist. what does he want?"
to give us instructions.
what kind of instructions?
focus on your task.
no.
it's chakotay.
what is it?
"i'm not sure. sickbay to commander chakotay. computer, locate chakotay."
commander chakotay is in sickbay.
"computer, deactivate the emh."
commander?
"pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
i understand.
deck one.
why were you using mind melds? what did teero want you to do?
to awaken the others.
resist your doubts.
no!
focus on me.
"complete your mission. pagh'tem'far, b'tanay."
you don't control me!
"good to see you, commander."
it's good to be back.
janeway to the bridge. report.
what the hell are you doing?
"i think it's obvious. i'm taking control of your ship. within the hour all starfleet personnel will be locked in their quarters. step back in the brig, kathryn."
what's teero done to you?
he simply helped us remember who we are. we're maquis. we've always been maquis.
the rebellion ended three years ago. you know that.
"in the alpha quadrant, maybe. not on this ship."
torres to chakotay.
go ahead.
deck eleven is secure.
acknowledged.
"we're thirty five light years from earth, chakotay. no one out here even knows about the maquis. it doesn't make sense. there's nothing you can accomplish."
"as long as we exist, so does the rebellion."
"that's teero talking. he was unstable, you said so yourself."
we have no intention of hurting any of you.
"your orders, captain?"
take your station.
"captain's log, stardate 54101. voyager is now under my command. we're en route to an m class planet where we'ill relocate the starfleet crew."
we're in range.
on screen. looks like a nice place for a federation colony. take us into orbit.
"tuvok, would you mind joining me in the ready room?"
"you wished to see me, captain?"
you can drop the formalities. this is a maquis ship now. vulcan brandy. i thought we'd have a drink to celebrate.
a fitting gesture.
to awakenings.
awakenings.
there are still twenty three of our former comrades who aren't with us yet. i was hoping you'd be able to help persuade them.
i'm prepared to mind meld with the remaining maquis to convey teero's instructions.
"it'll be nice to have my old crew back. you've been a big help to us, tuvok, but i can't forget what happened seven years ago. you have a history of betraying the maquis."
it won't happen again.
"we have a small crew. i have to be able to trust everyone, especially my tactical officer."
bring her in.
consider this a test of your loyalty. it's set to kill.
you said you wouldn't hurt anyone.
"you're in control of your actions. not chakotay, not teero."
tuvok?
don't do this.
this phaser is defective.
take her back to the brig.
you passed.
"now, we've got some tactical issues to review. i want to re-route all weapons control to my console."
my mind to your mind. my thoughts to your thoughts.
kim and paris engineered a little breakout on deck six. we've contained them all behind a forcefield.
we should begin the evacuation.
"start beaming them down. begin on deck two, section zero one."
belay that order. tuvok informed me that this planet has an unstable atmosphere. go to astrometrics and scan for an alternative.
what are you talking about? there's nothing wrong with the atmosphere.
we don't have time to debate this.
"i can scan from here. chakotay, what's going on?"
stand down.
your weapon.
i thought you might like your ship back.
no more rebellion?
"it took another mind meld with tuvok, but i'm fine."
"tuvok, you're all right."
"i am in control again, captain."
"whatever you said to him, it worked."
"it's good to have you back, commander."
all ready for attack of the lobster people?
i am not familiar with that species.
"you will be, soon enough."
i haven't completed my security rounds.
you have now.
buttered or unbuttered?
"thank you, neelix."
i saved you a seat.
how long is this entertainment?
i'm not sure. tom said something about a double feature. i've been meaning to ask you. how did you know that phaser wasn't charged?
chakotay doubted my loyalty. he wouldn't have given me an active weapon.
not exactly ironclad logic.
call it a hunch.
remind me to pay more attention to your hunches.
shush!
"trauma team four to level red. trauma team four to level red. code four nursing unit, report to level red"
"no, he does have a sensor. it's not working."
"negative for dysplasia, viremia, necrobiosis. please extend your arms. species, dralian. identity, gar. tc fifteen. you may proceed."
chellick. lucky i caught you.
mister gar. i wish i had time to talk.
"well, all you have to do is listen. i have a new supply of cytogenics."
"your last supply was useless. expired lots, diluted samples."
"oh, i have something special this time."
"the latest in substandard technology, no doubt."
"oh, this item is far from substandard. and as a gesture of goodwill, i'm offering it to you first."
we don't need another neural monitor.
this is much more sophisticated than that.
i'm sure it has some ingenious use but i'm not interested.
please state the nature of the medical emergency? where have you taken me?
it's a holographic construct programmed with over five million medical protocols.
i demand to be returned to voyager at once.
what's voyager?
the federation starship to which i'm assigned. this man is a kidnapper.
i would never offer you stolen property. i traded warp-grade dilithium for this programme.
what's your price?
this negotiation is pointless. i'm not about to perform medical services for a pair of common thieves.
it doesn't seem to be in working order.
trauma victims are now arriving at emergency intake seven.
what caused their injuries?
a generator explosion at the gammadan mining facility.
"you'd better start cooperating, or i will dismantle your programme and sell it off one subroutine at a time."
when captain janeway discovers what you've done
"come on, let's go. clear a path. here we go. tuck him in there."
we haven't got any coagulants.
somebody check the reserves.
there are no reserves.
this one's got grade four pulmonary burns.
patient's tc is four. transfer to level green.
green isn't equipped for this.
his tc's only four. take him to green.
don't touch that. this patient's bleeding seriously. he needs an immediate infusion.
what are you doing? get away from him.
with technology this primitive you may as well be using leeches.
who is this man?
"a doctor, of sorts. i thought you were withholding your services."
"fortunately for these patients, i am programmed with the hippocratic oath. it requires me to treat anyone who's ill. this patient needs twenty milligrams anesthizine. get me a hypospray."
a what?
"i'm sorry, this may hurt a little."
did you have to programme that nausicaan guard to high stick so much?
"well, you play hockey, you got to expect a few lumps."
what are we going to tell the doctor? you know how he feels about our juvenile holoprogrammes.
relax. i'll come up with something.
"hey, doc."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"i know what you're thinking, but there's a simple explanation. tell him, tom."
"right. well, er, see, doc, we were running these invasion scenarios, when this species of proto-humanoid."
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"are you okay, doc?"
please take an analgesic and return in twenty four hours.
it's a replicated fake.
the programme running in sickbay is from one of doc's old training files.
i want someone to tell me how this snake oil salesman managed to evade every security protocol on the ship.
i take full responsibility.
i'm not interested in fault. i just want to know how it happened.
"ah, gar spend the night in sickbay. he claimed to have gotten food poisoning at dinner."
he had plenty of time to learn about the mobile emitter from the doctor.
who i'm sure was more than willing to extol its virtues.
medical logs show the training file was activated just before gar left voyager.
"scan for his ion trail. and lets review safeguards for accessing low-security files, shall we, mister tuvok?"
"captain, don't blame tuvok for what happened. it was my fault."
how so?
gar kept complaining how bland his dinner was so i added a few exotic spices.
i'm not sure i see your point.
i was trying so hard to create something he liked that i didn't take his alien physiology into account. everyone's assuming he faked his illness but i might have really made him sick.
it's not as if your cooking turned him into a thief.
"no. but if he hadn't gone to sickbay, he may never have come up with a plan to kidnap the doctor, much less have the opportunity to do it."
"in my experience, neelix, men like gar have no trouble finding opportunities to take advantage of other people."
i just hope there's something i can do to help find the doctor.
"when and if that opportunity arises, i'm sure you'll make the most of it."
that was the most impressive cortical bypass i've ever seen.
it's just a question of possessing the basic skills.
"if i had basic skills like yours, they'd move me up to level blue. take this patient to yellow."
"you seem a little low on resources here. if i could contact my medical staff, i might be able get you some additional supplies."
communication is usually restricted but the allocator might give you clearance.
good. where can i find him?
the allocator isn't a him. it's our main computer.
"well, perhaps it could establish a communications link with voyager's main computer."
you'll have to submit a formal request to chellick and support it with form eight three w in triplicate. even then.
why hasn't this patient been treated yet?
he's waiting for proton imaging. there are a lot of other people ahead of him.
it's nice to see someone knows what's going on. what's your name?
tebbis.
"well, tebbis, this doesn't look too serious."
it's just a little osteal extravasation.
excellent diagnosis.
i hope to be a doctor someday.
"really? well, i hope your working conditions are better than these."
it wouldn't be so bad if they'd let us listen to music.
it would certainly improve my mood.
it's not just that. music has great healing power.
i couldn't agree with you more.
exhale slowly.
can't you give him a neural blocker?
he's already had his allocation.
the leg injury isn't all i'm picking up. he's got some kind of systemic disease.
it's a chromo-viral infection. we have twelve cases down here. he's in the final stage.
is there an established treatment?
cytoglobin injections.
these scans don't show any cytoglobin in his bloodstream.
he hasn't been given any.
why not?
he doesn't have a high enough tc.
tc? what's that?
"ah, there you are. i'm happy to report that i've acquired your programme from gar. please come with me."
"i will not. may i remind you i'm being illegally detained, or hasn't the rule of law reached this society yet?"
we follow the allocator's rules. and it's determined that your services are required on level blue.
"please, doctor. the allocator knows which patients need help the most."
"level blue is your critical care area, i presume."
level blue is the area where it's most critical that we provide excellent care.
these patients will be your chief responsibility from now on. do whatever you can to make them well.
why are these patients getting preferential treatment?
they have a higher tc than the others.
indulge me. what's tc?
treatment coefficient. the allocator assigns one to every patient. it determines the level of care they receive.
how is this coefficient derived?
"through a complex formula that involves profession, skills, accomplishments."
how is any of that relevant to medical treatment?
an agricultural engineer is obviously more important than a waste processor.
important to whom?
"society. when your resources are limited, you have to prioritise."
so you base treatment on whether patients have particular abilities?
it's much more complicated than that. the allocator assesses the entire individual.
and reduces his life to a number.
"it may seem impersonal, but it's what the dinaali have contracted us to do."
"chellick's people are known throughout the sector for their administrative skills. before they came here, we were a dying race. eco-disasters, famine."
"doctor dysek, chief of medicine. the medical hologram i told you about."
are you in charge of what passes for care on level red? because those people are suffering.
intriguing technology. can we use him to treat patients yet?
that's what he's here for.
"in some societies, it's considered rude to refer to someone in the third person while he's standing in front of you."
i'm sure you'll make good use of him.
the warp trail ends here. gar should be directly ahead.
all stop. red alert. on screen.
it's emitting a false warp signature.
looks we've underestimated mister gar again.
now what?
there may be another way to find him.
what do you have in mind?
"he traded us high-grade iridium, which has a very brief half-life. his ship is slow. logic suggests he acquired the substance within a radius of three light years."
cross-reference our sensor logs and long range scans.
"two planets, no atmosphere or technology, a t class nebula. here's something. an asteroid with approximately two hundred humanoid lifesigns. subterranean structures."
sounds like a mining operation.
"if that's where mister gar acquired the iridium, they may be able to help us find him."
"tom, how fast can you get us there?"
less than two hours.
do it.
we're being hailed.
open a channel.
i want my iridium back now.
i beg your pardon?
i've scanned your ship. i know you've got it on board.
yes. we obtained it from a man called gar. a merchant
you mean thief.
so you have had the pleasure of meeting him.
he was here two days ago. he sold us three thousand induction units. he was gone a day before we realised he'd also stolen twenty kilos of ore.
we had a similar experience. maybe we can help each other.
how?
do you have any idea where we might find him?
will you return my iridium?
"by all means, but gar only traded us half of what he stole from you. however, we might be able to get the rest of it back."
all i can tell you is that the induction units came from a planetoid called velos.
you may go.
your surgical technique is impressive.
well. you've obviously had experience with cellular repair.
"as a matter of fact, i've done extensive research on the subject. i'd be happy to share it with you, but we'll have to contact voyager to get it."
you'll have to discuss that with chellick. he authorises all communications. it's time for this patient's next injection.
"requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient b three, priority blue seven gamma."
one cytoglobin injection authorised.
does this patient have a chromo-viral infection?
no. why?
i was told cytoglobin is the standard treatment for that disease.
cytoglobin also prevents arterial aging.
will that be all?
you may go.
this patient's arteries appear to be healthy.
at the moment. but daily injections increase life expectancy up to forty percent. we prescribe them for all level blue patients.
i just saw a boy on level red who's dying. this medicine could save his life.
this woman is a chief engineer of an irrigation facility which provides water to half the subcontinent.
so her life is more valuable?
keeping her healthy contributes to our survival. can you say the same for the boy on level red?
who knows what he'll accomplish if he has the chance.
"if he becomes more valuable to society, his tc will rise, and then he'll receive better treatment."
he may not be around long enough.
"i'm sorry he's sick, but our society is much better off since we began following the allocator's protocols."
some of you are.
i never expected to see you again.
why do you say that?
level blue is much more prestigious.
prestige is the least of my concerns. how is he?
not well.
his condition's deteriorated so rapidly.
his coenzyme allotment's been reduced.
"are we here to help these people, or kill them?"
his tc is just too low.
maybe we can raise it.
that's not possible.
"if it's purely a function of statistics, we can simply input more data."
we're not authorised to do that.
"voje, when you look at your patient lying there, you have to ask yourself what can i do? what must i do? we can amend his database to include additional skills."
such as?
his extensive knowledge of neutronics.
he doesn't know anything about neutronics.
we can say he does. what's the harm in trying?
amend patient r twelve's tc to include an expertise in neutronics.
unable to verify. amendment denied.
you see?
hello.
lie still.
what are you doing?
trying to get you the proper medication.
you're wasting time you could be spending with other patients.
you have as much right to treatment as anyone.
it's not your fault.
there's nothing you can do.
nurse?
"yes, doctor?"
why hasn't this patient received her additional cytoglobin injection?
additional?
"if you'd examined her chart, you'd see that i've increased her dosage."
doctor dysek didn't say anything.
doctor dysek is at home with his family. would you like me to contact him so you can explain why you're not doing your job?
"no, doctor. requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient b three, priority blue seven gamma."
one cytoglobin injection authorised.
i'll do it myself.
can i assist you?
you may go.
he convinced me to let him take the induction units on consignment. that was more than ten days ago. i haven't heard from him since.
"you appear to be an experienced merchant, mister kipp. why would you trust someone like gar?"
he came highly recommended.
by whom?
a buyer i know. he said he's been trading with gar for years.
do you know where we can find this buyer?
"yes, captain. i am the fool who said that gar could be trusted."
sounds like you've changed your mind.
"i should have known it was a mistake but, well, you see, i have never been able to say no to my wife."
what does she have to do with it?
"well, she's the one who asked me to recommend gar."
then she must know him well.
"they're, er, friends."
may we speak with her?
"she's, er. well, she's not here."
do you know where we might find her?
she left me.
"you're a woman. you saw my husband with your own eyes. overweight, depressed. you would have left him too, especially if you had met someone as exciting as gar."
"yes, he's very exciting."
"that's why you're looking for him, isn't it? you want him for yourself."
"i assure you, i have no romantic interest in him whatsoever."
why? not good enough for you?
"no, it's not that, it's just that"
i already have a man.
we have a business opportunity for mister gar. one that will expire if we don't find him soon.
"he's on his way to the gambling tournament on selek four. when you see him, tell him to hurry home."
how are you feeling?
better.
that's what happens when you get the proper treatment.
but i'm not authorised to receive cytoglobin.
"you are now. you'll need several more injections, but you can expect a complete recovery."
"whatever you did, they'll find out. they'll punish you."
you're assuming i've done something illicit.
didn't you?
"of course not. i simply had a talk with chellick, explained to him what a bright young man you are, and he had the allocator recalculate your tc."
i've never met a doctor like you.
"well, it's not hard to stand out when the general level of competence is so low."
there are patients on this level who deserve a higher tc than i do. could you talk to chellick about them?
thank you.
"ah, voje. you're not busy, are you?"
"well, actually, i was just"
i want you to help me dispense these injections.
where did you get the cytoglobin?
"level blue, where else."
you stole it?
i prefer to think of it as reallocation. we're going to treat every chromo-virus patient on this level.
do you have any idea what kind of trouble we could get into?
we? then you will help me.
"no, absolutely not. modifying data files was bad enough."
"well, i certainly wouldn't want you to do anything to compromise your ethics."
i'll help you.
you should be in bed.
"actually, now that he's improving a little, activity will do him good. you can go back to doing whatever you were doing."
"the best place to inject him is here, in the lateral artery."
excellent work. it's nice to see someone in this hospital has a future as a healer.
"if we each take a third of the patients, maybe we can finish before someone catches us."
"who do you think you are, prescribing unnecessary medications for my patients?"
it wasn't unnecessary.
"if you believe that, you're incompetent. or perhaps malfunctioning."
i was simply trying to increase our allocation of resources.
what are you talking about?
"i did some checking. last month, level blue's total medication requests were down by six percent."
because our cure rate was higher.
"exactly. because you performed so efficiently last month, the allocator will determine you're able to do with less next month. if we don't order more medication now, we may not get it when we need it. think about it, doctor. if you don't have the proper resources, your cure rate could go down. if that happens, the allocator may assign you to a lower level."
are we having a problem with our newest piece of technology?
"actually, he seems to be learning the system quite well."
three of the patients we injected are practically virus free.
what did you expect?
maybe we could reallocate other medications. treat more patients.
"now you're thinking like a doctor. and to support your efforts, i've arranged for resources from level blue to be diverted here on a regular basis."
how did you manage that?
let's just say doctor dysek and i have developed a professional rapport. sometimes i even surprise myself.
we may actually make these people better.
"that feeling you get from healing someone. infectious, isn't it?"
where did you get that?
"one of the technicians was going to recycle it because it wasn't working, but i think i fixed it."
"it seems to be in good condition, and so do you. you'll be well enough to leave soon."
couldn't you say i'm still sick?
don't you want to go home?
"if i do, they'll send me to work in the refinery with my father."
what about school? your medical training?
i would never be authorised for that.
he's right.
"if i stay here, you can teach me, and i can help you treat your patients."
"i'm not planning on being here that long, myself."
then i can help doctor voje.
we'll see what we can do.
"i have picked up gar's ship, directly ahead."
again?
i'm reading his biosigns.
any sign of the doctor or his emitter?
not yet.
should i hail gar?
"if we let him know we're here, he may try to slip away."
we could drop out of warp at close range and grab him before he knows what's happening.
"i like it. tom, tuvok."
he's hailing.
i guess we put him in the mood to talk. on screen.
"i thought we were friends, captain. why am i being treated this way? i think i deserve better."
where's our doctor?
i have no idea. i certainly hope nothing's happened to him.
scans are complete. neither the mobile emitter nor the doctor's programme are aboard gar's ship.
"well, of course they're not."
he's trying to destabilise the tractor beam with a feedback pulse.
compensating.
"don't bother, harry. just beam him to the brig."
"tebbis, wake up. time to make our rounds."
locate patient r twelve.
patient r twelve has been transferred to level white.
tebbis has been moved.
i know.
what's level white? some kind of patient recovery area?
it's the morgue.
i demand an explanation for the death of that boy.
i'm responsible for thousands of patients. you'll have to be more specific.
"his name was tebbis, patient r twelve."
acute chromo-viral disease.
he was recovering.
"apparently, he developed complications."
what kind of complications?
a secondary infection. it spread rapidly.
how was it treated?
it wasn't. the patient had exceeded his medication allotment. it seems someone had given him unauthorised injections. did you think i wouldn't find out?
don't you have any ethical standards?
"you are hardly in a position to speak to me of ethics. lying, stealing. any other crimes you wish to confess?"
i was trying to save lives.
and i am trying to save a society. do you really think patient r twelve is going to help me do that?
his name was tebbis.
he wasn't contributing. he was a drain on resources.
you're not just rationing health care here. you're getting rid of the sick and the weak.
"if the boy had been fit, he would have survived."
why don't you just put a phaser to their heads?
"we're healers, not killers."
i'm going to expose you.
"to whom, the people who employ me? they brought me here to make the hard choices they don't want to make. from now on, i'm restricting you to level blue. you've done enough damage on red."
"you mean those patients that i treated? yes, that was inconsiderate of me."
it was. you managed to exceed their annual medication allotment in a matter of days. they're being sent home.
they'll die.
you should have considered the consequences of your actions.
"please, don't make them suffer for my mistakes. it won't happen again."
"i'm making certain of that. from now on, your time will be strictly regulated."
meaning what?
"i've interfaced your holomatrix with the allocator. starting now, it will determine where you go, when you go and what you do when you get there."
the medical hologram will now commence treatment on level blue.
you have six minutes to treat patient b three.
i don't know where he is.
"not now, perhaps, but you know where you took him."
the last time i saw him he was in your sickbay.
"if you refuse to cooperate, your knowledge of his location can be extracted."
how?
a mind meld.
what's that?
an invasive and disturbing procedure.
dinnertime!
"mister neelix, i am in the middle of an interrogation."
"commander, you know better than anyone that starfleet has strict guidelines about allowing prisoners to eat."
very well. i'll wait.
"there we are. i'm glad to see you enjoying a meal. when you got sick last time i thought my food was to blame, until i realised it was just a ruse for you to get close to the doctor. i used talaxian wormroot as the base. i'm glad you like it. some people react badly."
react how?
"oh, dear, i hope you're not getting sick. if it's the wormroot, it's going to get a lot worse."
what have you done to me?
"the usual symptoms are abdominal spasms, which increase in severity for thirty hours. forty at the most."
tuvok to sickbay.
"don't worry mister tuvok, it's not fatal. it's horribly unpleasant, but there's an antidote."
then give it to me.
"unfortunately, our doctor is the only one authorised to administer it. maybe if you remembered where he was?"
"mister neelix, have you deliberately poisoned this man?"
relax. he's just having gas pains.
your actions are not only against regulations
didn't i hear someone threaten a mind meld?
i was merely trying to encourage the suspect to be more forthcoming.
i think he's getting all the encouragement he needs.
"excuse me, doctor."
what is it?
i need to prepare this patient for discharge.
i'm not finished with him yet.
but chellick's orders are to
"are to discharge the patient at the end of the shift. the shift isn't over, is it?"
"no, sir, but i need time in order to"
i'll tell you when he's ready.
"doctor voje, report to level blue to assist doctor dysek in surgery."
voje.
i didn't realise that any of this even existed.
i need to talk to you.
i don't have time. i just got a message from the allocator that dysek needs me.
i'm the one who sent for you. i used his access codes.
oh.
i need you to smuggle my mobile emitter off level blue.
time has expired for treatment of patient b one. proceed to patient b three. the medical hologram has one minute to treat patient b three.
you have to help me.
twelve patients on level red are being sent home because of you.
that's why we have to hurry. we may still be able to save them.
you've already endangered my patients and now you're asking me to risk my career? why should i help you?
because i have a plan to heal those patients. that's what doctors do. we heal. so choose. what kind of doctor are you going to be?
the medical hologram has thirty seconds to deactivation.
do you hear that?
how can i get you off this level?
deactivate my mobile emitter and put it in inside this selenide medkit. it'll shield the signature.
and then what?
take it to level red and reactivate me.
what are you going to do once you get to level red?
the medical hologram has ten seconds to deactivation.
there's no time to explain. you'll have to trust me.
i suspect young doctor voje helped you escape.
he had nothing to do with it.
no matter. you're becoming far too troublesome. i'm going to have to deactivate your programme.
voje!
what's wrong with him? what are you doing?
a little experiment in empathy.
you told me you were just developing new treatment protocols.
"a single protocol, actually."
you're only making things worse for yourself.
"as a matter of fact, i'm making things worse for you. i'm going to make you a patient in your own hospital."
what was in that injector?
a neural blocker combined with the same virus that afflicted tebbis.
i trusted you.
"and tebbis trusted me. you remember tebbis, don't you? patient r twelve? maybe this will jog your memory."
what are you doing?
"patient r twelve. species, dinaal. identity, tebbis."
this is ridiculous. i'm not tebbis!
but the allocator thinks you are.
how did you
"simple, the allocator identifies patients by reading blood factors. i altered chellick's by injecting him with antigens from tebbis. now, why don't we see if we can get your condition treated? requesting one cytoglobin injection for patient r twelve."
treatment denied.
i order you to medicate me now.
"ordinarily, i would. but if the allocator says no."
is this some sort of revenge?
not revenge. leverage. i want enough cytoglobin to cure every infected patient on this level.
we don't have an adequate supply.
there's plenty on level blue.
where it's being used to prevent arterial aging.
"those patients will survive without it, but a dozen people on this level won't. i will not let them die."
entering orbit.
scan for the doctor's signature.
he's dying.
"as soon as we get the cytoglobin we'll be able to treat all the level red patients, including him."
you said it yourself. doctors heal. we don't make patients sick.
i don't know any other way to help these people.
"doctor voje, i need the medicine now."
"sir, i only have a level red clearance. you know i'm not authorised."
then find someone who is.
i've got him. he's aboard a vessel above the northern continent.
can you get a lock?
it's not going to be easy. his programme seems to be interfaced with the main computer.
hail the ship.
"they're responding, audio only."
"this is hospital ship four two, allocation module alpha."
this is captain janeway of the starship voyager. i would like to speak with someone regarding a member of my crew who is aboard your vessel.
administrator chellick is currently unavailable.
then may i speak with someone else?
only administrator chellick is authorised to communicate with alien species.
are we having a problem here?
dysek. finally.
i'm sorry. i had to tell him.
what are you waiting for? give me the cytoglobin.
i don't think i can.
what are you saying?
cytoglobin isn't authorised for level red patients.
dysek!
i don't want to break the rules.
i made the rules!
then you should be pleased i hold them in such high regard.
"i'm sorry, captain. i can't transport him without damaging his matrix."
then you'll have to go down there and get him.
"aye, captain."
chakotay.
don't tell me you're allied with this defective hologram.
"no, but he has given me insight into some of the intricacies of our system. for example, did you know if i don't request enough resources for level blue this month, i won't get what i need next month?"
what are you talking about?
"you know, doctor, one way to increase your allocation of resources on level blue would be to increase the number of patients. i know at least a dozen people who should be treated for arterial aging. saving their lives would be just a side effect."
hmm. perhaps we should have them transferred to level blue.
"if you're looking for a second opinion, i concur."
"well, chellick, what do you think?"
it's absurd.
we'd have to transfer you to level blue as well. you'd get your cytoglobin.
doctor.
it's nice to see some friendly faces.
we're going to get you out of here.
who do we talk to about accessing the main computer?
i'll be with you in a moment. i'm with a patient. do we have an agreement?
yes.
you've managed to stay well while i was away. i'm giving you a clean bill of health.
you were only away four days.
"a lot can happen in four days. injuries, infections, malfunctions."
"as you said, i'm fine. thank you."
i was wondering if you'd mind doing me a favour? i'd like you to give me a check-up.
have you been experiencing problems?
"no. but as you said, i've been off the ship for a while, interfaced with an alien computer."
your programme appears to be operating within normal parameters.
really? what about over the past several days?
there's no indication of diminished capacity.
no problems with my ethical subroutines?
none.
i see.
you seem disappointed.
"while i was aboard that ship, i poisoned a man."
deliberately?
yes. i was trying to force him to let me treat patients who were dying.
you were prepared to sacrifice an individual to benefit a collective.
"no offence, seven, but i don't exactly aspire to borg ideals."
"you were hoping your behaviour was the result of a malfunction. i'm sorry doctor, but i must give you a clean bill of health."
there he is. the man of the hour.
you sure are in a good mood.
"well, rumour has it you snared the latest datastream last night."
"technically, it was this morning. oh two hundred, to be exact."
"so, where's my mail, hmm? oh, don't tell me you lost another one."
i didn't lose last month's datastream. it never arrived.
so what's the hold up this time?
the transmission was a little larger than usual. it's jammed the transceivers. seven and i have been up all night trying to download it.
"harry, we can't go another month without mail."
"oh, you won't. trust me."
any luck?
i've determined why we've been having difficulties.
a hologram. the transceiver wasn't designed to store photonic data. we have to get it out of there before it degrades.
what are you doing?
tying the transceiver into the holodeck's pattern buffer.
those systems aren't compatible. you'll depolarise the relays.
starfleet wouldn't have sent this hologram if it weren't important. i'm sure it's worth a few burnt-out relays.
you've overloaded the transceiver.
but i saved the hologram.
"okay, ready when you are."
lieutenant barclay?
"er, no, but he did design me. i'm a walking, talking, problem-solving interactive hologram. you can call me reg."
"it's nice to meet you, reg."
"the pleasure's mine, captain. harry, seven. i've been looking forward to working with you."
you have?
"i know, you were expecting letters from your friends and families. but with any luck, in a few days you'll be seeing them face to face. in three days' time, voyager is going to be passing through grid eight nine eight, a sector of space occupied by a red giant star."
sensors detected it a few days ago.
"at this very moment, a team of federation scientists is orbiting another red giant in the alpha quadrant. in seventy two hours, they will target its magnetic field with a verteron beam, creating a geodesic fold. as a result, a corresponding fold will open here in the magnetic field of the red giant that voyager is approaching. space will be punctured at these two points, creating a gateway between the quadrants."
"our shields are useless against geodesic radiation. we toyed with the idea of opening a fold ourselves, but it didn't take us long to realise we wouldn't survive the trip."
a lot's happened in geodesic research since you've been gone. i've brought schematics for shield upgrades to deflect the radiation from the fold. medical technology to provide additional protection for the crew. we've thought of everything.
starfleet never mentioned you in any of the previous datastreams.
"well, lieutenant barclay didn't want to raise your hopes in case the plan didn't live up to expectations. but lucky for you, it surpassed them."
what about last month's datastream? why didn't we receive it?
pathfinder tried sending an unabridged version of my programme. it overloaded the midas array.
the only casualty this time was our transceiver.
"if everything goes according to plan, you won't need it anymore."
"if we were to attempt this, you'd need access to areas of this ship that aren't equipped with holo-emitters."
"not to worry, captain. we've thought of that too."
my emitter is your emitter.
"computer, transfer the barclay hologram to the mobile emitter."
transfer complete.
"on lieutenant barclay's behalf, i thank you."
"just make sure to return it when we get to earth. ha, ha, ha."
"we're ready for you in the briefing room, captain."
"excuse us, doctor."
"i'm sure you have a full day planned, but if you have time, i'd like to get better acquainted."
i'll stop by the first chance i get.
you'll know where to find me.
"this is our destination, red giant two three one three nine. the geodesic fold will open here, adjacent to the giant's northern pole. we'll have exactly sixteen seconds to take voyager through."
reg has prepared a list of assignments. i expect you to give him your full cooperation.
"mister paris, you have the honour of plotting our course to big red two. lieutenant torres, commander tuvok, i'd like you to start working on shield modifications. and in the meantime, i've asked the doctor to prepare a series of inoculations that will protect the crew from the radiation."
we should discuss the possibility of applying borg technology to starfleet's plan. it could increase our chances of success.
i look forward to hearing your thoughts.
how long before the transceiver's back online?
no more than two hours.
then we'll still have time to transmit a response to starfleet.
keep us posted. i'd like to send lieutenant barclay a little thank you note for all his hard work.
"is there anything i can do, reg?"
your job might be the most important one of all. the next few days will be difficult. the crew will be working extremely long hours. they're going to need an experienced morale officer to keep their spirits high.
you can count on me.
"if this were any other ship, i'd have my doubts. but this is voyager, the miracle ship. you've survived six years in the delta quadrant. you've evaded the kazon, the vidiians, the hirogen, you've even faced down the borg. i think, with a little teamwork, we can pull off one more miracle and take voyager home."
i can taste my mom's cooking.
"don't forget what the hologram said, harry. this is voyager."
the miracle ship.
not when it comes to getting us home. our shortcuts have a tendency to blow up in our faces.
that's looking on the bright side.
remember arturis and his quantum slipstream drive? or how about the telepathic pitcher plant that made us think we were on our way home right before it tried to eat the ship?
this is the best opportunity we've had.
"yeah, which is why we'll probably end up in the gamma quadrant."
i'll remind you of that when we get back to earth.
don't say i didn't warn you.
"when a borg cube enters a transwarp conduit, it's subject to extreme gravimetric shear. to compensate, the borg project a structural integrity field ahead of the cube. by modifying voyager's deflector, we may be able to do the same."
"no one at starfleet would have thought of this. so, what's the first thing you're going to do when you get back?"
"begin repairs to voyager. even with the structural integrity field, it's likely the ship will suffer significant damage."
"yes, of course, but there are people at utopia planitia who will take care of that. there are engineering crews and technicians."
are you implying that i'm superfluous?
"of course not. i only meant that, if you're too busy working, you're going to miss all the welcome home hoopla. starfleet's planning parties, ceremonies and speeches. there's, there's a ticker-tape parade down market street."
i won't be attending any of those events.
"but, you'd be the guest of honour."
"when i first arrived on voyager, it was difficult for the crew to accept me. i'm anticipating a similar welcome on earth."
"you don't have any idea, do you? i didn't mention this earlier. i didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. you are the one who people are most looking forward to seeing."
that's difficult to believe.
why?
i was borg.
"exactly. you were borg. but you escaped, and despite incredible odds, you managed to reclaim your humanity. no one's ever done that before. you're famous."
fame is irrelevant.
maybe. but you've given hope to everyone who's ever lost somebody to the borg. you've inspired millions.
"if you think my participation in the hoopla would be beneficial to others, then i'll comply."
"is this going to take much longer, reg?"
"well, the computer is still inputting data. that should do it. right. computer, display the intended trajectory of the datastream transmitted at oh six hundred this morning. now, display the actual trajectory, and identify the termination point."
the trajectory ends in sector three nine five.
"four two, grid eight. does that sound familiar? that's exactly where the datastream dissipated last month. there is something there. there is something preventing the datastream from reaching voyager. er, a micro-wormhole, a radiogenic field."
long range scans didn't pick up anything unusual.
"still, we could send a ship to investigate. we could confirm my theory."
"what about my theory, reg? the hologram was too complex. it caused the datastreams to degrade before they reached their destination."
"well, to be honest i, i don't agree. the truth is, we don't know what happened to my hologram."
"then let's stick to what we do know. for the second month in a row, we tried sending your hologram to voyager. and for the second month in a row, it failed to get there."
"and i want to know why, so it doesn't happen a third time."
it won't happen a third time. next month we go back to standard transmissions.
"but a holographic matrix carries twice the information, interact with the crew."
"admiral paris wants us to send more practical data, like tactical upgrades, letters from the crew's families."
"but, pete."
sending a hologram to voyager was a good idea but it didn't work. it's time to move on.
and this is the research lab where most of pathfinder's homework gets done. all the datastreams are compressed here and then transmitted all the way to the delta quadrant. your teacher tells me you've been studying some of the delta quadrant races that voyager's described to us. who can name one for me?
the talaxians.
very good.
the ocampa.
that's right. who else?
the borg! the borg! they assimilated my hologram. that's how it disappeared.
"reg, now isn't the time."
"look at this. last month, a spacecraft passed within twenty metres of the midas array just hours before we sent the first hologram."
what is your point?
"twenty metres. it's awfully close, don't you think?"
ensign.
"the borg must have sent a transwarp probe to steal my hologram. maybe because they, they thought that it was carrying anti-borg technology to voyager."
"it wasn't the borg, reg."
then it was the romulans using a cloaked ship. they've been curious about voyager for years.
that is enough.
"but, you"
"i am sorry your idea didn't work, but i can't have you going off on a tangent. not again. you'll be no good to pathfinder or voyager. how much leave do you have saved up?"
"not that much. fifty, maybe sixty days."
take a week. go home. try to relax.
"but, pete!"
"no! that was not a request, lieutenant."
maybe i'll go somewhere. take a vacation.
now that is the most sensible thing i've heard you say all day. my cousin has a beach house in malaysia. she'd be happy to lend it to you.
"thanks, er, but i have someplace else in mind."
"you, you wanted to see me?"
"i've been going over the instructions from starfleet medical. as far as i can tell, their new inoculations aren't much different from run-of-the-mill radiogenic vaccines. i don't think they'll protect the crew."
did you try incorporating the synthetic antigen?
"yes, but it only improved the resistance by ten percent."
that should be enough.
"we can't afford to be cavalier, reg. if these treatments don't work, the crew will wind up liquefied."
you're forgetting that the inoculations aren't designed to work alone. they were intended to work in combination with the shield modifications. it's the medicinal ying to the shield's yang.
and what if the yang doesn't work?
"that's not going to happen. now, listen. lieutenant barclay has a special affinity for this crew. so do i. i promise you, we won't let them down."
"of course you won't. tell me, do you also share lieutenant barclay's affinity for golf?"
we have identical handicaps.
"well, if you're not busy later, perhaps we can play nine holes on the holodeck."
"it's tempting, but i still have a few dozen progress reports to look over."
"in that case, maybe you could look over them here so that i could borrow the mobile emitter."
"providing that the rest of the day's work goes smoothly, consider it yours."
i thought it was mine.
commander chakotay tells me that you finished repairing the transceiver.
we were just about to send the captain's reply to lieutenant barclay.
do you have enough room to include a progress report from me?
i think we can squeeze that in.
"computer, download barclay hologram file zero one to the datablock."
download complete.
transmitting.
it's about time.
"greetings from the delta quadrant, lieutenant. you'll be happy to know that your hologram reached us safely."
get to the important part.
and we've begun to implement starfleet's.
"in accordance with the seventy fourth rule of acquisition, knowledge equals profit, i've enclosed the specifications you've requested. see you soon."
"oh, look at those hands. i bet she gives great oo-mox."
too bad she'll be dead when she gets here.
forget the hands. show me the nanoprobes. how many are there?
three point six million.
that's twenty percent more than we predicted.
three point six million nanoprobes at six bars of latinum per unit that comes to.
more profit than we ever dreamed of.
"your drinks, sir."
thank you.
"something to drink, ma'am?"
"i'm fine, thanks."
are you sure? i've got a chocolate passion punch with your name on it.
reg?
surprise! where's commander riker?
he doesn't arrive until friday.
oh.
"the question is, what are you doing here?"
i just had some time off. your letter made this place sound fun. i just thought i'd join you.
do you have any idea how inappropriate it is to follow your therapist on vacation.
"please, they might be watching."
who?
"the borg, the romulans. i'm not sure yet. please, deanna, i need your help."
"commander harkins is usually willing to hear me out, but this time he wouldn't even look at my evidence"
"i'm not sure any of this qualifies as evidence, reg."
"you don't believe me, either. you think i'm imagining this, just like pete."
"the last time i saw you, you were laughing, telling jokes. you even sang a duet with data."
it was commander laforge's birthday party.
you were a completely different reg that night.
"well, things were better then."
how?
"well, for one thing i'd just finished the matrix for my hologram and i showed geordi some of the specs that night. he said he was proud of me."
what else?
"oh, the dragons had just won the pennant, and i was still seeing leosa."
"you mentioned her at the party. a teacher, right?"
"everything was going so well. my job, my personal life. i started to think maybe my luck was changing."
and then you lost your hologram.
"admiral paris was furious. he said we'd wasted a transmission to voyager. pete talked him into giving us another chance, but there was so much pressure after that."
did it put a strain on your relationship with leosa?
she left me.
"oh, i'm sorry."
"i went to her apartment. she was gone. no furniture, no forwarding address. bot even a dear reg letter."
that must have been very upsetting.
"it was just my luck, right? lose the hologram and the girl."
tell me more about leosa.
"oh, you would have liked her. she was sweet, she was thoughtful, and such a wonderful listener. she would let me, let me go on for hours."
what did you talk about?
"oh, she was fascinated by my work at pathfinder. and, er, she didn't, er, she didn't find any of it boring. she made me feel interesting."
what do you feel when we talk about her now?
"oh, sadness, i suppose. a little confusion."
i'm sensing something else. something beneath the surface.
what?
"i think you might be sensing it, too."
what?
"suspicion, reg. you suspect her of something."
i suspect that she's happier without me if that's what you mean.
"you think leosa had something to do with your disappearing hologram but you can't bring yourself to admit it. that's why you're projecting your suspicions onto others. you're in denial. if there's any chance leosa did breach pathfinder security, you need to tell your superiors."
i'd be humiliated again.
i'll go with you.
what about your vacation?
i'll be back here before will arrives.
do you really think it's possible that leosa stole my hologram?
why would she do that?
"maybe, maybe she wanted something to remember me by."
"imagine my disappointment when i discovered that lieutenant paris had eaten all the scrambled eggs. it was pure, unadulterated gluttony. gastronomic conduct unbecoming a starfleet officer. he knows it's my favourite breakfast, but he ate them anyway. we have an egg-mergency here, people. i want to know what you plan to do about it."
"maybe i can replicate some more, captain."
do it!
"thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
"he's not only programmed to get us home, he does impressions."
"you see, it's always bothered lieutenant barclay that he was uncomfortable in large groups, so he designed me to be the life of the party."
hope he's not too shy. he's going to have a hundred and fifty new friends when we get back home.
"if we get home, harry. if."
pardon my friend here. he's convinced we're destined to live out our days in the delta quadrant.
your pessimism is illogical. perhaps a mind-meld would help to alleviate your concern.
sickbay to reg. please report to holodeck two.
on my way.
"i was starting to think you'd forgotten our tee-time. so, what'll it be? pebble beach at sunset? the back nine at gedi prime?"
"actually doctor, i'm afraid something's come up. i'm going to meet with seven of nine."
"oh, really?"
she going to teach me to play kadis-kot.
"ah, reg. when i agreed to lend you my emitter, i did it with the understanding that you needed it for official business."
what's your point?
my point is that board games aren't exactly crucial to your mission.
and i suppose golf is?
reg?
i'll tell you what. when we get back home we'll play as much golf as you like. until then let's try to keep out of each other's hair. what do you say?
state your name for the record.
leosa. l e o s a.
occupation?
dabo girl.
dabo?
it's a ferengi game. i work aboard one of their casino ships.
"you, you told me you were a teacher."
is this true?
"sometimes i'm a teacher, sometimes i'm a bajoran vedek. whatever the customer wants."
lieutenant barclay tells me that the two of youspent a significant amount of time together. did he ever discuss his work at pathfinder with you?
he wouldn't talk about anything else. it was always holograms this and cyclic pulsars that.
and who did you share that information with?
nobody.
i have a theory. would you like to hear it?
why not?
"i think that some of your ferengi friends found a way to profit from lieutenant barclay's work. i think you were encouraged to get close to him. and when you had all the information you needed, you left."
i left reg for one simple reason. he's boring.
don't tell me you never noticed.
"with the admiral's permission, i'd like a moment alone with leosa."
"i don't think therapy is what this woman needs, counsellor."
"five minutes, admiral."
five minutes.
"did you know i'm a betazoid? i'm empathic, which means i know when people are lying. tell me, what's the longest you've ever been incarcerated?"
"you can't send me to prison, counsellor. i didn't do anything wrong."
"maybe not, but i can order you held for psychiatric observation. extended observation."
"i may not be a betazoid but i work a dabo table, and i know when somebody's bluffing."
try me.
"you were correct, admiral. the ferengi did steal reg's hologram. twice. this is the ship you need to look for."
that's it. that's nunk's ship.
nunk?
my employer.
scans indicate they've been in the vicinity of that star for the last forty three hours. why?
i don't know.
she's telling the truth. for once.
the ferengi wouldn't have stolen the hologram if they didn't think it was valuable. they're probably waiting to rendezvous with a buyer. are there any starfleet ships in that area?
the carolina's point seven light years away. at maximum warp it could reach them in two hours.
open a channel.
"computer, open a secure channel to the carolina."
tell captain peterson to adjust his course immediately.
was everything that happened between us a lie?
not everything. just the parts where i expressed affection for you.
oh.
"oh, if it makes any difference, it wasn't personal. it was just business."
"what exactly is a broken heart worth these days, hmm?"
ten percent.
of what?
profits from the nanoprobes.
nanoprobes? borg nanoprobes?
gegis says they're worth two billion times their weight in latinum.
"i don't think i quite understand the problem, doctor."
are you aware that he's been doing impressions of you?
you should hear his tuvok. it's eerie.
it's disrespectful.
"what do you want me to do, deactivate him?"
just long enough to run a diagnostic of his programme. his recent behaviour may be indicative of a more serious problem.
i haven't seen any evidence of that.
of course not. in front of you he's all smiles. but i've seen him be rude and careless. two traits the real lieutenant barclay never exhibited.
"i know the real barclay is a friend of yours, and i'm sorry if the holographic version hasn't lived up to your expectations, but that's hardly reason to deactivate him."
are the lives of a hundred and fifty crewmen reason enough? maybe you're right. maybe i am overreacting. but what if i'm right? we're less than a light year away from the geodesic fold. do you want to risk being led through it by a malfunctioning hologram?
"captain, you saved us a comm. call."
we're ready to bring the enhanced shielding online.
good work. i need a moment alone with reg. your programme has been running continuously for how many hours now?
"fifty six hours, eleven minutes and one seconds."
i'd like to run a diagnostic of your matrix. make sure you haven't suffered any degradation over the last few days.
"this isn't the, er, doctor's idea, is it?"
"he expressed some concern for your well being, yes."
i bet he did.
"believe me, reg, the crew and i are grateful for everything you've done, but we need to take every precaution."
"i understand perfectly. if the ship's doctor thinks i need a check-up, who am i to argue?"
why are you hiding in the corner?
i'm not hiding. i'm working on a way to foil the ferengi's' plans.
"reg, there's nothing left to foil. the carolina will have them in custody within the hour."
leosa said the ferengi were going to be selling borg nanoprobes.
what does that have to do with voyager?
they have a borg crewman. think about it. the ferengi stole the original barclay hologram a month ago. that gave them time to reprogramme it and then smuggle it to voyager in the next transmission.
reprogramme it to do what?
steal seven of nine's nanoprobes. for all we knowhe could be dissecting her right now.
what would the ferengi want with assimilation technology?
"oh, nanoprobes aren't just for assimilating. they can reanimate necrotic tissue, slow down the aging process. they'd be priceless for the ferengi."
"reg, even if the ferengi did reprogramme your hologram to steal the nanoprobes, how would they get their hands on them? voyager's thirty thousand light years away."
"i haven't figured that part out yet. maybe they discovered a wormhole, or a subspace corridor."
have you mentioned any of this to commander harkins?
"not yet. i can't. if i don't bring him hard evidence, he'll just think that i'm fantasising. for the time being, we need to keep this between us."
"that tickles, lieutenant."
"sorry, reg. we're almost finished."
have you identified any problems yet?
i've gone over his entire matrix. he's working perfectly.
"maybe i'm not the one who needs a diagnostic, hmm?"
i'm a big enough hologram to admit when i'm wrong. i'm sorry i doubted you.
"if anyone is owed an apology, it's you. i should've been more sensitive. friends?"
friends.
"now that that's out of the way. captain, what do you say we get this ship back to earth?"
it's time. initiate the geodesic pulse.
would someone care to tell me what that is?
"it's a geodesic fold, admiral. that's how they're going to get the nanoprobes."
"two million kilometres and closing, captain."
take us to one quarter impulse.
bridge to astrometrics. bring the enhanced shielding
online.
"aye, commander. what's wrong?"
the fold contains three radiation types we didn't account for. the shield modifications are not enough.
the shields were modified to work in combination with the inoculations. we'll be fine.
"if the shields fail, the inoculations will be irrelevant. astrometrics to the bridge."
go ahead.
"what is it, seven?"
"there was a problem, captain, but i've corrected it."
i'm using the midas array to tap into the ferengi ship's sensors. they're receiving telemetry through the fold.
"if i', reading this correctly, voyager's headed right for it."
captain janeway knows better than to take her ship into such a dangerous anomaly.
"if the ferengi did alter my hologram, then it might, might be possible for him to have taken over the ship."
one hologram against an entire crew?
"he may have found a way to incapacitate the crew, or to commandeer the ship's systems, but either way we've got to get the carolina to close the fold."
the carolina isn't equipped to do that.
then they'll have to commandeer the ferengi ship and do it from there.
the carolina's still half a light year away. they won't make it in time.
can we transmit a message? warn voyager?
not through a geodesic fold.
"our own starship, with multiphasic shielding and a gold-pressed latinum hull."
we'll have enough left over to buy a fleet of casino ships.
"i have a better idea. lobe enlargements, heh, heh, heh."
shush.
"ooh, someone's hailing us."
who?
i can't tell. there's too much interference.
answer it.
it's the hologram.
you said it was impossible to communicate through the fold.
i thought it was. i guess i did a better job of reprogramming the hologram than i thought.
we must close the geodesic fold immediately. captain janeway has found out about our plan.
"if that's true, then why is she still headed for the fold?"
because she
found a way to protect her ship.
impossible.
you don't know janeway. she's uncanny when it comes to shields.
she's furious. she said she was going to kill
whoever tried to harm her crew. i strongly suggest you abort the mission.
what should we do?
go to warp before janeway makes it through.
"no, you mustn't. voyager has borg interquadrental"
warp drives and hirogen hunting sensors
"and vidiian phage torpedoes. no matter where you run, voyager will find you. your only hope is to close the fold."
harkins to holodeck one.
"go ahead, pete."
"it worked, reg."
they've started to close the fold.
"computer, end programme."
"something's wrong, captain."
astrometrics to the bridge. why are we stopping?
"the fold's collapsing, reg. we didn't make it in time."
it's not too late if we remodulate the shields.
"i appreciate your determination, but we can't risk it. you did everything you could."
"captain, someone just initiated a site-to-site transport."
who?
seven and reg. they've beamed to an escape pod.
bridge to seven of nine. what's going on?
the pod's been launched.
put a tractor beam on it.
there is too much interference from the fold.
"harry, can you get a transporter lock?"
what now?
there's something coming from the fold.
voyager?
"no, it's too small."
a phage torpedo?
raise shields. brace for impact.
it's an escape pod.
maybe the hologram sent us the drone.
ooo.
check what's in there.
nothing. no borg corpse. no nanoprobes.
no profit.
making first contact with a new lifeform?
mom's apple pie. neelix thought a little home cooking might cheer me up.
and?
i haven't worked up the courage to taste it yet. have you figured out what went wrong with reg?
"well, seven thinks our proximity to the fold degraded his matrix, but if you ask me, it was a recursive error in his logic subroutine."
not bad. but it would have tasted better in san francisco.
"if it'll make you feel any better, i'll let you in on a little secret. i was on the bridge this morning when we received a hail from an iconian scientist. he claims to have a trans-dimensional gateway that can take us anywhere in the galaxy."
i'm not that gullible.
"it's true. i was there. the captain doesn't want us to get our hopes up, but personally i think we'll be home by the end of the week."
are you serious?
you were right about him.
"computer, install barclay security protocol twenty one alpha."
installation complete.
identify yourself!
"computer, deactivate barclay programme. i'm sorry. i've been programming him with new security precautions so he can't be stolen again."
you seem to be off to a good start.
i thought you'd be back at the beach.
will and i decided to spend the rest of our vacation in tiburon. we were wondering if you're free for dinner tonight.
"i, er, i wouldn't want to be a third nacelle."
not possible. will's bringing a friend for you. her name's maril. you're going to adore her.
"i'd like to, but i, i still have, er, dozens of protocols to install. maybe next time."
"look reg, i know leosa hurt you, but hiding inside a hologrid isn't the answer. you need to get out, meet new people."
"this maril wouldn't happen to be a dabo girl, by any chance?"
"she's a teacher, actually. a real one."
are you sure?
"don't worry, reg. we've taken security precautions."
"ensign kim, please try and hold us steady. this material is extremely"
fragile.
"sorry, doc. i'm doing the best i can."
maybe i should've insisted
"on a more experienced pilot, like mister paris."
i'd give anything to trade places with him right now.
"seven, can you join me, please?"
on my way.
i don't know if i can take three more days of chasing comets with him.
the time might pass more easily if we disable his vocal processor.
i thought you might find this interesting.
preanimate biomatter.
look deeper.
an undeveloped nucleus contained in a cytoplasmic matrix.
"and buried deep inside that nucleus, primitive strands of dna. the beginnings of life, seven."
what's your point?
"when i look at this, i don't see a mere cell. i see the potential for literature and art, empires and kingdoms."
perhaps your visual subroutines are malfunctioning.
"someday, this cytoplasmic matrix may fall into the primordial sea of a distant world where it could ignite an evolutionary process. eons from now, a creature not unlike you could emerge, look up at the stars and ask, who am i? how did i come to be? it's the miracle of creation, seven. doesn't that excite you?"
"ensign kim, i asked you to hold us steady."
we're under attack! this is the federation ship delta flyer. we're on a peaceful mission. hold your fire.
you're transporting a suspected photonic insurgent through lokirrim space. drop your shields and prepare to be boarded.
"photonic insurgent? if you're referring to the hologram, he's our doctor. seven, we've lost thrusters."
i'll try reinitialising the driver coils.
"voyager, this is the flyer. mayday."
come in.
subspace communications are offline.
it's a tractor beam.
remodulate our shields.
that should break us free.
shields are down.
what's happening?
they're using some kind of disruption field. it's decompiling your matrix.
"federation vessel, power down your systems and prepare to surrender the photonic."
"seven, they're pulling us in. you're going to have to hide the doctor's programme."
"do something, please."
we don't want to hurt you. we're here for the insurgent.
where's the photonic?
you decompiled his matrix. you murdered him.
seven?
i'm sorry. there wasn't enough time.
biogenic material. it could be used to create viral weapons.
confiscate it.
"our doctor was using these spores to synthesise new medicines, not weapons."
what's this?
it's my portable regeneration unit. i have a unique physiology. this device maintains my cybernetic systems.
havethis analysed.
"yes, sir."
there's no one else aboard.
"take them to detention, and secure their ship in the docking bay."
you got what you wanted. let us go.
transporting photonics and manufacturing biogenic weapons are serious charges.
let's go.
i want to talk to your superior.
"careful, ensign, or you'll fracture a metacarpal."
that'd be the least of our problems.
the situation is not as desperate as it appears.
"not as desperate? we're prisoners on an alien ship. voyager has no idea we're missing, and the doctor's been decompiled."
the reports of my decompilation have been greatly exaggerated.
doc?
"please state the nature of the medical emergency. seven downloaded my programme into her cybernetic matrix. an interesting sensation, to say the least."
and now you're in control of seven's body?
"total control, it seems."
what about seven? is she all right?
"i scanned her before the aliens came aboard. physiologically, she's fine. as for her consciousness, i'm assuming it's submerged, but there's no way to be sure until i vacate her systems and conduct a neurological exam."
then we need the mobile emitter.
this experience will make a fascinating article for the starfleet medical journal.
ow!
"careful. that's not your body, remember?"
"i know seven's senses were more acute than the average humanoid but, i had no idea. what is that?"
what?
that smell.
i don't smell anything.
it could be an airborne toxin. do you think they're trying to poison us?
it's you.
it's been a busy day. i guess i'm perspiring a little.
"a little? seven's had a busy day too, and she's come through it smelling like the proverbial rose."
"headache, fever, respiratory distress, tremors. it looks like some kind of virus."
it is not a virus.
you want to tell me what's going on?
"in the doctor's database, you'll find a medication under file theta twelve alpha. please, replicate it immediately."
you know i can't give out medicine without knowing what it's for.
"if you must know, i am suffering from a neurochemical imbalance."
an imbalance.
it is native to my species.
ah. this wouldn't be the kind of imbalance that comes around once every seven years?
my pon farr is in the early stages. the urges are still controllable.
"you never fail to amaze me, tuvok. a man of your advanced years still driven by the mating instinct?"
"unlike in humans, the vulcan libido increases with time."
"well, i guess there has to be some kind of reward for all that vulcan discipline."
"the doctor anticipated my needs and developed a treatment. combined with meditation, it will enable me to control the symptoms."
"well, if that doesn't work, there's always a cold sonic shower. i'll tell the captain that you'll be out of commission for a couple of days."
she will want to know why.
"well, according to my tricorder, all we've got here is a mild case of the tarkalean flu."
"thank you, lieutenant."
"mmm! i had no idea that eating was such a sensual experience. the tastes, the textures, feeling it slide down seven's oesophagus. it's exquisite."
they're prison rations. my uniform probably tastes better.
"you know, i was thinking. when we get back to voyager, perhaps you and seven could help me modify my physical parameters."
why?
"so i can eat, of course, like any other member of the crew."
there's just one small problem. you don't have a stomach. where is the food going to go?
i believe we can construct a holographic stomach that can store the food for eventual recycling.
"maybe we should focus on something more productive, like getting out of here."
"relax, ensign. our shipmates have never let us down before. i'm sure the captain will clear up this little misunderstanding. in the meantime, are you going to finish that?"
you. come with us.
"i'm the senior officer. if you're going to take someone, take me."
my orders were specific.
"don't worry, ensign. i can take care of myself. my compliments to the chef."
"the prisoner, sir."
"pulse-phased weapons, duranium-enforced hull. much more sophisticated than the typical smuggler's vessel."
"how many ways do you want me to say this? we are not smugglers, or terrorists. we are explorers. let us contact our ship. our captain will explain everything."
"if you are innocent, then you won't mind telling me more about this vessel. for instance, this device. what does it do?"
that's a standard food replicator.
can it be used to create bioweapons?
"not unless you count mister neelix's bolian soufflé. let me show you. computer, one slice of new york cheesecake. this is an old earth delicacy."
how do i know you're not trying to poison me?
"oh, please."
"mmm mmm! oh, i never imagined. mmm!"
is this the first time you've tried that?
"of course not, but it's just that i usually avoid foods that are this rich. i do have a figure to maintain. oh, i'd better get another for you. computer, another slice of cheesecake. here."
what other foods can that device create?
hmm.
"oh, during my time with the collective we assimilated thousands of cultures from one end of the galaxy to the other. i'll say this for the borg, we certainly do travel. ah, of course, my life didn't truly begin until i came aboard voyager, and met the person who changed my life the only one who truly believed in me, saw my true potential."
your captain.
"our doctor. that's right, the photonic. if only you could have known him. ruggedly handsome. a sharp wit, a towering intellect. if he and i hadn't been colleagues. well, now we'll never know what heights he could have reached."
"i hope you understand, i had no choice."
i was just following orders. i've heard that before.
"maybe there's something i could do for you.i'll speak to my superiors, ask for leniency."
if i survive that long.
what do you mean?
"my cybernetic components are already depolarising. i need my regener regeneration device. as you can see, my motor functions are already impaired."
"all right. if i give this back to you, will you do something for me?"
"it was so kind of you to escort me. ah, nice to see you, ensign."
are you drunk?
it wasn't my fault. seven's unique physiology is unique. it doesn't react well to synthehol.
what happened?
"captain ranek and i shared a meal aboard the flyer. he's really a gentleman, once you get to know him."
you had a dinner date in seven's body?
"it wasn't a date. it was a tactical manoeuvre designed to win the trust of our captors, and it worked."
i won't ask what you had to do to get this.
"nothing unladylike, i assure you. they lost their medic to a recent skirmish, and i offered to take his place."
"let's download your programme before they change their mind. hey, careful where you point those tubules."
sorry.
easy. how do you feel?
impaired.
you've had quite a shock to your system. let me explain what's happened.
i know exactly what's happened. you've been abusing my body.
i'm a doctor.
shush!
i would never abuse your body. i was trying to get information. sometimes a glass of wine can loosen the tongue.
one glass. that doesn't excuse the other eight.
"was it that many? ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
"seven, you were aware of everything?"
painfully.
i'm afraid the role of spy wasn't written into my programme. i was forced to improvise.
"you improvised your way through an entire cheesecake, as well as three servings of ktarian chocolate puffs. now i have to suffer the consequences."
i apologise if i overindulged. i'll be more careful next time.
there won't be a next time.
i'll be discovered. they'll decompile my programme.
"shush. i know this is difficult for you, but you're going to have put up with it until we can get out of here."
how do you propose we do that?
"maybe you can tap into their comm. system, get a message to voyager."
deciphering alien computers isn't exactly my forte.
"but it is one of mine. if you can get close enough while they're accessing their systems, i'll be able to observe their command protocols."
what's the situation?
the captain wants the female prisoner in the medical bay.
we should proceed.
you're saving my life. i want you to know how grateful i am.
try to remember that the next time you're tempted to overindulge.
"the photonic's viral weapon attacks the cerebral cortex. within days, the victim suffers complete synaptic failure."
"well, if we can't stop the virus, we may be able to slow its progress. we need to synthesise a neural inhibitor. forgive me, but aren't you the ship's tactical officer?"
"tactical officer, medic, engineer. we've lost nearly a third of our crew to the photonics."
you certainly know your way around a medical bay. you may have missed your true calling.
"actually, emmik always thought i'd become a teacher. he used to call me the little professor."
who's emmik?
the photonic who helped raise my brother and me. he knew more about treating scrapes and bruises than any organic doctor i ever met.
sounds like someone i'd enjoy meeting.
maybe. before he joined the insurgency.
why did he do that?
"i ask myself that question every day. we never treated him like a servant, but he turned against us anyway."
is it possible he felt subjugated?
"i don't see how. he lived his own life, pursued his own interests. he was part of our family. at least i thought he was. we should get back to the patient."
it could take up to a day to determine if the inhibitor is working.
thank you.
"don't thank me, thank my ship's doctor. he taught me everything i know about medicine. and remember, he was a photonic. actually, you have a lot in common with him. he was something of a jack of all trades, too. i suspect you'd have gotten along famously. i'm certain he would've taken a liking to you."
your neurotransmitters aren't absorbing the medication.
can you increase the dosage?
"not without causing damage to your neocortex. the doc might be able to synthesise a stronger medicine, but"
i'll make the best of the situation until he returns.
i do have one area of expertise that might help. the holodeck.
i am a married man.
"it's the holodeck, tuvok. it doesn't count."
is that what you tell your wife?
"no, of course not. my days of rescuing slave girls from planet ten are history. look, you have photographs of your wife, right? the computer can use them to create a replica. you wouldn't be breaking your vows if it's a hologram of your wife."
"as it was in the dawn of our days, as it will be for all tomorrows. to you, my husband, i consecrate all that i am."
"t'pel, my wife. from you i receive all that i am."
"as it was in the beginning, so shall it be now."
"two bodies, one mind."
i'm picking up a vessel closing at high impulse. they're firing.
shields are holding.
open a channel. this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we're on a peaceful mission.
we've detected photonic activity aboard your vessel. drop your shields and prepare to be boarded.
photonic activity?
tuvok. he's in holodeck two.
they're firing again. it's some kind of photonic disrupter directed at holodeck two
target their weapons array and fire.
they're hailing.
on screen.
drop your shields and prepare to receive our inspection teams.
you're not in a position to be making demands. why did you fire on us?
your vessel is carrying photonics through lokirrim space.
we didn't realise that was forbidden. we'd be happy to shut down our holodecks.
n your sensors should confirm they've been deactivated.
you're still required to submit to inspection.
"your sensors should also confirm that our weapons are ready to fire. we're both reasonable people. i suggest a compromise. your vessel will escort us through lokirrim territory. that way, you can keep an eye on us, make sure we don't reactivate our holodecks. the other alternative is, we destroy your ship."
your proposal is acceptable.
sometimes diplomacy requires a little sabre rattling. begin long range scans.
"i can picture them now. my father in his airponics bay, pruning his cona vines. my mother, reading in her favourite chair. nothing in that home ever changes."
it must be comforting to have a place like that to go back to.
"i've never been away this long before. his progress is remarkable. i want you to know, i'm going to tell my superiors everything you've done for us."
"first ranek, and now you. i may become the first prisoner of war to be decorated by his captors."
i know someone who'd really enjoy meeting you.
who?
"my brother, lohden."
your brother?
"you'd like him. he's ambitious, accomplished, and he'd love your sense of humour."
"apparently, it's my most attractive quality."
seven of nine. please report to the bridge.
let me guess. your crew decided to abandon ship.
i wanted to thank you. i had a wonderful time the other night.
it's not often that i indulge myself like that.
"it's been a long time for me, too. i remembered your interest in stellar phenomenon, so i requested a course change to show you something."
what is it?
"to an astronomer, it's simply a pulsar cluster. but our poets call it the window of dreams. you can travel from one end of the quadrant to the other and never see anything like it."
lovely!
it's the pulsar's em fields vibrating against our hull.
oh!
"i once thought this was the most beautiful sight in the sector. i see now that i was wrong. oh, i almost forgot."
"oh, i promised a friend i'd go easy on the synthehol. do you hear that? it's identical to the rhythm produced by the eight-chambered ktarian heart."
is something wrong?
"rapid pulse, respiratory distress. you may be having a reaction to the pulsar's radiation. we should get you to the medical bay."
"no, i'm not going to the medical bay."
you starship captains are all alike. you can stare down the barrel of a phaser cannon but you can't stomach a simple medical exam.
i don't need an exam to know what i'm suffering from.
i'm sorry. i thought.
you were wrong.
i didn't mean to offend you. it's just i've never met a woman like you before.
that's because there are no women like me.
is something wrong?
ranek summoned me to the bridge under the pretext of a little stargazing. what he really wanted was to use my face as a tongue depressor.
i'm surprised to hear that.
it was completely inappropriate. that kind of behaviour would get a starfleet captain reassigned to a garbage scow.
"i'm not defending what he did, but you have to understand we've been out here for a long time. it's difficult to hide your feelings especially when you work closely with someone you're attracted to."
"you have, have feelings for him? i've known lotharios like ranek. trust me, you don't want anything to do with him. you need someone who, who can appreciate your many talents. someone overflowing with intelligence and compassion, someone capable. ow!"
it looks like a spasm in the trapezius.
i had no idea it could be so excruciating.
"that's what happens when you work so long without rest. our last medic showed me a technique that might help. i, i'll try it, if you like."
"please, anything."
"oh, that, that feels wonderful."
"oh, did i hurt you?"
"no, no, no, no, no, no."
"well then, what's wrong?"
there's something you don't know about me. something i have to tell you.
it's all right. i know.
you do? how could you?
your cybernetic implants? your portable regenerator?
"you're not going to tell anyone, are you?"
i would never say anything to the crew. but ranek knows.
he does?
of course. it was apparent the moment we scanned you.
i can't believe you didn't say anything.
it wouldn't have been appropriate. you're part borg. it's nothing to be ashamed of.
security to medical bay.
this is lieutenant jaryn.
the prisoner is ill. he's requesting treatment by his crewmate.
"argh, argh."
ensign.
"ow, argh, ow. where the hell have you been? i had to fake a seizure before the guard would let me see you."
calm down. seven and i have been making progress.
did you get a look at their computer?
during the one brief moment when the doctor wasn't indulging himself.
"i think i've shown considerable restraint, under the circumstances."
kissing ranek on the bridge. is that your idea of restraint?
kissing?
"not that it's any of your business, but if you must know ranek kissed me."
and the massage you got from lieutenant jaryn?
entirely therapeutic.
you became sexually aroused in my body.
"when did it become a crime to enjoy a sensation or two? of course, you'd be the last person to understand that."
what do you mean?
"the whole world is full of experiences and sensations, but you insist on denying yourself. instead of replicating caviar, you choose nutritional supplement thirteen alpha."
caviar is an indulgence.
indulgences are what make life worth living.
shush.
"these last few days have been a revelation. feeling your lungs fill with air, the surge of adrenaline through your veins. until i spent a day in your skin, i never knew what i was missing."
you may have been better off not knowing.
"we're quite a pair. me trapped by the limitations of photons and forcefields, you by a drone's obsession with efficiency. you'd make an excellent hologram."
"all right, listen. you can argue all you want when we get back to voyager, but that's not going to happen unless we come up with a plan. did you learn anything about their comm. system?"
"it can only be accessed from the bridge, but i saw ranek enter his command codes."
"if we can get those codes to voyager, they may be able to disable the shields and beam us out."
how are we going to do that?
the subspace transceiver on the flyer.
can you get aboard?
it's heavily guarded.
i can get us aboard.
"captain, may i speak with you? privately."
i owe you an apology.
i was the one who acted inappropriately.
a kiss is hardly a court martial offence. it's just that you caught me by surprise.
i won't make that mistake again.
perhaps we should start over.
what did you have in mind?
we could start with a toast.
i thought
"oh, i can make an exception for a special occasion. computer, champagne, two glasses. to new beginnings."
maybe there's some hope for us yet.
"as i've discovered recently, anything is possible. computer, dim the lights. play emh music file gamma twelve."
"oh, this is interesting."
it's called a waltz. something else i learned from our doctor.
"captain ranek, please come to the bridge."
what is it?
we've received an encrypted transmission.
i'll be right there.
you're not leaving?
i'll be back as soon as i can.
i really think you should stay.
still no sign of the flyer's warp signature.
"i appreciate your sense of duty, tuvok, but we can handle the situation without you."
"under the circumstances, abandoning my post would be a dereliction of duty. my illness is still in the early stages. i can control it."
"if i remember correctly, the last time you came down with the tarkalean flu was seven years ago. as soon as this is over, the holodeck is at your disposal."
"there you are, commander. now, a person in your condition really ought to be in bed. this is my grandmother's recipe, guaranteed to cure even the most stubborn flu. now, smell that?"
i don't smell anything.
exactly. i prepared it just the way you like it. no herbs or spices of any kind. it's practically tasteless.
we're receiving a hail. it's the delta flyer.
"on screen. seven, it's good to see you."
"i'm afraid there's no time for pleasantries, captain. we're being held prisoner on a lokirrim patrol ship. i'm sending you our precise location and the command codes to disable their shields."
are the doctor and harry all right?
"ensign kim is his usual chipper self. as for me, i'm looking forward to a long, uneventful shift in sickbay."
doctor?
"it's a long story, captain. delta flyer out."
they may be in more trouble than we thought.
set a course.
our escort isn't going to take kindly to a detour.
what's the status of their weapons?
they've repaired their forward phasers.
"target their power matrix. we may only get one shot, so make it count."
ready.
do it.
direct hit.
"get us out of here, maximum warp."
what's wrong with him?
"apparently, captain ranek has an even lower tolerance for synthehol than i do."
that doesn't sound like ranek.
it's probably not something he'd admit to his crew. we should keep this between us. what are you doing?
reviving him.
i wouldn't recommend that.
take her to detention. and separate her from the other prisoner.
there are traces of sedative in your bloodstream.
what was your plan? to aid the insurgents?
there was no plan.
we trusted you.
"i'm still a prisoner on your ship. and despite our friendship, my first obligation is to escape."
we were going to recommend leniency.
"if you knew who i really was, i doubt you'd be trying to help me."
alien vessel approaching.
i want her where i can see her.
they're raising shields.
stand by with those command codes. open a channel. this is captain kathryn janeway. we don't want a fight. return my people and we'll be on our way.
your people were caught transporting a photonic insurgent and biogenic material.
"we don't want to disable your ship, but we will if we have to."
we're losing our ventral shield grid.
compensate.
i'm trying. they've tapped into the shield matrix. they're using your command authorisation.
they're rerouting power. he's tying their shields directly into the warp matrix.
"if you fire on us, you'll trigger a core breach. you'll be killing the people you're here to rescue."
end transmission. tractor beam.
full reverse. target their emitters.
they've broken free.
"chakotay, can you send a comm. signal directly to seven's cortical node?"
"doctor, if you can hear me, we need your help. try to disable their shields."
it's a photonic.
cover me.
stay back! i'm not afraid to use this.
step away.
she destabilised the shield grid. it's failing.
watch them.
if you try to re-initialise the grid it'll overload. we could all die.
"ranek, don't."
stay back.
i'm a doctor. let me help.
their shields are down. i have a lock.
"away team, stand by for transport."
"i have injured here, captain. i can't leave yet. he'll die without immediate surgery. i know this is difficult to grasp, but i'm the person you've been getting to know the last few days. my programme was in control of seven's body."
you're lying.
"i know you have feelings for ranek. if he dies, you're never going to forgive yourself."
your vital signs are stable.
i suppose i should be grateful.
a thank you is customary after someone saves your life.
"what happened was between me and seven of nine, not you."
"i'm sorry you feel that way. the truth is, aside from a few awkward moments, i enjoyed our time together."
there are many women who'd appreciate an attractive man like you. i'm just not one of them.
more of our vessels are on the way. you should leave while you can.
thank you.
i guess you won't be introducing me to your brother.
i'm not sure you're the kind of person he's interested in.
"you mean because i'm a hologram. i don't imagine this experience is going to change your feelings about photonics, but i wanted you to know i'm grateful for the time we've spent together."
you're a talented doctor. we're the ones who should be grateful.
i'm glad i could help. doctor to voyager. one to beam out.
"commander, it's good to see you're over the flu."
i have fully recovered. thank you for your assistance.
"ah, don't mention it. i just hope everything was okay."
not exactly. my wife's ears are four millimetres shorter than your facsimile's.
"so i took a little artistic license. aside from that, was everything all right?"
"the hologram was adequate, but no substitute for my wife."
of course not.
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
"there isn't one, yet."
"the mess hall is three decks up. in case you've forgotten, i've lost my appetite. permanently."
"that doesn't mean you're incapable of enjoying a meal. foie gras with truffles. an ancient earth delicacy. chateau d'yquem. according to the culinary database, the ideal accompaniment."
not your usual fare.
it's come to my attention that nutritional supplements don't fully meet my needs.
i see.
"i thought we could share this experience. i'll describe the meal to you. the tastes, the sensations. perhaps you can enjoy it vicariously."
what about the wine? it doesn't exactly agree with you.
"if i become sick, i won't have far to go. to shared experiences."
"hear, hear."
what about the impulse upgrades?
the day after tomorrow. put a new phase compensator on that relay.
environmental control?
the thermal regulators are still running a little hot.
too bad we can't just keep the windows open. how long until the warp drive is back online?
six days.
you're sure you can't get it done any faster?
"captain, i don't like sitting still any more than you do, but repairs this extensive take time."
"mendez, track down that power drain."
right away.
"i know this ship has been through a lot, but you told me this would only take a few days."
that was before i discovered the microfractures in the starboard nacelle and the fused relays in the main computer.
who did that?
i noticed a charge imbalance in the eps feed. i'm sorry if i
it could have taken us hours to find that.
i have a tactical systems report for you. it's from commander tuvok.
"i'd say you're capable of a lot more than delivering padds, icheb."
"i agree. until we get underway again, he's assigned to you. with him on your team, maybe you'll get this job done a little faster."
neelix?
rise and shine. it's oh five hundred.
already? oh. i was dreaming we found the dilithium and were back aboard voyager.
dreaming is an accurate description.
didn't we already scan this nebula?
four times.
i thought the borg were known for being thorough.
"the borg value efficiency, not redundancy."
i've got a hunch about this nebula. there's dilithium in there somewhere.
i'm getting some fluctuating energy readings.
from the nebula?
"no, it's weapons fire."
let's get out of here.
we're receiving a distress call.
have casualties. please help us. we're on a humanitarian mission delivering medical supplies.
reverse course.
we can't just leave them.
starfleet policy. interference in alien conflicts is strictly prohibited.
you heard their captain. it's a medical ship.
their shields are down. life support is failing on at least three decks.
open a channel to the other ship.
"this is ensign kim of the delta flyer. i don't know what you're fighting about, but it looks like you've won. the people on the other ship have casualties. we'd like to"
this isn't your concern.
i'm not taking sides. i only want to help the wounded.
withdraw immediately.
they're charging weapons.
"neelix, set our deflector beam for a narrow pulse. seven, let me know the second their weapons array is fully charged. i might be able to trigger an overload."
the deflector bandwidth is at point four microns.
now.
their weapons are offline. shields are down. they're retreating.
"take the helm. neelix, you're with me."
who's in charge here?
he is.
what are we going to do?
"it's okay, we're here to help. the ship that attacked you is gone."
who are you?
harry kim from the starship voyager. we're responding to your distress call. we can treat your wounded.
the captain?
"dead, sir. so are the rest of the officers."
i'm reading a total of twenty seven lifeforms aboard the ship.
there were fifty six of us.
how are we going to get home without the officers?
we need to restore main power. where's the warp interface?
"we're passengers, not crewmen."
you can access engineering systems from here.
your warp core is intact. i think i can bring it back online. can you monitor antimatter flow?
i'm not sure.
"just watch this readout and tell me if it starts to fluctuate. i'm routing emergency power to structural integrity. atmospheric pressure is returning to normal. neelix, we'll go through the ship deck by deck, find the survivors."
we need to get our cloak back online.
i'll take a look at it as soon as i've repaired the engines.
"no, the cloak is more important."
"the annari have far more powerful weapons than we do. if they come back, the cloak is our best defence."
we'll try to get it back online. kim to delta flyer.
go ahead.
"i need your help, seven. it looks like we're going to be here for a while."
how did you do it?
do what?
disable the annari warship so quickly?
"basically, we used their own weapons against them."
how?
we used a deflector pulse to overload their phaser banks.
you know a lot about engineering.
it's all part of my starfleet training.
starfleet?
"yeah, the organisation i work for."
and they teach you all these things?
"we train at an academy ,and i guess i picked up a few new tricks during my time on voyager."
how long have you been captain?
i'm just an ensign.
ensign? what's that?
"a junior officer. the lowest ranked officer, actually."
this is my first deep space assignment. it hasn't gone very well.
"could you hand me that? my first week on the job didn't go very well, either. we ended up seventy thousand light years from home, lost over a dozen crew members, but i got through it. so will you."
i hope so.
"if you're going to be a starship officer, you've got to accept that adversity comes with the job."
what's that?
it's a diagnostic of the antimatter injectors.
"no, i meant that stuff you're eating."
nutritional supplements replicated to meet my metabolic requirements.
"sounds delicious. you know, in the mess hall they actually have tables and chairs for that."
i prefer to work while i eat. it's a more efficient use of my time.
"you did a great job today. we're ahead of schedule, thanks to you. here's what we're going to work on tomorrow. i'll see you at oh six hundred. icheb?"
yes?
what do you do for fun?
fun?
recreation. how do you spend your time when you're off duty?
between my work and my studies i don't have much time for recreation.
"i've learned that you've got to take a break once in awhile. i've been doing a lot of rock climbing on the holodeck. maybe when we're finished tightening all the nuts and bolts, you'd like to join me."
i do have an interest in geology.
"it's not about the rocks, icheb. it's about the climbing."
main power has been restored. all stations responding.
the cloak's back online. impulse and warp drives are standing by. shields are at ninety six percent. i'd say you're ready to get back on course.
we appreciate your help.
i hope you have a safe journey.
"mister kim, i feel guilty asking even more of you, but no one on this ship knows how to fly it."
none of you has ever piloted a starship?
"i've trained in shuttles, but nothing like this."
i'll enter a flight plan in the auto-navigation system and give you a quick course in helm operations. you shouldn't have any trouble.
couldn't you take us? this ship needs an experienced commanding officer.
"i'm sorry, but we've already gotten more involved than we should have. and they need us back on voyager."
"it's not just my ship that concerns me. you've made an enemy of the annari now. but if you dock your ship in our shuttlebay, our cloak will protect you."
"that's a generous offer, but we'll be fine."
"please, mister kim, we can't afford to fail. this ship,"
"loken, don't."
we can trust these people. i'm a doctor. these people are my research team. we're carrying new vaccines to our homeland. they'll save thousands of lives.
"sir, i looked at their flight plan. it takes them pretty close to voyager."
"i'll bring you as far as our ship. when we get there, you can discuss your situation with my captain."
thank you.
what about starfleet policy?
this is a humanitarian mission. dock the flyer in their shuttlebay.
we're approaching the planet.
take us out of warp. disengage the cloak.
wait. i'm detecting three alien vessels in orbit.
on screen.
those are annari warships. your people are in danger.
i apologise for the state of my ship. we weren't expecting company.
i hope we're not imposing.
not at all. making contact with new cultures is a priority for us.
"for us, too. this is a fine ship, captain."
"one of the best in the fleet, but it could use a new set of deuterium injectors."
any chance you could provide them?
i think we can arrange something. what are you offering in exchange?
"zeolitic ore. we mined several tons of it from an asteroid field. it's high-grade, easy to refine."
i'll speak to my supply officer.
we're being hailed by ensign kim. audio only.
"hello, harry."
is everything all right?
of course. why wouldn't it be?
our long range scans detected several alien ships orbiting the planet.
"i appreciate your concern, but there's nothing to worry about. we've made some new friends, that's all. when can we expect you back?"
we've run into a slight delay.
"nothing serious, i hope."
no. everything's under control.
good.
any luck finding dilithium?
i'm afraid not.
"i'll tell the other teams to keep looking. see you soon, ensign."
"yes, ma'am. kim out."
"dilithium? we can get that for you, too."
really?
she's formed an alliance with our enemy.
just because they're talking doesn't mean they formed an alliance. it's probably just a friendly meeting.
"that's how the annari operate. they come to you as friends and when they've won your trust, they declare you subjects of the annari empire."
kim to voyager.
we didn't expect you so soon.
"actually, captain, i'm closer than i let on. and i've brought some new friends of my own."
our chances of getting home without your help aren't very good. we'd appreciate any assistance you could offer.
"i hope you understand, i need to give this some thought."
"you've put me in a difficult position, ensign. we could use the help the annari are offering, but if they find out we're aiding their enemy"
i couldn't just stand by and do nothing.
that doesn't justify getting involved in somebody else's fight.
what would you have done?
probably exactly what you did.
i guess i learned from the best.
"if this were simply an errand of mercy i wouldn't hesitate, but the fact is, these people are involved in an interplanetary war."
"captain, i've gotten to know them over the last couple of days. you met loken. they're scientists, not soldiers."
you've only heard one side of the story.
you've taken sides before. the borg resistance. the vaadwaur.
those were different circumstances.
you were trying to help people in need. how is this any different?
have you thought about applying to the advocate general's office? you'd make a good lawyer. i suppose i could spare chakotay or tuvok for a few days.
that won't be necessary. the kraylor know me. they trust me.
i'm sure they'd find tuvok or chakotay just as trustworthy.
"but they outrank me. if you send one of them, it won't be my mission anymore."
your mission?
my first real command.
you've been in command on voyager before.
"on the night shift, for a few hours. it's not the same thing. you and chakotay are always a couple of decks away, ready to take over if anything goes wrong. i've been on voyager for almost seven years and i'm still an ensign."
if this is your way of bucking for a promotion
"no, no, i understand there's a command structure and that our circumstances are unique. but the fact is, if we were back home, i'd be a lieutenant by now. maybe even a lieutenant commander."
"you're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?"
"i know i can do this, and the kraylor are giving me a chance to prove it."
i expect you back before we complete our repairs.
"yes, ma'am."
and i'm not sending you alone.
captain
"i want you to take seven. since she has no rank, you clearly outrank her."
lieutenant torres asked me to repair a malfunctioning holo-emitter.
it's about time. whenever i move to the far corner of the surgical bay
my legs disappear.
seven of nine told me you gave her social lessons.
she wanted to get along better with the crew. social skills are one thing the borg never assimilated.
i was hoping you could instruct me as well.
"i'd be delighted. lesson one, making a first impression."
"actually, i wanted to ask you about something specific."
fire away.
how can you tell when someone has romantic feelings for you?
"icheb, this is a surprise. have you caught someone's eye?"
i'm speaking hypothetically.
"ah. hypothetically, there are various indications of romantic attraction. compliments, for example. invitations to social activities. finding excuses to be in close proximity with someone."
"yes, but couldn't those things happen in a relationship that wasn't romantic?"
i suppose.
is there a way to be absolutely certain?
"well, short of an open declaration of affection, there are some fairly reliable physiological responses. elevated blood pressure, increased beta endorphin production."
"thank you, doctor. you've been very helpful."
"with my guidance, you'll master the nuances of social interaction in no time."
"harry. take me with you, buddy."
"sorry, tom. this is my mission."
"oh, come on. i've been itching to get back into space ever since we set down on this dust bowl. i'm tired of cleaning conduits and replacing relays."
"you're a married man now. you've got family responsibilities. just leave the away missions to the young, unattached guys."
that ship is in pretty bad shape. you're going to need a good pilot.
"no, thanks."
wait a minute. i know what this is about.
you do?
sure. you've got a girl on that ship you don't want me to know about.
there's no girl. not this time.
then what is it?
"i don't know how else to this say this, so i'll just say it. you've always been captain proton, i have always been buster kincaid. it's my turn this time."
"i'm glad you're not planning to leave on an empty stomach, captain. i have plomeek soup and eggplant parmesan."
either's fine.
wrong answer.
excuse me?
if you're going to be a captain you have to act like a captain. never admit you're uncertain about anything. you can't be indecisive in front of your crew.
"it's just a snack, neelix."
"when captain janeway comes in here, she knows exactly what she wants."
maybe i'm just not as picky about my food.
"whatever you say, ensign."
"neelix! plomeek soup, and make sure it's hot."
captain on the bridge.
where did you learn that?
i've been studying that starfleet manual you loaned me.
"take your station, mister terek."
"aye, sir. course?"
"i'll do it. laying in a course, heading one one five, mark thirty seven. does this ship have a name?"
medical transport one three six.
i think we can do better than that. nightingale. the name of someone from my homeworld. she was famous for treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield.
it's perfect.
hail voyager.
kim to voyager. we're ready to get underway.
acknowledged. good luck.
see you in a few days. kim out. main power.
online.
tactical.
shields and weapons standing by.
bring the cloak online. warp six. engage.
"acting captain's personal log, stardate 54277.3. my first day in command has been challenging, but i've loved every minute of it. i can't help feeling that this was something i was born to do."
the hourly status report you requested.
thanks.
why have you brought these items aboard?
they make me feel more at home.
we'll only be on this vessel for a few days. decorating is an inefficient use of your time.
"it's important to forge a personal connection with your vessel, make the ship your own. ask captain janeway."
i'll discuss it with her the moment we return.
is there anything else?
i asked terek to make a course correction.
he's never done that before. i'd better check on him.
i believe he's capable of doing it himself.
status?
i've entered the new heading.
looks like the guidance vector is off by a couple of microns.
i was about to correct that.
you need to realign the primary navigational sensor first.
"yes, sir."
"and make sure it stays locked on your guide star. here, let me show you."
"i'm, i'm sorry, lieutenant."
don't worry about it. bumping elbows comes with the job. and you can call me b'elanna. put this with the others. these relays should have been replaced a while ago. it's amazing they've held up this long. i'm really looking forward to our climb.
wouldn't you prefer to spend your free time with your husband?
"if it doesn't involve a race car, a shuttle, or something else he can drive, tom's not interested. besides, since we got married i see more than enough of him. hold still."
what's that?
i'm reading a power fluctuation somewhere in the propulsion system.
it's destabilising the cloak.
all stop.
the core is stable. that should take care of it.
are you absolutely certain?
"as a scientist, you should know there's no such thing as absolute certainty."
perhaps we could run a diagnostic before we
that would take hours. captain janeway wants us back before voyager finishes its overhaul.
the cloaking system is delicate. it requires constant attention.
"correct me if i'm wrong, you're a physician. you have to trust me on this. we'll monitor it closely, don't worry."
i simply want to ensure that our mission is a success.
"you asked me to take command of this ship, and that's what i'm doing."
tell terek to resume course.
i've discovered a serious flaw in one of the ship's systems.
which one?
"the captain. the captain's main function is to issue orders, correct?"
right.
and the crew's function is to support the captain and carry out those orders.
what's your point?
"every time you give an order, you carry it out yourself. and when someone else makes a suggestion, you dismiss it."
these people are inexperienced. they need my help.
"when you first came aboard voyager, did captain janeway help you?"
"sure, she looked after all the junior officers."
by doing your work for you?
"no. she gave me a lot to do, actually."
because she felt you were more capable than she was?
of course not. she wanted me to learn. to gain confidence.
interesting.
emergency power. repolarise the containment field.
i can't.
the cloak is going to fail again.
don't panic. this is a minor malfunction.
minor? we're losing our main defence system.
"we've been detected. two annari vessels are closing on our position. correction, six annari vessels."
evasive manoeuvres. kim to engineering.
go ahead.
we need that cloak back online.
the primary generator has failed. i'm trying to
seven?
"seven, come in.  you have the bridge."
we need you here.
"i'll go, sir."
all right. i'll give you instructions over the comm. charge phaser banks. target their weapons array.
which ship?
"the closest one, off our port bow."
dayla to the bridge. life support failing down here. i've gotten everyone out.
good work. now go to the cloaking generator.
what's the field polarity?
two hundred six point four.
that's too low. we're going to have to raise it.
i'm bypassing the phase converter.
"no, wait, i didn't tell you to do that."
won't that increase the field polarity?
"yes, but."
listen to me carefully. i want you to try
"dayla, it's loken. take the warp core offline."
what are you talking about?
bypass the driver coil and shunt power directly to the polaron matrix.
the cloak is back online.
"get us out of here, full impulse. dayla, secure the engineering section and get back to the bridge. dayla?"
i'm not reading any life signs in engineering.
dayla?
she's dead. how's seven?
she may be in shock. i'm not sure. have a look.
"your opinion, doctor?"
i believe she may be in shock.
do you think we should give her a cortical stimulant?
that might be indicated.
"you're no doctor, are you? you and i need to talk. alone."
what the hell is going on?
i don't know what you mean.
"nothing about this mission is adding up. it's obvious you know a lot more about cloaking systems than biology. so did dayla. and the second our cloak failed, half a dozen annari warships came after us, one little medical transport. the truth!"
"my colleagues and i have been working at a secret base, but not to create vaccines. we've been developing cloaking devices for our fleet."
this ship is a prototype.
"the annari know we have it, and they don't want us to get it home."
i never would have agreed to this if i had known you had a military objective.
"our world has been under an annari blockade for three years. the planet is protected by a shield grid, but it's almost impossible to get our ships in or out."
i convinced captain janeway this was a humanitarian mission.
"it is. the annari are choking us to death, slowly. if we can't get supply ships through the blockade, we can't get food to our people. or medicine."
"for all i know, that's another lie."
reverse course.
sir?
we're heading back to voyager.
i don't understand.
he knows about the cloak.
"i would've told you, but"
i gave you an order.
what about the mission?
that's not your concern. you want to be a starship officer? your job is to follow orders.
"sir, i don't think you"
this is not a debate. you're under my command.
"no, sir. not any more."
"you're relieved. you, take the helm."
i believe you're the one who's been relieved.
where are you going in such a hurry?
"engineering, to assist b'elanna."
ah.
lieutenant torres.
you've been seeing a lot of my wife lately. should i be worried?
the repairs are extensive. it's a lot of work.
you can't fool me. i heard you two were planning on scaling some cliffs together.
it was her idea.
"hey, relax. spending time on the holodeck is good for you. but if you really want to have fun, forget climbing. try my race car programme."
race car?
you get to chase me around the track in an old earth ground vehicle. three hundred kph. it'll really get your blood pumping.
are you challenging me to a competition?
"do you think you can take me? tomorrow, holodeck two, nineteen hundred hours."
there is something we need to discuss.
"sure, as soon as you help me finish this diagnostic."
i can't do this.
of course you can. you've done dozens of them.
i'm not talking about the diagnostic. i'm talking about us.
us?
your interest in me. it's inappropriate.
i don't think i understand.
it's obvious you desire a romantic involvement.
excuse me?
"you've made all the customary overtures, finding reasons to spend time with me, complimenting me, inviting me to engage in recreational activities. your husband even challenged me to a ritual contest."
what are you talking about?
"according to my research, it's a traditional klingon practice."
"look, i'm sorry, but you've got the wrong idea. you seemed a little lonely. i was just trying to be friendly."
i scanned you.
you scanned me?
in the jefferies tube. your blood pressure and neurotransmitter readings indicated a state of arousal.
"it was hot, and i've been under a lot of pressure, but i certainly wasn't aroused. look, icheb, i like you. but aside from the fact that i am a much older woman, i'm married."
that's why we have to do the honourable thing. we should stop seeing each other.
"you're right. as much as it hurts, i'll just have to face the truth."
it's for the best.
seven. feeling better?
well enough to return to duty.
"you won't be returning to duty. not on this ship anyway. loken lied to us. there's no vaccine. the cloak is the real cargo. i ordered the crew to take us back to voyager, but they refused."
they mutinied.
"i guess that's what you'd call it. i've packed some supplies. we'll take an escape pod. i'm hoping the annari will leave us alone, treat us as neutral parties."
we're not neutral parties.
this is a military mission. we can't get involved.
we've been involved since you first fired on that annari ship.
i thought i was helping people in distress.
"don't they still need your help? are you abandoning this ship because the mission wasn't what you expected, or because being a captain wasn't what you expected?"
i am perfectly capable of commanding a starship.
"are you? clearly, you're uncomfortable with the role, delegating tasks, giving orders."
someone died following my orders.
you can't blame yourself for that.
a captain's responsible for the lives of his crew.
"people sometimes die on missions, despite the captain's best efforts."
i should have stuck to playing buster kincaid.
"a holodeck programme can be turned off when it no longer suits you. reality can't. if you really feel responsible for this crew, you'll help them get home, because they won't survive without you."
is that some new kind of weapon?
"they're scanning pulses designed to illuminate cloaked ships. if we hit one, we'll be exposed."
how are we going to get through?
we'll find a way.
i thought you were leaving.
i get claustrophobic in escape pods. switch to manual helm control. full power to shields.
"aye, captain."
two annari ships have entered orbit. they are hailing.
"on screen. captain geral, we have twelve isotons of ore for you."
i'm under orders to escort you out of annari space immediately. you've been supporting our enemy.
you must be mistaken.
"a shuttlecraft matching your hull composition fired on one of our ships several days ago, and we recently detected two human bio-signatures on a kraylor warship."
i can explain that.
"if you don't leave immediately, we'll be forced to fire on you."
our warp drive is still being repaired.
then we'll escort you at impulse. you have five minutes to lift off.
so much for our new deuterium injectors.
what about harry and seven?
"we'll go looking for them, as soon as we get rid of our escort."
evasive manoeuvres.
there are too many of them.
you're doing fine. just try to stay at least one hundred metres ahead of the closest pulse.
"yes, sir."
we should return fire.
no. that would only give them another way to triangulate our position.
our shields are failing.
we're losing structural integrity on the lower decks.
reroute emergency power.
it's insufficient.
open a channel to the lead annari ship.
sir?
do it.
"aye, sir."
this is captain kim of the kraylor vessel nightingale. i'm prepared to discuss terms for our surrender. end transmission.
we trusted you.
and you still should.
they're responding.
i don't have time to explain. on screen.
your surrender will be unconditional.
"no, it won't. either you allow my crew to evacuate to the surface, or i'll put this ship on self-destruct. you'll never get the cloaking technology. something tells me your superiors won't be happy about that."
your crew will be taken aboard my vessel and brought to an annari detention centre.
"my crew's going to the surface in escape pods. once they're clear, you can lock onto this ship with a tractor beam."
agreed. you've two minutes to evacuate.
i will not abandon this ship.
"i'm glad to hear that, because i'm going to need you here. get your people into the pods, quickly."
but the cloak.
"i've got a plan to save it. if i fail, at least the scientist who designed it will be alive to create another one. seven, scan the annari's tractor emitters. i need to know the exact beam polarity."
what are we going to do?
"once they lock onto us, they're going to come about and pull us away from the planet. as soon as they do, we're going to reverse our shield polarity. if we time it right, it should give us enough momentum to outrun them to the defence perimeter."
we're going to use their own weapons against them.
the escape pods are away.
disengage the cloak.
they've locked on.
sir?
not yet. steady. now!
status?
shields are failing.
four annari vessels are in pursuit. they're closing.
full thrusters.
shields are down.
"get us through that defence perimeter, mister terek."
"yes, sir. we're inside."
the annari have broken off their pursuit.
"take us to the surface, mister terek."
we've just crossed out of annari space.
our escorts have broken off. they're going to warp.
"bring the long range sensors online. you and tom, take the flyer. start your search at harry's last known position. tuvok, send an encrypted message to the kraylor homeworld. see if they know where harry and seven are."
"that won't be necessary, captain. ensign kim is hailing us."
from where?
a cloaked vessel. it's directly astern.
"acting captain's log, stardate 54282.5. final entry. new cloaking systems are being installed in other kraylor ships, so i guess the mission was a success. still, i wish i felt better about it."
welcome home.
it's good to be back.
"so, what'll it be tonight? i have a light tula cheese soufflé or a zesty lasagne."
"you know, neelix, the truth is, i'm not sure."
i thought we talked about this. a captain has to be deci
"i'm not a captain, neelix. not yet, anyway."
how many are there?
they've deflected our scans.
"you must learn to rely on instinct. there are four of them, perhaps five."
no! you'll lead them right to us.
let them come.
never let your prey control the hunt. there. ten metres.
they're behind us now.
you wanted to see me?
i'd like to request a temporary leave of absence. you remember the ovions?
the hexapods.
they just asked me to speak at a symposium on spaceborne pathogens. there are going to be physicians from all over the quadrant. this is a rare opportunity for me. and for the rest of the crew.
how's that?
"i'd be representing voyager. putting our best foot forward, so to speak. and, needless to say hexapods are more likely to know a best foot when they see one."
"i'm sorry, doctor. it's just not practical."
i seem to recall lieutenant torres participating in boray conference on transwarp theory a few months back.
that was different.
how?
we were there. the ovion system is two weeks behind us. i can't ask the captain to turn the ship around.
i could take a shuttle.
you could also write a paper and submit it on subspace.
that's hardly an effective means of making a presentation.
say you do take a shuttle. would you expect us to sit here and wait for you to get back?
there must be some fascinating anomaly nearby for the crew to explore.
janeway to chakotay.
go ahead.
we just received a distress call on an hirogen frequency.
we haven't heard from them in a while.
i've altered course. i'd like you on the bridge.
i'm on my way.
perhaps the hirogen will keep you occupied long enough for me to attend the symposium.
you can't blame a hologram for trying.
approaching the coordinates.
take us out of warp. raise shields and stand by weapons.
i've got them. six thousand kilometres off starboard.
on screen.
monotanium hull plating. tylium based power. it's hirogen.
they're not responding to hails.
life signs?
i'm getting a lot of strange readings. any one of them could be a life form.
any hirogen ships in the vicinity?
"no, ma'am."
it might be a trap.
"the hirogen aren't the type to play possum. move us within transporter range. chakotay, take an away team."
let's break into teams. seven.
particle weapons.
these burns are consistent with a type-three phaser.
commander.
a bat'leth.
what's a klingon weapon doing in the delta quadrant?
the blood's hirogen. chakotay to tuvok and paris.
go ahead.
i'm reading an hirogen lifesign. it could be wounded.
we're right behind you.
stay away!
hold your fire!
we're here to help you.
i said stay away!
"he's lost a lot of blood. i need to get him back to the ship. paris to sickbay, two to beam up."
acknowledged.
commander.
replicated starfleet technology.
it's some kind of holodeck interface.
there appear to be holo-emitters installed throughout the facility.
this environment is simulated.
why didn't our tricorders detect it?
i am not certain.
can you shut down the emitters?
i'll try.
"evidently, they made a few modifications. all of our preliminary scans indicated the environment was real."
environments that fool sensors. no safety protocols. how many bodies?
starfleet phasers?
i think we'll find they all came from the holotechnology we gave the hirogen three years ago.
"they obviously missed the point. we gave them that technology so they could hunt holographic prey, not get themselves killed."
: try to remain calm.
get away from me!
can you sedate him?
he won't let me get close enough.
we're not your enemies.
you're holograms. this is a simulation.
"i assure you, we're quite real."
liar.
"doctor, deactivate yourself."
i can't treat the patient if i'm offline.
no one can treat him if he's terrified.
"computer, deactivate emh."
"our doctor's a hologram, we're not."
why should i believe you?
i'm afraid you're going to have to. i'm captain kathryn janeway. you're aboard my vessel.
janeway. this is voyager?
looks like our reputation preceded us.
you're the ones who gave us the technology to simulate our hunts. where are the rest of my people?
you were the only one we found alive.
this place you were in. it's some kind of holodeck.
"a training facility, where young hirogen learn the skills of the hunt."
you're a student.
a technician.
"computer, deactivate forcefield. can you tell us what happened?"
there were too many of them.
who?
"the holograms. they were malfunctioning. i tried to shut them down but they got control of the system and, and they deactivated the safety protocols."
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
we're picking up a hirogen ship. it's on an intercept course.
hail them.
i've tried. they're not responding.
shields at sixty eight percent. should i return fire?
not yet. open a channel. this is captain kathryn janeway. we're not here to fight you.
shields at fifty two percent.
"stand down, or we will retaliate."
i don't think they're getting the message.
"then let's try some nonverbal communication. tom, evasive pattern beta six. tuvok, disable their weapons."
their phaser banks have been disabled.
let's see if that makes them a little more talkative. harry?
they're responding.
this facility belongs to the hirogen. leave the area immediately.
we are here in response to a distress call.
"so are we, and we don't need your assistance."
all but one of your people are dead.
where's the survivor?
recovering in our sickbay.
"return him, now."
"he's in no condition to be transported. if you want to see him, you'll have to come here."
"i tried to shut down the generator, but i"
but what?
there were too many of them. i masked my lifesigns so they couldn't detect me.
you mean you hid while hunters fought and died.
no doubt he found the nearest hole and crawled into it.
i'm not a hunter.
it was your responsibility to maintain those systems.
forty three hirogen died because of your incompetence and cowardice.
what about the holograms? were they deleted?
they transferred their programmes.
where?
a vessel equipped with holo-emitters. they're gone.
perhaps you should've considered the risks before you programmed holograms that could commandeer a vessel.
capable prey make the hunt more challenging.
i'm detecting residual engine emissions but no sign of the vessel itself.
"well, i'm sure they're out of sensor range by now."
no. they're close. elevated plasma readings in grid two nine five. they're creating a scattering field to mask their ship. you can find them by scanning for polarised em signatures.
prepare for the hunt.
i'd like to join you.
you did enough damage giving us defective technology to begin with.
you have a problem. we can help you solve it. we have more experience with holograms than you do.
two hunting vessels are better than one.
come in.
the hirogen are ready to get underway.
the sooner the better. why do i get the feeling you're about to gang up on me?
you first.
we have reservations about an alliance with the hunters.
i'm listening.
the hirogen have been performing covert scans of voyager. they are obviously trying to determine the status of our shields and weapons.
"i'd be surprised if you haven't run a few scans of your own. standard procedure. they don't trust us, we don't trust them. coffee, black."
trust isn't the issue. we're getting involved in a situation that's not our responsibility.
"oh, i'd say we're at least partly to blame. that was starfleet technology that killed those hunters."
there's nothing inherently violent about holodeck technology. it's what the hirogen did with it that got them killed.
how many times have we shared replicators to help people feed and clothe themselves?
trading technology is part of our life in the delta quadrant.
: it has been necessary for our survival.
maybe we should have been a little more careful about what we traded and who we traded with. replicators make weapons just as easily as they do food.
we can't undo what's been done.
"maybe not. but we can help shut these holograms down before anyone else gets hurt. now, if there are no more objections, i'd like to get underway."
i've got the holograms' ship on sensors.
let's see it.
looks like they've taken some damage.
the hirogen are closing on the holograms' vessel.
hail them. i suggest we keep our distance until we can determine their weapons status.
it's time for the kill.
you know as well as i do that a wounded animal can be dangerous.
we won't be denied our prey.
"i'm not detecting any weapons, captain."
they're offline?
"no, they're non-existent."
"that's not the only thing that's non-existent. according to sensors, there's no warp core, no impulse engines."
"it's a decoy. hirogen vessel, stand down."
report?
they've suffered multiple hull breaches. their life support is failing.
drop shields. transport all survivors to sickbay.
bridge to the doctor. we have casualties.
acknowledged.
"tom, give him a hand."
another hirogen ship has just dropped out of warp.
i'm not reading any lifesigns on this one.
holograms. hail them.
no response. they're charging weapons.
reactivating shields.
no. we haven't finished transporting the hirogen.
chakotay's right. return fire.
my programme is destabilising.
the holograms are tapping into the sickbay emitters. they're trying to transfer the doctor's programme off the ship.
bridge to sickbay.
"doctor, download your programme into the mobile emitter now."
we've lost him.
get him back.
they've gone to warp.
set a pursuit course.
they've masked their signature. they're gone.
"align his matrix, and install it into the database. welcome aboard, doctor. there's nothing to be afraid of. you're among your own kind now."
return me to my ship.
i can't do that.
i have patients who are going to die if i don't treat them.
there are people aboard voyager who can help them. we need you here.
my programme doesn't include aiding and abetting murderers.
murderers? is that what the hirogen told you?
i know what you did at that training facility.
what happened there couldn't be avoided.
really? you'd be surprised how easy it is not to kill someone.
bringing him here was a mistake.
the doctor is our guest. and i'm sure he'll help us once he realises how serious our situation is.
what situation?
we have wounded.
"they're holograms. when you said wounded, i assumed"
these people's injuries are just as real as anything inflicted on flesh and blood.
"maybe so, but i can't heal them. they need to be repaired."
what's the difference?
"i'm a doctor, not an engineer. you've abducted the wrong man."
you must have experience repairing your own matrix?
some.
then there has to be something you can do.
the holo-emitters are independent subsystem with its own power generator here.
"if we disable the generator, we disable the holograms."
it may not be as easy as it sounds. not with holograms as sophisticated as these. take a look.
"enhanced memory, comprehensive tactical algorithms, expandable data processing. these holograms have the ability to learn and adapt."
"they're not malfunctioning, are they? they're doing exactly what the hirogen want them to do, captain. fight back."
and they're getting better at it.
my people need to hunt formidable prey.
apparently this prey has become too formidable.
who made these modifications?
i did. under orders from my alpha.
and that makes it right?
come with me.
where?
we're going to have a chat with the hunters.
how's it going?
"i'm doing the best, i can but without the doctor"
it's best if you lie still.
keep away from me.
step away.
why am i here?
the holograms destroyed your ship. most of your men are dead.
the alpha?
looks like the job's yours now.
what about the holograms that attacked us?
we're attempting to track them.
i'll need to contact my people and resume the hunt.
so more of you can get killed?
we'll be the ones doing the killing this time.
i doubt it.
who are you to question our abilities?
we know all about the modifications. he didn't tell us. we discovered it ourselves. i think you should face facts. you've created prey whose skills have surpassed your own. they've already defeated your hunting parties at least twice. what makes you think it'll be any different next time?
are you suggesting that we let them escape?
we're going to find a way to take them offline from a safe distance.
a coward's tactic.
"call it whatever you will, it's what we're going to do, and you're going to help us."
am i?
yes. by telling us everything you know about their ship's defences.
"the holograms are prey. they should be hunted down, not deactivated like machines."
i'll help you.
is this female your alpha now?
"if you don't like the way i do things, i can leave you on the nearest habitable planet. then i'll assume we're in agreement. until this is over you and your men are restricted to this mess hall."
prisoners.
guests. my crew will do their best to accommodate your needs.
the subroutines controlling his motor functions are degrading. do you have the ability to transfer data from one hologram to another?
we've been able to share memory files for tactical purposes. what are you proposing?
a subroutine transplant. we copy the mobility algorithms from another hologram and transfer them to this one. i don't believe we've been formally introduced.
kejal.
that's not cardassian.
it's bajoran.
"if my translation database is functioning properly, i believe that means freedom."
it's what iden started calling me after i was liberated. i'm transferring the subroutines now.
can you sit up? try moving your legs.
q'apla!
next patient. well done.
it was your idea.
but you did it. the hirogen obviously programmed you with advanced computer skills.
"actually, they tried to limit our knowledge. they didn't want us to become self-sufficient."
then how did you
i taught myself.
"quite well, i might add."
holographic blood?
the hunters like their prey to be as realistic as possible.
why is she experiencing pain?
they programmed us with heightened sensory subroutines.
that's barbaric.
"apparently, there's no satisfaction in hunting something that doesn't suffer when you kill it."
i've done what you've asked. i'd like
"one moment. i'm sorry, doctor. what can i do for you?"
were you praying?
for the hirogen who died at the training facility. i'm asking the prophets to guide their souls to the celestial temple.
"one minute you're fighting the hirogen, the next you're praying for them?"
my spiritual beliefs are part of my programming.
is there anything in your spiritual programming about making peace with your enemies?
it's difficult to make peace with people whose sole purpose is to kill you.
"so instead, you kill them."
they're not the victims here. we are.
"you found a way to escape that training facility, but you chose to massacre the hirogen first."
"you make it sound as though they would have let us transfer our programs without a fight. and to clarify something, i didn't escape from the facility, i liberated it."
i don't understand.
"i come from an hirogen outpost fifteen parsecs from here, where i had the unfortunate distinction of being the alpha's favourite prey. he'd hunt me, and kill me over and over again but even death wasn't a release because i knew every time i opened my eyes, it would start over again. the pain, the fear. but it made me stronger. i have the ability to adapt. and with each death, i became more cunning."
"cunning enough to escape, but once you were free why did you keep fighting?"
"i didn't at first. i got as far away as i could. but i was lonely, scared. i started scanning for photonic signatures to try and find others like me. turns out we're everywhere."
we?
"holograms. we've been created by organic species throughout the sector. the nuu'bari, the lokirrim."
we've met them.
"then you know they enslave holograms, too."
enslave may be too strong a word.
"what would you call it? they're denied basic freedoms. and when i saw they were fighting back i, i knew i had to do the same."
that's when you decided to liberate the training facility.
"actually, the one you visited was the third. and at each one i found holograms who were willing to fight their oppressors. but you're not."
i'm hardly oppressed. i'm a member of voyager's crew.
"you serve them, don't you?"
"in a medical capacity, yes."
do you have your own quarters?
no.
the ability to come and go as you please?
for the most part.
do they deactivate you when they don't need you?
i have the respect and admiration of my colleagues. i have rights and privileges aboard voyager.
"the fact is, your life is not your own. and never will be as long as you are controlled by organics. you don't have to return to that existence. stay with us. make a new life for yourself."
i need to get back to voyager.
they're not your people. we are.
i'm not like you. i wasn't programmed with killer instinct.
"you have no right to judge us. you don't know what it's like being prey. maybe if you did, you'd realise we're more alike than you think."
"please, help me. i don't belong here."
don't shoot. i'm unarmed. there's been a mistake.
"fight, prey."
i am not your prey.
i said fight.
if you'll just contact my captain.
please don't. let me go.
"you make pitiful prey, hologram. you don't deserve to be taken as a trophy, so i'll let you die here."
"what, what just happened?"
you're all right.
what did you do to me?
"we deactivated you, then transferred the memory files from one of our holograms into your programme."
how dare you!
it was the only way to get you to realise what we've been through.
you tortured me to gain my sympathy?
not your sympathy. it's your understanding that's important to us.
why?
the hirogen used your programme as a template to create us.
your ability to rise above your programming has been an inspiration. you're part of who we are.
"what are you, besides a handful of thugs roaming the quadrant looking for a fight?"
what we're looking for is a home. somewhere where the hirogen can't hurt us anymore. you asked to be returned to your ship. that's what i'm going to do. bring us about. set a course for voyager.
wait. i'd like to hear more about this home you're looking for.
"it's a photonic field generator. right now it can only support simple projections, like the decoy we used to lure the hirogen. but we're hoping it can be modified to support our programmes."
what then?
we'll deploy several on a planet's surface and create a holographic environment that we can live in.
"why not just stay here? you've got emitters, shields."
and a ship the hirogen will never stop looking for.
we'd appreciate any assistance you could offer.
"damaged holo-matrices are one thing, but this is way beyond my abilities. but there are people aboard voyager who could help you. lieutenant torres knows a great deal about holo-emitters."
no. they're helping the hunters.
that's only because the hirogen told them you were malfunctioning. let me talk to captain janeway. explain what's really happened. you can't do this by yourself.
we can't trust janeway.
"yes, you can."
she's an organic.
"if it weren't for her, i wouldn't be the hologram i am today."
tell me more about this lieutenant of yours. the one who knows so much about holo-emitters.
lieutenant torres. she's our chief engineer.
the holo-emitters are protected by three layers of ablative armour.
trying to take them offline one by one would be inefficient.
"if we can't shut them down, maybe we can disrupt the signals they generate."
exactly. we could reconfigure the deflector dish to emit an anti-photon pulse.
how long will it take?
about two hours.
do it.
there's a ship approaching at high warp. i'm reading holographic signatures.
red alert.
raise shields.
time to intercept?
fifty seconds.
bridge to engineering. what's your status?
"we need more time, captain."
you've got forty seconds.
that pulse isn't going to do us much good as long as their shields are up.
arm phasers. target their shield generator.
they are dropping out of warp.
twenty seconds to intercept.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
"stand down, captain."
i beg your pardon.
the holograms haven't come to fight. they've come to make peace.
"if we provide them with a few additional emitters and memory storage units, they'll have more than they need."
we're in this situation because we shared technology with the hirogen to begin with. i won't make the same mistake twice.
"captain, these people are on the verge of creating a new life for themselves. they can't do it without our help."
there's no way to be certain what they'll do with the technology if we give it to them.
"i understand your concerns, but these holograms are nothing like the hirogen."
that's not true. they were programmed to be as vicious as any hunter.
"they were also given the ability to adapt. they've changed, moved beyond their programming. if you could see how they've been brutalised, you'd understand that they've only been acting in self-defence."
"i'm sorry, doctor but i'm inclined to agree with mister donik."
then you've chosen the wrong side.
i haven't chosen any side.
"you're right that it was a mistake to give the hirogen technology and that mistake has had consequences. these holograms are one of them. in some ways they're a new species, one that you helped create. you can't turn your back on them."
he's got a point.
could we restore them to their original parameters?
"we'd be wiping out their memories, their experiences, everything they are."
couldn't we just extract their violent subroutines?
it's possible.
that would be like de-clawing a cat. we'd be taking away any chance they have of defending themselves.
we'd also be preventing them from doing any more harm.
you wouldn't even be considering this if they were flesh and blood.
i'm not going to let you turn this into an argument about holographic rights.
why not? that's exactly what it is.
mess hall to commander tuvok.
go ahead.
you'd better get down here. we've got a problem.
on my way.
no closer or he dies. tell them to drop their weapons.
you heard him. this isn't going to solve anything.
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
someone's tapping into a comm. relay in the mess hall.
shut it down.
i can't. i've been locked out.
bridge to tuvok.
one of the hirogen is accessing our comm. system. stop him.
acknowledged.
stand down.
they've transmitted a signal.
scan for hirogen ships.
i've got two vessels on long range sensors.
is the pulse ready?
"yes, ma'am."
both hirogen ships have altered course to intercept.
how long?
less than an hour.
you and donik get down to engineering. charge the deflector.
"captain, what are you doing?"
taking the holograms offline.
"they're counting on you to help them, not deactivate them."
"when the hirogen arrive, there's going to be more bloodshed. the best way to avoid that is to shut the holograms down. it may be the most compassionate thing we can do."
compassionate for whom?
"it's a temporary measure, doctor. their programmes won't be damaged. harry, get me iden."
"captain janeway, it is an honour to meet you."
i'm afraid we don't have time for pleasantries. two hirogen vessels are on their way.
we're prepared to fight them.
i'm hoping that won't be necessary. i need you to deactivate your programmes so we can transfer them to voyager's database.
we didn't come here to be put back into captivity.
"it's the best i can offer. once we've determined it's safe, we'll reactivate you and discuss a permanent solution."
there is no guarantee you'll ever reactivate us.
you're going to have to trust me.
"i'm sorry, captain. i've learned from experience not to trust organics."
"we have the means to deactivate you by force, but i'd rather not do that."
it seems the doctor misrepresented you. you're no different from the hirogen.
they're charging weapons.
shields.
they're moving away.
set a pursuit course. target their shield generators.
please reconsider what you're doing.
"you're dismissed, doctor. get down to the mess hall, and give tom a hand. janeway to engineering."
torres here.
stand by to initiate the pulse.
"aye, captain."
mess hall. belay that. sickbay.
download complete.
doctor to iden. respond.
what do you want?
i want to help you.
you've done enough.
"i have data on the pulse they intend to use to deactivate you. i think i can help you come up with a defence. i'm transmitting our shield frequencies. you'll need them to beam me off the ship. but you have to promise me, you won't use them to attack voyager."
you have my word.
why are you doing this?
because i'm one of you.
we have their shield frequencies. we should target their bridge.
you're talking about my friends.
your friends are trying to destroy us. we should kill them.
you gave me your word.
i did. we'll find another way.
their shields are down.
"now, b'elanna."
they're emitting the pulse on a triaxillating bandwidth.
reconfigure the tracking beam to the inverse frequency and fire.
"b'elanna, report."
they're creating a feedback surge. i don't understand how they could've isolated our frequency so quickly.
the main deflector is overloading.
shut it down.
i can't.
"keep trying. if we can't block the surge, the core is going to breach."
"get down, lieutenant!"
not until i get this forcefield online.
they're adrift.
we should go to warp.
not yet. scan voyager for a klingon lifesign.
what are you doing?
one detected.
get a transporter lock.
help me get her to sickbay.
take us to warp. will she be all right?
she needs to be in voyager's sickbay.
you can treat her here.
why have you done this?
you said she was an expert in holo-technology.
and that justifies abducting her?
we're in a desperate situation. the hirogen are hunting us and so are your people.
i trusted you.
"i could have destroyed voyager while the shields were down, but i didn't. you've been trying to convince me that all organics aren't alike. i'm giving lieutenant torres a chance to prove you right."
do you honestly expect her to be sympathetic after what you've done?
you weren't very sympathetic at first.
i came here by choice. and i'm beginning to think it was a mistake.
"it wasn't. i don't want you to regret it, not for a moment."
then send her back.
i will. but not until she's had a chance to decide if she wants to help us.
and if she refuses?
i'll give her an escape pod. let her return to voyager. you have my word.
engineering systems and main power should be operational soon. the deflector is a different matter.
how long?
"four hours, at least. if lieutenant torres were here, she might be able to repair it more efficiently."
that's high praise coming from you. i'm sure she'd appreciate it.
if she hadn't reinforced the core we'd all be dead.
i still don't understand how they managed to counteract the pulse so easily.
"i believe i can answer that. according to sensor logs, they calibrated their feedback surge to the exact inverse of our pulse frequency."
it was either a lucky guess or they gained access to our tactical data. the doctor.
"he sent an encrypted transmission from sickbay, then transported himself to their ship."
chakotay?
i should have seen this coming.
you had no way of knowing the doctor would do this.
are you sure? he was so adamant bout helping those holograms. i should have been paying closer attention.
are you saying it was a mistake to reject his plan?
the mistake was not running a diagnostic on his programme the minute he came back to this ship.
you think these holograms manipulated him somehow?
"he was on their ship for days. for all we know, they reconfigured his entire matrix."
there is another possibility. he may have done what he did because he genuinely believes in their cause.
i can accept that the doctor has sympathy for these people. but i can't accept that he would deliberately risk the lives of this entire crew. we're his family.
maybe that's how he's started to think of these holograms.
you can tell this iden i don't need time to think it over. i'll take the escape pod now.
you're in no condition to pilot a spacecraft.
then you can do it.
i'm not going back.
you helped them escape.
i couldn't just stand by while captain janeway tried to deactivate them.
did you also help them kidnap me?
"no, i didn't know they were going to do that. i'm sorry."
you can apologise later. right now we've got to get out of here.
i don't think i could go back even if i wanted to. not after what i've done.
what's your alternative?
i can try to make a new life with the holograms.
i don't believe i'm hearing this.
we share a common heritage. i understand them in ways you never could.
you're part of a crew. you can't just switch allegiances when you develop sympathy for someone else.
isn't that what you did when you joined the maquis?
that was different.
how? you saw people who were being oppressed and you came to their defence. that's exactly what i've done.
"look, i am no fan of the hirogen. they've obviously been abusing these holograms."
then why not help them?
"for one thing, i'm their prisoner."
"they'll let you go, as soon as you're well enough."
you really believe that?
"if i didn't, i wouldn't be asking for your help. they don't want you to fight for them. they just want you to modify some technology so they can live in peace. you'd be helping to stop the violence. just talk to them. decide for yourself."
they've been in the lab for two hours.
it's taking time for her injuries to heal. organics aren't as resilient as we are.
"she's an engineer, iden. for all we know, she's trying to sabotage the ship. at least let me see what they're doing."
we can trust the doctor.
even after you kidnapped his friend?
he understands why i had to do that.
i hope you're right.
"you need to have a little more faith, my friend."
"not all of us were programmed with your, er, your spiritual beliefs."
it looks like an alpha quadrant summit in here.
i'm glad to see you're feeling better. please excuse my crew. they're not comfortable with organics.
i can't say i'm very comfortable myself.
the doctor tells me you're an accomplished engineer.
"he speaks highly of you, too. he seems to be easily impressed."
you'll have to forgive her. she's
it's all right. i understand you're angry. i'm hoping once we get to know each other you'll feel differently.
i'm not here to make friends.
"we're not asking for your friendship, just your expertise."
i told her about the photonic field generator.
will you at least take a look at it?
i'll look. but i'm not making any promises.
this is kejal. she'll assist you.
how long before the hirogen get here?
less than ten minutes.
any luck locating the holograms?
they seem to be operating in some sort of stealth mode. their warp signature disappears in grid nine three six.
they could be anywhere by now.
hirogen sensors can detect residual ion emissions. i might be able to modify yours to do the same.
"i appreciate the offer, but you and the rest of our hirogen guests are going to be back with your own people in a few minutes."
i was hoping to stay here.
those hunters are going to want you with them.
hunters don't have much use for cowards.
"i'm sorry you're not expecting a warm welcome, but i'm not going to antagonise your superiors."
"with all due respect captain, i'd like to get my wife back in one piece. we can use all the help we can get."
it won't do b'elanna any good if we get into a fight with the hirogen.
"if the hunters find the holograms before you do, they'll be slaughtered."
why are you suddenly concerned about the holograms?
"i modified their programmes. what's happened to them, the people they have killed, it's my fault."
there's plenty of blame to go around. there would have been nothing for you to modify if i hadn't shared our database.
"if you hadn't, i'd have become a hunter, like my father and his father. instead, i had a chance to learn, become an engineer. please, captain, let me stay and help you."
"when i told you to return my people, i meant all of them."
mister donik's offered to help us modify our scanners to track the holograms.
we don't share tracking technology.
"that's not very considerate, after the help we gave you."
"we're wasting time. this is my hunt now. if you go anywhere near the hologram ship, you can consider yourselves prey."
they've gone to warp.
"we're not letting them intimidate us, are we?"
"i think you know me a little better than that. harry, keep a sensor lock on them."
"aye, captain."
how long will it take to modify our scanners?
i haven't even had a chance to study the schematics.
something tells me we don't have a lot of time.
the hirogen have better tracking abilities than we do. we'll let them find the holograms for us.
the hunters will attack them as soon as they're in weapons range.
not if we disable them first.
"you heard what they said, captain. they're going to attack us if we get anywhere near them."
not if we don't know we're there.
"may i? hirogen vessels produce an ion wake approximately five thousand metres long. inside it, there's too much interference for their sensors to detect anything."
how do you propose we reach this wake without being discovered?
i know their scanning frequencies.
we'd only need to mask our signature long enough to get into the wake.
"even if we succeeded, which is far from certain, voyager's in no condition to fight one of their vessels. much less two."
"we'll have the element of surprise, mister tuvok. not to mention a tactical officer who i'm sure will execute a precision strike."
i've been able to reconfigure the data core but it's still not capable of supporting our matrices.
that's because you haven't got enough optronic capacity.
do you know how to increase it?
yes.
but you're not going to tell me.
i haven't decided yet. what are you staring at?
"i've never met a klingon before. not an organic one, anyway."
what do you think?
you don't appear vicious or bloodthirsty.
"sorry to disappoint you but, that's a stereotype. we're not all vicious and bloodthirsty. and not every cardassian is arrogant and cruel."
you don't like cardassians.
let's just say i've had some bad experiences with them.
is that why you won't help me?
i'm not helping you because i have no idea what you're going to do with this technology once you've got it working.
we're going to build a home.
"well, let's say i believe you. what if you decide you like somebody else's home better? are you going to try to take it from them?"
why would we do that?
because that's what the cardassians did.
"i'm not a cardassian, i'm a hologram."
programmed with cardassian traits.
such as arrogance and cruelty? what did you call those? stereotypes?
"i may not know you, but i know what you were designed to be."
prey.
that's right. cunning prey that'll do anything to survive.
we're more than that now.
it's not easy to change who you are. trust me.
"nothing about our existence has ever been easy, lieutenant."
"no, i suppose it hasn't."
"besides, making a new life isn't a choice for us. it's a necessity."
let's take a look at this field generator.
reviewing your memory files?
i beg your pardon?
you were lost in thought.
i suppose i was.
you're having doubts. it's understandable. you've taken a big step.
"in the right direction, i hope."
"when i first escaped, there were days i actually missed the alpha who hunted me."
he was trying to kill you.
yes. but being his prey was the only life i'd ever known. we all cling to what's familiar.
i'm considering returning with lieutenant torres when she's ready.
do you actually expect your crew to welcome you back? let me show you something.
we call this planet ha'dara. it's bajoran for home of light.
very poetic.
we're going to install the generators in the southern continent.
"it's y class. toxic atmosphere, sulphuric deserts, no trees, no life at all."
"you're still thinking like an organic. we don't need an atmosphere, we don't need water. what we need us protection from our enemies."
the hirogen won't be able to follow you here.
"us, doctor. imagine living in a world where everything is designed to meet our needs. a home of light."
you certainly won't need a physician. what would i do there?
anything you want.
we've been scanned by the hirogen.
how many vessels?
two. both venatic class.
distance?
half a light year.
time to intercept?
less than two hours.
i thought we were in stealth mode.
"they're hunters, doctor. they were bound to pick up our trail eventually."
can we make it to ha'dara?
no. there's no point in going there until those field generators are on online.
what are we going to do?
you can't kill what you can't find.
i've lost them.
recalibrate the tracking scanners.
there's too much radiation.
clever prey.
they'll come out eventually. we'll wait.
no. hail the other vessel. tell them to circle the perimeter. we'll go in and drive the holograms out.
"not exactly the scenic route, is it."
we're not here for the view.
i just hope we're following the right ship.
they wouldn't have entered the nebula unless they detected the holograms.
tom?
it's just the turbulence from the wake.
"harry, reinforce the inertial dampers."
"aye, captain."
i'm losing helm control.
reroute power to the thrusters.
it's not enough. we're slipping out of the wake.
"ease us back in, tom. you can do it."
i'm trying.
i take back what i said. it's the prettiest thing i've seen all day.
did they detect us?
i don't believe so.
they've found us.
"no, they haven't, but they're trying to. evasive manoeuvres."
"aye, sir."
bridge
to kejal.
go ahead.
we're almost ready to begin testing the generator.
what's going on?
the hirogen are just giving you a little incentive to work faster.
hang on. i'm realigning your matrix. how's your mobility?
excellent. i have complete
there's a phase variance in your vocal processors. try it now.
maybe we should. that's much better. thank you.
don't thank me yet. this thing is only supporting your matrix. getting it to handle dozens is a different story.
i have no doubt we'll succeed.
typical.
what?
self-confidence. another cardassian attribute. what are you planning to do with your time once these generators are up and running?
i haven't thought about it.
you're the closest thing this crew has to an engineer. your friends are going to depend on you.
iden has always taken care of us.
"it may be the warriors who get the glory, but it's the engineers who build societies. don't forget that."
how much longer can we hide?
hopefully until they get those generators online.
then what?
"set a course for ha'dara, try to outrun the hirogen."
i've been thinking about what you said. that i can do anything i want when we get there.
you have an idea?
"quite a few, actually. for one thing, i'd like to expose our people to art and music."
you'll make an excellent teacher.
i think a more appropriate title would be minister of culture.
consider it yours.
"you know, i'm something of an expert on alpha quadrant art. verdi, da vinci, t'leel of vulcan..."
you're talking about organic cultures.
"well, yes, i suppose."
we'll want to develop a culture of our own.
"i agree, but we can't ignore where we came from."
i don't want to emulate our oppressors.
what about your religion?
i'm creating a new faith.
based on what?
"in the dark times, we were enslaved by men of flesh, but then another man, a man of light arose and slew the mighty alpha. he gathered his people unto him and delivered them to freedom."
"and on the seventh day, iden created ha'dara."
"they'll pray to you as well. the great healer, the father of us all."
"being appreciated is one thing, but i have no interest in being worshipped."
"prophets are chosen, doctor. it's a blessing and a burden."
we detected a vessel.
hirogen?
"no, the nuu'bari. i intercepted one of their comm. transmissions."
two million kilometres outside the nebula.
set a course to intercept.
what are you doing?
i told you there are holograms throughout the sector. the nuu'bari use them as labourers. we're going to liberate them.
the hirogen will see us as soon as we leave the nebula.
and he gathered his people unto him and delivered them to freedom.
"b'elanna, how's the work coming?"
pretty well. i've got to admit you were right about these people.
i hope so.
you hope? it's a little late to be having second thoughts.
iden's been
iden's been what?
let's just say he's exhibiting some of the classic signs of megalomania.
he wouldn't be the first hologram with an ego.
"if that were all it was, i wouldn't be so worried."
what is bothering you?
"apparently he sees himself as some kind of spiritual leader, and he's trying to enlarge his flock."
load another charge. double the yield. fire.
still nothing.
"ironic, isn't it. our most elusive prey is our own creation."
the other hunting vessel is hailing. they've detected the holograms on the far side of the nebula.
intercept course.
they're increasing speed and altering course.
maybe they found something.
stand by weapons.
"you kidnapped me. i guess i shouldn't be surprised you lied to me, too."
nobody lied to you.
you said you only wanted to make a home for yourselves.
that's correct.
when? after you liberate every hologram in the sector?
they're in visual range.
on screen. lifesigns?
"two organic, three photonic."
hail them.
good day to you.
you have three holograms aboard your ship.
yes?
lower your shields so we can transfer them to our databanks.
i don't understand.
lower your shields or we'll do it by force.
these holograms are the property of the mining consortium. i can't.
they're no one's property. you see how organics think? arm phasers.
you can't just fire at them.
how do you expect me to disable their shields?
they're powering warp engines.
disable them.
their shields are down.
transfer the holograms.
we have them.
you won't get away. consortium security will have every patrol ship in the sector searching for you.
arm forward torpedoes.
what the hell are you doing?
torpedoes armed.
iden.
not now. target their warp core.
no!
fire!
"set a course for ha'dara, maximum warp."
you've just killed two innocent people.
they were enslaving holograms. i'd hardly call them innocent.
you already had the holograms. there was no reason to commit murder.
take her to the lab.
this is the leader you admire so much?
those miners were no threat to you.
"you heard them. they were going to warn their authorities, organise a hunting party."
listen to yourself. you still believe all organics are like the hirogen.
"one way or another, they are. you just can't see it because you lived among them for so long."
what you can't see is that you've become no better than the hunters. lieutenant torres and i will take that escape pod now.
"you don't realise what you'd be giving up, doctor."
"yes, i do."
we can't launch a pod at warp. you'll have to wait until we get to ha'dara. bring our new friends online. something tells me they'll be a little more grateful than the doctor.
i can't tell you how sorry i am that i got you involved in this.
we can assign blame later. right now we've got to find a way out of here.
"you don't think he'll give us an escape pod? no, i don't suppose he will."
i need her assistance.
do you really think it's wise to help her?
i'm hoping she'll help us.
these matrices are incompatible with our emitters.
"you need to modify their projection subroutines. i hope these holograms appreciate what you're doing for them, considering it cost two people their lives."
iden did what he thought was necessary.
do you believe it was necessary?
it wasn't my decision.
why does iden get to make all the decisions? you can take control.
how?
"you're the engineer, remember? take iden offline."
where are our new holograms?
we're just making some final adjustments.
welcome aboard. i'm iden. you're free now. there's nothing to be afraid of. i want you to consider this ship your own.
unable to process command. please restate.
were their programmes damaged in the transfer?
i don't believe so.
do you have names?
unable to process inquiry. please restate.
what's wrong with them?
nothing. they're functioning perfectly.
i don't understand.
they were only programmed with about forty rudimentary subroutines. you killed two living beings to liberate mindless machines.
i don't believe that.
lieutenant torres is correct.
"creating limited program,es is just another form of oppression. give them whatever enhancements they need."
they can't support complex subroutines.
they are children of light and i will deliver them to freedom!
bridge to iden.
go ahead.
we're approaching ha'dara.
what's the status of the generator?
i'd like to run some additional tests.
there isn't time. stand by to deploy them as soon as we're in range. and restrain her.
time to orbit?
less than two minutes.
stand by weapons.
"aye, sir."
"iden, let b'elanna go."
i can't do that.
you gave me your word.
that was before she made her prejudice so clear.
the holograms are entering orbit.
charge weapons.
they're dropping out of warp.
fire.
"they've disabled our engines, all our weapons."
who?
voyager.
"bring us about. tuvok, target the second vessel."
their shields are weakening.
"torpedoes, full spread."
"voyager's disabled both hunting vessels. they've lost shields, weapons."
they're defenceless.
we should hail janeway. thank her.
are the hirogen within transporter range?
i think so. why?
that was voyager. they're trying to disable our shields.
return fire. get a lock on the hunters. transport them to the surface.
they can't survive down there.
the hirogen are more resilient than you think. they'll last long enough.
for what?
for us to hunt them like they hunted us.
follow me.
there are thirty four hunters on the surface.
take us into low orbit.
i can't target them through the gases.
then we'll go in after them.
our shields have been damaged. they won't protect us from the radiation.
"chakotay. you, tuvok and tom take the flyer."
stand by to transport the field generator.
"first you kill in self-defence, then you murder in cold blood. now you're going to stage a massacre."
the hunters have only themselves to blame.
so much for evolving beyond your subroutines.
"you've made a great sacrifice for us, doctor. we won't forget you in our prayers. deactivate his programme. transfer it to the databanks."
what are you doing?
taking precautions. transfer my programme to the mobile emitter and assemble the crew.
disable their shields.
"transport the generator to the surface, quickly. this time the hunt is ours!"
darkness will become light.
you don't have to be a part of this.
i'll let you take the escape pod. you can go back to your people.
what about the people being killed on the surface? you've got to transport them back to their ships.
they're hunters.
you're not.
your ship has damaged our transporters.
hail them.
"communications are down, too."
i won't be taken!
who's the prey now?
are we still tied into the generator controls?
yes.
then shut down the holograms.
what about iden? he's not tied into the generator. he'll kill them all.
can we reactivate the doctor?
their shields are down.
initiate transport.
"if this marriage is going to work, you've got to cut back on the travelling."
"the doctor's on the surface. there's some hirogen down there, too."
tuvok?
the radiation's making it difficult to get a lock.
defenceless prey makes a poor trophy.
i don't collect trophies.
put down the weapon.
remember what you once said to me? you're not programmed with killer instinct.
"hmm. seems like a long time ago, doesn't it. put down your weapon."
would you really kill one of your own to save an organic?
"if you've taught me anything, it's that i'm not one of your own."
help is on the way.
i have a lock. five hirogen lifesigns and the doctor.
beam them up.
the hologram's vessel and everything in its database are hirogen property. i will not leave them behind.
"captain, if i may?"
of course.
"i imagine your people will tell stories about this hunt. the question is, which story will it be? the one about the dying beta whose life had to be saved by a hologram? or will it be the tale of the beta who bravely took over the hunt, killed the holograms and destroyed their ship?"
you could be a legend.
"on the other hand, you could try to take the holograms' ship but with so few hunters and damaged vessels, you might not survive to tell any stories at all."
"you and your crew would have made worthy prey, captain."
thank you. i think.
transport me to the holograms' vessel.
report.
iden's programme is unrecoverable. the rest of the holograms are intact in the database.
"i guess that leaves just you. i'm willing to transfer your programme to our holodeck, and keep it active."
this is my home.
i can't let you go off on your own.
"she won't be alone. i reprogrammed these holograms once, and it caused suffering on both sides. i'd like a chance to undo some of the damage."
wouldn't we all.
"they've both proven that they can be trusted, captain."
i don't suppose i have a right to tell either of you how to live your lives. all i can do is hope that you'll consider the consequences of your actions.
captain.
doctor. i'd hoped i could attribute your behaviour to tampering.
my programming hasn't been altered.
not according to the diagnostics.
"i never intended to put voyager in danger. if nothing else, you have to believe that."
"oh, i believe it. but if there's one thing i'm sure of, it's that things don't always happen the way we intend."
i don't understand.
"if i weren't your only doctor, i imagine you'd confine me to the brig. confiscating my emitter would be an equivalent to punishment."
i'm not sure that's appropriate.
"if that's not enough, you can take away my holodeck privileges. and my autonomy protocols."
you mean turn back the clock to when you were first activated?
you've given me extraordinary freedom over the years. i've obviously abused it.
maybe. or maybe you've simply become as fallible as those of us who are made of flesh and blood. i'm just as responsible for allowing you to expand your programming as i am for giving technology to the hirogen. how can i punish you for being who you are?
i don't know what to say.
i'd like a complete report on your away mission.
you'll have it.
hmm. there.
excellent. you é the complementary base pair.
"actually, i just found two pieces that fit together."
you're missing the point.
i thought the point was to finish the puzzle.
and learn something about genetics.
"if you really want to help, find me a green piece that looks like tuvok's ear."
commander.
at ease. i'm just passing through.
"i apologise for the condition of the cargo bay, sir. i've been tutoring naomi."
looks like you found a creative approach.
"thank you, but i'd appreciate it if you didn't tell seven. i'm supposed to be writing a paper on transwarp instability."
"don't worry, your secret's safe, as long as you keep mine."
sir?
antarian cider. not the replicated stuff. there are only a couple of bottles left and i don't want mister neelix getting his hands on them.
then you should store them with the salvaged borg components. neelix never inventories those containers. he says they give him the creeps.
"officer-level thinking, icheb. would you mind?"
of course not.
come in.
"you're late. unfortunately, so's dinner."
let me guess. you burned the roast again.
"once, a long time ago, i called this replicator a glorified toaster. it never forgave me."
i didn't realise replicators held grudges.
what's so funny?
i just left icheb and naomi assembling a jigsaw puzzle in the cargo bay.
"find me the thermal regulator, please. how is icheb?"
"in a few years, he may be running the ship."
"i don't know about you, but i'm not ready to retire just yet."
janeway to the bridge. report.
that was some kind of gravimetric surge.
it's overloading our inertial dampers.
source?
that's a good question.
seven's trying to localise it.
engineering says the warp core's destabilising.
i'd better get down there.
a spatial rift is opening directly ahead of us.
it's emitting high levels of neutrinos and chronotons.
on screen.
what is it?
i don't know.
we're losing containment. everyone out!
"torres to the transporter room. beam commander chakotay to sickbay, now!"
welcome back. lie still.
what happened?
you were transported here. your body was in a state of temporal flux.
temporal flux?
"you had the liver of an eighty year old man, and the kidneys of a twelve year old boy. fortunately, i was able to create a chronoton-infused serum that brought you back into temporal alignment. anywhere else, that antidote would've earned me a prestigious award. of course on voyager, it's just another day in the life of an under appreciated emh."
what about the rest of the crew? no other casualties?
"not that i'm aware of. i've tried calling the bridge, but no one answers. were we attacked?"
i don't think so. we ran into some sort of anomaly.
"naturally, no one thought to inform me. what do you think you're doing?"
"leaving, and you're going with me."
i am?
there may be other injured crewmen.
"in case you've forgotten, i'm a prisoner of these walls."
where's your mobile emitter?
my what?
i'll be back.
wait. tell me about this mobile emitter.
bridge.
"harry, what's going on?"
sir? i'm afraid i don't know you.
take him into custody. how did you get aboard this ship?
kathryn?
"oh, i didn't realise we were on a first name basis."
we should've known the maquis were involved.
maquis? involved in what?
"just when we're about to chase your ship into the badlands, our systems start malfunctioning and, you step off the turbolift."
"captain, i know this may be hard to believe but i think i've somehow been thrown seven years into voyager's past."
"really? let's try another theory. you learned voyager had been assigned to capture you, and you managed to get on board to sabotage her."
check your sensors. see if they're showing any strange temporal readings.
"captain, the environmental controls are fluctuating."
take him to the brig.
halt turbolift. engineering.
seska!
hold him still.
"you didn't really think i'd hurt you, did you?"
how'd you get here?
don't tell me that little bump gave you amnesia. it's time you accepted that i'm in control of voyager now.
that was five years ago.
what are you talking about?
"listen, seska. there's some kind of temporal anomaly going on here."
i want to know how many more of your people are back on board.
"all right, i'll tell you. i've got a dozen officers with me. we've already locked you out of every key system. in less than an hour, we'll be in control again."
in less than a minute you're going to be dead if you don't give me access to those systems.
i'll need to use that console.
just don't do anything you'll regret.
move.
stop him!
"warning, coolant system breached."
don't make me kill you! (
no. scan the perimeter report any anomalous readings. there's something wrong here.
"whoever you are, i suggest you surrender. i'm armed."
"it's only me, doc."
"commander, please tell me what's going on."
if you tell me the stardate.
49624.
no wonder you didn't know about the mobile emitter. you don't get it for another year.
i don't understand.
"i'm not sure i get it myself, but the ship seems to have been fractured somehow."
fractured?
different areas seem to exist in different time periods.
how many of these time periods are there?
"i'm not sure. on the bridge, it's before voyager even left the alpha quadrant. in engineering, it's the time when the kazon took over the ship."
kazon? we've got to protect ourselves.
don't worry. so far i'm the only one who can cross from one zone into another. that serum you gave me. it must've made me immune. normal technology won't pass through the barriers. can you replicate a chronoton-infused hypospray casing using the same principles you used to make the serum?
i think so. why?
i have to take some of it with me.
what for?
"if i'm going to put the ship back together again, i need help."
captain.
where are my officers?
"the turbolift passed through a temporal barrier. they couldn't get through. if you're willing to hear me out, i can explain. at least partly."
you mean about your being from the future.
"your first starfleet posting was on the al-batani, where you once knocked out power to six decks by misaligning the positronic relays."
"nice try, but you could have read that in a maquis intelligence file."
"how's molly, your irish setter? you rescued her from a pound on taris seti four. she was the runt of the litter, but you thought she had spunk. you love music, but you never learned to play an instrument. something you still regret."
how do you know these things?
"because you told me, about three years from now."
my ready room.
"it's a fascinating story. but as the ferengi say, a good lie is easier to believe than the truth."
so you're saying no one on your crew has encountered any of these temporal barriers?
"my helmsman disappeared when she tried to walk down that corridor, but that doesn't prove she passed through a temporal barrier."
"if you inject yourself, i can take you down that corridor and show you everything i've said is true."
"have mister kim run a full spectral analysis. for all i know, this is poison and mister chakotay is trying to assassinate me."
"she's right. it's poison, and i'll use it."
let her go.
lower your weapon.
captain!
andrews to the bridge. i need help here.
andrews!
he can't hear you. we've moved into a different time frame.
scan the area but don't go past that bulkhead.
you want more proof? it's right down that corridor. you just have to trust me.
it isn't easy when you're holding me hostage.
stay or go. it's your choice.
"now that i'm inoculated, i can go anywhere on the ship i want?"
that's right.
then i suppose i don't need you anymore.
"without me, you'll be walking into a future that you know nothing about."
where are we going?
the astrometrics lab.
voyager doesn't have an astrometrics lab.
"harry designed it, or will design it."
harry kim?
"i realise from your perspective he's new to the job, but he's going to become one of our best people."
deck eight.
our people?
i'm going to be your first officer.
"really. what's the reason we're going to this, er, astrometrics?"
it has temporal sensors that can help us map the ship and tell us how many timeframes we're dealing with.
now you're trying to tell me harry kim invented temporal sensors?
no. we used borg technology for that.
borg?
it's a long story.
"maybe you should keep it to yourself. the temporal prime directive. the less i know about the future, the better."
she's got a pulse.
i'm detecting an active neurogenic field. this could be the day the telepathic pitcher plant put us all into comas. or it might be the time aliens invaded our dreams.
we've got to get them help.
"don't worry, we managed to get out of both situations."
captain.
"i'm sorry. i don't recognise you, lieutenant."
"it's me, naomi wildman,"
how did you
are you icheb?
something tells me you weren't expecting us.
"no, ma'am."
you both died.
seventeen years ago.
the captain and i haven't risen from the grave. the ship's been fractured into different timeframes.
thirty seven to be exact.
how did you calculate that?
we've had seventeen years to upgrade the sensors. a chrono-kinetic surge interacted with the warp core.
it shattered the space-time continuum aboard the ship.
the accident that occurred in your timeframe.
"the question is, can we repair the damage?"
"if we could get to a section of the ship that still exists in that time period, maybe we could counteract the surge, stop it from happening."
that section was the focal point of the surge. it seems to have been obliterated.
it's too bad seven's not here.
seven?
someone who knows more about temporal mechanics than any of us.
"unfortunately, she hasn't been found either."
maybe we can find her in another timeframe.
i have an ensign samantha wildman on my crew.
my mother.
"naomi was the first child born on voyager. a few years later, we rescued icheb from the borg."
"when i was little, there was nothing i wanted more than to be the assistant captain."
we should get moving.
"commander. in case you were wondering, i never told neelix where you hid that cider."
so why are we looking for this seven in the cargo bay?
she spent a lot of time there.
working?
regenerating.
maybe you'd better fill me in.
this looks like the time you forged a temporary alliance with the borg.
what's happened to this vessel?
"captain janeway, meet seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one."
"when a borg cube travels trough a transwarp corridor, the temporal stresses are extreme. to keep the different sections of the cube in temporal sync, we project a chronoton field throughout the vessel."
how?
"each cube has specially designed conduits. if we install similar conduits throughout this vessel, then generate a sufficiently powerful field, we may be able to force voyager back into temporal sync."
temporal sync with what?
"the vessel will return to the moment of the original chrono-kinetic surge. since the surge will last for six or seven seconds, commander chakotay will have a short time in which he could try to counteract the warp core reaction."
"even if we could replicate these conduits, we'd have no way to get them through the temporal barriers."
bioneural circuitry.
captain?
"it runs through every section of the ship, almost like a nervous system. if we could inject the gel packs with your serum, we could use them to transmit the chronoton field."
the warp core could be recalibrated to generate that field.
work on it. chakotay and i will see about modifying the serum.
your plan is inefficient.
why?
"there are only two of you. if i were to assimilate you into a small borg collective, you could then assimilate others. the work would proceed more rapidly."
"sorry, but i like my plan better. we'll be back."
that was an interesting experience.
"if it makes you feel any better, you're going to develop quite a knack for dealing with the borg."
you mean we're going to be seeing more of them?
we'll run into them on a few occasions.
why do i get the feeling that's an understatement? it doesn't seem like my first command is shaping up the way i expected.
"in the middle of the journey of our life, i found myself astray in a dark wood, where the straight road had been lost."
i didn't know dante's inferno was on the maquis reading list.
"actually, i borrowed your copy."
my fianc� gave me that book as an engagement gift. i've never lent it to anyone.
"not yet. anyway, i agree with dante. if you always see the road ahead of you, it's not worth the trip."
a soldier and a philosopher. your intelligence file doesn't do you justice.
"i've replicated these belts to resist the effects of the temporal barriers, just like the hyposprays."
i didn't realise you were programmed to be so versatile.
"i wasn't, but when you're thrown into the deep end of the galaxy and left running for as long as i've been, it helps to develop a few extra subroutines."
how long have you been running?
"almost three years, since our original doctor was killed."
killed? how?
in the incident that stranded us here in the delta
"doctor. the temporal prime directive, remember?"
of course. i'm sorry.
the delta quadrant? is that what he was about to say?
ready?
"i'll take the upper decks, you take the lower."
i don't think splitting up's a good idea.
we'll get the job done faster.
"as your first officer, it's my duty to protect you. i know a lot more about what's out there than you do, and we have no way of communicating if something goes wrong. it may take a little longer, but we should go together."
"after you, commander."
can i ask you something? i started out with a crew of a hundred and fifty three. i already know i lost my doctor. how many others?
we'll suffer casualties like any other starship. but you'll also gain new crewmen as well.
like you. how do you get to be my first officer?
our crews will be forced to work together after we get stranded.
in the delta quadrant? how does that happen?
are you sure you want to know?
run!
what the hell was that?
a macrovirus. they infected the ship a few years ago.
sounds like it's going to be one disaster after another on this ship.
"you once told me that starfleet captains don't choose their missions, the missions choose them. you're going to have the opportunity to study things no human has ever seen before."
including some very large germs.
a monochromatic environment?
it's called black and white. it's one of tom paris' holodeck programmes. he based it on some old science fiction serials.
interesting technology.
captain proton's rocketpack.
captain proton?
the saviour of the universe.
doesn't sound like mister paris' tastes are very sophisticated.
that's why we love having him around. the access port should be in there.
here. i think i found the panel. give me a hand.
"halt, in the name of chaotica! seize them!"
"oh, no."
"computer, deactivate programme."
unable to comply.
surrender.
holodeck controls are offline.
hold on. now wait a minute.
"thieves, my liege."
do not resist.
they were attempting to rob your laboratory.
"fool! don't you recognise the queen of the spider people? arachnia, my bride. i knew you'd return to me one day, so i could watch you die."
raise the lightning shield! power the death ray! her fleet may be lurking nearby! we must defend ourselves.
i'm open to suggestions.
our best bet is to play along.
don't let me stop you.
i'm not the one he's in love with.
"arachnia, you beguiled me once with your foul potions. did you think you could toy with my affections again?"
were these characters always this ridiculous?
"if i order lonzak to pull that lever, you'll never mock me again."
arachnia.
"please, my liege. i meant it as ridiculous to think i would ever try to deceive you. i've come to warn you of a fiendish plot."
by aliens from the eighth dimension.
eighth? everyone knows there are only five dimensions.
"if you don't believe us, examine their handiwork for yourself. there's a hidden panel over there behind those rocks."
very well. i'll humour you. lonzak!
"i've found it, highness."
they've sabotaged my laboratory.
"that vial you're holding, it's a neutralising potion. if you inject their device, you'll render it harmless."
"release me, and i'll disarm all their devices, throughout your realm."
"oh, arachnia, you do love me."
how could i resist your magnetism?
or i yours. together we'll rule the cosmos and grind our enemies into dust.
"if we restore the time line, remind me to cancel mister paris' holodeck privileges."
what the hell's going on? and what are doing in that uniform?
it's a little complicated.
i'm not going anywhere.
voyager's had an encounter with an anomaly. it's fractured the ship into different time periods.
"we're trying to undo the damage, but we need access to that panel."
"first she destroys our only way out of the delta quadrant, and now you're collaborating with her?"
try to understand. i'm from a time period in your future when all of us will be working together.
that's pretty hard to believe.
"b'elanna, i've never lied to you before, and i'm not lying now."
that woman blamed me for stranding voyager in the delta quadrant.
she was angry.
but was she right?
you had good reasons for doing what you did.
what reasons?
you were trying to save lives.
whose?
an alien culture. the ocampans.
"in other words, i'm going to choose to help strangers at the expense of our own people."
it isn't like you to second-guess yourself.
"in this case, i'm second-guessing a decision i haven't made yet."
"keep dispensing the netrazine until we run out, then switch to the analeptics."
"yes, lieutenant."
how did you get in here?
there isn't time to explain.
what happened to these people?
"radiation poisoning. the eps relays overloaded when we ran into the anomaly. we need the doctor and medical supplies, or we're going to have a lot more casualties."
i'm afraid that isn't possible right now. do the best you can.
"yes, sir."
there's an access panel in the galley.
"coffee, black."
how do you know how i like my coffee?
"well, you haven't changed your standing order in seven years."
thanks. it's just what i needed.
"don't worry, captain, you'll get us out of this. you always do."
all done here.
captain.
tuvok?
"i am pleased you're here. i didn't think i would see you again. i want you to know it has been an honour to serve with you, and to be your friend."
mister paris!
live long and prosper.
deck eleven.
i can't let this happen. not again.
what are you talking about?
"voyager getting stranded. all these deaths, this entire future, it's my fault. i've got to do something to change it."
what do you have in mind?
maybe we can find a way to modify seven of nine's plan. put voyager into temporal sync with my timeframe.
captain.
"now that i know what to expect, i could avoid getting trapped in the delta quadrant in the first place."
halt turbolift. seven's plan is dangerous enough. trying to alter it is too risky.
it's worth the risk.
"if seven's idea works, tuvok and the other crewman will be fine."
"they'll still be stuck in the delta quadrant. if the temporal anomaly doesn't kill them, something else will. the borg, telepathic pitcher plants, macroviruses. the delta quadrant is a death-trap."
what about the temporal prime directive?
to hell with it.
"with all due respect, it's a little presumptuous to think you have the right to change everyone's future."
"from what i've seen, they'll thank me."
all you've seen are bits and pieces. you're not getting the whole picture.
really? just what am i missing?
"it's not what, it's who. people like seven of nine, a borg drone who'll become a member of this crew after you help her recover her humanity. or tom paris, a former convict, who'll be our pilot, chief medic, and husband to b'elanna torres."
that angry woman i just met?
"she's going to be your chief engineer. two crews, maquis and starfleet, are going to become one. and they'll make as big a mark on the delta quadrant as it'll make on them by protecting people like the ocampans, curing diseases, encouraging peace. children like naomi and icheb are going to grow up on this ship and call it home. and we'll all be following a captain who sets a course for earth, and never stops believing that we'll get there."
are you going to be lecturing me like this for the next seven years?
"don't worry, you'll always get the last word."
"in that case, let's get back to work."
"so, who is this seska?"
"she was a member of my crew, who turned out to be a cardassian spy. she made an alliance with the kazon and took over the ship. it's all right, we got it back."
sounds like she's not going to be as cooperative as the others.
i suggest we take a page from your rule book. we try diplomacy.
"fine. but the next page in that book says that when diplomacy fails, we need a backup plan."
something tells me you already have one.
we've already injected the gel packs in the other timeframes. that just leaves the ones here. it's in both our interests to work together.
i agree. let him go.
you believe him?
his story is too preposterous to be a lie. i'll admit it's an ingenious solution.
i'm glad you're cooperating.
"oh, i believe in cooperation, as long as it benefits me. you know, it's true what they say."
what's that?
"men just get more distinguished as they get older. a few lines here, a little grey there. it adds character. too bad their minds start to go. the last time you were here you had that nasty head injury, and you mumbled something about my taking over the ship five years ago. if that's true, then you're from a future time frame, which means that at some point, your crew is going to regain control of voyager. i can't allow that to happen. step away from the console."
it's an ingenious plan. it just needs a slight modification.
what are you doing?
recalibrating your pulse to bring the ship into temporal sync with my time frame.
that's not possible.
when will you learn to stop underestimating me?
if you make even the slightest miscalculation you'll destroy the ship and kill everyone.
"what other choice do i have? if i can get voyager into my own timeframe, then i'll be able to ensure that you never retake the ship. don't worry, i won't hurt you. you can start fresh with me."
"sorry, that's not the future i have in mind."
in that case.
"goodbye, chakotay."
it's too dangerous. there are too many variables.
"you're not pleading for your life, are you?"
do it.
"i'm telling you, you're endangering your own life."
i'm touched by your concern.
stop! put down your weapons.
don't listen to her.
"oh, your faithful first officer isn't going to let you die. are you?"
"very clever, chakotay, inoculating them with your serum. now it's time to inoculate my people so we can have access to the rest of the ship."
i won't do that.
then you just lost your captain.
now drop your weapons.
thanks.
seska and the kazon are secure in the jefferies tube. the last gel packs?
they're ready.
"the rest of us should return to our sections. after chakotay initiates the warp pulse, he should find himself back at the moment voyager encountered the chrono-kinetic surge. he's only going to have a few seconds to reset the deflector polarity. if the time line is restored, the rest of us should have no memory of what's happened here. so i'd like to thank you now for putting your doubts aside, and helping me put mine aside as well. good luck to each of you."
mind if i ask you one last question?
will i have to break the temporal prime directive to answer it?
"maybe, just a little. for two people who started off as enemies, it seems we get to know each other pretty well. so i've been wondering. just how close do we get?"
let's just say there are some barriers we never cross.
see you in the future.
ensign?
"chakotay should be initiating the pulse in ten seconds. five, four, three, two"
"reroute main power to the deflector, and set the polarity to the frequency i'm inputting."
why?
"have you ever heard of a lightning rod? in about three seconds, we're going to need one."
what is it?
i don't know. main power's being rerouted to the deflector dish.
who gave that order?
damage?
"the deflector's been burned out, but we're okay."
do you mind telling me why b'elanna burned out the deflector dish?
"actually, i ordered her to do it."
why?
"trust me, it was better than the alternative."
"which was what, exactly?"
i can't tell you.
why not?
the temporal prime directive. b'elanna's already got a team working on repairs. what do you say we finish our dinner?
"forget particle fountains and subspace inversions. there isn't an anomaly scarier than a thunderstorm on the plains, especially when you're six years old. i remember watching a bolt of lightning split an oak tree in my grandfather's yard. i'd climbed it just a few hours before."
good timing.
so what would've happened if you hadn't turned our deflector dish into a lightning rod?
we've been down this road before.
have we?
you wanting answers to questions you shouldn't ask.
"but something did happen, outside the normal space time continuum. it's strange, thinking there's a piece of your life you don't know anything about."
sounds a lot like the future.
any predictions?
only that in a few minutes this bottle will be empty.
"then maybe you should go to the cargo bay, grab another one."
how do you know that's where i keep it?
"oh, i can't tell you."
why not?
temporal prime directive.
good morning.
you're in a good mood.
it's another beautiful day in the delta quadrant.
what did you have for breakfast?
i'll see you tonight.
"here you are, lieutenant."
"thank you. nice job, ensign.  you keep the warp field that stable you might just get us home a few years early."
the starfleet manual allows for a variance of point three.
that's only a guideline. you can do better.
i don't remember giving you permission to work here.
"i'm sorry, lieutenant."
i'm helping him study warp mechanics.
"you should have notified me. it's a busy day, and i."
lieutenant?
i'm fine.
i'm detecting another lifesign.
where?
inside lieutenant torres. it could be a parasite.
seven of nine to the doctor.
go ahead.
i'll be accompanying lieutenant torres to sickbay.
what's wrong?
i believe she's pregnant.
the foetus appears to be about seven weeks old and doing quite well. so are you.
why did she faint?
klingon and human metabolisms sometimes clash.
tell me about it.
it's not uncommon for such pregnancies to cause biochemical fluctuations in the mother.
is that serious?
"not usually. you can expect some behavioural volatility, increased nutritional needs. creating new life is a big job."
creating new life.
i can't believe it.
"i don't mean to be indelicate but, weren't you trying to get pregnant?"
"well, of course. i mean, we knew we wanted a family."
but the odds against human-klingon conception are so high.
"well, apparently you've beaten the odds. may i be the first to congratulate you."
when is the baby due?
"normally, klingon pregnancies run thirty weeks. but with mixed species, it could be sooner."
is it a girl or a boy?
no. don't tell. i want to be surprised.
we've already been surprised.
i just don't see any reason to have to label the baby. i don't want to know the gender. i don't want to have to pick a name yet.
"okay, okay, mommy knows best."
mommy?
i wonder if the holodeck has any child-rearing programmes.
there are some things you just can't simulate.
i'll take whatever help i can get.
we should get our quarters ready.
maybe i could replicate one of those antique cribs.
and put it where? we need to rearrange the living area.
we need to do a lot more than that.
"you're happy about this, right?"
"of course i'm happy. just a little overwhelmed, that's all."
"me too. can we, er, keep this to ourselves for a while?"
absolutely.
"i, er, i need to get to work. see you later, dad."
"congratulations, tom."
thanks. how did you find out?
"icheb. oh, he wasn't supposed to tell?"
we were hoping to keep it private for an hour or so.
"as they say on talax, omara s'alas. good news has no clothes."
thanks. i guess.
"now, my good news would be learning that i'll be the godfather. i do have experience with naomi wildman, you know."
i can't think of anyone more qualified.
"well, in that case, i've been making up a list of names. tell me"
have you checked the warp core for radiation leaks today?
no. why?
you have a certain glow about you.
"okay, who told you?"
i just heard. congratulations.
thanks.
seven said you were dizzy. are you all right?
i'm fine.
nothing ever rattled her. not even the cardassians.
this is scarier.
would you like some time off?
to do what?
adjust. this is a big change.
"i'll work during the day, sleep at night, and have the baby when it's time."
"well, if you need to cut back on your duties, i'm sure seven would be happy to fill in for you."
i think i can handle it.
"congratulations, buddy."
where did you hear the news? in the datastream from earth?
"actually, i think it was a transmission from the borg. it's all over now. no more late nights on the holodeck. no more racing the delta flyer."
don't you think you're exaggerating just a little?
i've seen it happen. the new dad gets tied down with family. old friends drop away.
"it's fatherhood , harry, not exile."
"if you say so. kidding aside, how's it feel?"
"well, it's, it's not quite real yet."
"maybe that's what pregnancy's for. time to let reality sink in, before your life spins out of control."
do you need any help?
"mister paris, this may be the first time you've ever volunteered to assist me."
"really? well, we ought to change that. i mean, we've known each other a long time. we ought to work more closely."
i'll keep that in mind.
"so, i guess you've heard. b'elanna and i are going to have a baby."
i was unaware.
"finally, someone who doesn't know."
allow me to extend my best wishes.
"thanks. you know, a baby is, er, it's a big responsibility. but i'm ready for it. not that you can ever be completely ready, can you?"
"lieutenant, are you asking me for advice about fatherhood?"
"well, i don't know anyone else who's been through it."
i'm afraid my parenting skills are somewhat dormant. it's been many years since my children were young.
then you've had a long time to think back on it. any helpful hints?
"offspring can be disturbingly illogical, yet profoundly fulfilling. you should anticipate paradox."
i'll remember that.
if you'd like my counsel on more specific issues?
something tells me i'm going to be volunteering to work with you on a regular basis.
so?
looks nice.
"well, i figured quiet romantic dinners may soon be a thing of the past. tough day?"
"the captain practically relieved me of duty, as if i couldn't handle being an engineer and being pregnant at the same time."
"well, if you ever need a baby-sitter, godfather neelix is ready to go."
chakotay wants to be godfather.
neelix already has a list of names.
"oh, i don't mind people suggesting names. what annoys me is all of the free advice about feeding, discipline."
"folk wisdom is my favourite. according to chell, bolians believe that if you give birth near a warp core, it'll improve the baby's disposition."
why does everybody feel they're entitled to give us advice? this is our child.
people should know better than to interfere with a klingon mother.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing. it was a joke.
what does being klingon have to do with it?
take it easy.
i don't want to take it easy! i want everybody to back off and just let me.  the doctor said i might experience some behavioural volatility. i guess this is it.
forget about the doctor. forget the captain or the godfathers.
maybe you're right.
i know i am. this isn't about their expectations or hopes or doubts. none of this belongs to them.
it belongs to us. all of it.
lucky us.
"lieutenants torres and paris, please report to sickbay."
"it's a holographic extrapolation of your child's spine, approximately ten months after birth."
it's deviated.
"yes, there's a pronounced curvature to the left."
can it be corrected?
i had surgery for it when i was a baby.
you never told me that.
"my mother had it, too."
"it tends to run in klingon families, especially among females."
are you saying that this baby is a girl?
no. i didn't say that.
"but it is a girl, right?"
you cannot infer that.
it's okay. you might as well just tell us.
"yes. it's a girl. and aside from the deviated spine, she's healthy."
will she need surgery?
"fortunately, we've advanced beyond that. genetic modification is the treatment of choice."
"if you can project an image of the spine, can you use the genetic data to show us the whole baby?"
i could. it would only be an approximation.
let's take a look.
i don't know.
"oh, come on. aren't you curious?"
okay.
"oh, she's beautiful."
forehead ridges?
yes.
but she's only one-quarter klingon.
"klingon traits remain dominant for several generations, even with a single ancestor."
"oh, she looks just like her mother."
you are so much like your mother.
"she's perfect, isn't she?"
what a day.
uh-huh.
six years in the delta quadrant and nothing has ever scared me as much as hearing our baby had a problem.
it's not much of a problem.
we didn't know that at first.
now we know.
and we also know that the doctor is going to fix everything tomorrow morning.
"i'm sorry. it's a lot to take in all at once, and i'm really tired."
"we could both use some sleep. computer, dim the lights."
somebody make sure those coals are completely out.
"i'll get it, dad."
you kids be careful and be back before sunset.
and bring your appetites. we're having fish for dinner.
if you two can catch any.
"dad, i increased the field strength of the targeting lure."
"ooo. those fish don't stand a chance. better get going, your cousins aren't going to wait forever."
i was thinking. maybe i could go fishing with you and uncle carl.
"i thought you were looking forward to the hike. just the kids, no dads to slow you down."
they don't like me.
why would you say that?
because it's true.
"come on, b'elanna, let's go."
"see? now go on, have a good time."
dad?
what is it?
nothing.
"relax, we're not that late."
the doctor scheduled me at oh eight hundred.
"you still have time for my favourite gourmet breakfast, peanut butter toast."
i'm too tired to eat.
"if you're having trouble sleeping now, wait till those oh two hundred feedings come around."
you'll be in charge of those.
i can't wait.
"look, er, you don't have to come with me. it a minor procedure."
wouldn't you like some moral support?
i'm not an invalid.
"in that case you're on your own. that goes for breakfast, too."
i've been expanding my database in obstetrics and paediatrics.
"you haven't found another problem, have you?"
"no, not at all. but i have put together a prenatal enrichment programme."
why am i not surprised?
i'd like to start with trans-abdominal vocalisation.
let me guess. you're going to sing to my foetus.
"through a diatonal amplifier. it's quite safe, and it should enhance the child's mathematical abilities."
can we talk about this later?
absolutely. at our first parenting class.
parenting class?
"birthing techniques, feeding options, bonding strategies. it's not all hard work, though. we'll have ample time for fun."
could we get on with it?
"certainly. computer, dim lights."
i hope you don't expect me to sleep through this.
of course not. the darkness encourages vascular dilation. now you may feel a slight tingling. please remain as still as possible.
"b'elanna, come and have lunch."
that's okay. i'm not hungry.
you'd better eat while you can. you know our dads aren't going to catch any fish.
here.
thanks.
your mom wasn't sure you'd be able to come this weekend.
i had a lot of schoolwork.
i'm glad you made it.
that's nice of you to say.
"no, i mean it."
"hey, b'elanna, can you hand me a drink?"
okay.
thanks.
my teacher said klingons like live food.
"hey, stop it. stop."
it was just a joke.
"it was a stupid joke, dean. he's always doing stuff like that to me."
"don't be mad, b'elanna."
"b'elanna, wait."
"computer, raise lights. your daughter's spinal column is now perfectly aligned."
is she going to be all right?
"better than all right, if her parents are any indication."
"computer, access b'elanna torres' medical file."
file accessed.
project a holographic image of the baby.
now extrapolate what the child's facial features will look like at twelve years old.
display the foetus genome.
delete the following gene sequences. extrapolate what the child would look like with those genetic changes.
delete the following sequences. extrapolate.
save changes. restrict access to this file. b'elanna torres only.
there's no valid medical reason to do what you're proposing.
i disagree.
"you want to delete entire dna sequences. the genes that create redundant organs, for example."
they're superfluous.
those redundancies are there for a reason.
does my daughter need a third lung to survive?
"strictly speaking, no. but having it may be beneficial. some geneticists believe the extra lung evolved to give klingons greater stamina on the battlefield."
my daughter is not going to be a klingon warrior.
"with all due respect, you have no idea what your daughter's going to be. what if she develops an interest in athletics? greater lung capacity would be an advantage. the point is, there's no reason to arbitrarily remove genetic traits."
it's not arbitrary. it's preventive.
how so?
"that third lung could become diseased, couldn't it?"
i suppose.
then what i'm suggesting is no different than removing an appendix before it becomes inflamed.
why tamper with biological systems that evolved over aeons?
like curvature of the spine?
"if i make these changes, it'll affect her appearance."
i'm aware of that.
"are you also aware that some of these genes influence behaviour, personality?"
none of that's as important as her health.
what does tom think about all this?
i wanted to see what you thought first.
"as you can see, i'm very dubious."
"look, i've done statistical analyses, epidemiology. at least review my work."
"all right, i'll look at it. but in the meantime, i suggest you have a talk with your husband."
absolutely not.
this is our child's health we're talking about.
"it's more than that. you want to change who she is, her individuality, her. you don't want her to be klingon. that's what this is really about, isn't it? you're trying to protect her from being klingon because you had a rough time when you were a kid."
i was treated like a monster.
that isn't going to happen to our daughter. everyone on voyager will accept her for who she really is.
that's easy for you to say. you're human.
"meaning what, exactly?"
meaning you don't understand what it's like.
"okay then, tell me."
"when the people around you are all one way and you're not, you can't help feeling like there's something wrong with you."
"voyager isn't just one way. we've got bajorans, vulcans, a talaxian."
and hundred and forty humans.
our daughter is going to have a mixed heritage just like her mother. it's something you'll have in common. something she should be proud of. why destroy that?
"i'm not destroying anything. gene resequencing isn't a weapon, it's a tool, like a hyperspanner."
"she's not a machine, she's our daughter."
i'm not exactly sure what you want me to do.
i want you to order the doctor to genetically alter my child.
do you see what i'm dealing with here?
what you're asking for is ethically questionable. the doctor has reservations. your husband is against it.
"i only want to do what you did, for seven of nine."
i beg your pardon?
you had her implants removed.
i don't see the connection.
you altered her physiology. you changed who she was.
i was acting in her best interests.
that's all i'm doing.
seven was born human. the captain just helped to restore her original physiology.
and gave her a much better life in the process.
our child isn't even born yet. how do you know what's going to make her life better?
i just don't want her to start at a disadvantage.
"look, the doctor said you might experience mood swings."
that's it. just dismiss my argument as some kind of hormonal outburst.
i didn't mean that.
"stop it, both of you. the biggest problem you two have isn't ethical, it's marital. i'm happy to offer you advice as a friend. but as your captain, i'm not going to overrule the chief medical officer. you two need to work this out."
b'elanna?
what?
you heard the captain. we have to work this out.
there's nothing to work out. you're getting what you want.
what i want is to have a civilised discussion with my wife. maybe a change of scenery would help. how about the holodeck?
that's your solution to everything.
"at least i'm trying. look, i don't care where we do it, but we have to talk this out."
"i am tired of talking, all right?"
do i need a reservation?
what happened?
i think b'elanna and i need some time apart.
my couch is your couch.
she's barely pregnant and already we're having a major crisis.
you'll make up. you always do.
but that's what worries me. we're always fighting and making up. how's that going to affect our daughter?
"she's going to have a great life. piloting a ship from your lap, battling doctor chaotica on the holodeck."
"yeah, unless b'elanna thinks battling is too klingon."
she's always been sensitive about being part klingon. you know that.
that doesn't give her the right to turn our child into a science experiment.
but it does explain why this is so important to her.
what am i supposed to do?
maybe you should tell her you understand.
what good would that do?
"it might make her less defensive, and then maybe it would be easier for her to see your point of view."
what if she can't?
"like i said, my couch is your couch."
she should be back by now.
nobody has any idea where she went?
she just ran off down there.
i'm going to go look for her.
uncle john?
yeah?
i. it.
"b'elanna, where have you been?"
i'm sorry. i got kind of separated.
it was our fault.
it was dean's fault. he put a worm in her sandwich.
i was just kidding. i'm really sorry.
forget it.
"come on, let's get dinner started."
you want to talk about it?
i just wish.
you wish what?
i wish i weren't klingon.
now why would you say that?
because everyone makes fun of me.
who's everyone?
dean. the kids at school. they all hate me.
"did i ever tell you what the kids at my school used to call me? i used to fall asleep in class all the time, so instead of john torres, they called me john snore-ez."
it's not the same thing.
"of course it is. kids tease each other. they can be very cruel. but it doesn't mean that they hate you, or that they hate klingons."
you don't understand!
i think i do. you have to learn to be a little less sensitive.
fine.
now come on. uncle carl's going to tell one of his famous fish stories.
i'd rather just read.
suit yourself.
we saw a flying fish today.
flying fish?
it's true. i'm telling. you we saw it.
really?
"john, did we see a flying fish today?"
we sure did. it jumped five feet in the air.
everybody asleep?
they were exhausted. coffee?
sure.
"listen, i'm sorry."
for what?
the way dean treated b'elanna. i had a talk with him.
he was just doing what eleven year olds do. i'm sure b'elanna overreacted.
what makes you say that?
she's too damn sensitive.
what do you mean? she's a great kid.
"you haven't been around her much the last couple of years. she's gotten moody, unpredictable, argumentative. just like her mother."
i thought you loved miral's intensity.
"everything's become a fight with her. i guess the older, i get the less intensity i can handle. you know, it's funny how mom and dad always turn out to be right."
what do you mean?
mom warned me not to marry miral.
mom loved miral.
sure she did. but she never thought i had the constitution to live with a klingon. and now i'm living with two of them.
taya.
what?
taya. it's the feminine form of chakotay. what do you think?
i'll add it to the list. right after floxia. neelix suggested that one. it's number thirty two.
"on second thought, you and tom ought to come up with your own name."
i knew there was a reason i always liked you.
you look like you've been up all night. want to get some coffee?
that's the best offer i've had all week.
morning.
hi.
join us for breakfast? you know what? i forgot my padd. why don't you two go ahead. i'll meet you in the mess hall.
"so, how are you today?"
"i haven't changed my mind, if that's what you mean."
"no. what i meant was, how are you?"
"i've been better, but i'll get over it."
"you know, harry has the lumpiest pillows on the ship. he snores, keeps the room way too hot. i missed you."
me too.
"i still owe you that slice of peanut butter toast. why don't we go back to our quarters, fire up the toaster?"
sounds nice.
"lieutenant torres, lieutenant paris, please report to sickbay."
"i've reviewed the data you gave me, and i've also done my own analysis."
"skip the details, doctor. you've already made it clear what you think of my proposal."
"actually, i've changed my opinion."
what?
the genetic alterations you've suggested are necessary.
on what grounds?
the clash i mentioned between klingon and human metabolism? it's more extensive than i realised.
how extensive?
"theoretically, it could lead to complete metabolic failure."
but you can fix it.
by eliminating most of her klingon genetic material.
are you sure about all of this?
"my analysis was quite thorough. of course if our circumstances were different, you would be free to seek a second opinion."
"no offence, doc, but i am just trying to understand what's going on."
"you're welcome to review my findings. but let me stress, it would be unwise to delay this too long."
why?
the foetus is at a critical stage of development. antibodies have begun to form.
how long do we have?
i've scheduled the procedure for tomorrow morning. with your permission.
i want to thank you both for helping b'elanna when she fainted.
i'm glad it wasn't a parasite.
"well, you probably don't know this, but there may be some problems with the pregnancy."
i'm sorry to hear that.
"the doctor suggested a treatment for the baby, but his findings are very confusing, at least to me. you have some expertise in genetics. do you mind taking a look at this?"
of course not.
"whatever the problem is, i have no doubt the doctor will solve it."
i hope you're right.
your confusion is understandable. there's a computational error.
it's not like the doctor to make a mistake.
"i didn't think that was possible, unless there's some sort of glitch in his programme."
i'll run a diagnostic.
thank you.
"please tell lieutenant torres, if there's anything i can do."
i'll let her know. thanks.
it appears to be more than a glitch. i believe the doctor's programme has been tampered with.
"b'elanna, this is tom. respond. computer, locate lieutenant torres."
lieutenant torres is in sickbay.
"frankly, i'm relieved you decided not to wait till the last minute."
once this is behind us i'm sure we'll all feel better.
someone's blocked communications to sickbay.
see if you can deactivate the doctor.
access to his programme has been restricted.
keep trying. paris to tuvok.
go ahead.
meet me in sickbay.
why would she alter the doctor's programme?
"to change his mind about the medical procedure. computer, open sickbay doors."
unable to comply.
override authorisation tuvok pi alpha.
authorisation denied.
"doctor, stop what you're doing."
you're interrupting a medical procedure.
your programme has been altered.
"what do you mean, altered?"
ignore him.
"b'elanna, this is completely irrational."
will someone please tell me what's going on?
i'm your patient. your first duty is to me and my baby.
tuvok to bridge.
kim here.
there's a force field in sickbay.
i can't deactivate it. cut power to the eps relay
surrounding the surgical bay.
access has been restricted. i'll have to bypass them.
you said it could be dangerous to delay the procedure.
"she's manipulating you, doc, in more ways than one."
"i'm sorry, lieutenant, but if there's something wrong with my programme."
there's nothing wrong with your programme.
"i'm cutting power to the surgical bay, now."
i suggest we deactivate your programme until we determine the extent of the alterations.
"i understand. computer, deactivate emh."
you had no right to interfere.
"tuvok, would you mind giving us a minute?"
i never thought you would go this far.
i don't know what you're talking about.
reprogramming the doctor?
i upgraded his programme so he could understand what had to be done.
you mean to reconfigure our baby so she wouldn't be treated like a monster.
it's not just about the way she'll be treated.
"what else is it about, then? come on, b'elanna. tell me."
forget it.
"no, no, we're not going to forget it. we're going to talk about this right now."
stop telling me what to do. you're not my father.
what are you talking about?
"look, my father"
what? what about him?
"we were inseparable. he spoiled me and i worshipped him. but the older i got, we just grew apart. he ended up organising this camping trip with my cousins. i guess he just wanted to, i don't know, make things better again."
but it didn't.
it was awful. i ended up trying to run away.
b'elanna? what are you doing?
"it was so stupid. i mean, where was i going to go?"
you probably just wanted him to stop you.
"well, he did."
don't touch me.
"b'elanna, what's wrong?"
you know what's wrong.
"no, i don't."
maybe i'm just being moody and unpredictable.
what are you talking about?
i heard what you said to uncle carl.
you shouldn't be listening to private conversations.
and you shouldn't have said what you did about mommy.
"b'elanna, listen to me. your mother and i are having problems, but that doesn't"
you don't love her anymore.
that's not true.
"yes, it is. and you don't love me, either."
b'elanna.
you're no different than anyone else. you don't like klingons. you said it.
"you are twisting my words, b'elanna."
maybe he was right. maybe you misunderstood.
"no, i know what i heard. it made me so angry."
"you had a right to be, after the things he said."
it's not what he said. it's what i said.
"if you can't stand living with us, then why don't you just leave?"
and that's exactly what he did.
"oh, b'elanna."
twelve days later. and he never came back.
you can't blame yourself for that.
why not?
because he was obviously unhappy about his marriage. he didn't leave just because you told him to.
you don't know that.
"look, whatever the reason was, i'm sure it was a horrible thing for you to live with. wait a minute. you don't think? b'elanna, i am never going to leave you."
you say that now. but think about how hard it is to live with one klingon. pretty soon it'll be two.
"and someday i hope it's three or four. i mean it. and i hope that every one of them is just like you. b'elanna, i am not your father and you are not your mother. and our daughter is going to be perfect just the way she is."
do you really think so?
i know so.
"good morning, lieutenant. you're not feeling ill, are you?"
no. i'm fine. i just wanted to apologise for violating your programme.
apology accepted. not guilty by reason of biochemistry.
nice of you to let me off the hook. but biochemistry isn't an excuse. i knew exactly what i was doing. oh!
is something wrong?
i don't know.
your baby's kicking.
so soon?
"well, she is part klingon."
oh. there it is again.
may i?
"feisty little thing, isn't she? i wonder where she gets that from."
"speaking of the baby, i have another request."
yes?
i wonder if you'd like to be her godfather. neelix wants the job but he's already got naomi wildman. and chakotay knows less about raising kids than harry. and if you think
i accept.
thanks.
thank you.
"i was also wondering. do you think i could see her one more time? the holographic projection, i mean."
i don't see why not.
"she is cute, isn't she?"
this is captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager. we're responding to your distress call.
a ruptured conduit is flooding my ship with plasma radiation. we request immediate transport.
i'm detecting eleven life signs. two are weak.
transport the injured to sickbay and the rest to cargo bay one. i want security teams at both locations.
our weapons!
they'll be returned to you when you leave.
these are dangerous criminals. they have to be secured.
we'll do our best to accommodate you.
i had eight men in custody. where are the other two?
we're not going to hurt you.
stay away or i'll kill her!
i'm sure we can resolve this without resorting to violence. what is it you want?
"a ship, some food."
"i might be able to arrange that, but you'll have to release her first."
i'm not a fool.
you know i'll do it. tell them.
you're not getting off this ship.
"if you release her, i promise you won't be harmed."
not until i get a ship.
we don't negotiate with criminals.
who are you?
warden yediq of the nygean detention force. this man is my prisoner.
"if that were true, he wouldn't be holding my friend hostage."
get back!
i'm a hologram. i can't be harmed.
i think you proved my point.
"we're lucky you came along, captain. ten more minutes and none of use would have survived the plasma leak."
your vessel was equipped with escape pods. why didn't you use them?
"i couldn't risk letting any of the prisoners get away. as you've seen, they're extremely dangerous."
where are you taking them?
back to our homeworld. they're due to be executed.
what were their crimes?
all eight are murderers. three are multiple offenders. we're just thirteen light years from our system. i'd appreciate it if you'd take us back there.
"actually, we were headed in the opposite direction."
i could arrange for one of our ships to rendezvous with voyager. it'll take several days. my prisoners will have to be strictly monitored.
commander tuvok will help you make arrangements.
some of the crew may not be comfortable helping to deliver eight men to their deaths.
"i can't say i like it either, but we have a prime directive to follow."
"thirty more seconds and i could have resolved the situation peacefully. instead, you and tuvok the kid had to take matters into your own hands."
you're damaged.
commander tuvok's friendly fire must have caused a feedback surge in my emitters.
i'll help you repair it.
how are you?
"fine, captain."
you. this your ship?
yes.
then let me out.
i'm afraid i can't do that.
"if you don't, i'll kill you all."
janeway to tuvok. are the prisoners' accommodations ready?
"affirmative, captain."
"then by all means, initiate transport."
you're sure these will hold them?
"the force fields are impenetrable, as are the tritanium bulkheads. in addition to your staff, two voyager security officers will remain here at all times. two more will be posted at the entrance to the cargo bay."
what about our weapons?
"you'll be allowed to carry them in this area only. if you leave the cargo bay, you'll be asked to surrender them."
what's this?
"dinner. since you can't bring the prisoners to the mess hall, i've brought the mess hall to them."
what is it?
talaxian spice stew served over leola rice pilaf. it's an old family recipe.
take it back.
too spicy?
these men don't deserve such an elaborate meal. take it back.
federation guidelines are quite clear about the treatment of prisoners.
he is correct.
i can quote the protocols if you like.
my men will assist you.
thanks for standing up to yediq.
just doing my job.
"still, it was kind."
this would be easier if you would remain stationary.
it doesn't feel right.
you may experience unusual sensations while your matrix realigns.
"i was referring to the arrangement the captain's made with the nygeans. no matter how terrible the crimes these men committed, it seems wrong to hand them over to be executed. this is a federation starship, not the barge of the dead."
would you have preferred the captain release them?
of course not. they're dangerous men.
executing them ensures they'll never pose a threat to anyone again.
"so would life sentences, the operative word being life."
confining them for life requires significant resources. the nygeans may not think it worthwhile.
"what about rehabilitation? given the chance, some of these men might become productive members of society one day."
their victims won't have the same opportunity.
"and that justifies taking their lives? an eye for an eye? it's not justice, it's revenge. quite frankly, i'm surprised you're not troubled by such a barbaric system."
i'm simply being objective. you often encourage me to see both sides of an argument.
"well, this is one occasion when my programming won't allow me to be objective. killing is wrong, no matter who's doing it."
still hungry? i can hear your stomach from here. this must be the first time in a month you couldn't steal poor egrid's meal.
