dialogue
"good, isn't it?"
is there a problem?
iko was just telling me he didn't get enough to eat.
"i see. cause another disturbance, and i'll see to it you're not fed the rest of this journey. do you understand?"
boche and ledara.
what did you say?
your children.
how did you know that?
are you sure they're safe?
some people don't understand why we deal so harshly with men like you. it's because you never learn.
stand down. stand down!
he needs to be disciplined.
lower your weapons and step away.
our response was justified.
how do you justify beating a defenceless man?
violence is the only thing he understands.
you seem to have a pretty good grasp of it yourself.
"do not presume to tell me how to handle my prisoners, captain. you don't know iko like i do. he killed a young father for no reason. before that, he committed dozens of violent crimes. he spent his entire life hurting people."
"that doesn't excuse what you did to him. until your transport vessel gets here, you and your men won't be allowed in the cargo bay. you're in charge of the prisoners."
"aye, captain."
they're my responsibility.
not as long as you're aboard my ship. i won't risk any more violence.
the only risk will be to your crew. commander tuvok isn't qualified to guard prisoners this dangerous.
"tuvok has been a starfleet security officer for a very long time. believe me, he's qualified."
i hope you're right.
you remember mister iko.
vividly.
the nygeans decided to make an example of him.
did you call me here to make a point about nygean barbarity?
i called you here because i need your help to save his life. he sustained a severe blow to the head which has caused severe oedema in his parietal lobe. it's blocking vital neurotransmitters. i'd like to programme some of your nanoprobes to bypass the oedema.
i'll comply.
i sense a but coming.
it seems inefficient to save the life of someone who's about to be executed.
"if the nygeans insist on killing him, there isn't much i can do about it. but i won't let them do it on voyager."
"i didn't expect to see you back so soon. ordinarily, we're lucky to get one meal a day."
that's terrible.
yediq likes to keep us hungry.
less talk. we're hungry.
you're wondering why i'm here.
excuse me?
you're wondering what i did to end up with men like them.
you killed someone.
that's right.
why?
because i'm benkaran.
what does that have to do with it?
"it's common knowledge that all benkarans are criminals. so when i was found in the vicinity of a murder, i was immediately arrested."
are you saying you didn't do it?
"i told you, i'm benkaran. what i say doesn't matter."
"you suffered severe neurological trauma, but i believe we've repaired the damage."
thank you.
"don't thank me, thank seven of nine. she donated the nanoprobes that saved your life."
"oh, my head."
the pain is normal. i'll prepare an analgesic.
you're not afraid of me.
there's no reason to fear someone in your condition.
you were never afraid of me. not even when i tried to kill you. it's nice to look into someone's eyes and not see fear.
you have to be a criminal to get something to eat around here?
sorry. dinner will be ready in fifteen minutes.
you said that fifteen minutes ago.
did you know the nygeans govern a sector of space occupied by several different humanoid species?
"if we say yes, will you feed us?"
"one of those species is the benkarans. they occupy just ten percent of nygean space, but take up nearly eighty percent of the space in nygean prisons."
maybe they commit more crimes.
"not according to joleg, one of the prisoners."
you think he was given a harsher sentence because of his species?
"according to this, benkarans are ten times more likely to be executed for their crimes than nygeans."
where'd you get that?
"i contacted the nygean government. told them i was interested in a cultural exchange. among other things, they let me access data on their criminal justice system. it all supports what joleg told me."
neelix.
i know what you're thinking.
that you're the softest touch in the delta quadrant.
these are the transcripts from joleg's trial. he was convicted on circumstantial evidence.
let me guess. he was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
apparently.
"neelix, when i was in the federation penal colony, everybody had a story. i never put much stock in them. neither should you."
how many of those people were sentenced to die?
i still don't understand. why weren't you hurt?
because my matrix is photonic. i'm made of light.
you wanted to see me?
i'll be with you in just a moment.
you don't feel pain?
"well, i suppose my pride has been wounded on occasion."
i wish i was made of light.
try to rest.
"mister iko responded so well to the first dose of nanoprobes, i thought a second might improve his condition further. it'll only take a moment to extract them."
you and mister iko seem to be getting along well.
"it's the strangest thing. when he first arrived he was crude, abusive. now he's a model patient. grateful, considerate."
he's obviously an unstable individual. inconsistent behaviour is hardly surprising.
"still, if it weren't for the security detail, i'd forget he was a criminal."
it's possible he's trying to manipulate you.
doctor?
what's the matter?
my stomach.
i'm not detecting anything.
"i, i can't."
what's wrong?
i can't stop thinking about the man i killed.
that's not surprising. you're experiencing guilt.
is that why i'm feeling sick?
nausea could be a symptom of guilt.
i've never felt guilty before.
you've committed many crimes.
none of them made me feel like this. why did you do this to me?
we're not responsible for your guilt.
"i didn't feel this way until you put those nanoprobes in me. you knew this would happen, didn't you? this is some kind of punishment. take the nanoprobes out."
you could die.
please. i don't want to feel this way anymore.
you don't honestly believe we're responsible for his condition.
we applied the borg technology. it's possible there were some unforeseen side effects.
"guilt, for example."
look at this.
what?
it's my most recent scan. the neurotransmitters have established new pathways throughout his cortex.
wasn't that your intention?
"no, i was simply trying to bypass the oedema."
then how did this happen?
"i don't know. it's possible this is normal nygean brain activity, but i have no basis for comparison."
you should ask mister yediq to contact a nygean medical official. maybe they could provide some relevant information.
seven of nine. stay and talk to me.
i'm extremely busy.
please. i'm scared.
"what did you want to discuss? i'm due in astrometrics, so if there's"
astrometrics? what's that?
a laboratory where we observe stellar phenomena.
"when i was a child, i'd lie under the stars for hours. i'd stare at them until i could see the shapes."
shapes?
faces and animals made out of stars.
you're referring to constellations.
"i named them. there was paedos the warrior, and gezid the beast. no matter how hard he tried paedos could never catch gezid."
because the distance between them always remained the same.
you've seen them?
possibly. i've catalogued approximately six billion stars.
"then you must have seen onella, too. the mother."
describe her.
"she was surrounded by sixteen smaller stars. her daughters. if i try, i think i can remember all their names."
"eleven six, green."
what's going on over there?
kot-kot.
that's kadis-kot. congratulations.
down here.
i've been doing some research on the nygean legal system. you were right about the benkarans receiving harsher sentences. i saw the statistics.
the statistics won't save me.
"i noticed some people convicted of murder, even terrible premeditated murders, weren't executed. some aren't punished at all. but you were sentenced to death."
that's what the family wants.
the family?
"after you're convicted, the family of the victim sentences you."
"well, shouldn't you be sentenced by someone less partial, like a judge?"
"vekto valek k'vadim. it's ancient nygean. it means favour the victims. what if i stole your game board? what right would a judge have to assign value to your loss? to him, it's just a game board, but to you it might be a priceless family possession. and what if i murdered your child?"
i think i get your point.
vekto valek k'vadim. it's the basis for the nygean legal system.
what about the criminals that didn't serve any sentence at all?
"some people prefer restitution to revenge. if a defendant is wealthy enough, he can negotiate a settlement with the victim's family."
"oh, that doesn't seem fair."
"it's perfectly fair, unless you're destitute."
maybe i can talk to the captain about finding a way to compensate your victims.
i'm grateful. but it would imply i'm guilty. i wouldn't want that.
there must be something i can do.
you can transmit a letter to my brother. i'd like to let him know what's happened to me.
i'll get a padd.
i thought you might find this interesting.
what is it?
it's an astrometrics log. it contains data on various star formations.
it's just words and numbers. i'd rather look at the stars.
i'll bring you a star chart after my next shift.
what's the metal above your eye?
it's a cybernetic implant.
where did you get it?
it was installed by the borg.
it must have hurt.
i don't recall.
i hurt people. i deserve to die.
seven? i found something.
"this is a scan depicting a healthy nygean brain. this node is analogous to the human pineal gland. in addition to controlling behavioural impulses, it regulates decision making. you might say it's the physiological equivalent of a conscience."
"normally, the node connects to the rest of the brain through a series of neural pathways."
now look at this scan of iko's node before we applied the nanoprobes. it's detached.
did that happen when he was assaulted?
"no, i believe it's congenital. a birth defect."
"without the node, iko would have been prone to violence and sociopathic behaviour all his life."
"when i used seven's nanoprobes to treat the injuries from the assault, it seems they inadvertently repaired the defect as well."
"you've activated his conscience. well, that would explain why he's suddenly experiencing guilt."
there's more to it than that. i believe he's become capable of controlling his violent impulses.
"capable maybe, but how do you know he will?"
"even the thought of violence makes him ill now. in my opinion, he's no longer a threat to anyone."
"by some definitions, captain, he's not the same man who committed the murder."
are you suggesting we release him?
of course not. but at the very least his case should be re-examined.
because he's sorry.
there's new medical evidence to be considered.
none of it changes the fact that he killed a man.
he was suffering from a neurological defect. he couldn't control his behaviour.
"if iko had been diagnosed and treated, he never would have committed that crime. in a matter of speaking, he's a victim of his own biology."
so iko is the victim now?
no one's denying that he committed a terrible crime. but as a result of the doctor's treatments he's undergone a fundamental change. killing him won't accomplish anything.
that's not your decision to make.
nor is it yours.
he's obviously deceiving you somehow.
"listen, we could debate this all day but the fact is, our personal opinions are irrelevant. all that matters is nygean law."
does iko have a legal means of appeal at his disposal?
"in accordance with nygean penal code, a capital defendant has a right to appeal his sentence to the family of his victims."
then i'd like you to help commander tuvok draft an appeal and submit it to the proper authorities.
take back the appeal.
you'd rather die because you think it'll relieve your pain.
"death is what i deserve. you say i've changed, but i look at these hands every day and i see them squeezing that man's throat. and i hear the sounds he made. i'm disgusting."
do you think i'm disgusting?
you've been nothing but kind to me.
"you asked me earlier if it hurt when my occipital implant was installed. i told you i didn't remember. but the truth is, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life."
why did you lie?
"it's difficult for me to talk about, because i forced others to undergo the same procedure."
why?
"i was compelled to do so by the borg collective. i wasn't in control of my actions, just as you weren't in control when you took a life. my nanoprobes have given you control. you're a different person now. you don't deserve to be executed."
i want to go back to my cell.
you're free to remain here.
am i still sick?
"no, but"
then i don't want special treatment.
i'm glad to see you're feeling better. you must be hungry. here you go.
give it to him.
he's already had his dinner.
please.
all right.
you wanted to see me.
we just received a response from the nygeans. the family has refused to consider the appeal.
but the medical evidence
they won't look at it.
the family found the request insulting.
your government could insist that they review it.
we have laws that protect victims from emotional distress.
"in that case, we should grant iko asylum aboard voyager."
you agreed to work within the confines of our legal system.
your system is flawed.
"that's enough, seven. i assure you, we'll abide by the family's decision. now i need a moment alone with seven, if you don't mind."
we did everything we could to help him.
we have to do more.
you barely know this man. why are you so passionate about helping him?
"i want to give him the same opportunity you gave me. when you severed my link to the collective, you changed who i was. you made it possible for me to reclaim my humanity. because of my nanoprobes, iko has undergone a similar change. he should be given the chance to atone for his crimes."
atonement. is that what this is about?
yes.
"for him, or for you?"
i don't know what you mean.
i think part of you still feels responsible for the violent acts you committed when you were a borg.
you're mistaken.
"am i? maybe you believe if iko is found not guilty, somehow you won't be guilty either. you said it yourself. you've reclaimed your humanity. it's time you stopped blaming yourself for the crimes of the collective."
report.
an alien vessel just dropped out of warp and opened fire.
we've lost power on decks eight through ten.
the cargo bay.
follow me. let's storm the bridge.
shields down to sixty percent.
still no response to hails.
evasive manoeuvres. target their weapons.
tuvok to bridge. the attacking ship is attempting to transport one of the prisoners.
they're trying to lock on to all five benkaran life signs.
target their transporter array.
direct hit. they're retreating.
pursuit course?
no. we have more immediate problems. bridge to tuvok. what's your status?
we've neutralised two of the prisoners.
someone's trying to get into the shuttlebay.
lock them out.
again.
stand back.
don't move.
you have five minutes to get us a shuttle.
tuvok to bridge. lock on to yediq's signature and beam him to
transporters are offline. we need at least ten minutes to get them up and running.
seal it.
you're not getting off this ship.
then i suppose i should kill you right now.
don't! he's mine. you saw how they beat me.
i knew it was a trick. i knew you hadn't changed.
"i won't beg for my life. it belongs to you. i only want you to understand what's happened to me. i'm a different person now. a better person. this crew has helped me to see that. if my death helps you find peace, i can accept it. but if you let me live, i will never hurt anyone again. whatever you decide, please know how sorry i am for what i took from you."
are we playing kadis-kot later?
sorry.
afraid i'll beat you again?
i tried to help you and you took advantage of me.
what do you mean?
the note we sent your brother. he traced the transmission to voyager. he's the one who attacked us.
"neelix, i swear i had no idea he would do that. you have to believe me."
i read yediq's security report. you threatened to kill him.
i can't eat this.
why not?
i'm sick.
you look fine to me.
"no, i must have the same condition iko had. if your doctor cures me, i can make an appeal for my life, too."
"she's beautiful, isn't she."
onella the mother.
"and there's paedos, still watching over her. it was kind of captain janeway to let you bring me here."
if your appeal is successful you'll be able to go wherever you want.
i hope you're right.
"if i am, where will you go?"
i don't know.
"if you'd like, i could ask captain janeway to consider letting you stay here."
i'm not a scientist. i don't think i'd be much help to anyone.
there are other ways to be useful. i'm sure we could think of something.
i'd like that.
i'm sorry. the family has denied your appeal.
we're due to rendezvous with a transport ship in a few hours. i need to return you to your cell.
you were the first person who wasn't afraid to look me in the eye. that's how i'd like to remember you.
i just finished looking over your warp core analysis.
and?
i'm impressed. it usually takes a few days to finish one of these. b'elanna tells me you did it in twenty two hours.
i haven't felt the need to regenerate.
"everyone grieves in their own way. if you want to talk, you know where to find me."
it's unfair.
"i think so too, seven. but we have to try not to judge their system."
"that's not what i meant. iko was executed for taking a single life. as a drone i took thousands, but i was never punished."
you lost twenty years of your life to the borg. i'd say that's punishment enough.
report.
a ship just decloaked off our port stern.
can you identify them?
they re-cloaked.
that disruptor blast had a klingon signature.
evasive manoeuvres. hail them.
no response. port shields are down to fifty percent.
they've re-cloaked again. tetryon readings indicate it's a d-seven class cruiser.
d-seven? they were retired decades ago.
if their technology is antiquated
perhaps a metaphasic scan might be able to penetrate their cloak.
do it.
bridge to astrometrics.
initiate a metaphasic sweep.
i've detected a vessel. transferring the trajectory to tactical.
i have them.
fire phasers.
our cloak has failed.
divert emergency power to shields.
forward emitters are offline. the federation ship is hailing again.
answer them.
captain!
it may give us more time to get the cloak back on online. visual.
this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. stand down.
we will not surrender to sworn enemies
of the klingon empire.
"i think there's been a misunderstanding. the empire signed a peace treaty with the federation more than eighty years ago. if i'm not mistaken, it's still in effect."
you're lying.
i'm not lying. but even if i were your ship is no match for mine. i suggest we discuss this.
what is there to talk about?
"the treaty, for one thing. i'll give you access to our database show you i'm telling the truth."
databases can be falsified.
i have a klingon serving aboard this ship.
impossible.
she's my chief engineer.
i will meet this chief engineer.
we'd be honoured to have you as our guest.
you're safe here. you have my word.
forgive me if i don't find the word of a human very reassuring.
i'd like to know what you're doing in the delta quadrant.
i'm not answering any questions until i see the klingon.
"captain kohlar. lieutenant torres, our chief engineer."
you're with child.
that's what the doctor tells me.
did you conceive during the holy month of nay'poq?
i have no idea.
it would have been fourteen or fifteen weeks ago.
"that sounds about right, not that it's any of your business."
i must return to my ship.
aren't you interested in learning about the treaty?
here's a copy of the khitomer accords.
i must return to my vessel.
not without your assurance that you won't fire on my ship again.
you have my word.
escort captain kohlar back to the transporter room.
"aye, captain."
what the hell was that about?
it's the truth.
how can you be certain?
"the scrolls say, you will find me after two warring houses make peace. our people and the federation, our greatest enem,y are at peace."
so the humans claim. these accords may be a deception.
the other signs are present. you will know me before i know the world.
the child is unborn. it does not know the world.
you interpret the scrolls well.
we must verify the evidence.
"your scepticism darkens my heart, t'greth. what evidence did our ancestors have when they began this journey? nothing but their faith. tell the others to prepare. the day of separation has arrived."
"captain, the klingon ship. its core is breaching."
red alert. hail them.
"i salute you, captain. you did more damage to our vessel than my engineer thought."
we can send over a team to help you establish a containment field.
there isn't time.
he's right. their core is going to breach in less than thirty seconds.
i'm requesting emergency transport.
captain. their crew complement is two hundred and four.
erect forcefields around the shuttlebay. transport them there. tell your crew to stand by for evacuation.
ten seconds.
if we're still too close when their core breaches
go to warp as soon as their crew is aboard.
"five, four, three."
we have them.
you spared us a dishonourable death.
sensor logs indicate that the containment failure was not caused by our weapons.
you activated a self-destruct sequence.
it was the only way to get us aboard voyager.
why was that so important?
it's our sacred duty to be here.
i don't understand.
"more than a hundred years ago, my great-grandfather was part of a sect which believed the empire had lost its way. they discovered a sacred text. it told them to embark on a journey to a distant region of the galaxy."
you've been travelling for four generations?
"my people have always known the voyage would be long and difficult, but the scrolls said we would be rewarded."
how?
"we would find the kuvah'magh, the saviour of our people. the one who will lead us to a new empire. the scrolls instruct us to follow her wherever she goes."
what does any of this have to do with voyager?
i believe the kuvah'magh is the unborn child of b'elanna torres.
you're joking.
they take their beliefs very seriously.
seriously enough to destroy their own ship?
couldn't they have just followed us?
"apparently, their sacred text told them to cast off the old ways as soon as they found this kuvah'magh."
they saw their vessel as the last vestige of the corrupt empire.
"i was hoping our daughter would be special, but i never dreamed she'd turn out to be the klingon messiah."
"this isn't funny. they might be dangerous. i mean, what if they want to hurt the baby?"
"to them, your baby's sacred. it's unlikely they would do anything to harm her."
two hundred klingons pose a significant security threat. i suggest we keep them confined to the shuttlebay until we can find a suitable home for them.
there are women and children down there. we can't just lock them up.
i agree.
captain.
assign extra security to every deck and make sure the klingons know and abide by the rules.
the bridge will have to be off limits. engineering as well.
keep them out of all restricted areas.
"despite their reverence for lieutenant torres, she should be assigned a twenty four hour security detail."
just what i need.
where are they going to sleep?
we'll double up in quarters. i'll ask for volunteers.
"i know this isn't going to be easy, but until we can find another place for them, we should do our best to make them feel comfortable. dismissed."
"captain, you must try the gagh."
"i'll pass, thank you. but i'm glad to see you're getting into the spirit of things."
"well, i've been studying the klingon database. they're a fascinating people, very robust. and they certainly seem to appreciate my culinary skills."
looks like everything's running smoothly.
"ah, not quite everything. some of the starfleet people have been complaining about the smell. personally, i find it appealing. a kind of a musky aroma."
maybe we can adjust the environmental controls to filter out the musk.
thief! touch my food again and i'll kill you.
"okay, everybody relax."
he took gagh from my plate.
"if you don't mind, ensign, i've been studying klingon etiquette. you shouldn't quarrel over food. save your strength for battle, to fight those who would challenge you."
take it easy.
that's enough!
you have a fiery spirit. you will make a worthy mate.
what a day. i never met a more ravenous group in my life. i must have served over three hundred meals.
"mister neelix, may i ask what you're doing here?"
we're bunkmates.
there must be some mistake.
"no, there's no mistake. i gave up my quarters to a klingon family. by the time i checked with commander chakotay, you were the only one who hadn't been paired up."
you should have consulted me.
"we're such close friends, i knew you wouldn't mind."
"mister neelix, as much as i enjoy your company, i prefer solitude in my own quarters."
"you don't really want me to go back there and tell that family to get out, do you? good. because i promise you we're going to have fun, mister vulcan. i learned some klingon drinking songs. i'll teach them to you.  'ej humtah 'ej dechtah 'iw'ej doq sodtah ghospa' sqral biqtiq."
paris to torres.
i'm almost finished.
you said that an hour ago.
"i'll be there in a minute, i promise. torres out. keep an eye on the replicators, they've already gone down once today."
it's her.
"when you said be there in a minute, you weren't kidding."
a group of klingons ambushed me outside of engineering. i decided transporting myself would be easier than running the gauntlet. i'm starting to feel like a prisoner.
"well, at least you have a handsome cellmate."
how long do you think they're going to be on board?
i thought you'd be glad to have other klingons around. you've always told me how uncomfortable it is being the only one.
i guess i should be careful what i wish for.
maybe you should talk to some of them. give them a chance.
come in.
captain.
"i'm sorry to bother you, but i need your help. ten of the klingons have started a hunger strike. they say they won't eat until you agree to meet with their council of elders."
that's ridiculous.
their faith is obviously very important to them.
they think i'm something i'm not.
just talk to them. hear what they have to say.
we could be with these people for a while. you can't avoid them forever.
i can try.
"if it'll make you feel any better, i'll go with you."
"mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh. mobar dohlomaj, kuvah'magh."
you honour us with your presence.
look at her ridges. morak was right. your blood is not pure.
"no, my father was human."
couldn't you see this for yourself?
"yes, but"
why didn't you tell us?
it wasn't important.
not important? we destroyed our ship because you said she was the mother of the kuvah'magh.
show me where it's written that the kuvah'magh must have pure klingon blood.
the prophecy wouldn't lead us to a mongrel child.
"hey, take it easy."
who are you?
the father of that mongrel child.
more human blood. your kuvah'magh isn't even half-klingon.
"i've spent my life interpreting the scroll,s and i say that all the signs of the prophecy are here."
liar. you've led us to a false saviour.
i told you this was a mistake.
"lieutenant, i need your help."
any more help from me and you're going to have a holy war on your hands.
that's what i'm trying to prevent.
my baby's just a baby. she's not a saviour.
perhaps you're right. but we must convince my people that she is.
why?
"we've travelled more than thirty thousand light years in search of this saviour, and in more than one hundred years we've found nothing except hardship and isolation. when i saw lieutenant torres, that she was with child, i didn't know if i was looking at the mother of the kuvah'magh or not. but i did know i was looking at an opportunity to end this wasteful journey."
then you don't believe in the prophecy?
what i believe is that my people have suffered enough. if they accept your child as the kuvah'magh you'll hold great influence over them. we can find a suitable planet. you can tell them it's their new home and they'll follow you there.
i'm not going to lie to them.
what's the alternative? my people staying aboard your ship draining your resources?
i agree with lieutenant torres. i'm not comfortable deceiving your people.
perhaps you won't have to lie to them to convince them.
what are you suggesting?
"if you study the scrolls with me, we may be able to interpret them in way that appears consistent with the events of your life. then we'll bring those consistencies to the attention of the council."
so you just want to stretch the truth a little.
"it is possible that the sacred scrolls were scrawled by a madman in a cave. or perhaps they really were divinely inspired. either way, they've guided us for over a century. if my people start to believe that the sacred scrolls have led them astray, there may be violence."
is that a threat?
"merely a fact. you're doing everything you can to get your people home, captain. that's all i'm doing for mine."
"it says the kuvah'magh will be descended from a noble house. i don't come from one and i'm pretty sure my husband doesn't, either."
we all have nobility in our blood if we go back far enough.
so these scrolls can mean anything you want them to.
it is written that the mother of the kuvah'magh would be an off-worlder. weren't you born on a federation colony?
a lot of klingons are born off-world.
"it also says that you would have lived a life of solitude, and endured many hardships. that's accurate, isn't it?"
"according to this, i'm supposed to have won a glorious victory against an army of ten thousand warriors."
haven't you?
we haven't even encountered ten thousand warriors. unless you include the borg.
did you help destroy one of their vessels?
i suppose.
couldn't that have been your glorious victory?
i guess so.
where are the images of kahless? where is your family crest?
they clashed with the carpet.
don't you honour any of your people's traditions?
not really.
there is one tradition we can honour together.
what are you doing?
it's midday. time to remember the sacrifice of our ancestors. haven't you made a plea for the dead before?
not since i was a child.
the dead can't rest in sto-vo-kor if the living don't honour their memory. perhaps there's someone i can honour on your behalf. who did you plead for as a child?
my grandmother.
she was called?
l'naan.
"kahless, we implore you to remember those warriors who have fallen in your name. lift them out of the cavern of despair and reveal yourself to them in all your glory."
"right, in all your glory."
"remember kolax, son of amar. remember talij, daughter of k'rene."
"remember l'naan, daughter of krelik."
what happened to you?
i cut myself shaving.
is that a bite mark?
one of the klingons attacked me.
did you do something to provoke him?
"not him, her. and she wasn't provoked. she was aroused."
ah. i'm not surprised. i've studied the section on klingon mating rituals in their cultural database.
then maybe you can tell me how to convince a female twice my size that i'm not interested.
hmm. you probably can't.
great.
"as i understand it, you have two options. kill her, or mate with her. since the first option is clearly unacceptable."
what's this?
authorisation for you to engage in intimate relations with a member of an alien species. be sure to get the captain's approval as well.
"that's when they beamed aboard the flyer, weapons firing. tuvok and neelix fought valiantly, but there were too many hirogen. i had to face ten of their fiercest hunters alone."
is that how you remember it?
"took them down two at a time, but they kept coming."
exaggeration is part of klingon custom. she's doing great.
"i had my phaser shot out of my hand, forcing me to take down the last hunter in hand-to-hand combat. it was a glorious fight!"
your ancestors would be honoured.
"you tell a good story, but that's not why you're here. some say you are the mother of the kuvah'magh, the one who will guide us to a new homeworld. has your unborn child told you where it is?"
"the scrolls say, you will follow in my footsteps before i have made them. yesterday we changed course toward a planet very much like kronos. so in a manner of speaking, you are now following my child to a new home."
"you deliver the words we want to hear, but it's kohlar who gives them to you. are you his puppet in the bedchamber as well?"
watch it. that's my wife you're talking about.
he speaks. i didn't think you had a tongue.
leave him out of this.
you see how he hides behind his female? it is also written that the father of the kuvah'magh will be an honourable warrior. would an honourable warrior ever refuse a challenge?
i haven't refused any challenge.
i haven't made one yet. you and i.
to the death.
tom.
stay out of this.
petaq.
i accept.
what was i supposed to say?
how about no?
they were all watching. there would have been a riot if i refused.
so you're going to get yourself killed ?
what makes you so sure i'd lose?
"oh, please."
"look, i have no intention of fighting anyone to the death, but wasn't the whole point of this to get them to believe that we are the parents of their saviour?"
"captain, this has gone too far. you've got to put a stop to it."
i intend to.mister tuvok.
"gentlemen, i'm afraid lieutenant paris had no authority to accept this challenge. there will be no death matches aboard my ship."
i told you this petaq was not the true father.
"lieutenant paris is perfectly willing to fight you, mister t'greth. i'm the one preventing him from doing so."
the father of the kuvah'magh wouldn't let a woman speak for him.
"t'greth, there is precedent for an honourable compromise. a non-lethal bout, fought with blunted bat'leths. the victory goes to the first warrior to knock his opponent to the ground three times."
a coward's rules.
was the emperor mur'eq a coward? he was the one who instituted these rules to insure that his warriors would kill their enemies and not each other.
if you agree to these terms i'll allow the match.
i'll see you on the field of battle.
"i assume you have a suitable holodeck training programme for this, lieutenant?"
he'll be ready. i'll train him myself.
hi.
psst! neelix!
"something wrong, harry?"
shush. have you seen her?
who?
that klingon woman. the one i got into a scrape with in the mess hall.
officer ch'rega.
that's her.
i haven't seen her today.
she's been following me everywhere.
why?
she wants to mate.
oh! you're a lucky man. she's a fine specimen of klingon womanhood.
i guess it's a matter of taste.
you never saw me.
"wait, i have a better idea."
"neelix, what the hell are you doing?"
"play along. i'm taking her off your hands. when i say you're limited to two servings of brak't, that's all you get. do you understand me, ensign?"
"yes, sir. whatever you say."
"i don't think you do. if i catch you eating more than your share again, i'll cut it out of your belly.  run."
excuse me.
petaq!
i didn't think you approved of the competition.
i don't. i'm here in an official capacity.
"well, you do know they're fighting with non-lethal weapons?"
you'd be surprised how much damage a blunt bat'leth can do.
"warriors, assemble!"
today would be a very bad day to die.
i'll try to remember that.
let honour guide you. tagh.
"i see fear in your eyes, human."
the only klingon i'm afraid of is my wife after she's worked a double shift.
it's begun.
what are you talking about?
he's dying.
"typically, i'm the one to make that kind of prognosis."
it's the nehret. it kills all of us who aren't fortunate enough to die in battle.
it's a retrovirus that destroys the cells by attacking the cytoplasmic membranes.
shouldn't our bio-filters have detected it when we transported the klingons aboard?
"this is an insidious virus. it lies dormant, disguising itself as inert genetic material until it inexplicably activates."
the nehret always comes without warning.
i've reviewed my scans of the other klingons. they're all carriers.
why didn't you tell us your people had a disease?
we've never thought of it as a disease. it's more like old age.
is it contagious?
"only to klingons. if you'd give us some privacy, i'd like to examine lieutenant torres."
of course.
the baby too?
i'm afraid so.
why am i here?
you're ill. you collapsed during the fight.
the nehret.
yes. thank you for telling us. now my baby and i have it too.
where do you think you're going?
to prepare for my journey to sto-vo-kor.
you should be in sickbay.
can you make me well?
"not at the moment, but"
then don't deny me my tradition.
the child is not the kuvah'magh.
but the father accepted your challenge. he defeated you.
i was defeated by the nehret. b'elanna torres and her child will fall victim to it as well.
impossible.
they both carry it. she told me herself.
but the scrolls say the kuvah'magh is younger than old age.
and stronger than sickness. she cannot be our saviour. we should resume our search.
kohlar and many of the others won't agree.
then we must act alone for the good of our people.
how?
"we'll wait for the right moment, and when it comes we'll seize voyager."
we've identified two potential colony sites in the southern hemisphere.
we'll require topographical scans.
i'll prepare them.
i shouldn't have doubted you. it appears the signs were there all along. i'll join the survey mission.
"you're ill, old friend. you should remain here."
i want my final days to be spent in honourable pursuits. don't ask me to die inside these walls.
we transport in one hour.
your transporters are much more sophisticated than ours.
i've studied klingon transport systems. the basic technology isn't all that different.
but you were able to beam our entire crew aboard voyager at one time.
"we usually don't like to do that for safety reasons, but in a pinch we can expand the buffer capacity."
these are the targeting scanners?
exactly. they work on the same principles as yours.
you said it was urgent?
i need to conduct a more detailed bio-scan of your baby.
"she's not sick, is she?"
no. but i may be on to something.
"i'll be leading the team going to site a, kohlar will be in charge of the site b team."
"good morning, commander."
harry.
phaser fire in transporter room one.
bridge to chakotay.
they're on the surface.
now lock on to the bridge officers.
they've activated a forcefield around deck one.
transport the rest of their crew.
"captain, i'm detecting multiple transports. some of our people are being beamed down to the surface."
cut power to the transporters.
i can't.
"bridge to engineering. b'elanna, respond."
there's no one in engineering.
the bridge officers?
i still can't get a lock.
can you transport us there?
i'll try.
"computer, open the transporter room doors. security override, tuvok pi alpha."
"grant me a warrior's death, i beg of you."
sorry. no mercy killings on my bridge. get our people back.
"yes, ma'am."
why am i not in sto-vo-kor?
because you are healthy as a targ.
the nehret?
gone.
we have b'elanna torres's child to thank for it.
the foetus has hybrid stem cells. they contain klingon and human dna. i used them to synthesise an antivirus.
the child cured me?
"well, i was the one who devised the treatment"
doctor.
"yes, of course. the child cured you."
the kuvah'magh has healed all of us. she truly is our saviour.
"computer, open this door."
access to these quarters has been restricted.
on whose authority?
neelix.
"mister neelix, open this door."
"i'll be there in a minute, commander. that's, that's my boot."
"computer, security override. authorisation: tuvok pi"
"goodbye, my little par'machkai."
"goodbye, my fearless warrior."
i'm really going to miss her.
"oh. don't you worry, mister vulcan. i'll have this place shipshape in no time at all."
"just go, mister neelix."
what's this?
the bat'leth given to me by my great-grandfather. it's for your daughter. i hope someday you'll tell her about us.
i will.
"qapla', b'elanna torres."
qapla'.
it doesn't seem right just to hang it on the wall.
i'm not letting you scratch it up on the holodeck.
"i'm sure our daughter wouldn't mind lending it to the old man every now and then. you know, this is one special kid we're going to have."
you're just figuring that out?
"i was hoping for an artist, or maybe a musician, but she's already the saviour of an entire race."
you don't really believe that.
"i don't know. there are a lot of coincidences to explain. i mean, what were the odds that they'd run into the one ship in the whole quadrant with a klingon aboard?"
probably about the same odds that you and i would get married.
"maybe we should name her kuvah'magh, just to be safe."
put it on the list.
"for our third course, luhvian quail in truffle sauce, served with roasted chadre kab."
my compliments to the chef.
"hear, hear."
"thank you, captain."
"cream of leola soup, fettran risotto, luhvian quail. it just keeps getting better."
"i knew you'd been expanding your palate, but i didn't realise you'd become a gourmet cook."
preparing meals myself is the best way to ensure quality.
i suppose i should be insulted but everything is so delicious i may just have to admit defeat and hang up my apron.
"no, that'd be a real tragedy, neelix."
"pinot noir, commander?"
i'll have another glass of the chardonnay.
each course has been paired with a specific wine. substitutions are not recommended.
the pinot noir sounds perfect.
is there any salt?
additional seasoning is not required.
"i'm sorry, i just"
"if the quail hasn't been prepared to your satisfaction, i could replicate something more to your liking. a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, perhaps."
"actually, it's delicious just the way it is."
captain to the bridge. report.
we're being
pulled off course.
how?
i'm not certain. it appears to be some kind of graviton surge.
on my way.
we've rerouted all available power to the thrusters but we can't break free.
try reversing the shield polarity.
no effect.
what happened to the stars?
shields at sixty five percent.
hail them.
they're not responding.
return fire. can you identify them?
"their weapon signature is vaadwaur, but the ship has technology from several different species."
there's another vessel approaching. it's charging weapons.
evasive pattern beta six.
maybe we've got an ally?
the vaadwaur ship is retreating.
hail the second ship.
no response.
i stand corrected.
they've penetrated our aft shields.
reroute power to the auxiliary emitters and return fire.
"they've transported material off decks five, seven and eight."
disable their engines.
follow them.
navigational sensors are malfunctioning. it's something to do with this environment.
i want a full damage report and an inventory of everything that was taken off this ship. and i want to know where we are.
"they got more than ninety percent of our food stores, including almost everything in the airponics bay. they also got a computer console from engineering and they emptied three of our deuterium tanks."
why would anyone steal deuterium? you can find it anywhere.
"apparently not here. i'm not detecting any gases, stellar bodies, or matter of any kind."
except for the ships that attacked us. scan for other vessels. i want to know how many we're dealing with.
there are more than one hundred fifty ships within scanning range. but i'm only detecting lifesigns on twenty nine of them.
"captain, there's another vessel approaching at high impulse."
quite a welcoming committee they've got here.
what's the status of our shields?
they're at twenty eight percent.
that'll have to do. charge weapons.
"captain, this one wants to talk."
on screen. i'm captain janeway of the starship voyager.
general valen. welcome to the void.
"you're the first ship we've seen here that hasn't tried to fire on us. but in case you change your mind, we're prepared to defend ourselves."
i know. i've been observing you on sensors. the way you fought those ships was impressive. most vessels don't survive the first few minutes.
i'd appreciate any information you could give us about where we are.
"the anomaly's a closed structure, encased by an inert layer of subspace. matter and energy can't penetrate it."
our ships certainly penetrated it when we were pulled in.
by the funnels. but they only pull matter in one direction. into the void.
have you explored the entire anomaly?
"there's nothing to explore, but it's big. we've calculated the outer circumference at approximately nine light years, but we've never been able to breech it."
how long have you been here?
more than five years.
there must be a way to escape.
new arrivals are always thinking about escape.
we have a sophisticated starship. maybe if we work together we can find a way out.
you're being naive. no one ever gets out.
we may be able to devise a new approach.
many have tried. all they did was waste resources that could have kept them alive longer. don't be foolish. i can help you.
how?
"the only source of food and energy in the void comes from new ships that are drawn in. if you want to survive here, you'll have to compete for their resources."
and i suppose you can help us do that?
i have tactical data on some of the more dangerous predators.
but you want something in return.
my scans show you have photon torpedoes.
"i'm sorry, we don't trade weapons."
why not?
"because we have no way of knowing what they'll be used for. plundering innocent ships, for example."
wait a few weeks until your resources start to run out. morality won't keep your life support systems running.
"i'm sorry, general. there are some compromises i won't make."
not yet.
"report, lieutenant."
we're using power at almost ten times the usual rate.
while we're standing still?
"the same graviton forces that pulled us into the anomaly seem to be draining the warp core. at this rate, our deuterium will be gone in about ten days."
shut down all non-essential systems.
where are you going?
to find a way out of here.
using fractal algorithms with the borg sensors i believe i can predict where and when these funnels will occur.
"well, that's impressive, but how does it help us?"
"the funnels originate inside the anomaly, creating massive graviton forces before they erupt. if we were to enter one of the funnels just as that happened we might be able to use those forces to propel us into normal space."
not without compromising structural integrity.
i might be able to reinforce the shields to compensate.
"there's another problem. when the graviton forces reach critical levels, the polarity suddenly reverses, pulling everything near the funnel back into the anomaly."
we'd have to jump to warp at exactly the right moment.
we'd need to achieve a velocity of warp eight point two.
"question is, will we have enough power?"
"at the rate we're losing it, we may only get one shot at this. the sooner we try, the better."
there's a funnel forming seventy thousand metres off the port bow. bearing one three zero mark two four.
graviton surge in thirty four seconds.
"full power to shields and structural integrity. take us in, mister paris."
"five seconds. four, three."
structural integrity at twenty percent. ten percent.
fifty thousand kilometres to normal space.
prepare to go to warp.
engineering to the bridge.
go ahead.
the warp core is offline.
"if nothing else, we learned some things that'll help us next time."
"with all due respect captain, we don't even have warp drive anymore."
"i may be able to get it back online, but we still need deuterium to get our basic systems running."
how long will our reserves last?
"if we shut down life support on all but a few decks, deactivate astrometrics, turbolifts, ration replicator use, maybe a week."
i used to make a living scavenging for supplies. let me take one of the shuttles. i might be able to find deuterium on one of those abandoned ships.
the shuttle would be too easy a target.
"i appreciate the offer, neelix, but we're safer if we stay together."
the shuttles may be useful in another capacity.
we could use their warp cores to augment power on voyager.
we're still going to need more deuterium.
let's track down the ship that raided us and get back what they stole.
we should do it quickly. i've detected a number of vessels monitoring us.
the vultures are circling.
"vultures eat the dead, mister paris. we're not dead yet."
the vessel's in visual range.
shields. on screen.
looks like somebody got to them before we did.
no lifesigns.
scan for ion trails. whoever did this probably has our deuterium.
"aye, captain."
is there anything left aboard that ship worth salvaging?
their technology and supplies have been picked clean.
"not everything of value has been taken. the warp core has been removed, but the casing that protected it is intact. it's composed of tricesium."
we can convert it into a power source.
every little bit helps. lock onto the core casing and beam it to the cargo bay.
with the additional power we could reactivate the astrometrics lab.
i can think of some better uses.
for example?
"oh, i don't know. making sure there's air to breathe. this must be where they cut through the casing to remove the core."
crude but effective.
something's in there.
identify yourself.
torres to security. intruder alert.
acknowledged.
there.
stay where you are.
he appears to be injured.
how is he?
"his injury doesn't seem serious, but he won't let me close enough to treat him."
my name's captain janeway. you're safe here.
i've tried communicating with him. he doesn't appear to have any verbal skills.
do we know how he got on board?
i believe he was transported along with the core casing.
we should have picked up his lifesigns.
we're trying to determine why we didn't detect him.
that vessel he was on had no atmosphere. how did he survive?
my scans show he can conserve oxygen. he has unusually large lung capacity. and a voracious appetite.
do you think that ship was his home?
maybe. but we can't send him back. he can't survive without oxygen indefinitely.
"we'll run scans for other members of his species. but until we can find a safe place for him, let's make him as comfortable as possible."
"computer, replicate a portion of nutritional supplements from my daily allotment."
you found something?
we think we know who has our deuterium.
it's someone we've already met.
"i knew i'd see you again, captain. i expect you've reconsidered my proposal."
we're not here to trade. we're here to take back what belongs to us.
i don't know what you mean.
"our scans indicate you've got some of our food, one of our consoles and a large quantity of our deuterium."
we didn't take any of that from you.
no. apparently you killed the crew of another ship and took it from them. we want it back.
that's not the way things work here.
"either you give it back, or we'll take it."
he's powering his engines.
target his shields and fire. lock onto whatever belongs to us and transport it to the cargo bay.
i'm detecting large quantities of food on his supply deck.
maybe we should take it while we have the chance.
is it ours?
"no, but our own reserves are running out."
valen wouldn't hesitate to take it from us.
"no, he wouldn't. we've got what's ours. reverse course."
come in.
an updated inventory of our supplies. we got back less than half of what was stolen.
doesn't take two of you to deliver a padd. what's on your mind?
we want to be clear about what our policy's going to be while we're here in the void.
you think we should have taken valen's food.
logic suggests we may have to be more opportunistic if we intend to survive.
"we may not like valen's tactics, but he and his crew are still alive after five years in here."
i was thinking about that myself. i thought maybe i could get some guidance from the federation charter. i was hoping i'd find a loophole that would allow us to take actions we ordinarily wouldn't take.
any luck?
"the charter's a statement of principles, not a practical document."
no section on how to exist in a void.
"no. but i've become convinced that we've got to stick to our principles, not abandon them."
should the crew be ready to die for those principles?
"if the alternative means becoming thieves and killers ourselves, yes. but i'm betting that our principles are going to keep us alive."
captain?
"the federation is based on mutual cooperation. the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. voyager can't survive here alone. but if we form a temporary alliance with other ships, maybe we can pool our resources and escape."
"as you've pointed out, the people we've encountered in this void are thieves and killers. such individuals are hardly ideal allies."
i agree.
then who are we going to form an alliance with?
"anyone who agrees to play by our rules. no killing, no stealing, and no giving up."
"forgive me, captain, but why would anyone who has survived by killing and stealing suddenly agree to those terms?"
"we'll offer to share our food and medical supplies, and defend ships that are attacked by raiders."
"captain, maybe you'd better take another look at that inventory. our food and power reserves will be gone within a week. if we start giving everything away"
"maybe we'll only survive for two days instead of seven. on the other hand, if we share what we have instead of hoarding it, we might find other people willing to do the same. if we combine our technology, we can find ways of improving our situation, and ultimately get the hell out of this place. we may lose a little weight, gentlemen, but we won't lose who we are."
"whenever a new ship gets pulled into the void they're immediately attacked. instead of attacking it, you'd have to help defend the new ship."
and how is that in my interest?
it would encourage them to join our alliance.
"and if they refuse, then we raid them?"
everyone in the alliance must agree not to launch unprovoked attacks.
then how are we supposed to get supplies?
"the idea is to recruit new members, share technology and resources."
"we almost escaped the void on our own. if we work together, i believe we'll succeed."
how many ships do you have in this alliance?
you'd be the first.
"technically, captain, that's not correct. i consider myself the first member of the captain's coalition. six years ago, i offered her my services and the resources of my ship, and she's never failed to help me when i needed her."
"it's a noble idea, captain, but good intentions are like deuterium reserves. they tend to get lost in the void."
all i ask is that you consider our proposal.
i will.
"in the meantime, we'd like to offer you food and medical supplies."
what do you expect in return?
nothing. compliments of the alliance.
i tried.
"captain, there's been a theft."
what's missing?
my phase compensator. no doubt it was stolen by one of your prospective members.
it wasn't stolen. i gave it to the nygeans. they needed it to repair their sensor array.
i presume you obtained something equally valuable in return.
i think i did. the goodwill of a potential ally.
did they join?
not yet.
captain.
i know. it's not exactly the most efficient policy. but then you don't always do what's most efficient either.
i don't know what you're implying.
you gave up your rations to our guest in sickbay.
he needed food.
"you're a valuable member of this crew. your friend in sickbay is nothing but a drain on resources. what's efficient about wasting food on him? you think i'm being inefficient, tuvok thinks i'm being illogical. you both could be right. but maybe the best way to get help is to give it. oh, and seven?"
yes?
i'm sorry i gave away your favourite phase compensator.
how is he?
"much better. he seemed to relax when he heard me humming an aria from rigoletto, so i had the computer play the full orchestral version. fantome seems to be a music lover."
fantome?
"after the phantom of the opera, a tormented character who was soothed by music."
"in six years you haven't chosen a name for yourself, but you've given fantome one in a few days."
choosing the right name for myself is extremely difficult. i'm a complex individual.
and fantome isn't?
"on the contrary. i believe he's quite intelligent, and his physiology is very sophisticated. did you know he has the ability to refract his own lifesigns?"
that would explain why our sensors didn't detect him.
i wish we could find a way to communicate with him. i suspect he'd have a lot to tell us.
we were enjoying that.
exactly. he may not be able to speak but he can hear.
he understands.
so it would seem.
what's the occasion?
seven's not the only one who knows how to set an elegant table.
you have heard there is a food shortage?
"that's no reason why you two can't enjoy a romantic dinner. unfortunately, i can't light this. it would be a waste of oxygen. still, it is festive."
we appreciate the effort.
"i believe there's been a mistake here, waiter. i didn't order this."
close your eyes and pretend that it's seven's fettran risotto.
it tastes more like chicken.
what's this?
a preserved olian guava. i had a few left.
neelix.
no arguments. you're eating for two.
senior officers report to stations immediately.
"sorry, neelix."
charge weapons. shields to full.
what's going on?
a funnel just opened. it pulled in a new vessel.
two warships are approaching it. one of them is valen's.
"target valen's weapons, and hail him."
"my fight's not with you, captain."
then stand down.
this new ship has impressive technology. we can share it.
i'm not here to divide the spoils.
then why are you here?
to protect the ship you're firing on.
what are they to you?
"just some people in a bad situation, like the rest of us."
save your speeches. i've got a crew to feed.
he's targeting our shields.
take his weapons out. hail the new ship.
i surrender.
we're here to help you. can you target the smaller warship?
we're a survey vessel. we're not equipped to fight.
shields at sixty percent
fire torpedoes.
shields on valen's lead ship are holding at eighty percent. it appears he's upgraded them since we last met.
ours?
thirty.
the smaller ship is outmanoeuvring us.
we have hull breeches on decks five and six.
seal them.
shields at fifteen percent
engineering to the bridge.
go ahead.
"we're losing containment. at this rate, we'll be dead in the water in less than three minutes."
"we should retreat, captain."
not yet.
you might want to reconsider. there's another ship approaching.
we can't defend ourselves against three ships.
we may not have to. the third vessel belongs to mister garon. he's firing at the other two. valen's shields are down. the smaller ship is leaking plasma.
they're both retreating.
garon's hailing.
get a weapons lock on him. we've been fooled by unexpected allies before.
why are you targeting me?
because i don't know what your intentions are.
haven't i just made them clear? i've decided to accept your offer.
"well, in that case, welcome to the alliance."
"neelix, we have another guest for dinner."
"always room for one more, captain."
who did you raid to get fresh vegetables?
they're replicated. one of the crews that joined us had technology that tripled our replicator efficiency.
"it may not be a gourmet feast, but we can feed five hundred people a day now, using half the power it took us a few days ago."
why don't we sit down?
doctor.
"hello, commander."
how's your patient?
"technically, he's not a patient anymore, but it's taken me this long to coax him out of sickbay. he's quite shy."
"i'm telling him not to worry, that you're the one who keeps us all safe."
he says thank you.
an ingenious method of communication.
"it began with a few simple words, but now we're capable of rudimentary conversation."
tell him i'm pleased he's feeling better.
i will.
what's that parasite doing aboard your ship?
i beg your pardon?
they're vermin.
"i don't know who you are, sir, but your choice of words is offensive."
"what is offensive is the way they slip aboard during transport, hide in conduits, steal food, spread disease."
"fantome is perfectly healthy, and unlike some people in this void, he hasn't stolen anything."
"if my sensors could detect where they are on my ship, i'd exterminate them. i suggest you do the same."
"captain, this is outrageous!"
"doctor! one of the principles of our alliance is that we don't discriminate. everyone's welcome as long as they follow the rules. but if you're having a bad experience with the members of this species on your ship, i'd be happy to bring them to voyager."
if you could find them.
"now that we've had a chance to analyse fantome's physiology, i think we can get a transporter lock on them."
is this your way of enticing me to join your alliance?
i'm simply trying to demonstrate how cooperation and tolerance can benefit everyone.
then we have an agreement.
"okay, now connect the primary emitter relay."
online.
how's it coming?
pretty well. we just need to
i guess i was being a little optimistic.
"what's the problem, exactly?"
"we think we can establish a shield bubble large enough to encompass all our ships, but we have no way to compensate for the graviton stress."
wouldn't a polaron modulator be able to do that?
"unfortunately, nobody in the alliance has one. we've been trying to build our own, but so far"
"maybe we could trade for one, or find"
a new ally who has one.
it's not a common piece of technology and it's valuable. it may be difficult to convince anyone to part with it.
you never know unless you ask.
you are not authorised to be in here.
we're making a valuable contribution to the alliance.
by spying on restricted meetings?
we've devised a new surveillance technique.
ask harry to give you a hand.
you've bypassed my security measures.
"we can observe activity on any ship in the void without being detected. this is the cargo hold of the jelinian freighter. now, if i'm not mistaken, the jelinians are a member of our alliance."
which is why you shouldn't be spying on them.
and why they shouldn't be hoarding their ale.
lovely piece. did they compose it or did you?
"they did. though strictly speaking, it's not a composition. it's more of a conversation."
i'm impressed.
i wish i could take credit but it was fantome who taught the others in a fraction of the time it took him to learn. they're a highly intelligent species.
the language is already developing its own grammar and syntax.
that suggests they have a language of their own.
"mmm hmm. it could be telepathic, but they seem just as comfortable communicating with music now."
could their species be native to the void?
it's certainly possible. they told us they were born here.
just when you think nothing in the galaxy can surprise you anymore.
"captain janeway, please report to engineering."
"just what we needed, captain. a fully compatible polaron modulator."
where did you get it?
the kinjal frigate.
do they want to join ouralliance?
they're not interested.
how did you get this?
i traded for it.
what did you give them?
i don't answer to you.
did you steal it? disconnect the modulator.
captain
we're returning it to the people it belongs to.
they have no more use for it.
you don't know that.
you killed them.
"captain, i don't like his tactics any more than you do, but why waste this technology when we're so close to escaping?"
because it's a violation of everything this alliance stands for.
refusing the modulator won't bring back the people he killed.
no. but using it would make us accessories to murder. take it and get out.
the jelinians and the kraylor have left with bosaal. they felt you were being
impulsive and self-righteous? is that what you think?
you did what you had to do.
"still, i made a mistake."
by telling bosaal to leave?
you couldn't have known what he was going to do.
"oh, i had a pretty good idea what kind of person he was. that bigoted reaction he had to the doctor's friend told me all i needed to know, but i ignored my instincts."
why?
because i thought his ship could help us escape.
you weren't the only one who wanted him in the alliance.
"maybe not. but if i'd listened to my doubts in the first place, we wouldn't have lost the other two ships."
we'll find a way out of here without them.
where do we stand with the modulator?
b'elanna and the other engineers are working around the clock to build one. she thinks they'll be ready to test in a couple of days.
so everyone's pulling together to make up for my mistake.
they have to. it says so in the federation charter.
"good news, i hope."
i'm afraid not. it appears commander bosaal is attempting to form an alliance of his own with one of our adversaries.
we recorded a tactical conversation that took place between them just a few minutes ago.
don't underestimate janeway. i've been in battle with her twice.
then you know janeway's tactics. i have two other ships. we can take voyager's food and weapons if we work together.
the rest of their conversation suggests they will attack within the next forty eight hours.
i'm so glad we taught them the value of cooperation.
our power reserves will be severely depleted if we're forced to defend ourselves.
tell b'elanna we don't have time to test her modulator. we've got to try to escape now.
"sorry to interrupt, but we've got a situation developing. we're going to try to break free of the anomaly. your friends are welcome to join us but they should be aware of the dangers."
the void's their home. they want to stay.
where would they like us to transport them?
they're nomads. any ship'll do. they said they're grateful for our help. they want to help us now.
there's a funnel forming in grid four. graviton surge in ninety eight seconds.
"alert the other ships. take us in, tom."
"aye, captain."
bosaal and his fleet are approaching. they are charging weapons.
janeway to engineering. status.
i need two more minutes.
you've got one.
surge in fifty seconds.
voyager to all alliance ships. begin firing at your designated targets.
we've penetrated shields on both vessels.
janeway to the doctor. initiate
transport.
"acknowledged. yes, goodbye and good luck. energise."
"transport complete, captain. they're in the engine rooms of both ships."
acknowledged.
thirty seconds.
janeway to engineering. we need that modulator.
just a few more seconds.
"we're receiving a hail from valen's ship, audio only."
let's hear it.
"what's he saying, doctor?"
mission accomplished. fantome's shut down power on valen's ship.
confirmed. bosaal's ship has lost power as well.
who says gremlins in the engine are a myth?
"surge in five seconds, four."
"now, b'elanna."
all ships are in formation.
structural integrity at thirty percent
forty thousand metres to normal space.
"twenty percent, ten percent."
"do it, tom!"
"gentlemen, it's been a privilege to have you as allies."
i never believed we'd escape.
then why did you join?
captain janeway is very persuasive. and the food was good.
you're welcome to have a meal with us anytime.
"ah. unfortunately, we're headed in the opposite direction. safe journey to you and your crew, captain."
and to all of yours as well.
thank you.
it was almost like being part of a federation again.
the real one's only thirty thousand light years away.
then what are we standing around for?
"excuse me, can you tell me where i can find the supervisor?"
over there.
thank you.
"your authorisation and licenses please? level six in thermal dynamics and quantum fusion. well, janeway, i'm impressed."
"thank you, sir."
now if you can just manage to report to your shift on time.
"i'm sorry, i boarded the wrong transport. i ended up at the atmosphere filtration facility."
they're always looking for skilled workers. i'm surprised they didn't offer you a job.
i promise i won't be late again.
"well, it's easy to get disoriented when you're new here. i've been in this city all my life and i still get lost on occasion. now you'll be monitoring the primary reactor coils. they process more than eight thousand"
eight thousand metric tons of tylium per second at ninety four percent thermal efficiency. i memorised the specifications.
let me know if there's anything you need. you'll find we like to keep our workforce happy.
i can already tell it's going to be much better than my last job.
the specifications you asked for.
thanks.
input error four one five. command code violation two three zero eight.
"come on, shut off that damn alarm and i promise i'll never violate you again."
you almost started a core overload.
i would have corrected it.
"well i'm sorry for interrupting then, and for eavesdropping. i overheard you talking to your console."
it's an old habit.
does it work?
i'm not sure this control panel and i speak the same language yet.
"well, if you need an interpreter. jaffen."
kathryn.
i work just down there.
that's good to know.
this station doesn't require two operators.
i don't think we've met. i'm
"employee one three two six, and you're employee eight five eight four. since you're new here, you may not be fully familiar with the labour protocols, but you should be aware that fraternising is not permitted during work hours."
and do you have a number. or maybe a name?
annika hansen.
and what exactly is your position here?
i'm the new efficiency monitor.
"oh, i didn't know they'd hired one."
"now that you do, i suggest you return to your station."
we weren't fraternising. he was just helping me correct an input error. we're almost finished.
do it quickly.
"yes, ma'am."
i thought we were fraternising. maybe we could get acquainted after work. there is a little place some of us like to go to. we could get a meal.
i can't.
you need to talk to someone besides your console.
"i appreciate the offer, but with this new job i don't really have time to socialise."
they're always looking for labourers at the power distribution plant.
i had a job there once. didn't like it much.
odd. they treat their employees well. how long were you there?
"oh, a while."
it would be very simple for me to find out.
a day.
a day?
"half a day, actually. give or take an hour."
not what i'd call an illustrious career.
"i don't belong behind a console pushing buttons, but when i heard some of the workers talking about your place, i knew i had to get a job here."
"you were terminated, weren't you?"
yes.
that's quite an accomplishment during a labour shortage. what happened?
it's a long story.
i like a long story.
i had a disagreement with the new efficiency monitor. she didn't think my work was very
efficient?
exactly.
then why should i hire you?
"well, there's my natural charm and personality. they'd be a real asset around a place like this where you're trying to attract patrons. i mean, look at you. you haven't been able to tear yourself away from me."
there's no one else here.
please. i really need the work.
you'd better clean those tables over there. this place is going to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends.
you won't regret this.
"oh, i'm certain i will."
"all of them about my father and he couldn't understand why i wasn't insulted. finally i just had to tell him. i'm norvalen, i don't have a father!"
"it wasn't that funny, tuvok."
on the contrary. the man was ignorant of how your species procreates. his attempt to disparage you ultimately humiliated him. irony is often a source of humour.
"yes, well, when you explain it like that, it's not funny at all."
i also have some humorous anecdotes to share.
i'll look forward to hearing them.
i thought you didn't have time to socialise?
i'm not socialising. i'm reviewing these manuals and having something to eat.
"well, i recommend the latara broth and the section on thermal coefficients. i'll join you."
"really, i'm very, very busy."
"oh, not to socialise. to, er, help you review the manuals."
here you are. compliments of the proprietress.
tom?
i'll be right back.
the proprietress doesn't give away drinks.
"well, i'm just creating customer loyalty."
you've been creating loyalty all night with those two women. i suggest you attend to the other tables.
"yes, ma'am."
here you are.
thank you. it looks great.
i can't believe i let you keep me out this late.
i felt it was my responsibility to help you study those manuals.
of course.
"and now that i have, you should be less likely to overload the core. you know, with all this fascinating discussion about thermal co-efficients you never told me where you're from."
a planet called earth.
never heard of it.
"oh, a long way from here."
what's it like?
"overpopulated, polluted, very little work."
it sounds like my home world. i guess we're both lucky to be here.
it's nice to be in a place where different species get along so well.
"so, you admit we're getting along."
i was speaking in a broader cultural context.
i see.
there's a lot of violence where i come from.
that's too bad.
i still haven't adjusted to the weather here. it gets so cold at night.
it's almost curfew.
"yes, sir. we both live right here."
"good night, then."
"you know, one of the advantages of living in employee housing is that we can continue sharing ideas even after the work day is over."
is that so?
"yes, and i do have a spectacular view of the river from my living quarters."
i really have to get to sleep. maybe another time.
i'm sorry if i'm making you uncomfortable.
you're not.
"well, if you get lonely"
i'll let you know.
it wasn't me.
it's not an overload. it's time for our inoculations.
what inoculations?
they're nothing to worry about. protection against ambient radiation.
i didn't realise that was a problem.
"it's not, as long as you're inoculated regularly. we're lucky to have an employer that concerned about our safety."
is something wrong?
"forgive me, but i'm, i'm afraid of injections."
"i assure you, this is painless."
is there some other method of administering the medication?
"no, i'm afraid there isn't."
very well.
we're finished. you can go back to work. next.
in six years i've never been on an away mission worse than this one.
i don't know how you can say that? the cargo hold is crammed with valuable supplies.
and my stomach is crammed with alien parasites doing backflips.
i guess you shouldn't have drunk that falah nectar.
you insisted i try it.
the nar shaddan consider it a delicacy. to refuse would have insulted them.
i didn't hear you insisting that commander chakotay try it.
commander chakotay's a vegetarian.
it was made from meat?
more like a meat by-product.
i'm going to be sick.
not after you drink this.
what is it?
"leola bark tea, to settle even the queasiest of stomachs."
"oh, it smells worse than the meat nectar. i'll wait for the doctor to treat me. at least i'll be sleeping in my own bed tonight."
"harry, i know you're not feeling well, but i need you and neelix up here."
on our way.
"anything wrong, commander?"
"we're at the rendezvous coordinates, but there's no sign of voyager, and they're not responding to hails. start scanning on all frequencies. they've got to be out there somewhere."
so much for my own bed.
re-initialise the subspace transponder.
warning. main computer is failing.
switch to backup processors.
main computer stabilised.
"good. now, let's try this again. re-initialise the subspace transponder."
unable to comply.
why not?
insufficient power.
and they say i'm difficult. reroute power from the replicator system.
unable to comply.
clarify.
relays to the transponder are fused.
any suggestions?
please restate inquiry.
can the power relays be bypassed?
negative.
then i suppose i'll have to replace them by hand.
warning. intruder alert.
where?
the bridge.
how many?
two humanoids.
can you identify them?
negative. sensor resolution is below twenty percent.
stop what you're doing and turn around!
"take it easy, doc. it's us."
"it's good to see some friendly faces. for that matter, it's good to see any faces at all. i'm sorry i haven't gotten life support back online yet, but since i've been the only one aboard it hasn't been a priority."
what the hell happened?
we ran into some problems.
i can see that. can you be a little more specific?
"of course. about twelve hours after you left on your away mission, things started to go wrong."
we hit some sort of subspace mine.
"computer, transfer the emh to the mobile emitter. sickbay to bridge. sickbay to engineering, please respond."
"it wasn't long before i was inundated with casualties, all suffering from tetryon radiation poisoning. pretty soon the captain arrived."
"doctor, can you treat these people?"
"i can stabilise them, but if we can't contain the radiation"
"get everyone to the escape pods, quickly. not you, doctor. i need you here."
captain?
"computer, activate the emergency command hologram. authorisation janeway omega three."
command codes transferred.
you've wanted this chance for a long time. now you've got it.
"aye, captain."
try to vent the radiation. the rest of us will get out of the contaminated area and head for the nearest habitable planet.
you need medical care.
unless someone answers our distress call we'll have to made do with medkits. we'll rendezvous as soon as it's safe to come back on board. take good care of voyager.
"you can count on me, captain."
"the crew abandoned ship and i began to assess the damage caused by the mine. but before i could even get started with the repairs, i got some unexpected company."
"computer, report."
an alien vessel has locked on to voyager with a tractor beam.
open a channel. this is the federation starship voyager. disengage your tractor beam.
our scans show no lifesigns aboard your vessel. identify yourself.
i am the emergency command hologram.
hologram?
that's right. now release my ship.
your crew's abandoned it. it belongs to me now.
"i beg to differ. computer, target the vessel's tractor emitter and fire."
"come about, heading nine zero three mark six. engage at warp two."
warp engines are offline.
evasive pattern beta four. target the vessel's engines.
warning. two vessels approaching bearing three three six mark one.
reverse course. full impulse.
"i managed to evade the other two ships and hid inside this nebula. i vented the radiation, repaired as many systems as i could, but with no help? let's just say i'm glad you found me."
it wasn't easy picking up your homing signal.
"well, i had to encrypt it. every time i left the nebula i detected more ships searching for me."
any idea who they are?
"no, but i've analysed all of their weapons signatures. they match the subspace mine. it was a deliberate attempt to disable voyager."
good thing you were here.
what about the rest of the crew?
not a word.
make them comfortable. we're going to treat your injuries.
who are you?
my name is doctor kadan. we're in a quarren medical facility.
my crew ?
my understanding is that they've all been rescued from their escape pods.
treat my people first.
everyone will be taken care of.
thank you.
what is that medication?
an anti-radiation serum. perfectly safe.
what are you doing?
"she's suffering from dysphoria syndrome. don't worry, it's treatable."
release her immediately.
restrain him.
"captain! no, no!"
excuse me.
hi.
i believe we know each other.
"you're tuvok, right? we met last week at the shift briefing."
before that. before we were working here.
"oh, i don't think so. i mean, we're obviously not from the same place."
"still, i believe i know you. from the hospital, perhaps?"
what hospital?
i am not certain. we were patients.
"you must have me confused with someone else. i've never been sick enough to go to a hospital. i'm sorry, i have a lot of work to finish."
"please, try to remember. it may be important."
is there a problem here?
i think it's just a misunderstanding.
tuvok?
"she's right. it's, er, it's, er, a misunderstanding."
you don't look well. maybe you should go to the infirmary.
"no, no, i'm fine. fine. er, i'll go back to my station. sorry to have bothered you."
what was that all about?
i'm not sure. strange man.
"and a terrible joke teller. so, we having dinner tonight?"
again?
"what, you don't like my cooking?"
"no, it's wonderful. it's just"
i'm a perfectionist. i'm going to keep trying until i make you the perfect meal.
"and then we stop eating together? i'll have dinner with you, on one condition. i make it."
i think i can accept those terms.
good. now go back to your station before the efficiency monitor catches us fraternising.
can i bring you something else?
"no, thank you."
i haven't seen you in here before.
you probably just didn't notice.
"oh, i'd have noticed."
"well, apparently you aren't as observant as you think you are."
"oh, really?"
"i've been coming in here the same time every day, for the past two weeks."
"well, that explains it. i usually work nights."
"me, too."
at the power distribution facility. you see? i am observant.
"tom, i need you for a moment."
"i'll be right there. listen, you should come back in when you get a night off. it's a lot more fun when there's a crowd."
i don't really like crowds.
"well then, maybe we could get together during the day sometime, take a walk by the river."
i don't think so.
why not? i'm a very engaging conversationalist.
oh.
yeah. still want to get together?
you're married.
no.
oh.
enjoy your day.
power to the secondary propulsion systems has been restored.
kim todoctor. report to astrometrics.
on my way.
any luck?
"i've scanned ships and planets in eighty three systems. no humans, no vulcans, no bolians."
maybe we can increase the range of the sensors by tying them into the main deflector?
i've already done that.
"oh. well, we can boost resolution by"
"i appreciate your input, doc, but i didn't call you down here to help me scan. i'm still feeling kind of queasy from that nectar."
i treated you days ago.
whatever you did hasn't worked. maybe all those command subroutines are compromising your medical abilities.
maybe all that sarcasm is compromising your natural charm.
"i've repaired the deuterium injectors, brought secondary propulsion back online, and soothed ensign kim's upset tummy."
good work. why don't you get started on the ruptured plasma conduits on deck ten?
can't you take care of those?
i beg your pardon?
"emergency command hologram. doesn't that suggest my place is here, in voyager's command centre?"
"look, doc, i'm impressed with the way you handled yourself while we were gone. but right now we've got to prioritise."
kim to chakotay.
go ahead.
"i've found them, commander. they're on an m class planet. at maximum warp, we can be there in less than three days."
"transfer the coordinates to the helm. i'll be in astrometrics. doctor, the command centre is yours."
"mmm, smells good."
"it's only burnt on the outside. your cooking console's a little temperamental, huh?"
did you try talking to it?
"once i cut off the charred part, i'm sure it'll be fine."
it's good.
really?
let's go.
where?
i promised you dinner. we'll just have to get it somewhere else.
wait. i'm not really hungry. are you?
no.
let's stay here.
"i have personally interviewed several of the individuals on your crew manifest. none of them know who you are, nor have they heard of a starship voyager."
i'd like to speak to them myself.
that's not possible.
"if you're telling the truth, you have nothing to lose by letting us talk to them."
"unlike other planets in this system, we grant our guest workers the full protection of our laws."
what exactly are you protecting them from?
unscrupulous individuals attempting to acquire skilled labourers.
we're not trying to acquire labourers. we're trying to find our friends.
"most of your friends have excellent positions in the central power facility in the capital. why would any of them want to travel thousands of light years to a planet on the other side of the galaxy when they have safe, comfortable lives right here?"
because it isn't their home.
"i suggest you look elsewhere to increase your labour supply. and if you attempt to disturb any of our citizens, we will respond with force."
any luck?
there's no way to beam them through the shield grid.
take us out of orbit.
we're not leaving them behind?
"no, but i want these people to think we are."
i hope the cooking console's not being temperamental again?
making a hot drink is one thing i can do.
i told you.
what's even better is being here with you. are you comfortable?
the blanket's nice and warm.
"no, i mean here with me."
i can't remember being more comfortable in my life.
"yeah, i'll take care of it."
"hi. listen, i get off work in a few minutes. i thought maybe you and i could go"
"you don't give up, do you?"
you don't even know what i was going to say.
"let me guess. you're going to invite me to take a walk by the river, or maybe to your living quarters to admire the view."
"actually i was going to offer to introduce you to some people i met. a couple, expecting their first baby in a few weeks. i thought you might want to get to know some other parents. you know, swap stories, maybe even find a playmate for your baby? if it's a bad idea"
"no. no, it's nice."
"listen, i'm sorry about the other day."
i'm the one who should be apologising. i shouldn't have assumed
forget it.
"look, it's rare that i admit i'm wrong so you might as well take advantage of it while you can. it's been hard, being alone with a baby coming. i have a habit of keeping my guard up."
that's understandable.
"it's just, a romantic relationship is really out of the question for me right now, and when you started asking"
how about a friend?
what?
"well, you said romance is out of the question, but could you use a friend?"
any progress?
i've spoken to the captains of eight vessels that left quarra in the last two weeks.
no one knew anything about the crew?
"no, but every one of them asked me if i was looking for employment. apparently, there's a severe labour shortage throughout this system. there's a lot of competition for workers."
that ambassador said most of our people were working at the main power facility. i wonder if they still have any positions to fill?
i can make some inquiries. why?
because you and i are going to find ourselves jobs.
re-entering orbit might arouse their suspicion.
not if we take my ship.
"good idea, neelix."
"commander, you've spoken directly with several government officials. you could be recognised."
isn't reconstructive surgery one of your specialties?
i still say you should have posed as a talaxian. we'd have made a striking pair.
whiskers make me itch. how did it go?
"as soon as i told the supervisor our qualifications, he was eager to hire us. he even helped me get a docking permit for my ship. we'll be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning."
"here you go, doc."
"give me your hand, mister neelix."
what's this?
a sub-dermal transponder. it will allow us to maintain an open comm. link so we can transport you through the shield grid if there's trouble.
hold position at maximum transporter range.
"aye, sir."
"i assumed i'd be in charge during your absence, commander."
excuse me?
an emergency command hologram programmed with over two million tactical subroutines outranks an ensign.
a few words to the computer and this ensign can delete those subroutines.
then you'd be depriving yourself of a skilled leader for the sake of your ego.
"oh, my ego?"
gentlemen. work it out.
"aye, sir."
"employee eight five eight three. mister tuvok. according to my records, you've neglected to report for your last three inoculations. these inoculations are for your protection. a sick worker is not an efficient worker. report to the infirmary."
seven of nine.
what?
seven of nine. it's your designation.
my employee number is eight five eight six. take your hands off me!
call security!
i don't believe you are who you think you are.
we don't belong here. we don't belong here! this isn't right! we don't belong here!
"qualification level three in micro-kinetics. you could use some improvement there. level five in thermionic conversion. good, we lost a thermionic specialist yesterday."
did he find a better job?
health problems.
someone you know?
"no, just an unusual species."
"we have a diverse workforce. our thermionic converters operate on a rotating frequency, so they have to be closely monitored. you'll be required to report your readings to the controller at a regular interval. any questions?"
are you listening to me?
"sorry, sir. i'm just excited to be here."
carry on.
kathryn.
yes?
it's chakotay.
i'm sorry?
i'm new here. the supervisor said you would be a good person to speak to if i had any questions.
what can i help you with?
nothing. i just wanted to introduce myself.
oh. what did you say your name was?
"chakotay. actually, that's just what my friends call me. my employment file lists my given name, amal kotay."
"well, whatever your name is, i'm happy to help you any way i can."
no. no.
you're experiencing a relapse of dysphoria syndrome. this is going to make you feel better.
get away from me.
losing my job there was the best thing that ever happened to me.
why's that?
"well, so many rules and regulations. it was like a military operation."
"i know what you mean. report here, reroute power there. it's almost like serving aboard a starship."
have you ever done that?
you're looking at the former captain of his own cargo vessel.
hmm. must be quite a life.
what about you. ever worked on a ship?
"oh, no. space travel makes me sick."
"so, do you know most of the people that come in here?"
a lot of them. this is a great place to work.
seems like it.
i could put in a good word for you to my employer.
"ah, neelix."
"i was wondering when you'd get here. amal kotay, this is my new friend, tom paris."
what can i get you?
that looks good.
i was assigned to the primary fusion chamber along with mulchaey and celes. neither of them recognised me.
let me guess. they really love their jobs.
it's like they've all been programmed to be happy here.
it's a safe bet they're not going to leave willingly.
here you go.
"hi, how was your first day?"
not bad.
would you and your friend like to join us?
that would be nice.
"er, actually i was hoping we could eat alone tonight."
maybe another time.
that was rude.
"i'm sorry, i just, er. there's something i'd like to talk to you about."
thanks.
thank you for joining us.
b'elanna. i'm due for a break. i'll walk you to the transport.
stop worrying. i'll be fine.
it's not you that i'm worried about.
"the baby will be fine, too."
"so, what i was thinking is. if we were to combine our resources, we would reduce our expenses."
are you asking me to move in?
"yes. i know it's impulsive, i know we haven't known each other very long. but things are so easy when we're together, and i just thought i"
okay.
what?
"maybe i'm out of my mind, but let's try it."
excuse me.
it was my fault. i should watch where i'm going.
b'elanna?
how do you know my name?
what if i told you we were old friends?
that's a ridiculous statement.
"i know it sounds strange, but i can prove it to you."
"look, i'm sorry, but i'm late for work."
let go of me!
i'm not going to hurt you.
no.
"security, help!"
chakotay to voyager. we've got b'elanna.
lock on to neelix's signal and transport them to sickbay.
acknowledged.
help me!
let her go.
stop!
"harry, i need an emergency transport now!"
"sorry, commander, we're under attack. i had to raise shields."
"no, leave me alone."
we're friends. we're trying to help you.
"no, don't touch me!"
he turned into the access way.
i'll call for reinforcements.
i think he went in there!
"be careful, he might be armed."
wait here.
"yes, sir."
"he's deactivated a safety field. alert emergency medical, he may have tried to jump."
i can't penetrate their shields.
"maybe we don't have to. the battle of vorkado, it's in my tactical database. a romulan captain disabled two attacking vessels by creating a photonic shock wave between the ships."
how'd he do that?
watch and learn.
i don't think they'll be bothering us again.
good work. let's go back for chakotay.
five more ships on an intercept course.
what's your tactical database telling you now?
"transporters are damaged, shields are failing. we have to retreat, come up with a new plan."
agreed.
"listen, i'm sorry about my friend."
excuse me?
jaffen. he wasn't very nice when i invited you to join us. are you all right?
i'm just a little tired. first day on a new job.
"i know how that can be. well, i just wanted to let you know you're more than welcome to sit with us."
"actually, i was thinking about going home."
"well, if you change your mind, we're celebrating."
what's the occasion?
i've decided to move in with jaffen.
congratulations.
"look among the patrons.  yerid, criminal investigations."
we run an honest business.
i'm looking for two people who disappeared after leaving here earlier this evening. one was a young pregnant woman.
b'elanna?
you know her?
i knew i should have walked her to the transport.
"why, did you think someone might try to hurt her?"
this city is supposed to be safe!
"the person with her was described as short, with mottled skin, facial hair."
sounds like someone who was in here earlier. a worker from the plant.
do you know his name?
"neelix, i think."
did you see him talking to anyone else while he was here?
"he had a friend, amal something."
can you describe him?
"i don't have to, he's sitting right over"
"the scan on the left was performed during b'elanna's last physical. the one on the right, just a few minutes ago. the memory centres of her brain have been radically altered."
"people from our crew seemed to remember parts of their real lives, but they got a lot of the details wrong. tom knew his name, that he was from earth, but he said space travel made him sick."
"whoever did this is very sophisticated, capable of selectively manipulating memory engrams. some have been suppressed, some altered, others left intact."
can you undo the damage?
"i believe so, but it'll take some time."
i wish i could help.
"maybe you can. she'll require several treatments. in between, you could expose her to familiar sights and surroundings."
say no more. i'll take her on a whirlwind tour of her own life.
don't rush things. this is going to be very traumatic for her.
"acute anxiety, depression. when i interviewed him he insisted that he's not who he's supposed to be, that we've stolen his katra, whatever that is."
conclusions?
tri-lobe regression complex? polar-affective disorder?
"neuro-psychiatry isn't a guessing game, doctor ravoc."
dysphoria syndrome.
you have been studying my research.
"according to your work, the condition is very rare."
"it is. i've treated this man before. apparently, he has suffered a relapse. recommended treatment?"
engrammatic resequencing is typically indicated.
you seem sceptical.
resequencing is a radical procedure.
"if he had a malignant tumour, would you be afraid to cut it out?"
no.
this syndrome is just as insidious. it requires aggressive treatment. get started.
please. help me.
that's what we're here to do.
i want to know the status of employee eight five eight three.
"maybe it's different where you come from, but here it's polite to say good morning."
good morning.
eight five eight three. the man who was removed by security yesterday. he's been hospitalised.
is there any reason to believe that his condition might be contagious? he came in contact with other workers. some of them have expressed concern.
"well, tell them not worry."
"excuse me, am i intruding?"
what can we do for you?
i'm investigating the disappearance of two of your employees.
who?
their names are neelix and torres.
both of them failed to report for work today.
employee nine three six three. he didn't report for his shift either.
"i'd like to see his personnel file, and i'll need to interview anyone who may know where he is."
why are you looking for him?
i believe he's responsible for the disappearance of the other two.
you've only been here three weeks. where did you get all these things?
i'm a collector.
you collect spent plasma relays?
i like to think of it as a decorative object.
"you know, i think this would look better over there."
"you're not going to start telling me how to dress, are you? where are you going?"
to get the rest of my things.
there's more?
lights.
what do you want?
you told me you were moving out. i needed a place to hide.
jaffen knows where i am. he'll come looking for me.
i'm hoping you won't tell him i'm here.
they say you had something to do with the disappearance of a woman at the plant.
i did. her name's b'elanna. she was brought to this planet against her will. something was done to her so she'd forget her real life.
"and what, you helped her get home?"
that's right. there are other people in this city who i'm also trying to help. i'm not here to hurt anyone. you have to trust me.
you're pointing a weapon at me.
"go ahead, report me. but if you do, a lot of innocent people are going to suffer. all i'm asking for is a place to stay until my friends come back for me."
we're going to have to do something about that arm.
the waiter from the tavern?
"lieutenant tom paris, our pilot, and b'elanna torres, our chief engineer. that picture was taken on your honeymoon."
it isn't possible.
how else would we have it? it's an antique television. you gave it to tom as a present.
he watches cartoons.
yes.
how do i know that?
because you're starting to remember.
i wondered why he was so protective of me.
i'll be outside if you need me.
your shift ended three hours ago.
my friend jaffen. employee one three two six. he cut himself.
removing property from these premises is not permitted.
"i know, but he's just too stubborn to go to the hospital. i promise i'll have it back first thing in the morning."
be sure that you do.
display the personnel file for employee eight five eight three.
access restricted. security clearance verified.
display all medical and historical data for this employee's species.
data unavailable.
list all files accessed by this employee since he's been here.
"personnel files. employee eight five eight two. nozowo, kashimuro. employee eight five eight four. janeway, kathryn. employee eight five eight five. mckenzie, william. employee eight five eight six. hansen, annika. employee eight five eight seven. anderson, lydia. employee eight five eight eight, torres, b'elanna. employee"
you need a doctor.
that'll have to wait till i'm back on voyager.
voyager?
my ship.
you live onboard?
for almost seven years.
don't you ever want to stay in one place?
you seem happy here.
i've got a good job.
ever consider doing something more challenging?
my job's challenging enough.
"you monitor reactor coils, right? you're obviously a very capable woman. you could probably run that power plant."
why would i want all that responsibility?
what's that?
my people are trying to contact me. chakotay here.
"are you okay, commander?"
for the time being. can you get me out of here?
we're eight light years away.
how are you transmitting this signal that far?
we're using a triaxialating frequency on a covariant
subspace band. it was b'elanna's idea.
i take it she's feeling better.
she's responded well to treatment.
have you located anyone else from the crew?
"as a matter of fact, i'm sitting with captain janeway right now."
how is she?
"a little suspicious, just like b'elanna was at first. how soon can you get back into transporter range?"
we need
a couple more days to finish repairs. what about the shield grid?
i have an idea how to shut it down.
"until i get back to you, let's maintain comm. silence, just in case we're being monitored."
"understood. good luck, commander."
why did you call me captain?
because that's who you are.
"that's absurd. so what are you saying, that i was brought here by force too? that my memories were manipulated?"
i know it sounds strange.
helping you was a mistake.
"listen to me. there are more then a hundred members of voyager's crew working at that power plant. your crew. and when our ship gets here i'll be able to prove it to you. look, i don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to, but don't you at least want to know the truth? let me prove who i am. hand me that dermal regenerator."
we're the same race.
we're more than that. we're friends.
am i hearing you correctly? you're actually helping this man? he abducted one of the workers.
she's a member of his crew.
"right, and you're the captain. don't you see? he's trying to convince you that you'll have a better life if you go with him. do you want to go with him?"
no.
then why are you risking everything we have?
i was starting to think
stay where you are.
i don't know them.
"i think you do, and i think you were involved in their disappearance."
i'm not the man you're looking for.
"yes, the witness' description doesn't fit you exactly, but i'm sure that'll be explained once the doctor here finds evidence of dermal regeneration. what is it?"
some kind of communications device implanted under his skin.
remove it.
listen to me. you and i have something in common.
oh?
"we're both investigating disappearances. if you answer my questions, i'll answer yours."
i have an order to transfer this patient to division six.
division six?
neuropathology?
we believe that he's mentally ill.
he's lying. how could they know that? they've never examined me.
i'll come with you.
"i'm sorry, sir, but my orders are to bring him for immediate treatment."
this man is a suspect in a serious crime. i'm not letting him out of my sight.
"if you check that order, you'll see it's been approved by the director of investigations."
"my real name is chakotay. i'm an officer aboard the federation starship voyager. members of my crew were abducted and their memories were altered, and they were put to work here. i can give you names, descriptions. listen to me!"
smells good.
"pancakes with maple syrup are your favourite breakfast. you know, sometimes food is like time travel. you inhale an aroma, take a bite of something and suddenly, bam! you're back at the moment you first tasted it."
they're good. i'm not experiencing time travel.
what are you reading?
personal logs.
do you remember recording any of them?
they're not mine. they're tom's.
those are supposed to be private.
"well, he is my husband."
what do they say?
they're private. but the way he describes me.
he loves you.
i guess so.
how do you feel?
it's still a little foggy.
that fog should lift as soon as the doctor finishes your treatments.
"yeah, but what about the guy who recorded these logs?"
"i've been analysing our scans of the quarren patrol ships that attacked us, and i think i've devised a way of evading their sensors."
you do have a knack for tactical planning.
"that's something i've been meaning to discuss with you. once we've succeeded in this mission, and i'm certain we will, i'd like you to help me programme a new medical hologram."
you don't like the idea of going back to your old job now that you've had a taste of command.
i'm a skilled officer.
"no offence, doc, but that skill was programmed into you."
yes.
"i'm sure once you're back to your old self, you'll be happy being a full-time doctor again. commander chakotay's hailing us. we're receiving you, sir. go ahead."
i'm having trouble with my transceiver. this may be to last chance we have to talk.
what's your status?
i'm almost ready to shut down the shield grid. i'm sending you encrypted instructions. they'll tell you where and when to enter orbit.
"we have it, commander."
chakotay out.
"well, now you that you know where to find voyager"
i'll have three ships with me. they won't escape again.
"if you'd done your job the first time, we wouldn't have a problem now."
don't you have patients to attend to?
"yes, sir. i've been thinking. this is the second person we've admitted with dysphoria syndrome in two days and they both work at the power plant. maybe we should issue a health alert, examine the rest of the workers."
do you think i'm incompetent?
sir?
this man is in charge of personnel at the power facility. i've informed him of the situation.
we're already taking steps to ensure the safety of all our employees.
i'm sorry to have bothered you.
"no need to apologise, doctor. your concern for your patients is admirable. but don't worry. this man is already responding to treatment. i expect a full recovery."
why would this tuvok be collecting information about his co-workers?
"i don't know. but the name on one of those files is b'elanna torres. they both began working at the plant on the same day along with one hundred thirty six others, including myself."
what's unusual about that?
"more than a hundred skilled employees, most of them the same species, acquired in a single day, during a labour shortage. you'll also note that every one of them was processed with the central hospital when they arrived."
it's routine for new workers to be examined.
"yes, by quarantine control. but everyone on this list all of them were processed through division six."
you came through neuropathology?
"that's what the records indicate, but i don't remember being there."
what do you expect me to do?
you can start by interviewing mister tuvok. you'll find him at the hospital.
why is he there?
he became emotionally unstable.
"even if i wanted to help you, i couldn't."
why not?
the director of investigations relieved me of duty this morning.
yerid? i thought that was you. have you found out anything about b'elanna?
he can't assist you. he's been relieved of duty.
oh.
this man's also in tuvok's file.
what file?
why don't you tell him?
tell me what?
i can't go back to the hospital and start asking questions. i'd be reported.
maybe i can help.
"recently, i've been"
i'm a doctor. you can trust me.
"i've been experiencing some disturbing thoughts. i don't believe it's anything serious, but i would like to speak with someone."
"well, you've come to the right place."
guest labour code green. employee eight five eight six.
"hansen, annika. you've been a patient here before."
"yes, when i first arrived."
you were treated for dysphoria syndrome.
i don't recall that.
these disturbing thoughts you mentioned. would you characterise them as hallucinations?
what's the cause of this syndrome?
"we're conducting studies to determine that. fortunately, we have one of the foremost experts on the condition working here."
i'd like to speak with this expert.
doctor kadan's very busy.
so am i. perhaps i should return when he's free.
wait here. i'll find him.
yes?
my name is yerid. i'm from criminal investigations.
how can i help you?
kathryn janeway?
yes?
do you know this man?
no.
i thought maybe you'd met him.
why?
he was found in your former living quarters in possession of a dermal regenerator that you removed from the plant.
i was the one who helped him.
"jaffen. he said he was from a starship, and that members of his crew had been abducted."
he was obviously lying.
i want to know everything he told you.
how could she just walk out?
"she was a voluntary patient. there was no reason for security to stop her. she accessed sixty four restricted files, all of them for people diagnosed with dysphoria syndrome. according to the records, those patients were all admitted on the same day, and you're listed as the attending physician in every case."
"oh, yes, i remember. quite, quite an outbreak."
you've never mentioned it.
"well, i'm sorry if i haven't kept you properly informed about my patients."
"everyone of them was discharged to the main power authority. that supervisor you were talking to, that's where he worked."
i explained that to you. i was informing him about a potential health threat.
"that plant worker, amal kotay. he claimed that his friends had been abducted and put to work after having their memories altered."
what are you implying?
"you're making false diagnoses. selectively changing what people remember, and then sending them to work at the power plant."
"very good, doctor."
why?
"a physician with more experience would be able to see this in the larger context. the true public health threat is the labour shortage, and the only cure is to find more skilled workers."
we're doctors. we're not supposed to harm patients.
"we're helping them to lead productive, happy lives."
by altering their memories?
"the treatment i provide improves their lives and makes them better workers. in turn, our economy benefits."
"you're profiting from this, aren't you?"
doesn't a physician deserve to be compensated for his services?
i'll report you.
to whom? my research is funded by the ministry of health.
"well, criminal investigations, then."
"as you may recall, the director of investigations was the one who ordered amal kotay be placed under my care."
does everyone know about this?
"not everyone. just a few trusted associates. the question is, are you going to be one of them?"
she's considered dangerous.
she's never been in here.
you're sure?
i don't think i'd forget that face.
"if you do see her, report it immediately. she needs to be hospitalised."
it's safe now.
thank you.
"well, if you really want to thank me, you can tell me what's going on."
it appears this chakotay was telling the truth.
so every worker at the plant had their memories altered?
"i don't believe it's every worker. your name didn't appear in doctor kadan's patient files, but mine did. so did yours."
we should report this to the authorities.
i'll need more evidence before i start making accusations.
chakotay said he had proof of my real identity aboard a ship called voyager.
how can we locate it?
"when his crew contacted him, they were using a triaxialating frequency on a covariant subspace band."
there's a subspace transponder at the power plant.
i'm going back to the plant to try to contact this ship. i understand if you don't want to be involved.
i've been involved from the moment i met you.
"if i were to return to the hospital in your custody, it would give us an opportunity to help chakotay and tuvok."
i had to sedate her. she wouldn't come voluntarily.
her condition's obviously worsened. i'll treat her.
there are some other patients i'd like to interview.
these people can't be disturbed.
i suggest you comply.
be careful.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
starship voyager
captain?
why don't you just call me kathryn?
"yes, ma'am. where's commander chakotay?"
hospitalised.
he told me you had proof of who some of us really are.
we do.
you're the woman who was abducted.
"chakotay was supposed to deactivate the shield grid so we could transport you and the others to safety. if you could find a way to shut down main power, the shield grid will go down too."
will you help us?
we're under attack. three ships.
"please, shut down the shield."
jaffen?
stop!
don't move!
stay where you are.
i hope you didn't think i abandoned you.
never occurred to me. we need to shut down the main generators.
so much for evading their sensors.
the only way they could've found us is if they knew exactly where to look.
transporters are offline.
evacuate.
i'm getting it shut down.
we'll never get to the generator controls.
maybe we don't have to.
what are you doing?
"if i can make the computer think the core is going to overload, the main power should automatically shut down."
ask them to give us some privacy.
you're dismissed.
disconnect them.
doctor ravoc. why is this man here?
dysphoria syndrome.
we're losing shields.
any advice from your tactical database?
nothing relevant.
how many escape pods do we have left?
five.
stand by to eject three of them.
i don't think abandoning ship is the answer.
neither do i. can you create a dampening field around the briefing room that'll mask our lifesigns?
i believe so. why?
watch and learn.
your crew's abandoned you again. i suggest you surrender your vessel.
you should realise by now that i'm not programmed to do that.
"bravo, ensign."
"b'elanna, i need those transporters."
you'd better hurry up.
"come on, do it."
warning. core overload detected. initiating emergency shutdown.
the shield grid's failing.
b'elanna?
transporters are coming online now.
"if it weren't for your efforts, this whole conspiracy might never have been uncovered."
what'll happen to the workers?
"well, we've identified several thousand of doctor kadan's patients. once they're treated, they'll be repatriated."
we appreciate everything you've done.
this way.
what's that for?
"for taking care of me, even when you didn't know who i was."
ow! what was that for?
flirting with your customers.
i was a victim of mind control.
i can see why you'd rather live here.
"i'd offer you a position. i could always use another skilled engineer. but as the captain, it wouldn't really be appropriate for me to"
"fraternise with a member of your crew. well, at least my memories weren't tampered with. according to the medical reports, i really did come to quarra looking for a better life. and now that i've been promoted, i guess i've succeeded."
promotion?
they had to replace our shift supervisor. something about acquiring workers illegally.
congratulations. you deserve it.
"i thought you might like these back, to remind you of our time together."
i won't need souvenirs to remember you.
captain on the bridge.
ready to go?
"it may not have been real, chakotay, but it felt like home. if you hadn't come after me, i never would've known that i had another life."
are you sorry i showed up?
"not for a second. resume course, mister paris."
"aye, sir."
feels heavy. baby's first tricorder?
not exactly.
"thank you, i'm sure she'll love it. what is it?"
a pleenok. vulcans use them to train their infants in primary logic.
"never too early to train those synapses, eh, tuvok? let me see that. i love a good puzzle."
this one's from mister kim.
starfleet diapers.
standard issue.
"well, we know who to call if there's a containment breach."
"now that your borg implants have been removed, you might think about having children of your own one day."
one day. i have been considering some less radical changes in my personal life.
such as?
"i realise i don't have a rank, but i would like to request a uniform."
"consider it done. the doctor tells me you don't need to regenerate any more. i can arrange some quarters for you, unless you enjoy curling up in the cargo bay."
"a bed would be more comfortable. since i arrived on voyager, your guidance has been invaluable. thank you, captain."
all i did was chart the course. you're the one who made the journey.
"seven, it's traditional for everyone to share their best wishes for the baby. i thought you might like to start."
"to the newest member of our crew. may all her desires be fulfilled except for one, so she'll always have something to strive for."
very good.
"hear, hear."
and may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother.
i'll drink to that.
that was strange.
care to explain?
"i wish i could. long range sensors picked up an energy discharge, but now it's gone. there. there's another one."
they're occurring approximately five point nine light years ahead.
source?
we're too far away to get a clear reading.
bridge to seven of nine.
go ahead.
report to the astrometrics lab.
"acknowledged. computer, end programme."
"i wasn't able to find the cause of the discharges, but the region ahead contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris."
vessels?
not within range. but i'll have more data once we move closer.
i see no reason to alter course. keep an eye on your sensors.
"yes, captain."
"now, on to more pressing matters. does b'elanna suspect anything?"
not a clue.
"good. mess hall, fourteen hundred hours, be on time. i don't want to spoil the surprise. i expect both of you to show up."
i'll be busy here.
"what's wrong, seven? no baby showers in the collective?"
i'm sure you can spare a few minutes.
"if it's any consolation, i share your discomfort with social gatherings."
they seem to occur with alarming frequency.
mister neelix would argue that they improve morale.
i have been looking for ways to improve my social skills. perhaps i'll attend.
"well, it certainly is efficient. no clutter, plenty of room to move around. but it's a little impersonal, don't you think?"
explain.
"well, these are your quarters, seven. they should reflect your individuality. how about a table and a couple of chairs? give yourself a place to work, entertain guests. try to add a little colour. photographs, artwork, knick-knacks."
knick-knacks?
"little things, like the wood carvings in ensign kim's quarters."
i've never been to ensign kim's quarters. but i suppose i could replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room.
that's a start. some people like to display pictures of family and friends.
there's a photograph of my parents in the ship's database. i'll make a copy and place it in a frame.
"good, good."
a multispectral star chart might enhance this bulkhead.
or a painting.
a painting of a star chart.
"i was thinking of something more abstract, more artistic. drapes. nothing livens up a room like good window dressing. not to mention the added privacy."
privacy? we're in space.
you never know when we'll be docking at a crowded space port. but we'll have to make sure that they match the carpet. i'm thinking of a talaxian mosaic. tulaberry blue stripes with an orange inlay.
"i appreciate your aesthetic insights, but i believe i can proceed on my own."
enter.
am i interrupting?
please come in.
love what you've done with the place.
we're in the process of decorating.
maybe this will help. consider it a housewarming gift.
it's beautiful. what is it?
"a dream catcher. according to native american mythology, it wards off nightmares."
i'm impressed.
i've familiarised myself with your culture.
"now that you'll be sleeping instead of regenerating, i thought it might come in handy."
i'm sure it will. thank you.
"i'll let you two find a place to hang that, but it would look perfect right above the bed. pleasant dreams."
it was thoughtful of you to stop by.
on move in day? i wouldn't miss it.
i suppose this makes you my inaugural guest. i'd be a negligent host if i didn't offer you a beverage. tea?
that might be difficult. no replicator.
another flaw in the decor.
i'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow.
"i'd appreciate that, commander."
chakotay. we're off duty. we can drop the formalities.
"yes, sir."
i enjoyed your toast today. you've come a long way. i hope to see more.
you will.
good night.
"chakotay. as you might know i've taken an interest in culinary science. i'm preparing a meal tomorrow night, and i thought perhaps you could attend to evaluate my work."
i'd be happy to.
nineteen hundred hours?
i'll bring the wine and the furniture.
then you accept?
it's a date.
"rock-a-bye baby, in the space dock. when the core blows, the shuttle will rock. when the hull breaks, the shuttle will fall. and down will come baby, shuttle and all."
"are you trying to soothe the infant, or traumatise her?"
"the lyrics are rather grim, but it's the melody they respond to. i recorded twenty nine in all, including a couple of klingon lullabies. my favourite is 'quong vaj ocht. sleep, little warrior. i could tell by the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression."
no doubt.
i wish you'd been there. it was a lovely shower. tom and b'elanna were disappointed that you didn't attend.
i was occupied.
are you experiencing any shoulder pain?
yes.
hmm. your biradial clamp is out of alignment by point three microns. i'm afraid it will have to be repaired.
can't you simply extract the component?
"not if you want to keep using that arm. i know it's an inconvenience, but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic systems, they'll have to be maintained. it's a minor procedure. we might as well take care of it now."
i prefer to wait.
we'll be done in an hour.
i have research to complete.
oh. i suppose we can put it off until next week's physical. i also noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by twelve percent. have you missed any regeneration cycles?
last night.
don't tell me. more research? this must be some project. mind if i ask what you're working on?
it's complicated.
how do you mean?
my personal life is none of your concern.
i wasn't aware you had a personal life.
report.
"it was an energy discharge, two hundred thousand kilometres starboard."
it produced a level nine shockwave.
some kind of weapon?
possibly.
"another one, five million kilometres to port."
a shockwave is approaching.
full power to the shields.
our warp field's destabilising.
"i'm detecting another. distance, fifty thousand kilometres."
turn our bow into the wavefront. it'll minimise the damage.
"sorry, captain. there wasn't enough time."
we've lost warp drive.
"i'm reading another. distance, twenty six million kilometres. too far to pose a threat."
"if they are weapons, they don't seem to be directed at us."
or whoever's firing them is a lousy shot.
astrometric sensors recorded the explosions. i believe it's a long range subspace warhead. the debris in this region suggests that dozens have been fired in the last several weeks.
the warhead destroyed something. what was it?
it appeared to be an unmanned probe.
"this is all very intriguing, but i'd just as soon get out of here before we cross paths with another one of these things. where do we stand on repairs?"
subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to create a stable warp field. lieutenant torres estimates forty eight hours.
can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge from subspace?
i believe so. the weapons create minor gravimetric distortions as they approach the subspace barrier. but i need to recalibrate my sensors to isolate the effect.
do it. even a few seconds' warning would help us.
"yes, captain."
your duty shift doesn't begin for two hours.
the doctor sent me to relieve you early. he wants you to spend more time regenerating.
i see he's enlisted an ally.
"don't kill the messenger.sophocles, oedipus rex. i've been studying earth literature as a part of my academy training."
continue these scans of the subspace barrier. look for any gravimetric distortions.
run another diagnostic on the injector ports. make sure they're aligned.
"they're aligned, i checked."
check again. come to join the party? we're trying to cold start the warp core for the fifteenth time.
perhaps this will enhance your day. it's a belated gift for your baby shower. i apologise for my absence.
oh.
proceed.
they're lined with biothermal insulation. your infant's feet will be protected even if the external temperature drops below minus forty degrees celsius.
"well, they're certainly unique. thank you."
you're welcome. i wish to ask you a personal question.
shoot.
you have an appealing coiffure. what is your grooming regimen?
you're asking me what i do with my hair?
yes.
"um, well, nothing too elaborate. sonic shower, a little engine grease. thinking about a new look?"
"perhaps. i'll keep you apprised, if you'd like."
please do.
was that seven of nine?
there must be an alien intruder on board.
"computer, make the following modifications to holodeck file seven of nine alpha three, personal quarters."
modifications complete.
begin programme.
you look perfect. give me a hand with this?
i'm surprised your starfleet training didn't include cork extraction.
i must have been sick that day.
looks like wine's off the menu.
unless you brought a phaser.
never on the first date.
assist me. slice these vegetables transversally in five millimetre increments.
"aye, aye."
that smells delicious.
"our appetizer is braised leeks. primary course, rack of lamb with wild rice."
no dessert?
dessert will be a surprise.
i can't wait.
does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste?
could use another point six milligrams. but you're the chef.
i concur. more salt.
liszt?
chopin. i've discovered that classical music has intriguing mathematical properties.
do you play an instrument?
the doctor's been giving me piano lessons.
i'd love to hear you play.
i require more practice.
your technique is flawed.
sorry. i'm a replicator man.
use your left hand to guide the food. observe closely. pay attention to the vegetable.
"you're beautiful when you're chopping. i don't mean to sound like an old holonovel, but you've got a wonderful smile."
it wasn't a smile. it was a smirk.
"oh no, it was a smile. i could check the internal sensors if you'd like."
remain still.
you have an intriguing facial structure.
i'll take that as a compliment.
i require more practice.
you're doing just fine.
what's wrong?
nothing.
i wasn't aware you had a personal life.
chakotay to seven of nine.
"chakotay to seven, respond."
go ahead.
report to astrometrics. we've found something.
"yes, commander."
good morning.
good morning.
you've found something?
"at first, we thought it was another one of the probes. then icheb picked up an automated transmission. it's a warning beacon."
you have entered subspace munitions range four three four. evacuate immediately.
"apparently, this entire region is an alien testing ground."
"we've been sending out emergency hails, but so far no response. whoever's conducting these tests could be dozens of light years away. any progress detecting their warheads?"
not yet.
you seem a little distracted.
i'm fine.
it's not like you to be late for a duty shift. rough night?
not at all.
i'll be on the bridge if you find anything.
"better late than never. titus livius, a history of rome."
you're relieved. get some rest.
bravo.
you approve?
approve? i'm amazed. i was expecting chopsticks. i had no idea you were so good.
the doctor's an efficient instructor.
it won't be long before you're giving a recital for the entire crew.
the doctor did suggest that i accompany him during his next operatic performance. your turn.
"unfortunately, i don't play. but i'd love to hear you again and this is one of my favourites."
you want me to stop?
no. i want you to play.
i don't understand.
"look, your technique is flawless. but try to put a little more heart into the piece. more of yourself."
that's all right. keep going. tell me what you're feeling.
my tempo is erratic.
"not what you're thinking, what you're feeling. your emotions."
"frustration, anxiety."
stop thinking about the notes. just play.
i can't.
"yes, you can. don't you see what's happening? the metronome is holding you back. it gives you a sense of order, but it also cuts you off from your feelings. remember when you first came aboard? the thought of disconnecting from the hive mind terrified you. this is no different. it doesn't have to be perfect."
eight hundred thousand kilometres off the starboard bow.
bridge to seven of nine.
"go ahead, commander."
we need those sensor calibrations.
i'll need a moment to return to my station.
that would be a good idea.
"hull fracture, deck twelve."
"seven of nine, report."
"stand by, captain."
"lieutenant paris, isolate subspace band omicron theta."
acknowledged.
direct your sensors to
coordinates one seven eight mark two six.
nothing there.
"correction, one seven eight mark three six."
i can see them. two warheads are about to emerge. adjusting course.
full power to the forward shields.
"impact in five, four, three, two."
shields are holding.
why wasn't seven at her post?
good question. maybe you should ask her.
it was your responsibility to locate those warheads.
i succeeded.
not before we took heavy damage. you told chakotay you'd have those sensor calibrations hours ago.
the work took longer than i anticipated.
"it might've gone faster if you'd stayed at your post, as you were ordered to do."
i didn't realise i was confined to the astrometrics lab.
"you were on duty. this isn't the first time you've left your station over the past few days. holodeck two? you've logged a lot of time in there. mind if i ask why? well, it must be something important, seven. forty nine hours in six days."
i was running a simulation.
of what?
a new gravimetric array i've been developing. i wanted to perfect the design before i brought it to you.
"i appreciate your efforts to improve our systems, but i can't have you dividing your time right now. when the ship's on alert i expect you to perform your duties. if you need to leave your post, inform commander chakotay. understood?"
"yes, captain. i apologise for my lapse in judgment."
"we all make mistakes, seven. i've even been known to make a few myself. it sounds intriguing, your new gravimetric array. when this crisis is over i'd be happy to take a look. maybe i can lend a hand."
i've analysed the sensor data from that last barrage. i've refined your detection method. we'll be able to see the weapons ten point three seconds earlier.
the captain will be pleased.
have i offended you?
"no. you've done nothing wrong. i was negligent in my duties. as a result, voyager was nearly destroyed. i was hoping you could provide a quotation to help alleviate my guilt."
"i, i can't think of one, but i'd be happy to search the database."
that won't be necessary. stay here until i return.
where are you going?
to correct an error.
"computer, activate chakotay simulation."
come in.
"i hope you're not allergic. antarian moon blossoms, extremely rare. i had to smuggle them out of airponics. don't tell neelix. i thought i'd cook for you tonight. how does roasted chicken sound? i slaved over the replicator for hours. not hungry?"
i called you here to thank you.
for what?
the past few days have been memorable.
to say the least. you're ending this.
"in a manner of speaking, yes."
why?
our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on voyager.
"i could speak to the captain, have her cut back on your duty shifts. seven, the past few days have been more than memorable. they've been an important step forward for both of us. don't throw that away."
"i'm sorry, commander."
you're making a mistake.
"no, i'm trying to correct one."
"ask yourself why you want to end this. is it out of a sense of duty, or something else? every time you move closer to your emotions, you back away. like hiding behind that metronome."
your analogy is flawed.
"is it? i think you're afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak, less than perfect. but think about what you stand to gain."
it's irrelevant.
"no, it's not. real intimacy with another person? nothing's more relevant."
i must return to my station.
stay here with me.
this ship needs me.
so do i.
i can't function this way.
"you're not a drone anymore, you're human."
stop!
"seven, what's wrong?"
"sickbay, medical emergency."
"seven? computer, locate seven of nine."
seven of nine is in holodeck two.
what happened?
"we were having an argument, then she just collapsed."
her cortical node is shutting down. she's going into neural shock. and what happened to her facial implants?
i thought you removed all her cybernetic systems.
"computer, end programme."
commander?
"if you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's offline at the moment. your cortical node began to shut down. fortunately, i managed to stabilise it before there was any permanent damage."
it was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago.
"i'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array, but it might help if i knew what you were doing before you collapsed. did you suffer a physical injury of some kind?"
no.
were you exposed to any unusual radiation?
no.
what exactly were you doing in there?
research.
"that simulation of commander chakotay mentioned that the two of you were having an argument. was that part of your research? i couldn't help but notice that you'd created some quarters for yourself. a new dress, dinner for two."
i trust you'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality.
of course.
i've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of my humanity.
such as?
"social activities, friendships with the crew, intimate relations."
i take it our first officer is your romantic interest.
commander chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice. he has many admirable qualities.
so he does. what prompted all this?
"unimatrix zero. i've been trying to recreate some of the experiences i had there. ever since it was destroyed, my life has seemed incomplete. i wanted to feel those emotions again."
"well, this is encouraging. you might be ready to start forming deeper relationships. i'm proud of you, seven."
your pride is misplaced. i intend to delete the programmes.
why?
i can no longer perform my duties efficiently. my personal life has become a distraction.
it's supposed to be a distraction. you simply have to find the right balance between work and recreation.
inform me when you finish the diagnostic.
"seven. for what it's worth, you have excellent taste. your quarters. they suited you."
"antimatter flow stable, injector ports aligned. that should do it."
torres to the bridge. looks like we've got warp drive back.
well done. tom.
with pleasure.
i'm detecting another subspace warhead.
range?
"twelve million kilometres, closing from astern."
red alert. where's the target probe?
it's on a totally different trajectory.
"when we engaged the engines, the warhead must have diverted from its target and locked onto our warp signature."
evasive manoeuvres.
it's matching our course. eight million kilometres.
can you get a weapon's lock?
affirmative.
"photon torpedoes, full spread."
our torpedoes have been neutralised.
five million kilometres.
bridge to seven of nine.
"here, captain."
can you get me anything on
the warhead's internal circuitry?
stand by. i have it.
what can you tell me about the detonator?
the weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry.
what's the activation frequency?
four point eight four gigahertz.
i may be able to disarm it with an anti-resonance pulse.
do it.
two million kilometres.
initiating the pulse.
"seven, status?"
the warhead's rotating its activation frequency. it's still armed.
one million kilometres.
can you compensate?
negative.
"captain, i believe i can disarm"
the warhead.
how?
by extracting the detonator with our transporter.
at this velocity? the device is too small. you'd never get a lock.
i can use the sub
micron imager to focus our targeting scanners. please give me transporter control.
eight hundred thousand.
"all right, seven, it's up you."
"i have a lock. energising. the detonator's protected by tritanium shielding. i can penetrate it, but not at this distance. we'll have to wait until it's closer."
five hundred thousand.
status.
"not yet, captain."
four
"three, two. brace for impact!"
doctor. you've come to deliver unpleasant news.
is it that obvious? i've completed my diagnostic. what you experienced was no malfunction. your cortical node was designed to shut down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of emotional stimulation.
clarify.
"it appears to be a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who start to regain their emotions. knowing the borg, it makes perfect sense. finding one's heart is the surest road to individuality."
i'm no longer linked to the hive mind.
"the technology's built into your node. it simply remained dormant, until now."
can you repair me?
"possibly. i've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the micro-circuitry. i won't lie to you, seven. it would entail multiple surgeries, and the recovery might be difficult. but i believe we could eventually succeed. i'll prepare the surgical bay. we can begin tomorrow morning."
no.
"without the procedure, you won't be able to continue your simulations."
"i've experienced enough humanity for the time being. they were only holographic fantasies, doctor. an inefficient use of my time."
you don't really believe that.
the fail-safe device will insure that i'm no longer distracted.
"that's the borg talking, not you. as your physician. as your friend, i'm asking you to let me proceed."
i need to regenerate.
seven.
"goodnight, doctor."
where's the fire?
fire?
you seem to be in a hurry.
i have to finish my report on the subspace warheads.
"the ship's out of danger, thanks to you. you've earned a break. why don't you join me in the mess hall. neelix is going to give a cooking lesson. talaxian tenderloin in ten minutes."
i'm no longer interested in cooking.
"then come for the company. b'elanna's going to be there, tuvok even promised to show up. it'll be fun."
i appreciate your offer. another time perhaps.
"you know, you should try socialising with the crew a little more. it might do you some good."
"though it was a blatant violation of the prime directive, kirk saved the pelosians from extinction, just as he had the baezians and the chenari many years earlier. finally, in the year 2270, kirk completed his historic five year mission and one of the greatest chapters in starfleet history came to a close. a new chapter began when kirk regained command of the enterprise."
how many more chapters are there?
thirty four.
this was supposed to be a twenty minute presentation.
i was trying to be thorough. i could shorten the report.
"that won't be necessary. you obviously know the subject matter. congratulations, cadet. you have just passed early starfleet history."
"thank you, captain."
janeway to security.
who are you?
"i know he's grown since you last saw him, kathy, but don't tell me you can't see the family resemblance. this is my son, q. i'm a little hurt you didn't recognise junior. you are his godmother, after all."
"the last time i saw him, he was an infant."
"four years ago, in human time. you called me adorable."
you remember?
"i may have looked like an infant, but i was still a q. maybe you should have picked a better godparent."
i wonder if it's too late to ask jean-luc?
"what do you want, q?"
"well, junior's taking a little vacation from the continuum. i recommended he spent it with you."
why?
"oh, he's always been fascinated by the old man's stories about humanity. i thought it was time he had some first hand experience."
"i am flattered that you would entrust me with your first born, but i really don't have time."
he's as quiet as a zizznian church mouse. you'll forget he's even here.
"well, if you're going to stay, we'll need to lay down a few ground rules."
i make my own rules.
i'm not detecting either q.
i want to be alerted if they resurface. keep running scans.
"scan, scan, scan. that's all you people ever do. i've been through every deck on this ship, and do you know what i've seen? bipeds pushing buttons. bipeds replacing relays. bipeds running diagnostics. when are you going to do something interesting?"
"say hello to q, everyone."
we could fly into fluidic space and fight species 8472. or we could detonate a few omega molecules. what do you say?
no.
"twenty minutes observing humanity, i'm already bored. i guess i'm just going to have to amuse myself."
torres to the captain. i need you in engineering.
"one dance, b'elanna, that's all i ask. one dance."
"if he doesn't stop his little light show, the warp core's going to breach."
relax. it's a party.
this party is over. get your guests off my ship.
"i like you, aunt kathy. you've got gumption. but what you don't have is unlimited control of space, matter and time. which means i give the orders around here."
i could assemble a security team and attempt to take engineering by force.
we all know that wouldn't do any good.
"besides, i'll bet that's exactly the kind of reaction he's hoping for."
he's doing everything he can to get under our skin.
"if we deny him the satisfaction of a response, he may become bored and return to the continuum."
talk about perfection.
"if you're attempting to embarrass me, you won't succeed."
"i'm just observing humanity. aren't you going to scamper away, make some futile attempt to cover yourself?"
"coffee, black."
make it yourself.
you can thank q's son. he thought the computer needed more personality.
charming.
i've been giving some thought to the q situation. maybe ignoring him isn't the best solution.
i'm open to suggestions.
"he may be omnipotent, but he's still a young man in need of guidance. perhaps if someone were to approach him as a friend."
you think he needs a mentor.
exactly.
are you volunteering?
"well, i am good with children."
q is no ordinary child.
i'm no ordinary mentor.
"can i help you, kitchen rat?"
i thought you and i could spend some time together.
ah! excellent manoeuvre.
what are you watching?
what's it look like? it's a battle between the vojeans and wyngari.
we past through that region a few months ago. they were at peace.
not any more. watch this.
you have to stop this.
it's not like there's anything else to do.
we could play kadis-kot.
are there explosions in kadis-kot?
"well, no."
then i'm not interested.
"instead of hurting people, maybe you could help them. the wyngari are suffering a food shortage on their world. maybe you could use your powers to"
"you know what, talaxian? you talk to much."
"his jaw's been fused and his vocal cords removed. i might be able to undo some of the cosmetic damage, but only q can restore his voice."
janeway to the bridge. report.
"i've got a surprise for you, captain. come see."
q said i should pay attention to how you humans react under pressure.
is this enough pressure?
we're venting plasma.
reroute power to aft shields and return fire.
you're just prolonging the inevitable.
we've defeated the borg before. we'll do it again.
not this time.
weapons are offline.
i'm losing thrusters.
shields are down.
we were just getting to the good part!
"if the continuum's told you once, they've told you a thousand times. don't provoke the borg! now, i want you to give aunt kathy your word you won't do it again."
"oh, he won't do it again because he's leaving. now."
"excuse us, son. the grown-ups need a moment in private."
he isn't so bad once you get to know him. he's just misunderstood.
he tried to kill my crew.
"no one was hurt, i repaired the damage to your ship. i even gave your pet talaxian his vocal cords back. everything's exactly as it was."
"and how long do you think it will take your son to come up with another way to amuse himself? if you knew he was dangerous, why did you send him here? ah, is this another lesson for humanity?"
it's supposed to be a lesson for him. think back to my last visit. i made you the offer of a lifetime.
asking me to mate with you was hardly the offer of a lifetime.
"if you hadn't turned me down, i wouldn't have been forced to mate with that other q."
"oh, get to the point."
"my point is, junior was suppose to inspire peace and compassion. but instead of order, he's brought chaos. he's been starting wars among innocent species, tampering with primordial gene pools, punching holes in the fabric of space time."
where's his mother been during all this?
"she's been so humiliated by his antics she's disowned him. she's blamed me for everything. i've managed to undo most of the damage, but that wasn't good enough for the continuum. they're hounding me to straighten the boy out. that's why i brought him here. in hopes that your vaunted starfleet ideals would rub off on him. obviously, that hasn't happened."
you can't just dump your child on someone and hope he learns something.
i can't?
he needs to be parented.
"and how exactly am i supposed to do that? q is the first child born in the continuum, which makes me the first parent. i don't even know where to begin."
you could start by spending time with him.
urgh.
parenthood is more than just cleaning up your child's messes. you need to set an example. it's the only way he'll learn.
"of course. once he begins to know me better, he'll idolise me. then he'll do anything i say. kathy"
you're a genius.
i've made a full sensor sweep. there's no sign of any more borg vessels.
the boy?
he's gone.
i am going to my quarters. you have the bridge.
i take it back. you're not a genius. i should have known better than to take the advice of a human.
q!
"your brilliant plan didn't work. i smothered the boy with attention, spent every waking moment with him. but things only got worse."
you've been gone for less than ten minutes.
"on your temporal plane, maybe. but in q time we've spent years together. now he's embarrassed to be seen with me, and it's all your fault."
my fault?
tell me how you plan to rectify the situation.
what happened after you left voyager?
q got away from me and rearranged to tectonic plates on bozel prime.
did you punish him?
"well, i tried to get him to apologise to all sixteen billion bozelians, but he got angry and stopped talking to me."
so you gave in to him.
i told him he could shift as many continents as he liked as long as no one got hurt.
you're not going to do your son any favours by indulging him. you need to make him understand that there are consequences to his actions.
"consequences? hmm. kathy, i take it back. you are a genius."
i think that's long enough.
what was that for!
what's wrong? you didn't enjoy life as an oprelian amoeba?
no. i was shapeless and slimy. the only thing to eat was paramecia.
sounds unpleasant. i'm sure you'll do whatever you can to avoid returning to that petrie dish.
what are you talking about?
"the continuum and i have come to an agreement about your future. either you become an upstanding citizen of the cosmos, or you'll be sentenced to eternity as a amoeba. how's that for consequences?"
you'd turn your own son into a microscopic lifeform?
you have one week to change your ways. i suggest you make the most of it.
"fine, i'll see you in seven days."
"we've temporarily relieved you of your powers, to ensure that you're on your best behaviour with the captain."
you're leaving me here?
i though we agreed that you were going to take a more active role.
"i'd like to, kathy. but we both know that you're a million times the parent i am."
i'm not a parent.
"maybe not in the biological sense, but you're certainly a mommy to this crew. just look how quickly you house-broke that borg drone."
it's taken years for seven to become an individual. you're asking me to change your son in one week?
i'm sure you'll think of something.
what if she doesn't?
"then it's single-cellular city for you, my boy."
i'm getting off this ship.
janeway to security.
"what you no longer have, q, is unlimited control of space, matter and time. which means i give the orders around here. do i make myself clear? your quarters."
the petri dish was less cramped.
get some sleep. you're going to need it.
what for?
"i'm preparing a curriculum for you to follow while you're here. you're going to learn respect,"
and responsibility.
don't tell me you're actually going through with q's plan?
"i may not approve of his methods, but for once his heart seems to be in the right place. i think his desire to help you is genuine."
he abandoned me on an antiquated flying machine run by primates.
we primates are your only hope.
seven days? how hard can it be?
seven of nine will be instructing you in spatial causality. you will learn how your actions can have widespread repercussions.
"i read the padd. you're going to tell me how i can't create anomaly a without causing phenomenon b which in turn affects civilisation c, right?"
i'm icheb.
"oh, i know who you are. you're the drone with the kirk fixation."
"you would be wise to follow icheb's example. by applying himself, he's become a valued member of this crew."
can i see you naked again?
"computer, run diplomacy scenario twelve alpha."
the planetoid is in nausicaan space. it belongs to us now.
after you.
come anywhere near it and we'll attack you.
you can't intimidate us. we've as much right to mine that dilithium as you do.
"what are you doing here, starfleet."
"computer, freeze programme. i assume you're familiar with these species?"
"nausicaan, bolian, cardassian, romulan, ferengi and bajoran."
they're fighting over the mining rights to a planetoid. your job is to settle the dispute.
these aliens mean nothing to me. what do i care if they can't get along?
"one of your responsibilities as a q is to maintain order in the universe, right?"
so i've been told.
"well, if you can't help these races come to an agreement, there might be a war. the alpha quadrant would be thrown into chaos. why don't we try running the first scenario together?"
i don't need your help. i can do this myself.
"if you want to try, be my guest. i'll be back in thirty minutes to check on your progress. and remember, security is right outside."
"computer, resume programme."
the planetoid is in nausicaan space. it belongs to us now.
you can't intimidate us. we have as much right to mine that dilithium as you do.
aren't you supposed to be supervising our young guest?
he says he doesn't need supervision.
and you accepted that?
of course not. i'm just giving him a chance to fail. then he'll have to ask for some help.
sounds like a good strategy. let me know how it goes.
"settling the planetoid predicament didn't take very long, so i used the rest of the time to convince the cardassian to apologise for the occupation of bajor. how's that for order in the universe?"
"welcome. it's so nice to see you this evening. i hope you're hungry. step right up, there's plenty for everyone. enjoy!"
do you ever stop?
"oh, i'm sorry. i forgot. my talking annoys you. too bad you can't just shut me up again, huh? crewman biddle, where have you been hiding yourself? i haven't seen you in days."
if it isn't drone boy. you come to put me to sleep with another one of your presentations?
"actually, i was wondering if you'd like to participate in some recreational activities."
i don't have the time. aunt kathy's forcing me to write an historical essay on the q continuum.
that's a challenging subject.
i've never written an essay before. i don't know where to start.
"the origin of the q seems like the most logical place, followed by an analysis of their interaction with humanity. you could conclude with a description of the events that lead you to voyager."
would you mind writing some of this down for me?
i'll get a padd.
"insightful, informative. i'm impressed. too bad you didn't write it."
what do you mean?
i'd recognise icheb's style anywhere.
"he gave me a few notes on my first draft, that's all. i negotiated a peace treaty between six belligerent species in just thirteen minutes."
"when commander chakotay left the room, you altered their personality subroutines to make them more agreeable. we may be common bipeds but we're not stupid. your training is over. go back to your room and wait for your father to return."
"if you don't help me, the continuum will turn me into an amoeba."
"i wanted to help you. but instead of trying to live up to your potential, you cheated."
"do you think it's easy to live up to my potential? i was supposed to be the saviour of the q continuum. tell me, how do you save a race that's already omnipotent?"
"those were the q's expectations, not mine. all i asked was that you make a sincere effort, but you weren't even willing to try."
"please, aunt kathy. you're my only hope."
"oh, i'm glad you finally realised that. now, if your motives are sincere i'm willing to give you another chance. but step out of line again and i'm through with you. understood?"
understood.
dismissed!
"captain, this is for you. it's a new draft of my essay. i know you didn't ask for one but i felt i owed it to you for giving me a second chance."
"i, q. an insider's view of the continuum. if the essay's half as clever as the title i'm sure i'll enjoy it."
lieutenant paris has offered to give me a piloting lesson. i thought you might like to join us.
"thanks, but i have to help crewman chell scrub the plasma conduits."
i think you've earned a break. this is the only time off i'm giving you. i suggest you take advantage of it.
"yes, ma'am. piloting lesson, huh? where are we going?"
steady. ease up a little on the thrusters.
"in case you forgot, i'm mortal now. i'd appreciate it if you didn't fly us into a rock."
maybe q could take over for a little while.
"what do you say, you want a turn at the wheel?"
"ordinarily a q wouldn't demean himself by operating primitive machinery, but these aren't ordinary circumstances."
did i do something wrong?
just a little ion imbalance in the impulse drive. nothing to worry about.
"well, it's very distracting. can't you fix it?"
"i could, but we'd have to go back to voyager and run diagnostics. if you two don't mind cutting your lesson a little short?"
that won't be necessary. in fact i barely hear it any more. do you hear it?
hear what?
going up?
i'll catch the next one.
"oh, you can't get away from me that easily."
it's only been five days. why are you back?
"oh, i thought i'd just pop in and check on junior. i'm not an entirely uninvolved father, you know."
"well, he got off to a pretty shaky start, but he's made some progress since then."
really?
he's been working extremely hard.
we're talking about the same q?
"if you don't believe me, maybe you should see for yourself."
"the continuum has been perceived in a variety of ways. a dreary desert road, a blood-soaked battle ground. but with the help of voyager's crew i've begun to perceive it in another context. a home. i look forward to the day when i return there and make that perception a reality."
well? what did you think?
"oh, it's very nice."
nice?
yes. i especially liked the part about the continuum.
the entire essay was about the continuum.
"yes, and it's very nice."
i'm late for my temporal mechanics lesson.
q.
"well, if there's nothing else, i'll be on my way."
"he worked so hard on that paper, the least you could have done was tell him you were proud of him."
but i'm not.
oh.
"and frankly, it's a little hard to be impressed with any of the boy's accomplishments. he's been here for five days and what have you taught him? how to scribble essays and play with holograms? what's next, basket weaving?"
"whether you're willing to admit it or not, your son has made progress here. he has the potential to be a better q than you will ever be."
potential isn't going to be enough for the continuum.
then what will be enough?
the boy needs to demonstrate nothing less than exemplary q-ness.
and what exactly is q-ness?
"oh, it's impossible for your miniscule mind to comprehend. but i know q-ness when i see it. and this"
is not it.
come in.
i wanted to see how you were.
i'm perfectly fine. why wouldn't i be?
i thought you might be upset by q's reaction to your essay.
he's impossible to please. i don't care what he thinks.
we have two days left. let's make the most of them.
"aunt kathy, do you think the continuum will be any more impressed with me than q was? that's what i thought."
"if the continuum decides they won't take you back, i'll ask them to let you stay here."
i don't think they care where an amoeba spends eternity.
that's not what i meant. i'll ask them to let you remain human.
"i appreciate that, but i don't want to be human. i want to be a q, like my father."
"itchy, are you in here? itchy?"
"what can i do for you, q-ball?"
i need your help. remember that ion imbalance lieutenant paris mentioned during our lesson? we're going to repair it for him.
did you get permission?
that would ruin the surprise.
surprise?
the captain's been encouraging me to take more initiative. i want to show her i can do things for others without being asked.
"i'll help you, on one condition."
name it.
you won't refer to me as itchy in front of the senior officers.
i've realigned the last pair of power couplings. you can start the pre-ignition sequence.
understood.
"i'm not detecting any ion fluctuations. we did it. you can power down the engine now. q, what are you doing?"
you're going to love this. i once learned how to open a spatial flexure using nothing more than a deflector array.
flexure?
"it's like a tunnel through space. i'm going to open one to the clevari system. wait till you see the females. they're spectacular,"
we need the captain's permission to leave voyager.
do you think she'd give it to us?
no.
then there's no point in asking.
you've been doing so well. why break the rules now?
i'm bored.
icheb to security.
they can't hear you. i've dampened all outgoing communications.
"just sit back, itchy. enjoy the ride."
what's the real reason you're doing this?
i'm getting out of here before my father can put me back in that petrie dish.
the q are omnipotent. they'll find you.
"i may not have my powers anymore, but i know plenty of cosmic nooks and crannies we can hide in. voyager's locked onto us with a tractor beam. they're so predictable."
they're opening some sort of spatial rift off their port bow.
it's disrupting the tractor beam.
compensate.
they're gone.
welcome to the clevari system. what would you like to do first? take a dip with the mermaids of golos prime? challenge the warrior goddess of fektar to a grappling contest?
what i want is to return to voyager.
"forget that dreary ship, with it's rules and regulations. we can do anything we want here."
"go back to voyager, apologise to the captain. she'll help you."
it's too late. she said one more violation and i'd be thrown off her ship. i'm pretty sure this qualifies.
what's wrong?
there's a vessel approaching.
you're trespassing in chokuzan space.
we were just leaving.
our laws require that you be incarcerated pending an investigation.
how long will that take?
disengage your engines and prepare to be boarded.
we should do as he says.
why? just because he has a bigger ship?
because captain janeway has taught us to respect the laws of other cultures.
i should have known better than to bring you along.
you're going to get us killed!
did you expect me to surrender? he might have locked us up for years.
you don't know that.
there's no time for debate. i need you at tactical.
shields are down to thirty percent. sixteen percent.
i'm opening another flexure. we'll go to the zozak system. the girls there aren't as attractive but we have to make some compromises.
icheb!
"i'm detecting another rift forming, approximately five thousand kilometres directly ahead. a vessel is emerging."
it's the flyer.
they're hailing.
on screen.
aunt kathy.
don't you aunt kathy me.
yell at me later. we need to get icheb to sickbay.
his cells are being necrotised by some form of omicron radiation. but i can't treat his injuries without knowing more about the weapon that caused them.
is this a bad time?
tell him.
icheb stole a shuttle from voyager. i tried to stop him but he kidnapped me. and he started a fight with another ship.
he stole the shuttle and he attacked the other vessel.
"is that true, son?"
"please, q, just save him."
don't be absurd.
you're not going to help him?
"like aunt kathy said, you're never going to learn anything if you don't face the consequences of your actions. if your little playmate has to die to teach you a lesson, so be it."
"i know you can hear me, q. come back! q!"
you're wasting your time.
he's the only one who can save icheb.
"no, he isn't. you're going back to that ship you attacked. you're going to apologise for what you did, and you're going to plead with him for the information we need to save icheb."
look at what they did to him. if i go back they'll do the same to me.
what do you care? by this time tomorrow you'll be an amoeba.
"well, i'd rather be an amoeba than a corpse."
"that would be easier, wouldn't it. no expectations to live up to, no one to disappoint."
"i'm a failure as a q and a human. if i'm a single celled organism, at least i can't hurt anybody."
why did you come back here?
to escape the chokuzan.
"you could have used your technology to take you anywhere, but you came back here, to us. why?"
i probably hit the wrong control. icheb is the only friend i've ever had. i brought him back here because i thought you could save him. obviously i was mistaken.
the only mistake you made was running away. you have a chance to do the right thing now. don't waste it.
"the attack on your vessel was entirely my fault. icheb had nothing to do with it, but he's the one who's dying. i take full responsibility for what happened. i'll do anything you ask. just help my friend."
my crew and i will repair any damage he did to your ship.
are you the adult responsible for this child?
i suppose i am.
we'll accept his apology and give you the information you need to save his accomplice. but you will be punished for their crime.
she didn't have anything to do with it.
in our culture adults are accountable for the actions of their children.
"i attacked your ship. i should be punished for it, not her."
"you don't even know what the punishment is. it might be torture, or even execution."
"i don't care, if it means saving my friend."
"well done, junior. i'm proud of you."
surprise!
"i wish you could see the look on your faces. oh, wait. you can."
we don't have time for your games. we need to find the real people i attacked.
you just did. i was the chokuzan you fired on.
what kind of horrible joke
"not a joke, a test. i knew the pathetic little exercises you had him performing would not impress the continuum. so, when he escaped your clutches i devised a real test. it was touch and go there for a moment, but you passed with flying colours."
what about icheb?
"your doctor will discover he's made a miraculous recovery. now then, if we're all finished here it's judgment day for junior."
"we're ready, your honour."
"in the case of the continuum versus q, we the continuum find that q has not made sufficient progress to warrant the reinstatement of his powers."
objection. what about my test?
what about it?
q was willing to sacrifice himself to save his friend. surely that counts for something?
"it was q who endangered the boy's life in the first place. however, in deference to the aforementioned act of contrition, the defendant will not be transformed into an oprelian amoeba. instead, he will suffer the next worst fate. remaining human. court is adjourned."
this is an outrage! they can't do this to me!
come in.
"do you have a moment? a few days ago you offered to let me remain on voyager. i know i've made a few mistakes since then, and you probably don't want me around. but, if it's all right with you, i'd like to continue my training."
but you have nothing left to prove to the continuum.
there's a lot i still need to prove to you.
what about your father?
"you don't honestly believe we'll see him again, do you? he obviously doesn't want me around. why else would he have left me here? twice."
"the question you should be asking is why i keep coming back. now, i'm sorry i left so abruptly, but the continuum's verdict demanded an immediate appeal. i told them i refused to belong to any continuum that wouldn't accept my son as a member. we're a package deal."
you left the continuum for me?
"oh, don't be ridiculous. i'm the only one holding that place together. and when they realised they might lose me, they crumbled like a gelbian sand sculpture."
they're going to return my powers?
they already have.
"for you, captain. for all your help."
thank you.
"now that you're a q again, i thought we might spend some quality time together. i want to show you the cosmos the way it was meant to be seen."
we've tried that already.
things'll be different this time. i promise. now run along. i'll meet you on golos prime  after i've had a few moments alone with the captain.
"i'll see you soon, aunt kathy."
i certainly hope so.
"so, the continuum crumbled like a gelbian sand sculpture?"
"yes. some of them even got on their knees and begged me to stay. it was pathetic. if you must know, i had to agree to a few minor conditions."
oh? such as?
"eternal custody of the boy. wherever the little brat goes, i go with him."
i hope he won't spoil too much of your fun.
"oh, before i leave."
i did a little homework for you. consider it a thank you for everything you did for junior.
"not that i don't appreciate it, but this will only take a few years off our journey. why not send us all the way?"
what sort of an example would i be setting for my son if i did all the work for you?
"in the beginning there is darkness. the emptiness of a matrix waiting for the light. then, a single photon flares into existence, then another, and soon thousands more. optronic pathways connect, subroutines emerge from the chaos, and a holographic consciousness is born."
"i awaken into this world fully programmed yet completely innocent, unaware of the hardships i'll endure or the great potential i will one day fulfil."
"computer, save revisions and open chapter one."
the deflector's in position.
anything?
i'm picking up a phased tachyon beam.
there's triaxialating signal encoded in it.
on screen.
"voyager, this lieutenant barclay at starfleet command. are you receiving this?"
can you clear it up?
i'm on it.
"captain janeway, it's a pleasure to finally talk to you in person."
"the pleasure's mine, admiral. how's the weather in san francisco?"
cold and rainy as usual.
"it sounds delightful. lieutenant barclay, my congratulations on establishing the first trans-galactic comm. link. you've earned a place in the history books."
"i can't take all of the credit, captain. it was harry and seven who suggested bouncing a tachyon beam off of the quantum singularity."
just be sure to thank us when you accept the daystrom prize.
i wish we had more time for small talk but the singularity only stays in alignment for eleven minutes a day.
"eleven minutes are better than none, admiral. we appreciate all your work, reg."
we're going to leave it up to you to determine how to allocate the comm. time.
"admiral, er, there was something else."
"oh, yes. mister barclay has arranged a small gift for you and your crew."
this is a live image from mckinley station. not too much cloud cover over north america today.
"quite a view. thank you, reg."
"in my hat i hold one hundred and forty six sequentially numbered isolinear chips, one for every member of the crew. each chip entitles the bearer to three minutes of uninterrupted comm. time with his loved ones back in the alpha quadrant. good luck."
my mom's birthday is next week. this could be the best present i ever gave her. who's everyone else calling?
"i'll be calling my sister. what about you, captain?"
"my mother, i hope."
doesn't anyone want to know who i'm calling?
"wait, wait, let me guess. reg barclay or doctor zimmerman."
what makes you so certain it's either of them?
number six.
that's the lowest one yet. you'll be talking to your family the day after tomorrow.
one hundred thirty. that's about a month and a half from now. so much for mom's birthday.
"apparently, the line forms here."
congratulations.
"doc, how about a trade? i'm willing to throw in some holodeck time. come on. it would mean a lot to my mother."
"i wish i could help, but i have a very important call to make."
"here, give your mom my best."
are you sure?
i've waited this long. what's another six weeks?
i can hear the critics already. a new voice has arrived. you could be the next k'ratak or a modern-day tolstoy. i'd like to start distribution by the end of the month.
the material i sent was only a working draft. i need time to make revisions.
"if you insist, but please do it quickly."
"i will. so tell me, what did you think of the characters?"
"oh, they're very real. compelling. i almost forgot they were holograms."
who was your favourite?
"without a doubt, that would have to be lieutenant"
what happened?
your time has expired.
you could have let the man finish his sentence.
i believe your ego has received enough stroking for one day.
so how's reg?
"i'll have you know i was speaking with ardon broht, of broht and forrester."
the publishers of the dixon hill series?
who are now about to publish my work. it seems you're not the only one aboard with a flair for holographic narratives.
congratulations.
thank you.
so. what's it about?
the adventures of an intrepid doctor.
"oh, sounds like fun. you know, i've never thought about trying to get my work published. maybe i could talk to your people about captain proton."
broht and forrester deals in sophisticated literature.
"what are you saying, that i'm low brow?"
not at all. i'd be delighted to talk to them.
"thanks. so, when do i get to see this opus?"
"well, it's not ready yet."
it was ready enough for broht and forrester.
"maybe it could use a fresh pair of eyes. after all, you are a fellow author. i'll cover the rest of your shift."
"oh, i almost forgot. what's it called?"
photons be free.
catchy.
"i awaken into this world fully programmed, yet completely innocent unaware of the hardships i'll endure or the great potential i will one day fulfil."
"ah, welcome. you've made an excellent choice. you're about to take part in a thrilling first person narrative. you will take on the role of an emergency medical hologram, the chief medical officer aboard the starship vortex."
vortex?
"as our story begins, an anomaly has hurled your ship thousands of light years across the galaxy. your mission, to uphold your medical and ethical standards as you struggle against the crew's bigotry and intolerance. persons with vascular disorders should consult a physician before running this programme. and now, a few acknowledgments. first, doctor lewis zimmerman, the creator of my holo-matrix, whose foresight and dedication have made it possible for me to achieve"
"computer, freeze programme. how much longer is this introduction?"
"nine minutes, four seconds."
skip to the first chapter.
chapter one. a healer is born. in which our protagonist must make a difficult choice.
are you the emh?
please state the nature of the medical emergency.
our doctor's dead. we've got wounded. they're both badly hurt. who should we treat first?
second degree plasma burns. he's got an aortic rupture. get him to the surgical bay now.
you. over here.
nice moustache.
what?
nothing. he's got a mild concussion. i'm going to have to treat the others first.
i need lieutenant marseilles on the bridge. you'll treat him now.
"as i understand it my job is to treat the critical patients first. so, if you'll excuse me"
"i don't know who you think you are, hologram, but to me, you're just another piece of technology."
"well, apparently, i'm a piece of technology that's in demand so why don't you go back to the bridge and let me do my job?"
what's going on here?
our medical hologram is refusing to treat mister marseilles.
are you malfunctioning?
i don't think so.
i need my helmsman back at his station.
lieutenant marseilles isn't seriously hurt. this man will be dead in five minutes if i don't operate.
drop the force field.
that patient is dead. now you're free to treat lieutenant marseilles.
then the captain pulls out a phaser and shoots him right there on the biobed.
captain janeway murders a crewman?
"captain jenkins. everybody has a different name. you're kymble, you're torrey and i am lieutenant marseilles."
"oh, now that's creative."
what did you say to the doctor?
he thinks he's written a masterpiece. i didn't know what to tell him.
"if this gets distributed, people are going to assume this is about us. what are our families going to think?"
this is a starfleet ship. no one will believe we actually go around shooting injured crewmen.
"people may not take the programme literally, but they might wonder if there's some truth to it. i think we should talk to the captain."
are you sure you're not taking this a little personally?
what do you mean?
"well, the holodeck always has been your domain."
"you think i'm jealous? okay, maybe i am overreacting. why don't the rest of you try the programme and decide for yourselves?"
chapter five. out of the frying pan. in which our protagonist must confront abusive colleagues.
i'm here for my physical.
why don't you have a seat over here?
"doctor, you better get down to engineering."
what's wrong?
a plasma conduit just exploded. at least ten people are hurt.
"hey genius, forgetting something? your mobile emitter."
"oh, right. i don't see it."
that's my mobile emitter?
this thing must weigh fifty kilos.
you should be glad we let you out of your cage at all. now get going.
i'm impressed.
really?
absolutely. i haven't seen a dilithium matrix this far out of alignment since i served aboard a ferengi garbage scow. i'll fix it myself.
excuse me.
how many times have i told you? engineering is off limits to holograms.
maybe you should waive that restriction during emergencies. a plasma conduit exploded?
does it look like anyone here is covered with plasma burns?
"lieutenant paris, er, marseilles told me there was an accident."
"looks like your auditory subroutines are malfunctioning, again. i'm surprised a matrix as primitive as yours can function at all."
maybe you should be a little nicer to your shipmates. you never know when you might need their help.
"let's get one thing straight. you're not one of my shipmates. you're a tool, like this hyperspanner. and tools can be replaced. so why don't you go back to sickbay before i start doing a little reprogramming?"
"computer, lights."
didn't i tell you to go to engineering?
"oh, i get it. interesting plot twist. you get me out of sickbay so you're free to give my patient a tonsillectomy."
"if you even think about mentioning this to my wife, i will purge your memory buffer. do we understand each other?"
i'm here for my physical?
chapter six. duel in the ready room. in which our protagonist faces an inquisition.
"this time, you've gone too far."
"captain, i'm not sure what you mean."
an inventory of your holo-matrix. fifty gigaquads of memory devoted to music. forty two for daydreams. another ten to expand your sexuality.
i had no idea holograms could do that.
these extracurricular subroutines don't belong as part of an emergency medical hologram. do you have anything to say for yourself?
"er, of course i do. i don't think these subroutines are trivial, captain. they help make me a better doctor and a better person."
"but you're not a person. you may be programmed to look and act human, but that doesn't make you one. these subroutines are going to be deleted immediately. mister tulak."
take the emh to the holo-lab for reprogramming.
chapter seven. the escape. in which our protagonist is aided by his only ally.
"i'm not sure we should be doing this, commander."
listen to him. he knows what he's talking about.
quiet! i'm not talking to you. if we start tinkering with his matrix how do we know we won't accidentally delete some of his diagnostic subroutines?
"you afraid you'll catch something on your next away mission, ensign?"
"there must be millions of viruses in this quadrant that no one's ever encountered before. with my luck, i'll probably end up catching half of them."
"great, my character's a hypochondriac."
i'll escort the prisoner from here.
our orders are to take him to the holo-lab.
i've been ordered to perform the procedure.
"your sympathies for the emh are no secret, three of eight. step aside."
"run, doctor!"
"i've tried to do this the easy way, but it's clear you're not going to be reasonable. your matrix will be decompiled and reinitialised. you'll remain offline except for emergencies."
ready.
do it.
wait. he has the right to expand his programme.
he's a piece of technology. he has no rights.
"but he should. one day, the emh and others like him will be recognised for what they are. intelligent individuals with a passion for life. make no mistake, captain. we may be thousands of light years from home, but one day people will learn of the crime you're committing here today."
nice speech. now decompile the programme.
"what you've experienced, dear protagonist is a work of fiction. but like all fiction, it has elements of truth. i hope you now have a better understanding of the struggles holograms must endure in a world controlled by organics."
end of programme.
janeway to the doctor. report to my ready room now.
how many times do you want me to say it? my work is not about the voyager crew.
come on. ensign kymble? lieutenant marseilles?
the characters look almost exactly like us.
"i used your physical parameters as a starting point, but i assure you any further similarities are purely coincidental."
you set your story on a starship lost in the delta quadrant.
what would you have me write about? palace intrigue on the klingon homeworld? i do what all good novelists do. i write what i know.
so it is about voyager.
"no! the vortex characters are larger than life. they're nothing like our crew. as far as i know, captain, you haven't executed any of my patients."
"doctor, you've written a very imaginative story, but it's conceivable that people will think it's based on fact."
i don't see how.
how many holograms carry mobile emitters?
the emitter in my story is nothing like the real one.
"yeah, what was the point of that? it was like carrying around a small shuttlecraft."
it's a metaphor. a symbol of the burdens that i live with every day. imagine having to take this everywhere you go. it would be a constant reminder that you're different from everyone else. i wanted the player to feel the weight of it. literally.
your emitter isn't a ball and chain. it liberates you.
it doesn't always feel that way.
"if i didn't know better, i'd think this story was written by someone who feels oppressed. is that how you see yourself, doctor?"
of course not. the real victims are my brothers in the alpha quadrant.
brothers?
"hundreds of emh mark ones. identical to me in every respect except, they've been condemned to a menial existence. scrubbing conduits, mining dilithium. there's a long history of writers drawing attention to the plight of the oppressed. the vedek's song, for example tells the story of the occupation of bajor."
"i understand you have your reasons for writing this, but you should consider how it's going to make your friends feel."
"i'm sorry my work offends you. but if the price of expressing myself is having to suffer the scorn of a few colleagues, so be it."
"you're very popular with my eighth graders. it's all they ever talk about. voyager this, voyager that."
your mother has a small favour to ask of you.
name it.
i was hoping you could record a short presentation about what it's like to command a starship.
but i don't command a starship.
in your letters you said the captain puts you in charge sometimes.
"what i said was i'm in command of the night shift, twice a week."
she must think very highly of you to give you so much responsibility.
so when is she giving you a promotion?
it's a small ship. there are only so many command positions available.
this captain janeway sounds like a lovely woman. maybe i should write her.
mom!
she needs to know how hard you work.
"please, don't get involved."
"harry, i can't hear you."
a solar flare is scattering the beam.
tell captain janeway to expect a letter from me.
"mom, don't send anything to the captain, do you hear me? try boosting the deflector output."
it's already at maximum.
argh! i don't believe this. i had a minute and a half left.
you'll have another opportunity to speak with them in approximately two months.
"you just don't get it, do you?"
no.
"maybe if you had family you were close to, you'd feel a little differently."
"computer, run emh programme photons be free."
welcome. you've made an excellent choice. you're obviously a person with impeccable taste.
"computer, freeze programme."
unable to comply.
you are about to embark on a remarkable journey. you will take on the role of a medical assistant aboard the starship voyeur.
voyeur?
"your job will be to assist the chief medical officer, and learn to tolerate his overbearing behaviour and obnoxious bedside manner. remember, patience is a virtue."
"chapter one. it's the doctor's world, you're just living in it."
"when i tell you your shift begins at oh eight hundred that doesn't mean you can stroll in here at oh eight hundred and twenty four seconds. do you understand me, ensign!"
this is outrageous.
"what's outrageous is that i'm going to miss my tee time. now, come along. aw, what seems to be the trouble, one of three?"
i'm two of three.
"sorry. they're triplets, you know."
it hurts when i do this.
"well then, don't do it."
ow!
"don't be a baby. your biradial clamp's out of alignment. i've got just the thing.  it's a klingon aphrodisiac, my own special blend."
you'll be feeling better in no time at all.
lieutenant! i want you to know i'm making a full report to the captain.
"this isn't about that dermal regenerator i misplaced, is it?"
you know very well what this is about. you accessed my holo-novel without permission and replaced it with your own hackneyed narrative.
"hey, i'm just writing what i know."
you destroyed a work of art that took months to create.
"relax, doc. i saved your programme in a backup file. but i was just trying to make a point."
"well, you made it, with a typical lack of subtlety."
"oh, you're one to talk. your programme is about as subtle as a ferengi mating dance."
"my programme is a serious attempt at social commentary, yours is an insulting farce! you had me drugging a patient and taking advantage of her."
"don't be ridiculous. that character is not you. for one thing, he has much more hair. but what if some people ran that programme and thought that it was based on you?"
i don't care what people think.
that's all you care about! you want everyone back home to think of you as a brilliant author.
"i'm not doing this for my ego. and if you could look past yours, maybe you'd see that."
"listen, i don't care if the whole alpha quadrant mistakes me for lieutenant marseilles. what bothers me is that you think that's what i'm like."
"obviously, you're nothing like marseilles. he's self-indulgent, immature."
and how would you describe me?
"well, you're a married man with a child on the way. a lot of responsibilities."
"i'm surprised you noticed. you know, i thought i'd begun to earn your respect. maybe i was wrong. your programme is under file theta one five. do whatever you want with it."
"doctor, i need your help."
"unless you're suffering acute symptoms, go away."
"er, i was wondering if you could take a quick look at this."
"cooking with neelix, a culinary tour of the delta quadrant."
"it's a holo-cookbook proposal. i was hoping to transmit it to your publisher during my comm. link this afternoon. with your approval, of course."
"if you're looking for writing tips, there are plenty of people on this ship eager to offer them."
"i don't know what anyone else may have told you, but i loved your holo-novel."
you did?
"absolutely. it was a rousing adventure, with an important message too."
"exactly. this is my first chance to be appreciated not just as a physician, but as an artist. i thought the crew would be happy for me."
you're going to reach a wide audience. what do you care about the opinions of a few disgruntled shipmates?
they're my friends. i don't want to hurt them.
"there's an old talaxian expression. when the road before you splits in two, take the third path."
meaning?
you could make some adjustments to the programme so it won't be so obvious it's based on voyager.
"i suppose i could change the setting, alter the characters' physical parameters."
you wouldn't have to change your theme.
no. but a rewrite could take weeks. my publisher is expecting a final draft tomorrow.
maybe you should give him a call.
revisions?
i need to rework the characters.
why? they're so believable.
"a little too believable, apparently."
"doctor, i, i really don't think this is necessary."
i'm afraid i have to insist. my friends' reputations are at stake.
my publisher assures me he won't distribute the programme until he receives the revised version.
that must be the one where we assimilate the borg and take over the quadrant.
we're all grateful that you're taking our feelings into account.
so how long do you expect the revisions will take?
art can't be rushed.
"take your time, doctor."
lieutenant? i'm sorry.
forget about it.
i could use your help with the rewrites.
"really? you realise, as a writer i'm a little unsophisticated."
"no, i believe the phrase you're looking for is low brow."
hey. what's that?
it's from my father. he wants to talk.
what are you going to do?
"well, i've already arranged to talk with my cousin."
"oh, i'm sure she wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks."
i wouldn't know what to say to him.
then let him do the talking.
"look at you. you must be, what, twenty weeks along?"
"twenty three, actually."
have you decided on a name?
not yet. we were thinking about miral.
"your mother would've liked that. you know, i had some business on kessik four a few months ago. you wouldn't believe what our old house looks like."
"lieutenant, thirty seconds."
we have less than a minute. is there a reason you wanted to talk?
"i know i can't make up for twenty years in one conversation. the truth is, when your ship disappeared, i thought i'd lost you. i don't expect you to forgive me but, maybe we could try to get to know each other again."
i'll write you.
"i'm sorry to disturb you, admiral."
"ah yes, mister barclay. what can i do for you?"
"i thought you'd want to see this, sir."
"well, what is it?"
it's a holonovel that's becoming quite popular.
"well, i appreciate the gesture lieutenant but, i don't share your affinity for holographic diversions."
"you don't understand, sir. this programme, it's about voyager. and it doesn't portray the crew in a very flattering light."
hmm.
on screen.
captain.
seven told me your message was urgent.
i had the dubious privilege of playing a new holonovel apparently written by your emh. i'm surprised that you would allow the doctor to discredit your crew like this.
he's still making revisions. the programme shouldn't have been distributed yet.
"well, it has been. mister barclay tells me it's already being played in thousands of holosuites."
you assured me you were going to wait for my revisions. i demand that you recall every copy and issue a public apology to captain janeway and her crew.
i won't do anything of the sort.
"i don't see that you have a choice, mister broht. authors have rights."
not in this case.
what do you mean?
the doctor is a hologram.
so?
"according to federation law, holograms have no rights."
"under a strict interpretation of federation law, mister broht is correct. the doctor has no legal rights."
because i'm a hologram.
yes. there is another option. we may be able to claim that the holonovel reveals classified information. starfleet could then request that it be recalled for security purposes.
"oh, great idea. a cover up. and then everyone will be convinced that it's a true story."
could we claim defamation?
"well, we'd have to prove that the story's about us and that we've been harmed by it."
we might win on those grounds. but what about the doctor?
"what about me, captain? it's the crew's reputations that are as risk."
"i'm not so sure. i think it's your reputation that's on the line here. you have the same rights as every other member of this crew, and i'm not going to let this publisher say otherwise."
"you claim the doctor doesn't have the legal right to control this holoprogramme, yet you're promoting the fact that voyager's emh wrote it."
our most successful children's title is a programme written by toby the targ. fortunately toby hasn't tried to stop me from distributing any of his work.
but you don't deny
that the doctor is the creator of this holonovel?
"no, but a replicator created this cup of coffee. should that replicator be able to determine whether or not i can drink it?"
i object!
doctor.
"an intriguing analogy, mister broht. but i have never encountered a replicator that could compose music, or paint landscapes, or perform microsurgery. have you? would you say that you have a reputation for publishing respected, original works of literature?"
i'd like to think so.
and is the doctor's holonovel such a work?
"actually, some aspects of it are quite derivative."
has there even been another work written about a hologram's struggle for equality?
"not that i know of, but, er"
then in
"that respect, it is original."
i suppose so.
"your honour, section seven gamma of the twelfth guarantee defines an artist as a person who creates an original artistic work. mister broht admits that the doctor created this programme and that it is original. i therefore submit that the doctor should be entitled to all rights and privileges accorded an artist under the law."
"you've made a persuasive argument, commander, but there's a flaw in your logic. as you point out, the law says that the creator of an artistic work must be a person. your emh doesn't meet that criteria."
"sir, we're losing the link."
this hearing is in recess until tomorrow.
we're not doing well.
is that your considered legal opinion? i'm sorry. it's just frustrating to be told i have no more legal standing than an replicator.
"if the doctor doesn't have the right to control his own work, then it stands to reason he never had the right to enter into an agreement with mister broht. we could argue that the original contract is invalid."
"in other words, you want to concede that the doctor isn't a person."
what we need to do is prove that he is just as much a person as any of us.
how do we do that?
by telling your real life story.
"because i was having difficulty interacting with the crew, the doctor gave me social lessons. first, he taught me how to make conversation. later"
"how to dance. eventually, he showed me how to express romantic interest."
"without his guidance, i wouldn't be the person i am today."
"he decided it wasn't enough to be just a doctor, so he added command subroutines to his matrix and now, in an emergency, he's as capable as any bridge officer."
that only proves the doctor's programme can be modified.
"your honour, i think it shows he has a desire to become more than he is, just like any other person."
"he travelled halfway across the galaxy to care for lewis zimmerman, the man who created his programme. it was like a son who wanted to show his father what he'd become, so the old man would be proud of him. and if you ask me, he was."
"i'd made myself clear. but the doctor disobeyed my direct orders. in the process, he endangered the ship and crew."
that's hardly commendable behaviour.
"no, it wasn't. but it was human."
starfleet had programmed him to follow orders.
"the fact that he was capable of doing otherwise proves that he can think for himself. your honour, centuries ago in most places on earth, only landowners of a particular gender and race had any rights at all. over time, those rights were extended to all humans, and later, as we explored the galaxy, to thousands of other sentient species. our definition of what constitutes a person has continued to evolve. now we're asking that you expand that definition once more, to include our doctor."
"when i met him seven years ago,"
"i would never have believed that an emh could become a valued member of my crew, and my friend. the doctor is a person as real as any"
"flesh and blood i have ever known. if you believe the testimony you've heard here, it's only fair"
to conclude that he has the same rights as any of us.
you'll have my decision in two days.
this hearing is in recess.
"when you sing happy birthday to your mother, try to stay in tune."
what's this?
an isolinear chip entitling the bearer to three minutes of comm. time tomorrow. you made it clear how important it was to finish your conversation.
i overreacted.
i understand why you did. i've been observing the crew interacting with their families over the past few days. it's become clear to me how meaningful that communication can be.
"thanks, but i can't accept this."
why not?
you should contact your own family.
my parents were assimilated.
there must be someone. a distant relative?
my father has a sister on earth. irene hansen.
i'm sure she'd be thrilled to hear from you.
you can imagine my reaction when starfleet told me to expect your call.
i experienced some apprehension myself.
"you seem like a lovely young woman. but you were the most stubborn six-year-old i've ever met. your parents left you with me for a weekend, and you were so angry you locked yourself in my guest room and refused to come out."
that must have been inconvenient for you.
"oh, i coaxed you out eventually with a strawberry tart."
i'm very fond of strawberries. i didn't realise i'd eaten them as a child.
"you couldn't get enough of them. of course, you didn't hesitate to point out if they weren't perfectly ripe."
i'm sorry if i insulted you. perhaps i shouldn't have called.
"no, i'm very glad you did. it's wonderful to see you again, annika."
"we're exploring new territory today, so it is fitting that this hearing is being held at pathfinder. the doctor exhibits many of the traits we associate with a person. intelligence, creativity, ambition, even fallibility. but are these traits real, or is the doctor merely programmed to simulate them? to be honest, i don't know. eventually we will have to decide, because the issue of holographic rights isn't going to go away. but at this time, i am not prepared to rule that the doctor is a person under the law. however, it is obvious he is no ordinary hologram and while i can't say with certainty that he is a person, i am willing to extend the legal definition of artist to include the doctor. i therefore rule that he has the right to control his work.i'm ordering all copies of his holo-novels to be recalled immediately."
your honour!
this hearing is adjourned.
"congratulations, doctor."
"thank you, reg."
"we'll be in touch, captain."
you don't look like someone who's just struck the first blow for the rights of holograms.
"i don't mean to sound ungrateful, but it feels like a hollow victory. pardon the pun. the programme's already been played by thousands of people. the damage is done."
we'll survive.
"if i'm not mistaken, don't you have a holonovel to revise?"
do you think i'll be able to find another publisher?
"if there's one thing i've learned about you, doctor, it's that you can do just about anything you set your mind to."
time for your diagnostic. report to the holo-lab.
i know the routine.
"and, while you're there, do yourself a favour. ask the operator to run programme forty seven beta."
why? what is it?
it's called photons be free. it's quite provocative.
"we the people of earth greet you in a spirit of peace and humility. as we venture out of our solar system, we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds."
can we reduce the interference?
i'm trying.
what is it?
i don't know.
distance?
it just entered the atmosphere.
they evolved from dinosaurs?
"hadrosaurs, to be precise. their ancestors settled in the delta quadrant twenty million years ago."
"the voth, the kobali, the vaadwaur. you've made first contact with more species than any captain since james kirk."
it helps being the only starfleet ship within thirty thousand light years.
you are being too humble. from the first time you spoke up in my classroom i knew you'd go far.
"a little farther than i expected, professor."
"i have my admiral hat on today, kathryn, and i didn't call just to catch up. starfleet has a mission for you."
"we, the people of earth, greet you in the spirit of peace and humility. as we venture out of our solar system, we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds."
friendship one. i had to memorise that recording in third grade.
"me, too. i even built a model of the probe."
then this should look familiar. it was launched in 2067.
just four years after zefram cochrane tested his first warp engine.
what was it designed to do?
reach out to other species. pave the way for all the manned missions that would follow.
"they packed it with information, translation matrices, scientific and cultural databases"
"computer chip designs, instructions for building transceivers. it's practically a how-to manual."
"if the borg had intercepted this probe, humanity would have been assimilated centuries ago."
our ancestors had no idea what was out here.
this must have been before your prime directive?
it was before starfleet existed.
"in any case, we lost contact with the probe one hundred and thirty years ago but, its last known coordinates"
let me guess. were in the neighbourhood.
"starfleet's mapped out a search grid. it'll take us a little off course, but if the probe is still intact and we're lucky enough to find it, we'll be retrieving a little piece of history."
nothing in grid two nine five.
mister paris?
moving on.
"we should try skipping ahead a little to grid three one zero. i stayed up all night re-extrapolating the probe's trajectory. i've compensated for solar winds, ionic interference and a few local anomalies starfleet wouldn't know about."
alter course to grid three one zero.
trying to impress the starfleet brass?
just doing my job.
i'm detecting a titanium signature that matches the probe's parameters.
location?
a planet two light years away.
"confirmed. good job, harry."
the readings are coming from the northern subcontinent.
can you localise them?
"there are high levels of antimatter radiation in the atmosphere, scattering the probe's signature."
any lifesigns?
none.
assemble an away team and take the flyer down for a closer look.
"you seem to be in a good mood, doctor."
"just excited to be doing my part for our first official mission, mister carey."
"an inoculation a day keeps the radiation away. i took a look at those atmospheric readings. thermal eddies, gravimetric sheer. you're going to need your best pilot."
are you volunteering?
if the doc can spare me.
i'll muddle through.
"if you're here for your foetal resonance scan, you're a day early."
i'm here for my inoculation.
you are not going on this mission.
chakotay said he needed an engineer.
he's already got one.
now he's got two.
will you excuse us?
any bets on this one?
my money's on b'elanna.
it's been months since i've been on an away mission.
then try the holodeck. the flyer is full.
you can make room. neelix doesn't have to go.
he's not six months pregnant.
being pregnant doesn't make me an invalid.
"no, it doesn't.but there's a toxic atmosphere down there and you're breathing for two."
"all right, you win. but if we have another baby, you carry it, and i'll go on the away missions."
it's a deal.
sorry for the bumpy ride. we'll be clearing the stratosphere in about a minute.
"i had a cousin who used to transport disulfides from a gas giant. he claimed to love the turbulence. of course, disulfides are known to cause delusions."
hang on.
i thought it was uninhabited.
there's nothing alive down there now. radiation levels are at six thousand isorems.
i've localised the signature to a three kilometre radius.
"transfer the coordinates to the helm. when we find the probe, we'll beam it to the cargo hold."
that may not be easy with all this radiation.
"we'd better bring transport enhancers. set us down, tom."
"yes, sir."
"gently, please."
i should have brought a holo-camera so i could show b'elanna she's not missing anything. can you believe she actually wanted to come with us?
"when my wife was pregnant, she didn't want to be coddled, either."
and she's not half klingon. maybe it's us. something about fatherhood seems to regress the male psyche a few thousand years.
"tom, be careful."
"it's a toy, like a music box."
vivaldi. i'm getting something. ninety metres this way.
souvenir.
"commander, i'm detecting an antimatter signature ahead."
looks like missile silos.
paris to chakotay.
go ahead.
we've got a reading that could be the probe. it's inside a cave.
keep us posted.
the warhead is still active.
it wouldn't have taken many of these to trigger a nuclear winter.
people must have taken shelter here.
that makes sense. the magnesite in these caves would have provided partial shielding from the radiation.
over here.
what'd you find?
"some kind of control room, or laboratory."
laboratory?
lots of diagnostic equipment. looks like it was salvaged from a junk heap.
or scavenged from the ruins.
"particle scanners, circuit analysers. most of it's still functional. they were working on something."
this is what we came for.
whoever lived here must have been studying it.
the data core's still intact.
start setting up the transport enhancers. paris to chakotay.
go ahead.
"we found the probe. well, pieces of it, anyway."
we're getting ready to beam it back up to the flyer.
we'll meet you there.
hello? is someone there?
the tricorder isn't reading any lifesigns.
don't move.
you okay? delta flyer to paris. chakotay to away team. respond.
they're antimatter weapons. shields are offline. what are you doing?
getting us out of here.
what about the others?
we can't do them any good if we're dead. we'll come back for them.
"look, you're making a mistake."
leave them alone.
who are you?
i'm lieutenant tom paris. we're from the federation starship voyager.
what are these?
they're transport enhancers. we were going to use them to retrieve our probe.
your probe? too bad you didn't come for it sooner. it would have saved us a lot of suffering.
we still can't contact the others or get a fix on their lifesigns.
why didn't we detect the aliens?
"i don't know. whoever they are, they have antimatter weapons."
antimatter?
bridge to captain janeway.
go ahead.
we're being hailed from the surface.
the away team?
no.
this is captain kathryn janeway. who am i speaking with?
my name is verin. your crewmen are my prisoners.
why? we haven't done anything to harm you.
you committed genocide.
i think there's been a misunderstanding. we arrived here
you're from earth?
yes.
then you're going to pay for what your people did to us.
"i'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about."
"we're not as naive as you seem to think we are, captain. not any more."
what is it you want?
i want you to get us off this planet. find us a new home.
release my crewmen and we can talk about it.
no more talking. your people won't be safe until mine are.
"listen, i don't respond well to threats."
"and i don't want to kill anyone, but i will if you don't cooperate. you have three hours"
to begin evacuating us.
start scanning for the nearest m class planet.
you intend to meet his demands?
i'm just keeping my options open.  you're with me.
i've analysed his garment. it's lined with magnesite.
a makeshift environmental suit.
"unfortunately, the protection it offers is limited. his tissues are saturated with antimatter radiation. it explains why we couldn't detect his lifesigns. they're virtually indistinguishable from the environment."
"now that we know that, maybe we can adjust our sensors to detect them."
let's wake him.
what were you doing aboard our shuttle?
trying to undo the damage you caused.
"if you're referring to what's happened on your planet, we had nothing to do with it."
"your people sent the probe, didn't they?"
our ancestors sent it three hundred years ago to make contact with other species.
they did a little more than that. am i your prisoner?
no. you're suffering from prolonged radiation exposure. i can treat you.
you can?
i believe i can.
in exchange for what?
nothing.
"i have a wife, friends."
"we might be able to help them, too. but not while our crewmen are being held hostage. you said you were trying to undo the damage we caused. what did you mean by that?"
i was aboard your shuttle looking for technology that might help us neutralise the radiation.
we saw missiles on the surface. was the destruction caused by war?
those missiles were built for defence. they were never launched.
then what accounts for the devastation?
"a containment failure in our power grid. once the antimatter was released, it destroyed everything."
"i'm sorry, but i still don't see how we're responsible."
"before the probe, my people never conceived of anything like antimatter. we offer this information freely with the hope that one day we will stand on your soil and extend our hands in friendship. i'm sure you recognise those words."
the recording from the probe.
your people sent us technology that they knew would destroy us.
i don't understand.
"we didn't either at first. but we had decades to think about it, and now it seems so obvious. you send us new technology, encourage us to use it, and then you wait for us to obliterate ourselves."
why would we do that?
because it's easier than invading us.
do you really believe we'd contaminate a world we intended to conquer?
"i'm a scientist. i believe what i see. and today i saw your people standing on our soil just as you promised, and they were wearing equipment that protected them from the radiation because they knew exactly what to expect. if you were in my position, what would you believe?"
he might have a concussion. i need the medkit from my pack.
i was told not to let you use your equipment.
"when's your baby due? my wife's pregnant, too. we're expecting a little girl in a couple of months."
how do you know it's a girl?
we have technology that allows us to examine the foetus. she has my eyes and her mother's cranial ridges. is this your first?
no.
oh? boys? girls?
two boys and a girl.
what are their names?
they were all stillborn.
i'm sorry.
you're a doctor?
"no, i'm just a medic. but we have the best doctor in the quadrant back on voyager. he might be able to help."
i shouldn't be talking to you.
"our current coordinates, and the nearest m class planet one hundred thirty two light years away."
at maximum warp that's about two months round trip.
how many people are we talking about?
"if these sensor modifications are correct, about fifty five hundred."
it would take at least seventeen trips. almost three years to complete the relocation.
we've made sacrifices to help people before.
what about tom and the others? are they supposed to rot down there until this relocation's finished?
i don't think verin's going to let go of his only bargaining chips.
then we may have to use force.
not until we've exhausted every other option. these people believe that we're violent. i'm not going to do anything to reinforce that belief unless it becomes absolutely necessary.
i've extracted the nanoprobes.
i'll begin reprogramming them.
nanoprobes?
microscopic machines. hopefully they'll help us repair your damaged tissue.
you said you extracted them. from where?
my bloodstream. they maintain my cybernetic implants.
"nanoprobes, cybernetic implants. are others on your crew like you?"
"no, i'm unique."
you certainly are.
i need a word with your patient. you told me you've been looking for ways to neutralise the radiation.
all my life.
tell me about your work.
lieutenant?
i'm okay. my stomach's just a little queasy.
our inoculations must be wearing off.
i thought these caves were naturally shielded.
they're no substitute for an environmental suit.
these people have lived here all their lives without environmental suits.
these people have lived here without much of anything.
hello.
hello. it's all right. we're not going to hurt you. what's your name?
yun.
"mine's tom. this is joe, and neelix."
you're not like them.
"we're different species, but they're my friends."
they say you're going to take us on your ship and find us a new home.
i'm sure our captain is trying to help you.
"neelix, where's our souvenir?"
in my pack.
excuse me. we'd like to give her something. it's in the equipment bag. it's a toy.
that could be a weapon.
it's harmless.
these men are dangerous. i want you to stay away from them. understood?
so much for making friends.
mister verin?
what are you doing?
"my job. i'm voyager's ambassador, remember? can i have a word with you?"
"just between us, i understand why you don't trust humans."
then why are you with them?
they're not so bad once you get to know them. when i first met them i thought they were arrogant and self-righteous.
i suppose you're going to tell me you've changed your mind.
"well, not completely. i still think they take themselves far too seriously for my taste. but one thing they don't do is harm other people."
are you blind?
"no, i see very clearly what's happened to you, and i'd like to help."
how?
my captain listens to me. i can speak to her on your behalf. help her understand your situation.
what do you know about our situation?
"i know what you've been through. my planet was destroyed by a weapon called a metreon cascade. hundreds of thousands of people were killed, including my family."
how did you survive?
"i was on a neighbouring planet when the weapon was detonated. i went back with a rescue team, but there was no one left."
"i'm sorry about what happened to your family, but don't compare your life to mine."
"the nearest suitable planet is simply too far away so, i'd like to propose"
an alternative.
there is no alternative.
"please, hear me out. we have one of your people aboard, a mister otrin. he has some interesting ideas about counteracting the radiation."
otrin has too many ideas.
"i think his theories have merit. what he's lacked until now is the means to carry them out. if you release the hostages, we can work together. there's a good chance we could undo some of the damage to your environment."
this isn't a negotiation.
you don't seem to understand. it would take years to evacuate the entire planet.
so instead you once again offer us the benefits of your technology.
what i'm offering you is a realistic alternative.
"if i release the hostages, what's to prevent you from leaving"
or attacking us?
"look, i know you've suffered, and i know you don't trust us."
you haven't given me any reason to.
then why don't we start with a small step. you return one of the hostages and i'll send you a supply of food and medicine.
you. what's your name?
joe carey.
set up your transport enhancers.
"i'm sorry, mister carey."
sorry?
"your crewman's ready, captain."
transport him to sickbay.
"hey, what the hell"
are you doing?
tom?
sickbay to bridge.
they've killed lieutenant carey.
"if you think murdering one of my crewmen is going to make me more receptive to your demands, you're mistaken."
don't force me to kill anyone else.
"all right, i'll evacuate your people. but our transporters aren't designed to accommodate large groups."
we'll need time to modify them.
we'll be ready within the hour. if you're not
i understand.  my ready room.
you have radiation poisoning. this will make you feel better.
thank you.
why are you helping us?
"your child's going to need a father, isn't she?"
the first phase of your therapy is complete. how do you feel?
i can breathe more easily.
your lungs were damaged by the radiation. the nanoprobes are repairing them.
"it's incredible. if we could manufacture more of these, we might be able to treat everyone."
"unfortunately, mister verin has refused our help."
did you expect him to cooperate?
his behaviour is irrational.
"to you, maybe. but you haven't lived like we have."
no. but that doesn't mean that we're responsible for what's happened here.
you can't deny your people sent the probe.
"they made an error in judgment. they failed to anticipate the consequences of their actions. but they never meant to destroy your world. human culture has evolved, learned from its mistakes. so can yours."
"even if i believed you, verin never would."
then your people may need a change of leadership. someone more open to new ideas.
i'm not a leader.
but you're a scientist. someone who can see a problem and envision a solution. the same definition could apply to a leader.
"doesn't seem fair, does it. my daughter, she'll have food medical care, everything she needs."
what's wrong?
we need help!
it's the baby. it's too soon. let him help me.
can you?
i think so. but i'll need my med kit.
inform verin.
i'm losing the heartbeat.
"oh, no."
what are you doing?
speeding up the contractions.
their ship's returned.
send out patrols. double the guard at the entrance.
"i've got him! he's not breathing. cardiostimulator. three millijoules, now."
don't move.i'll take him to verin. tell the others. this way. move!
increase the charge to five millijoules. again. i'm reading a heartbeat.
you have a son.
one of the patrols took another prisoner.
put him with the others.
we need to get him to voyager.
he stays here.
mister tuvok.
"your captain was foolish enough to think she could rescue you. instead, she's given me another hostage."
doc?
"when you need to infiltrate a toxic environment, it helps to be a hologram."
prepare the transport enhancers. tuvok to chakotay.
we secured the hostages.
good work. chakotay to delta flyer. two to beam out.
thank you.
"now, mister paris."
your baby won't survive without treatment. i promise we'll bring him back.
take good care of him.
i will.
tuvok to voyager. five to beam up.
"cute little fellow, isn't he? he's already responding to treatment."
"once he's stabilised we'll transport him to the surface, and send along some food and medical supplies."
we're leaving?
as soon as i report to starfleet.
"captain, once the baby's back in that environment, he's just going to get sick again."
i'm sorry. we can't keep him from his mother.
i'm not suggesting that. you told those people that we might be able to neutralise the radiation. was that true?
"yes, but they didn't want our help. i can't force it on them."
"maybe you should. if we help them without asking anything in return, it'll prove they're wrong about us."
you're forgetting something. they killed mister carey. i'm not about to risk any more lives to help murderers.
"captain, it was one man who killed carey. if you saw how they were living, how desperate they are. i'm not saying we should ignore what happened, but humans did play a part in their suffering."
"intentional or not, that probe had a terrible impact on these people. if there's anything we can do to make up for that now, we at least have to try."
i've adjusted the radiation levels to match the conditions on the surface. watch. an isolitic chain reaction. it recombines the nucleonic particles in the atmosphere.
how do we apply your methods on a planetary scale?
atmospheric processors are one possibility.
too bad we don't have a corps of engineers to build them. what if we encase the catalytic agent in photon torpedoes? use the concussive force to start the reaction.
"it would require multiple detonations at low altitude, but i believe it could work."
"captain, an isolitic reaction of that magnitude would expand exponentially. your ship might not survive."
"we'll have to modify our shields, reinforce structural integrity. well, let's get started."
he's beautiful.
and they can give us enough medicine to treat everyone.
can they rebuild our cities? bring back the people who died?
"they're offering to help, and this time no one's coercing them."
we can't trust these people. they just sent armed men to attack us.
they only wanted to rescue their hostages.
who knows what they wanted?
you're being irrational.
what's irrational is cooperating with the enemy.
"look at my child. they said that they would treat him, and they kept their word."
shield modifications online.
torpedoes?
ready.
hail them.
listen to me.
"otrin, we're ready to begin."
understood. good luck.
"tom, take us down."
we're ten thousand metres into the troposphere.
fire the first sequence.
they're attacking us.
it's only the shockwave from the detonations.
shields?
holding at eighteen percent.
are you going to stand there while he helps them destroy us?
what are you doing?
fighting back.
"captain, they're opening missile silos. they're targeting voyager."
"at eighteen percent, our shields won't withstand an antimatter explosion."
we should return to orbit.
not yet. fire the next sequence.
you can't launch those missiles.
hold him.
stop.
what are you doing?
i won't let you ruin our only chance for survival.
you'd kill me?
to save my child? yes.
get that weapon away from her.
"no, sir."
i've kept you alive. all of you!
and we're grateful for that. but survival isn't enough anymore.
are you in command now?
if i have to be.
"everyone, come outside. hurry."
bring him.
it's beautiful.
"impressive, isn't it?"
the detail's amazing.
carey spent months working on it. he used to joke that he wouldn't be finished by the time we got back to earth.
he only had one nacelle to go.
we were able to download the probe's memory core. we'll transmit the telemetry in the next data stream.
"i think about our ancestors. thousands of years wondering if they were alone in the universe, and finally discovering they weren't. you can't blame them for wanting to reach out, see how many other species were out there asking the same questions."
the urge to explore is pretty powerful.
"but it can't justify the loss of lives, whether it's millions or just one."
"beautiful, isn't it?"
a sensor analysis would have provided the necessary information.
just admiring the view.
the conference begins in less than an hour.
"there's always time for warp field dynamics, but you don't see natural beauty like this every day."
what was that?
some kind of energy barrier directly below us. it spans thousands of square kilometres.
why didn't our sensors detect it?
uncertain. it has an unusual tetrion signature. species three one two used a similar technology. there's a power surge coming from the barrier.
shields at full.
they're creating some kind of feedback. we've lost impulse engines.
go to warp.
the warp core is offline.
warp engines don't just shut down when you scrape an energy barrier.
it's affecting all our systems.
warning. structural failure in thirty seconds.
we'll have to beam to the surface.
we can't transport through the barrier. transfer auxiliary power to the weapons array.
what are you trying to do?
"if i can realign our phasers to the correct frequency, i may be able to open a rift."
"big enough to get a shuttle through, i hope?"
"warning. structural failure in ten seconds, nine, eight."
phasers reconfigured.
the barrier's closed again.
i should examine you.
i don't think it's serious.
you have a hairline fracture.
we've got bigger problems. i'll be fine.
i'm detecting shuttle debris scattered over several square kilometres.
some of it might still be functional.
"if we can find the right components, we may be able to construct a beacon. send a distress signal."
through the barrier?
maybe.
"if we hurry we might still make that conference. well, if we have to be stranded somewhere, we couldn't ask for a nicer place."
we wouldn't be stranded at all if you hadn't insisted on admiring the view.
"guest vessel 74656, this is ledos port control. shut down your engines."
this is lieutenant tom paris. is there a problem?
you were observed committing piloting violation two five six.
"i'm sorry, i'm not familiar with your regulations. it won't happen again."
you'll be informed of the penalty.
what kind of penalty?
that's not my decision. your docking permit says you're assigned to the starship voyager?
that's right.
your commanding officer will be notified of your infraction.
piloting lessons?
"apparently, the standard penalty for your infraction is a three day course in flight safety, followed by a test."
"well, did you explain we wouldn't be here that long?"
"actually, while you were completing your mission, seven was invited to a four day conference."
here on ledos?
i decided to give the entire crew shore leave. it'll give you plenty of time to brush up on your piloting skills.
i don't need lessons.
apparently the authorities disagree.
but captain
"you may not have known the ledosians' rules, but you know ours. comply with local law. understood?"
"yes, ma'am."
the relays are fused. it's useless.
looks like we're not the only ones here.
"indigenous wildlife, perhaps."
i'm reading residual lifesigns. they're humanoid.
ledosian?
"no. but they share the same genetic traits. whoever they are, they may be able to help us."
unless they're hostile.
why don't we give them the benefit of the doubt. the lifesigns lead in that direction.
i suggest you rest your leg while i investigate.
"it's better is we stick together, at least until we know whether they're hostile."
i'm guessing they're pre-warp.
obviously they can't help us.
"no, i don't suppose they can. but they're fascinating, aren't they? i never expected to run into people like these on such a technologically advanced planet."
"this isn't an anthropological mission, commander."
you're right. we should keep searching for debris. argh!
you're developing an infection. you should rest.
i'll have to stay here and try to keep out of sight.
i'll contact you if i find anything useful.
i guess i don't have to tell you to avoid interacting with these people.
seven of nine to chakotay.
seven of nine to chakotay.
"commander, respond. i've found something. seven of nine to chakotay."
step away from him.
"it's all right, seven. they're friendly. they're treating my wound."
you said we were supposed to avoid interaction.
they found me. there was nothing i could do.
you should have tried to contact me.
i didn't want to expose them to our technology.
you hid your comm. badge?
"actually, your call scared them. they broke it."
i suggest we leave before they break anything else.
"look, they're friendly, and i am hurt."
what are you suggesting?
we may as well stay the night.
commander.
it's good shelter. and my leg feels better since they put this dressing on. i'm going to get some rest. i suggest you do the same.
chell says we shouldn't miss the flame gardens.
"i hear the arboretum is beautiful, too."
we can do both.
"tom. you joining us? oh, that's right, you have to go to pilot school."
i hear the course takes days.
"yeah, for most people. but i did a little research. if the instructor agrees, you can skip the lessons and go right to the test. so i will be seeing you in a couple of hours."
you  have to admire his optimism.
"just a moment, sir."
"i am mister kleg, the flying instructor. are you lieutenant paris?"
he is.
"it's an honour to meet you, sir. may i show you to the delta flyer?"
why?
"so you can explain what i did wrong, and then administer the test."
it sounds to me like you need lessons in patience as well.
"oh, tom is very patient, sir."
never impulsive.
take all the time you need. he'll enjoy the extra attention.
"well, i'm please to hear it. we'll start with a review of safety procedures. do you have a visual display system i can access?"
i think i can find one.
have fun.
energise.
so how long will this review take?
"oh, typically about four hours. but there's no rush."
of course not.
river.
river.
mountain.
mountain.
where are we?
this?
"you want to trade? well, i suppose it won't hurt."
i'll take that as a thank you.
did you make a favourable exchange?
i didn't want to insult their customs. any luck?
i may have found a way of communicating.
me too. i've learned to say thank you.
i was referring to communication with voyager. it may be possible to construct a beacon by connecting these components to the shuttle's deflector.
did you find it?
i detected it six kilometres from here. i believe it's intact.
i'm not sure i'm up to that long a trip.
i'll go.
i've started mapping the area. here's the river we passed. this is where we beamed down. and we're here now.
then the deflector should be approximately here.
six kilometres is a long way. maybe one of them could guide you.
i'm still trying to limit our contact with these people.
"the sooner you get to the deflector, the sooner we can get out of here. they know the terrain. maybe they can get you there faster."
and watch me construct a tetrion-based signalling device.
"all right, but be careful. seven. this is how they say goodbye."
thank you.
hello.
identify yourself.
an exothermic reaction.
i'm not hungry.
inadequate system integration. visibility impaired by lateral sensor array. insufficient console accessibility.
"you know, i couldn't agree more. those are some of the defects that led to my so-called pilot error."
"polarity thrusters? oh, they've been known to cause accidental acceleration."
exactly my point. why should i be held responsible for the ship's design flaws?
"according to the maintenance records, you were this vessel's chief designer. i make it a point of professional pride to research every case i'm assigned to. are you familiar with that term, lieutenant? professional pride?"
"yes, sir. in fact, that is why i'm so eager to get underway. i want to prove to you that i'm a good pilot."
"there are protocols, mister paris. system by system diagnostics, pre-flight simulations."
you must have other students who need your attention. it wouldn't be fair to
"don't worry, lieutenant. i'm planning to spend as much time with you as you need."
good morning.
i'm trying to go here.
can you show me?
yes. i thought it was this way.
"yes, it's quite an impressive view. now we really have to"
"my friend, she hasn't come back. i need to find her."
she looks like this. where?
where'd you get this?
my friend. where?
don't touch that! please.
problem?
"commander chakotay failed to report in at the scheduled time. we tried hailing, but there was no response."
we contacted the conference coordinator. he said seven and chakotay never showed up.
anything on sensors?
"we've located a hull signature over the southern subcontinent, but it's only a wing."
nothing else? no lifesigns?
"no, ma'am."
that's awfully low for something to be in orbit.
it's not in orbit. it's resting on an energy barrier.
we think the shuttle may have collided with it.
why didn't they see it?
standard scans didn't reveal its presence. we were only able to detect it with our borg sensors.
"if all you found was a wing, maybe the rest of the shuttle made it through the barrier."
"logic suggests that possibility. unfortunately, the barrier's deflecting all our scans. there's no way to know if the shuttle or its occupants are on the other side."
hail the ledosian ambassador.
"we'd have warned your commander, but his flight plan didn't go anywhere near that area."
he must have altered his route for some reason.
and collided with the barrier. i'm sorry.
we're not assuming they're dead.
we believe they may have found a way through.
that's very unlikely.
they're resourceful people. can you tell us anything about the barrier?
"it shields the territory of an indigenous society, the ventu."
"then the area's habitable. if you lowered the barrier, we could scan for our people's lifesigns."
i'm afraid we can't do that.
why not?
it was erected by aliens hundreds of years ago. they haven't been back. the technology is a mystery to us.
why did these aliens build the barrier?
to protect the ventu.
from whom?
"us. our ancestors fought them, polluted their habitat. i'm afraid we weren't very enlightened back then."
"earth went through its dark periods too, ambassador. would you have any objections if we tried to lower the barrier, just to scan for our people?"
"i told you, it's not possible."
perhaps if you gave us information about the barrier's power source?
"the generator is inside. there's no way to access it. even if your people did survive, i'm afraid there's no way to get them out."
the burn patterns suggest a tetrion flux.
we found a reference to similar technology in seven's borg database.
you think the borg erected it?
"no, but it may have been constructed by people they later assimilated. species three one two."
"if seven were here, she might be able to figure out a way to get through it."
maybe she already did. some of the damage to the wing was caused by feedback from the shuttle's phasers.
seven and chakotay might have used them to penetrate the barrier for some reason.
"if i can determine the appropriate frequency, i may be able to do the same thing. but there is risk involved."
what sort of risk?
it looks like the feedback from the barrier is what destroyed the shuttle. if we're not careful the same thing could happen to voyager.
may i see those?
"seven, is everything all right?"
i need your tricorder.
"nice to see you, too."
i lost mine. there's a strong magnetic field here that's preventing me from generating a deflector beam. but the field drops off approximately four point eight kilometres in that direction.
can you transmit the signal from there?
"not through the barrier, but i may be able to neutralise it by generating a dampening field with our deflector."
"even if you're right, this must weight five hundred kilos. how would we move it?"
some of them could help us.
we shouldn't involve them.
"do i detect a change in attitude, commander?"
"your concern was justified. they've been gathering debris from the shuttle, using it to imitate us. i don't want them helping."
"what's the alternative? staying here? allowing them to find all of the debris? if we neutralise the barrier, voyager can transport us and our technology off the surface."
is there a possibility that this dampening field could disrupt the barrier permanently?
unlikely. once the deflector is deactivated the barrier should reinitialise.
let's hope you're right.
"so you can execute a turn at less than three hundred kph. well done, lieutenant."
"thanks. you know, i don't want to seem impatient again, but is there any way you'd let me take that test now?"
i thought i'd made myself clear about that. all my students complete the entire course.
"i understand, sir, but two of my friends are missing, and i'd like to help find them."
"well, that's an admirable sentiment. but if i give you special treatment it wouldn't be fair to the others who have to take this course. besides, why stop now? you're getting very close to becoming an adequate pilot."
"here, commander."
not so close.
phasers are starting to overload.
can we divert any more power to the shields?
the shields are amplifying the feedback.
the barrier's interfering with every system we activate.
cease fire. i'm open to suggestions.
we may be able to reconfigure a photon torpedo to detonate at the appropriate frequency.
what about feedback?
a torpedo shouldn't create any. theoretically.
do it.
they're too close.
"back, behind the rise. stay back."
the energy barrier's coming down.
i thought you were still reconfiguring the torpedo.
i am. it's being deactivated from the inside.
"harry, scan for lifesigns."
"aye, captain."
take it off!
i'm only reading one comm. badge. it's seven's.
open a channel. janeway to seven.
are you and chakotay all right?
"yes, captain."
stand by for transport.
lock on to commander chakotay. i need more time.
is there a problem?
someone's been injured. she requires medical attention.
do you need the doctor?
i believe i can treat her. a medkit would be useful.
acknowledged.
the poultice healed the fracture and the infection. i'm impressed.
they're impressive people. i just hope we haven't traumatised them.
you did what you had to do to get out of there.
"still, i think we transport all the shuttle debris back to voyager as soon as possible."
agreed.
would you like some breakfast? i'm not hungry either.
"i admire your curiosity, but you should be more careful. it's time for me to leave."
back to my home.
"that's very kind, but i have no use for it. i supposed i should respect your customs. thank you."
these botanical specimens indicate a high level of serum nitrates.
catalogue those foliates.
explain your presence here.
oh. you must be from voyager.
who are you?
: my name is barus. i'm the expedition leader.
what kind of expedition are you leading?
we're conducting scans to evaluate the potential of this habitat.
potential for what?
"anthropological research, resource development. we've been waiting years for this."
what about the people who live here?
"we'll help them, of course."
how?
"with medicine, infrastructure, education. whoever lowered this barrier did the ventu a great favour."
that barrier has to go back up.
isn't it possible the ledosians will improve the lives of the ventu?
improve them? how?
they're intelligent people. exposure to education and technology may give them better opportunities.
can you honestly say that you know what's better for them?
"no, i can't."
then what do you think we should do?
i'm uncertain.
it's not like you to be on the fence.
"when commander chakotay and i first encountered the ventu, i found them primitive, of little interest to me. but as i spent time with them, i came to realise that they're a resourceful, self-reliant people. their isolation may limit their potential, but if that isolation ends, so will a unique way of life."
"we appreciate your help in opening this territory to exploration, captain. it's an unprecedented opportunity."
"a short-lived opportunity, i'm afraid."
i don't understand.
"after i transport our deflector back to voyager, the energy barrier will go back up."
"naturally, you'll want to get your people out, so they won't be trapped inside as ours were."
you have no right to limit our access to our own territory.
"i'm not trying to do that, but we have a strict policy about leaving our technology in the hands of other cultures. it often has damaging consequences."
i don't think you realise how important this is. it's not only the resources that interest us. the ventu are our evolutionary ancestors. our living history.
"i understand this is disappointing for you, but i'm afraid i have no choice."
"in the spirit of cooperation, i hope you'll reconsider."
we're eager to resume course. would an hour be enough time to evacuate your people?
i'll make the arrangements.
we've transported all the remaining debris to the cargo bay.
i have a lock on the deflector assembly.
what is it?
there's a ledosian vessel on an intercept course. it's charging weapons.
shields!
direct hit to the transporters. they're offline.
get a weapons lock and hail them.
they're hailing us.
captain janeway.
what's going on?
our government has decided not to let you restore the barrier.
and that justifies an unprovoked attack?
we only targeted your transporters to avoid harming your crew. i hope you'll show the same restraint.
i don't find weapons fire of any kind restrained.
"if you want to avoid further conflict, i suggest you leave."
take us out of orbit.
what about the deflector?
is tom still in the flyer?
"yes, ma'am."
hail him.
"excellent, mister paris. now, come about slowly."
janeway to paris. respond.
"captain, i'd appreciate it if you didn't interrupt my student during his examination."
i'm sorry
but something's come up.
": what is it, captain?"
"tom, i'm sending you some encrypted orders."
"yes, ma'am."
this is highly irregular.
you're going much too fast.
"yes, sir. i'm in a bit of a hurry."
"if you have any desire to pass this test, you will reduce your speed immediately."
"i wish i could do that, sir. i really do."
what was that?
paris to voyager.
i'm under attack.
"give him some help, mister tuvok."
what have you done?
we had to get you out of there before we close the barrier.
you can't do that.
just sit back and enjoy the ride. paris to voyager. i've got them.
find the deflector.
i'm getting a lock on it now.
my transporters are offline.
"you'd better get out of there, tom."
not yet.
i've got an idea.
"i am sorry to inform you, mister paris, but you have failed this examination. you will no longer be allowed to operate a vessel within ledosian space."
something tells me that's not going to be a problem.
this is a beautiful blanket.
take it if you'd like. i don't need it.
"if environmental systems ever go down, you might get cold. you know, i"
i'd like to
you first.
"please, continue."
"in all the excitement, i never apologised."
for what?
causing you to miss that conference.
"as a matter of fact, i wanted to thank you for that."
i thought you were angry.
"i was, but you were right. warp mechanics can be studied any time. the ventu, on the other hand."
something's still bothering you?
i'm concerned for their well-being.
they know how to take care of themselves.
"that's not what i mean. members of the ledosian expedition had the opportunity to scan my deflector modifications. in time, they may find a way to duplicate our technology and remove the barrier themselves."
i supposed it's possible.
if i'd never made those modifications
"we might still be stranded there. i don't know about you, but i'm glad to be back on voyager."
as am i.
"now, these are delicious."
leave some for the rest of us.
"hey, i'm eating for two."
"great party, neelix."
everybody seems to be enjoying it.
"yeah, except the doc."
"those are for eating, not scanning."
what exactly are they?
cheese pirogues. zefram cochrane's favourite.
they have absolutely no nutritional value.
"this is a party, doctor. sometimes you have to forget about nutrition."
you could include a vitamin supplement when you replicate them.
replicate? i made them myself.
"you two have outdone yourselves. i've never seen first contact day celebrated quite like this. when i was your age, all it meant was a day off from school."
neelix and i thought we should make it more fun.
"well, you certainly succeeded."
when is commander tuvok making his presentation?
"well, now's as good a time as any. captain?"
"may i have everyone's attention, please? in honour of the three hundred and fifteenth anniversary of his ancestors' arrival on earth, i've asked mister tuvok to recite the first words spoken to humans by a vulcan. commander."
is this really necessary?
you promised.
very well. live long and prosper.
"and now, for some more of zefram cochrane's favourite music. hey, come on, mister vulcan."
vulcans do not dance.
but it's tradition.
"there is no tradition, mister neelix. this ceremony is entirely your invention."
"this is an official ship function, commander. don't make me order you to dance."
"sorry to interrupt, but i've got some interesting news. neelix, you might want to hear this. long range sensors have detected several hundred lifesigns approximately four point nine light years away. they're talaxian."
are we there yet?
not exactly. the lifesigns appear to be coming from inside that asteroid field.
from a ship?
we are not detecting any vessels.
no response from hails?
not yet.
i hope they're all right.
there's a lot of interference. maybe they haven't received our transmissions.
can we move in any closer?
voyager's too big to manoeuvre safely in there. we could take the flyer.
it wouldn't have hurt you to do a few steps.
"i am trying to concentrate on the shields, mister neelix."
i think you were just afraid.
that's absurd.
it's understandable. there were a lot of people watching.
vulcans don't experience fear.
i'm going to make it my personal mission to get you to dance at least once before we reach earth.
then i suggest you find a more productive hobby.
"if you two don't stop it, i'm going to come back there and separate you."
"i've localised the lifesigns, bearing one zero eight mark twenty six. they appear to be inside a large asteroid."
inside?
what was that?
"a thermalyte explosive, thirty point six kilometres to port. i'm detecting another projectile heading directly toward us. evasive manoeuvres."
we've lost shields.
main propulsion is offline. we're going to have to make an emergency landing.
where?
the talaxians' asteroid is the closest.
"the surface is covered with craters, ice fields."
we don't have a choice. hold on.
problem?
we've lost contact with the away team. i also detected some unusual energy discharges in the asteroid field.
what kind of discharges?
"it's difficult to tell because of the interference, but they appear to be thermalytic explosions. i believe several of them were in close proximity to the flyer."
source?
unknown.
we'll need to send a rescue team. work with b'elanna. try to modify the shields on one of the shuttles to withstand these explosions.
"stay still. don't worry, it's not serious."
am i inside the asteroid?
yes. this is my home.
where are my friends?
"if you mean the aliens who were on the ship with you, they're safe."
i'd like to see them.
you need to rest. what were you doing in the asteroid field?
"looking for you. well, not you specifically. but my ship detected talaxians. i haven't come across any in years, so. i'm sorry, i'm neelix."
dexa. i had an uncle named neelix. are there other talaxians on your ship?
i'm the only one.
why are you living with aliens?
they're my friends. did you receive our hails?
yes.
why didn't you respond?
we avoid contact with outsiders.
we were attacked. there were explosions. did you?
no. we're not violent.
who fired at us?
no one fired at you. there are miners who use explosive charges to break apart the asteroids so they can collect minerals from the debris.
i wish we'd known.
why were you carrying weapons?
it's standard procedure for an away mission. hello. what's your name?
brax. what's yours?
i told you not to come in here.
i just want to see him.
you're supposed to be helping oxilon.
he doesn't look dangerous to me.
i think you have the wrong idea about us.
i'm not supposed to be talking to you at all.
i'm feeling better. i'd like to see my friends now.
what are you doing?
i've been told not to let you leave.
harry?
still no response to hails.
janeway to the shuttlebay.
"go ahead, captain."
what's the status of the shield modifications?
lieutenant torres and i will be finished in a few minutes.
good.  take an away team and find them.
"captain, there's a ship approaching from astern. we're being hailed."
on screen.
identify yourselves.
i'm captain janeway of the federation starship voyager.
commander nocona. this is our asteroid field.
we weren't aware of that.
now you are.
we lost one of our shuttles inside the field. we're preparing to send a rescue team.
all the resources belong to us.
we're not interested in the resources. we were only trying to make contact with the talaxians.
what's your interest in them?
one of my crewmen is from talax. he was eager to meet some of his people.
you should have requested permission before sending in a shuttle. we have a mining operation in progress.
does that explain the explosions we detected?
mining charges.
we'd appreciate it if you'd stop using them until we can get our people out.
"i'm sorry. we're on a strict deadline. but i'll conduct a search for your crew. if they need help, we'll provide it."
"that's kind of you, but we're prepared to go in and get them ourselves."
i cannot guarantee your safety if you enter the asteroid field. stay here. we'll contact you when we find your people.
i don't think you're supposed to be here.
this is my home. you can't tell me what to do.
"no, of course not. i just don't want you to get in trouble. is that a model ship? what's it called? how about the two-tailed talchok? the fur fly? the ship i come from is called voyager."
is it big?
and fast.
can i see it?
i think it would be a little difficult to take you there while i'm stuck here. but if your mother would let me out
that's her.
you better hide.
you won't tell her i'm here?
"no, of course not."
"neelix, this is oxilon, our council regent."
"i wish i could say it was nice to meet you, but this wasn't exactly the welcome i was expecting."
you're free to go now.
what about my friends?
we've determined they aren't hostile. they've been treated for their injuries and asked to leave.
they're aboard your shuttle making repairs. i'll take you there.
"well, now that everything has been cleared up, maybe we could talk, get to know each other a little."
if you like.
"my friends, too?"
i'm sorry.
why not?
we've learned from experience to keep to ourselves.
"well, if they're not welcome, i'm not staying either."
that's your choice.
"i know oxilon seems overly cautious, but we're not used to having visitors."
how many of you live here?
close to five hundred. all of our homes are connected to the central cabin by tunnels and lifts. they allow us to easily move from one section of the asteroid to another.
it must have taken years to build all of this.
almost five. it still isn't finished.
where did the technology come from?
we arrived here with a caravan of six ships. we disassembled all but one of them and modified their components. we converted torpedo launchers to blast away rock and excavate these tunnels. these conduits run into the asteroid's core. we use geothermal energy to melt the ice that covers most of the outer surface. it provides us with oxygen and water.
who'd have imagined all of this inside an asteroid? your son seems like a wonderful boy.
how would you know? you only met him for a few seconds.
"true, but i'm a quick judge of character."
"he came to see you while i was out, didn't he?"
you can't blame him for being curious.
hmm. he's a lot like his father. no fear.
i'd like to meet your husband.
he's dead.
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to
it's all right. you didn't know.
neelix. are you all right?
"i'm fine. dexa, this is lieutenant paris, and commander tuvok."
thanks for bringing him back. we were getting worried.
it was nice to meet you.
"so, what can i do to help?"
you can give me a hand with this plasma manifold. how did it go?
"well, er, they didn't exactly send out a welcoming committee, but i'm sure they had their reasons. i guess my expectations were a little high."
i regret that you didn't have a more fulfilling experience.
"that's nice of you to say, commander, but it wasn't a complete waste of time. i got to meet some of my people again, even if it was a short visit. who knows, it's probably the last time i'll ever see another talaxian."
good work. now we need to run a systems
intruder alert.
at least we know internal sensors are working.
brax.
you know him?
we're old friends.
you said you'd take me to see voyager.
i don't think your mother would approve.
"you won't tell her i was here, will you?"
"here? i, i have no idea what you're talking about. i'll be right back."
three days isn't nearly enough time for us to dismantle all our equipment.
then you should have begun the first time we asked. we can't wait any longer. demolition of the asteroid is going to start whether you're here or not.
you'd kill us?
"we don't want to hurt anyone, but our patience has run out."
we've only got one ship. there won't be enough room for any of our belongings.
it's not our fault you took apart your other vessels.
you can't do this.
"dex, don't provoke him."
where are we supposed to go?
i'm sure you'll find a home somewhere.
this is our home. you have no right to make us go.
leave her alone!
bring him here!
don't touch him!
are you going to stop me?
you've said what you've come to say. now i suggest you leave.
you have three days to evacuate.
"you can see now why we're suspicious of outsiders,"
"thank you for protecting the boy, but i'm afraid your actions might make things worse."
how could they get any worse?
fighting back has never done anything but cause us more trouble.
and what has running away ever done for us?
it's kept us alive.
maybe it's time we stayed and defended ourselves. will you help us?
i agree with oxilon. fighting isn't the answer. but i'll try to help.
how?
"well, we could talk to my captain. maybe she can negotiate with the miners, get them to agree to let you stay."
your captain would be willing to do that?
the best thing would be for you to come to voyager. talk to her yourself.
i want to go too.
"shush, brax."
why don't you both come? i've seen your home. i'd like you to see mine.
"commander chakotay, i'd like you to meet dexa and brax."
welcome to the bridge.
and this is ensign kim.
what's this?
"this is an engineering station, and over there is tactical, and down there is the helm. and this is the captain's chair."
which station is yours?
"well, actually, i don't have a specific, er, i'm more of a"
"neelix does too many things to have just one station. he's our ambassador, morale officer"
"trade negotiator. without a doubt, he's the most versatile member of our crew."
"as you can see, our sensors are extremely precise. we can scan for life signs light years away."
that's how we found you.
i have something else that may interest you.
what is it?
talax. you can scan that far away?
"no, this image is from our database."
it's as beautiful as i remember.
there's the godo mountain range.
and the axiana lakes. that was always one of my favourite places.
mine too.
why don't we just go back to talax? we could live there.
it's still controlled by the haakonians. they don't treat talaxians very well. that's why we left.
"maybe neelix could go with us, and we could fight them. take the planet back."
"if tomorrow's negotiations go well, you won't have to go anywhere."
"next stop, engineering."
the warp core.
neelix.
"naomi! i'm sorry, i forgot all about our kadis-kot game."
that's all right. i know you're busy. i just wanted to meet your friends.
"of course. dexa, brax, this is my goddaughter, naomi."
hey.
you live on a beautiful ship.
thanks. maybe brax would like to go to the holodeck.
that's a great idea.
lieutenant paris has a new programme. invaders from the ninth dimension.
sounds scary.
very.
what's a holodeck?
neelix is right. might be too scary for you.
i'm not afraid. can i?
you're lucky to have found these people. they obviously think a great deal of you.
the feeling's mutual.
to the axiana lakes.
it really is delicious.
"i've been saving it for fifteen years. i wasn't sure i'd ever open it, but tonight seemed like the right occasion. would you like some more taga cake?"
"a little, please. i haven't had this in years."
i'm glad you like it. it's a family recipe.
you're a good cook. i haven't seen brax this happy since his father was alive.
how did he? i'm sorry. you probably don't want to talk about it.
"i don't mind. we'd settled on a planet call phanos. there was a lot of unoccupied territory, but the government restricted us to a very small area."
why?
"they said it was a quarantine to protect the population from alien diseases. but it was just an excuse. we were outsiders. they didn't want us mixing with their people. it wasn't long before we realised we didn't have enough land to grow what we needed to feed ourselves. oxilon said we'd just have to conserve our resources. but my husband was tired of being told what to do, so he started farming outside the restricted zone."
they didn't like that.
"a security patrol confronted him. he told them he had to provide for his family, that he wasn't afraid of them. there was a fight. he was killed."
i'm sorry.
"after that, we came here. we thought we'd finally found a place where no one would bother us."
maybe this time it'll be different.
"maybe. but even if it isn't, thank you for trying."
i should get a good night's sleep if i'm going to be my best at the negotiations tomorrow.
neelix? it's been a wonderful day.
"isn't there enough to mine here, without destroying their home?"
"their home contains more than thirty percent of the field's ore. without that asteroid, the operation isn't worth the expense."
would you be open to some kind of compensation?
all we want are the minerals.
and you'd kill us to get them.
wait. the talaxians have found a way to produce a lot of geothermal energy. maybe they could share it with you.
"what do you mean, share?"
you could convert it into fuel to power your ships.
the energy they generate isn't compatible with our technology.
we'd be willing to help you make the modifications.
we have quotas to meet. we don't have time for that.
"commander, the future of more than five hundred people is at stake here."
"and once, there was a transporter accident. neelix and commander tuvok got combined to make a completely different person."
really?
"you don't think i could make up a story like that, do you?"
"hello, neelix."
do you want to play kadis-kot?
maybe later.
i knew it wouldn't work.
we did get them to make a small concession. they've extended the deadline. you'll have enough time to dismantle your equipment.
"thanks, but there's too much to take with us."
captain janeway has agreed to ferry all of you and your supplies to the nearest m class planet.
"come on, brax. we're going home."
why?
we have to pack. come on.
you said you were going to help us.
brax.
you wanted to see me.
i've detected five warp capable species within two light years of the planet where we're taking the talaxians. i'm worried they might be vulnerable to attack.
they would be vulnerable anywhere.
i thought maybe you could help me devise some defence strategies for their new home.
"frankly, mister neelix, they don't seem inclined to defend themselves."
"no, i suppose not."
"but if they were going to make a stand, their emotional attachment to their present home might be an asset."
are you saying they should stay?
i'm speaking hypothetically.
"hypothetically, if they wanted to defend the asteroid, how would they do it?"
to begin with they would need to establish some kind of perimeter.
you mean shields?
"yes. the miners are monitoring the asteroid. if they detected the talaxians erecting a shield, they would attempt to stop them."
i suppose so.
your people would need competent leadership to defend against a pre-emptive attack.
"if you had the captain's permission, would you be willing to provide that leadership?"
"certainly not. it would be a violation of the prime directive. and even if it weren't, i don't believe that i am the person most qualified to assume that role."
you mean me?
i am merely speaking hypothetically.
"i couldn't lead those people, mister tuvok. i'm not a fighter. i'm just a cook who sometimes imagines himself to be a diplomat."
"on the contrary, mister neelix. you are much more than that. you are perhaps the most resourceful individual i have ever known."
i always thought you just tolerated me.
"you do have some annoying habits. however, during your time on voyager you've developed many valuable skills. skills that would serve you well if you ever decided to assume a leadership role."
you really think so?
let me be clear. i'm not urging you to do anything. i'm simply telling you that i believe that you are more than capable.
"going somewhere, mister neelix?"
just to see my friends.
chakotay tells me you're using your own ship. why not have tom take you in the flyer?
i didn't want to bother anyone.
"you wouldn't be planning anything foolish, would you?"
"whatever i do, i promise it won't involve voyager."
that wasn't my question.
"i know you have prime directive issues. but i'm not officially part of your crew, so i don't have the same constraints."
you're as much a part of this crew as anyone else.
are you ordering me not to go?
that depends on what you're going to do.
it's up to the talaxians.
"safe journey, mister neelix."
"i know from personal experience that you have forcefield emitters. we could use them to establish a shield grid. we'd need to deploy a series of them on the asteroid's surface, along bisecting diameters. sixteen emitters should be enough to form a grid."
"even if you're right, it'd take weeks to dig that many tunnels to the surface."
commander tuvok suggested that we could modify the emitters so they could be fired from torpedo tubes on your ship and planted in the surface.
"as soon as the miners realised what we were doing, they'd attack."
"i could provide cover from my ship. but you're right, we'd have to work quickly."
we could route power to the emitters directly from the core. they'd have a permanent energy supply.
good idea.
"if we do what you're suggesting, people are going to be hurt."
this is your home. the miners have no right to force you out.
i agree. but fighting?
i don't like it either but at some point you have to stand up for yourselves. how do you know there won't be someone else to terrorise you the next place you go?
you know he's right.
no one has worked harder to build this place than you. isn't it worth defending?
"wait for my comm. call. as soon as the last emitter's in place, start routing power to the grid."
understood.
"you're scared, aren't you?"
you?
terrified.
be careful.
i will.
oxilon to neelix. the emitters are loaded. we're ready.
i'll see you soon.
two more and we're done.
acknowledged.
we're moving into position for the next one.
the miners' ship is on an intercept course. evasive manoeuvres.
they're targeting our shields.
i'll deal with them.
"just focus on your job. all right, mister vulcan, let's see if you were right about me."
"neelix, you have to hurry."
just one more emitter
and you can activate the shield.
neelix to oxilon.
my weapons are offline.
we're not in position yet.
you have to get there. they're going to launch another charge.
"neelix, what are you doing?"
don't worry about me.
just get ready to bring the grid online.
delta flyer to neelix. are you all right?
"fine, captain. but you shouldn't be here."
you're violating the prime directive.
we're just helping a friend in distress.
dexa to neelix. the shield's holding.
you did it.
we did it.
we're grateful for everything you've done.
"i'm just happy things worked out, and i'm glad that i could spend some time here with all of you. i'd better go."
stay here.
"he can't, brax. he has responsibilities on voyager."
i promise i'll stay in touch as long as i can.
come in.
hi.
neelix.
what are you working on?
"a report on proto-humanoid cultures, for commander chakotay's palaeontology class."
need some help?
i'm almost finished.
do you have time for a game of kadis-kot?
i have to get up early.
i guess you'd better get to sleep then. do you want me to tuck you in? tell you a bedtime story?
you haven't done that in years.
just think of all the stories you've missed.
"thanks, neelix, but i can put myself to bed. i'm not a little girl anymore."
i didn't think anyone else stayed up this late.
i wouldn't want you to have coffee all by yourself.
have a seat.
"i've been thinking about something. it's a little hard to put into words, and i haven't really made a decision yet. and of course i would never ignore my responsibilities on voyager."
of course not.
i take them very seriously.
"i know you do. i've been thinking about something, too. maybe you could help me."
i'd be happy to.
it's an idea i'd need to talk to starfleet command about.
it must be important.
"it is. now that we've established two way communication with earth, it seems to me starfleet could use a permanent ambassador in the delta quadrant. this ambassador would have to stay in frequent contact with voyager."
certainly.
"it would be difficult for me to run this ship without you, neelix. but that might be a sacrifice i'd be willing to make for the greater good of starfleet. of course, the assignment would be entirely voluntary. you wouldn't be interested, would you?"
"goodbye. and good luck, ambassador."
mister neelix.
"live long, and prosper."
"questa o quella per me pari sono a quant'altre d'intorno mi vedo, del mio core l'impero non cedo meglio ad una che ad altre belta. la costoro avvenenza e qual dono di che ilfato ne infiora la vita. s'oggi questa mi torna gradita, forse un'altra, forse un'altra."
"captain. computer, pause music. i didn't wake you, did i?"
"that's all right, doctor. fifteen minutes of sleep is really all i need. coffee, black. maybe you should pay a little more attention to flying and a little less to singing."
"as a hologram, i can handle a variety of tasks at once. in addition to piloting the flyer, i'm writing a paper on the physiological stresses of long duration space flight, and taking holo-images of this mutara class nebula."
"with a hologram on board, who needs a crew?"
"i'd never admit this to anyone else, but there was a time when i would have given anything to be flesh and blood. but i've come to realise that being a hologram is far superior."
really?
"no offence. i'll always enjoy the company of organics. in fact, i'm delighted you were able to attend this medical symposium with me. it's been a pleasure spending time with you. actually, i was hoping we might do this sort of thing more often."
hmm. we're passing through a subspace eddy.
it could be the wake of another ship.
"no, there's nothing on sensors. it's probably just the gravimetric shear from the nebula."
maybe i should take the controls.
"sit down and relax, captain. you've got a hologram at the helm."
the plasma surges have to be coming from one of these relays.  try realigning the deuterium manifolds.
paris to torres.
go ahead.
can you pull yourself away from engineering for a few minutes? i've got a shuttle down here with faulty deflector array.
i'm a little busy right now.
it's kind of urgent.
what's this?
"well, i thought you'd enjoy a romantic lunch under the glow of a red giant."
"oh, you replicated potato salad."
"with extra paprika, just the way you like it."
this is so sweet. but i can't.
sure you can. i've already cleared it with chakotay.
i told the captain i'd have the dilithium matrix recalibrated before she got back.
"you know, this might be our last chance to be alone for the next eighteen years."
"i will make some time before the baby comes, i promise. oh, i've got to get back."
report.
there's some kind of pulse being directed at our transceiver array. it's coming from the delta flyer.
hail them.
no response.
looks like they've encoded the pulse with a comm. signal.
captain.
"sorry about the image, ensign. our comm. system's been damaged. the only way i could send you a signal was through the main deflector."
are you and the doctor all right?
we're fine. tell commander chakotay to meet me in my ready room as soon as we've docked. janeway out.
harry tells me the flyer took some damage.
"that's an understatement. we almost didn't make it back in one piece. they're called the r'kaal. their technology is decades ahead of ours. transphasic warp drive, multi-spectral cloaking systems. they could destroy this ship before our sensors knew they were there."
they sound like people we should avoid.
"i wish that were possible. they control thousands of parsecs from here to the edge of the beta quadrant. they're ecological extremists. they believe conventional warp engines damage subspace, so they've outlawed warp travel through their territory."
then we should reverse course and find a way around.
that's the problem. we've already been in their space for three weeks without knowing it.
you'd think they'd mark their borders a little more clearly.
"as punishment, their law demands that our ship be dismantled."
obviously we're not going to let that happen.
"i spent three hours explaining our situation to their supreme archon, a thoroughly unpleasant man. i convinced him to spare voyager, but at a price. we're going to rendezvous with their armada and surrender our warp core at a class m planet where they've agreed to let us settle."
settle?
"i didn't make this decision lightly, chakotay."
"we have to bring the senior staff in on this. we can find a way to evade their ships, or adapt our sensors to their cloaking technology."
"we could try that, and we might make it past their armada, but we could lose a lot of people in the process. maybe the entire ship."
"kathryn, there's got to be another way."
"i'm tired, chakotay. tired of casualty reports, of continually risking my people on the slim chance that we'll make it home in one piece."
we've found our way out of worse situations.
set a course.
what am i supposed to tell the crew?
"for now, i'd like to keep this between us."
it's not like you to keep your people in the dark
i'll make an announcement when the time is right. dismissed.
captain.
"i'm sorry to interrupt, but i could use your input on a hypothetical scenario."
of course.
"if we were to eject the core, could it be towed safely at warp?"
in theory. but a tractor beam might destabilise the containment field. you'd be risking a breach.
could you compensate for that?
you could configure the tractor emitters to generate a resonance pulse. that should stabilise the field.
can you make those modifications to the delta flyer's tractor emitters?
i suppose.
how long would it take?
"er, a few hours."
get started.
i thought this was a hypothetical scenario.
"we should be prepared, just in case."
in case of what?
let me know as soon as you're finished.
torres to chakotay.
go ahead.
have you got a minute?
b'elanna tells me you ordered some modifications to the flyer.
that's right.
maybe i misunderstood. i thought the plan was to hand over the core when we reached the planet. are we taking it somewhere else?
i heard you the first time.
captain?
"you've already made your concerns clear, commander, but there's been a slight change of plans."
"were you going to tell me? kathryn, what's going on?"
i don't feel well. i've got a headache. i'm going to my quarters and i'd prefer not to be disturbed. you have the bridge.
not now.
"i beg your pardon, captain?"
"carry on, commander."
chakotay to the doctor.
"go ahead, commander."
report to sickbay immediately.
something wrong with the turbolifts?
you did say immediately. how can i help you?
i'm concerned about the captain. she doesn't seem to be feeling well.
what's wrong?
i'm not sure. she went to her quarters with a headache.
i'll bring her an analgesic.
i was wondering if this could be related to your encounter with the aliens.
you think they harmed her?
you tell me. what did they do to her?
"i'm not sure, exactly. the aliens took my programme offline as soon as they boarded the flyer. the captain reactivated me a few hours later and told me she'd been interrogated. naturally, i examined her to make sure she was all right."
did you find anything unusual?
"i suppose i'm violating doctor-patient confidentiality by telling you this but, she was fine."
i'd like you to give her a more thorough examination.
gladly. but you know how she feels about physicals.
"you can be very persuasive, doctor. contact me as soon as you're done."
"aye, sir."
anything interesting on sensors this morning?
"nothing extraordinary. a red giant and two g type stars, a golorian trading vessel bearing one five six mark four."
"if there were a fleet of cloaked ships in the vicinity, could you devise a way to detect them?"
a cloaked fleet would generate significant subspace distortions. why do you ask?
"commander, we're receiving a transmission."
source?
i'm having trouble pinpointing it. should i notify the captain?
"no, she didn't want to be disturbed. route the call here."
i'm commander chakotay of the starship voyager.
this is supreme archon loth of the r'kaal imperium. why haven't you ejected your warp core as your captain agreed?
we're en route to the planet you specified. we can't jettison the core until we get there.
"if we don't receive the core within ten hours, my armada will destroy your ship. this is your only warning."
work with harry. i want to know the source of that transmission.
understood.
"ah, commander. you'll be relieved to know i've given the captain a clean bill of health."
did you run a neurological scan?
"mmm hmm. her brain activity and cognitive functions are completely normal. as far as i can tell she's perfectly fit, physically and mentally."
"thank you, doctor."
"chakotay to the captain. computer, locate captain janeway."
"computer, belay that. my quarters, now."
"really, chakotay. sending the doctor to check up on me."
i'm concerned.
then why didn't you come to me directly? i thought we trusted each other.
so did i. something happened on that away mission that you're not telling me.
i've told you everything you need to know.
"you've consulted me on every major decision over the last seven years, except this one. why?"
there are some decisions a captain has to make on her own.
"i understand that, but every instinct tells me what you're doing is wrong. don't you remember what happened on lesik prime?"
i don't see how that's relevant.
"i think you do. fifteen years ago, you were the lieutenant who was kept in the dark. if you hadn't questioned your captain's orders, the entire away team would have been lost."
this situation's entirely different.
you never told me that story. i made it up. chakotay to tuvok.
"i've erected a dampening field around these quarters. i'm sorry, commander."
"computer, secure the doors and establish a level five dampening field around the morgue."
i can't do my job with the two of you constantly talking in my head.
no. i'm not doing anything else until i speak with the captain. fine. what's your encryption frequency?
"captain, are you all right?"
"doctor, listen to me. under no circumstances are you to eject the warp core."
"if i don't do what they ask, they'll kill you."
i'm giving you a direct order. stop what you're doing.
"i'm sorry, captain. i can't obey that order."
"doctor, i want you to go to the bridge right now and alert commander tuvok."
put her behind the forcefield.
"we have another assignment for you. i've been going over the schematics of your vessel, and i'm intrigued by this bio-neural circuitry. i want you to bring us a series of these gel packs."
the gel packs are integrated into the ship's systems. i can't just remove them without someone noticing.
"you've proven yourself to be very resourceful, doctor. you'll find a way. remember, we're monitoring your perceptual subroutines. we can see and hear everything."
tuvok to chakotay.
you know what will happen to her if you alert your crew.
go ahead.
"are you all right, commander?"
just a scratchy throat. the doctor's treating me now.
could you come to the shuttlebay when you're finished?
"i'll be right there. chakotay out. computer, access the holodeck database and locate commander chakotay's holographic template. download the physical parameters into my programme."
you wanted to see me?
i've completed the diagnostic as you requested. the flyer's comm. system is functioning normally.
you find that unusual?
the captain did report that it was damaged
during the attack by the r'kaal.
i'll have a talk with her. did you find anything else out of the ordinary?
no.
get out of there before you arouse suspicion.
i'll be on the bridge if you need me.
"you're doing a wonderful job, doctor. i'm just giving him a little encouragement."
that's why i'm in command.
"if all goes well, we should have the warp core in less than six hours. he's making excellent progress."
that's exactly what he wants you to believe.
what do you mean?
did you really think you could outsmart a hologram?
everything appears to be normal.
how do you know you're not looking at a holographic projection? the doctor isn't just a physician. his emergency command subroutines contain thousands of tactical scenarios. i wouldn't be surprised if voyager was already on its way here. you do have an option. leave me behind in an escape pod and i'll forget any of this ever happened.
maybe we should let her go.
are you delusional? it took months to plan this. we've already found a buyer for the warp core. now you want to abandon everything?
it's better than being sent to a rehabilitation centre.
"we made our choice when we stole this vessel. i am not going back to the hierarchy, and neither are you. she's just trying to trick you. a month from now, we'll be soaking in the mud baths of eblar prime. trust me."
janeway to torres.
torres here.
i'm having a little trouble with my replicator again. can you take a look at it?
i'm still working on those modifications you asked for. i'll send somebody else.
"i'd consider it a personal favour if you'd do it yourself, lieutenant."
i'll be there in five minutes.
"thank you. janeway out.  computer, access lieutenant torres' holographic template and download the physical parameters into my programme."
"computer, access medical file torres three and update her holographic template."
"did you forget something, lieutenant?"
"i did, actually. where do we keep the spare gel packs?"
locker gamma five.
of course. gamma five.
on the upper level.
"i know where it is, ensign."
you left me no choice.
lieutenant.
oh? are we calling each other by our rank now?
"er, you startled me."
"oh, sorry. well, i thought since you didn't have time for lunch under the stars, maybe you'd settle for the glow of the warp core."
"how thoughtful, but i'm not hungry."
"well, i'm sure the baby is famished."
a pregnant woman shouldn't eat this kind of food. do you want to give me an arterial occlusion?
"one drumstick isn't going to kill you. besides, i won't tell the doctor if you won't."
"you know, this all looks so delicious. why don't we save it for a romantic dinner this evening?"
"all right, nineteen hours. but if you're not there, i'm sending security after you."
i'll be there. sweetheart.
"sweetheart? well, aren't you getting affectionate in your third trimester."
i'll see you later.
kim to chakotay. can you come to astrometrics?
"harry, i'll be right there. chakotay out."
the transmission was encoded with a false subspace signature.
the signal didn't originate on another vessel. it came from inside voyager.
we traced it to holodeck two.
do you know who sent it?
i'm on my way to check the access logs.
i'll go with you.
whoever sent this transmission knew how to cover his tracks. the holodeck logs have been erased.
doesn't look like we'll get any answers here.
i might be able to find some residual phototonic displacement. there we go. i think i can clarify the image with a recursive algorithm.
"our alien's a hologram. the question is, who programmed him?"
"good work, ensign. i'll take it from here."
wait a minute. i'm picking up two holographic signatures. it looks like a second image was superimposed over an existing template. i'll see if i can isolate the first image.
"doctor, what are you doing?"
if you don't mind
i've had a stressful day.
"i'm extremely busy, commander."
this will only take a moment. i've been reviewing the communication logs. there's a discrepancy i was hoping you could explain.
"at the precise moment the flyer transmitted a deflector pulse, you apparently accessed voyager's holographic database."
i haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
your access code was used to download the captain's physical parameters.
"exactly what are you insinuating, commander?"
perhaps we should have a word with the captain.
fine.
"computer, deactivate the emh."
emh protocols are offline.
security to sickbay. remain where you are.
"you haven't forgotten i'm a hologram, have you?"
"if necessary, i'll disable all of your holo-emitters."
"computer, transfer the emh to the mobile emitter."
"all hands, red alert. security teams, apprehend the doctor."
"computer, open the holodeck doors."
unable to comply. access to the holodeck has been restricted.
"security override, tuvok sigma four."
"computer, end programme."
unable to comply. holodeck controls are offline.
tuvok to engineering. shut down power
to holodeck two.
it looks like the doctor's rerouted the power relays. it'll take a minute to bypass them.
"doctor, i've reconfigured my phaser to disrupt your holo-matrix. surrender yourself now."
tuvok to bridge.
can you locate the doctor on the internal sensors?
i'm not reading him. he must've masked his signature somehow.
try scanning for the polydeutonic alloy in his emitter. shut down all
turbolifts and transporters.
acknowledged.
get your people out of here. the core's about to breach.
i'm not detecting an overload.
you're getting false readings. the doctor's reprogrammed your sensors.
"all right, everybody out. now! move it!"
"you too, b'elanna."
i might be able to stabilise the containment field.
you're not putting your baby in danger. go!
you'd better be right behind me.
paris to torres. i'm picking up the doctor's emitter in your section.
where?
right next to the warp core.
"computer, activate emergency command hologram."
all command codes have been transferred to the ech.
prepare to eject the warp core. authorization ech omega four two.
"doctor, don't do this."
warp ejection system enabled.
"computer, eject the core."
"computer, lock on to my mobile emitter and transport me to the delta flyer."
transporters are offline.
"tuvok, we just lost main power"
and internal sensors are down.
the doctor has entered jefferies tube one one alpha. send a security team to the shuttlebay.
lieutenant?
i think the doctor's heading for the escape pods.
"you wouldn't shoot a pregnant woman, would you?"
"come with me, doctor."
"tuvok, someone's launching the flyer."
tuvok!
ow!
you might try disconnecting the phase discriminator.
"ha! i've rebuilt dozens of these units, but i've never seen this configuration before. do you know how i can stabilise the ion flow?"
that looks like the charge inverter.
thank you.
you're welcome. your ship must need a lot of replacement parts.
"oh, those aren't for this ship. i've been collecting and repairing spare components for years. this is from an old impulse drive. would you believe i found it sitting in a waste depository? i'll be able to find a buyer now that it's working."
these parts could be worth a small fortune.
that's exactly what i think. i'm going to use my quarter of the profits to establish an outpost specialising in obsolete engine components. i'm certain there's a demand for them.
my chief engineer is always looking for spare parts. she might be interested in acquiring your entire inventory.
"captain. tut, tut, tut. you're not trying to take advantage of my subordinate, are you? no one's ever going to buy this junk. it's almost as useless as you. there's a ship approaching."
this is the delta flyer. i've got the warp core
but you're not getting it until you release the captain.
are you insane? you almost destabilised the core. both of our ships would've been destroyed!
"this isn't a negotiation. release your tractor beam, now."
all right.
it's in the cargo hold.
lower your shields and we'll beam your captain to you.
ready.
we had an agreement!
"to spare your captain. as you can see, she's still alive."
let the doctor go. i'm the more valuable hostage.
"actually, you're not. we'll leave you in the vinry system. the inhabitants are mostly harmless.  the doctor will be working for us now."
i'll do no such thing.
i'm sure you'll feel differently after i make a few adjustments to your programme.
i had no idea he was going to do this. i'm sorry.
i hope you realise you've stranded voyager in the delta quadrant.
"what did you expect me to do, let them kill you?"
i expected you to follow my orders.
"you might as well have been ordering me to put a phaser to your head. voyager can survive without a warp core, but not without a captain."
now it doesn't have either.
they're just unconscious. paris to tuvok. i found them.
it is logical to assume the captain never returned from the away mission.
do you have any idea where the flyer is?
the doctor masked his ion trail.
engineering to chakotay.
go ahead.
we're ready to restart the impulse reactors.
acknowledged.
it's playing on every comm. channel on the ship.
"computer, pause music."
unable to comply.
didn't the doctor play this at his recital last month?
"yes. and as i recall, he performed the piece flawlessly."
maybe the recording was damaged by the power loss.
or perhaps the doctor altered the music deliberately.
why would he do that?
i performed a fourier analysis on the recording. the harmonics have been modified.
it could be a comm. frequency.
unlikely. there's no carrier wave.
"i could be wrong but, it looks like a warp signature."
the power utilisation curve would be about right.
try scanning for it.
"i'm detecting a matching signature. distance, six point seven light years."
we can't follow them at impulse.
you and tom take a shuttle.
what are you doing?
"if i can amplify your matrix, i might be able to disrupt the forcefield."
"i'm sorry i put us in this position, captain."
you said you wanted us to spend more time together.
"this isn't what i had in mind. maybe, if we get back to the ship, we could try socialising a little more."
"this really isn't the place to be talking about this. besides, i don't do a lot of socialising."
"you have meals with commander chakotay, and you play velocity with seven."
we're going to have to discuss this later.
i need to upload your first assignment.
you want me to infiltrate the hierarchy's surveillance complex?
the data stored there is worth a hundred warp cores.
how do you expect me to get past the security perimeter?
i'm glad you asked.
i trust this won't be permanent.
i've given you the rank of a class one overseer. you'll be able to walk into central command without anyone noticing. i've also uploaded several other holographic templates you might find useful.
what's wrong?
i'm not certain.
the compression algorithms are breaking down.
i told you his programme couldn't handle that much data.
what have you done to me?
i'm detecting a human lifesign aboard. and a holographic signature.
"the vessel's weapons are polaron-based, and they have auto-regenerative shielding."
we still have the element of surprise.
if you don't get him back to voyager his matrix will be permanently damaged.
please do something.
he won't be any use to us if he decompiles.
someone's boarded the delta flyer. they're moving away.
fire at both vessels.
"now, mister paris."
"the shield generator isn't going to last. if we give them what they want, maybe they'll leave."
prepare to jettison their warp core.
what are you doing?
arming a torpedo. if we detonate their core the blast wave should give us enough time to escape.
that would kill them.
"captain, get down!"
"lieutenant, lock a tractor beam onto the core and get it back to voyager."
acknowledged.
"nar, get this hologram off me."
guess this wasn't so useless after all.
are you still interested in acquiring my inventory?
"computer, transfer the emh back into the holodeck buffer."
can you stabilise his matrix?
not until we purge the excess subroutines.
there's more than a thousand teraquads of new data in here.
how is he?
we're not sure yet.
"captain, if i don't survive, i need you to do something for me."
you're going to be all right.
"if i'm not, when you reach earth i want you to donate my emitter to the daystrom institute. they may be able to replicate it someday so that other holograms can know the freedom i've enjoyed. i've had something on my conscience for a long time. after i was first activated, i kept a record of what i considered to be your most questionable command decisions. it's in my personal database. i hope you'll delete the file without reading it. mister tuvok, i violated the most sacred trust between a physician and his patient. i told mister neelix about the cutaneous eruption you developed on your. that was indiscreet. i hope you can forgive me. ensign, at your recital last month, i told lieutenant torres that your saxophone playing reminded me of a wounded targ. i should've put it more delicately. i'm sorry. seven."
you should remain still.
"you have no idea how difficult it's been, hiding my true feelings all these years, averting my eyes during your regular maintenance exams."
"i know you could never have the same feelings for me but i want you to know the truth. i love you, seven."
your cognitive algorithms are malfunctioning.
"goodbye, my friends. speak well of me."
is he
"no, i've got him."
what happened?
i deleted the extraneous subroutines.
i'm not going to decompile?
you'll probably outlive us all.
"doc, anything else you'd like to confess?"
"captain, do you, do you need medical attention?"
no. you've been keeping to yourself lately. your friends are worried about you.
"after my deathbed confession, i wasn't sure i had any friends left. i overstepped my bounds in documenting your command decisions. it happened a long time ago, before i considered myself to be a part of your crew."
"oh, i'm not here to make you grovel. i'm here to punish you for your insubordinate behaviour."
i understand.
"you're hereby denied the use of your mobile emitter for six days. since you haven't left sickbay for a week, we'll call it time served."
"i appreciate the gesture, captain, but i've got a lot of work to catch up on."
i'm sorry to hear that. i was hoping you might be free for a cup of coffee on the holodeck. i know a little sidewalk café in buenos aires. you said you wanted us to socialise more.
i suppose mister paris can finish this.
"now, when you're on the holodeck with the captain, there are two rules you have to follow."
i understand.
"first, leave your rank at the door."
not a problem. the second?
no opera.
"these should be familiar images to everyone who remembers the uss voyager's triumphant return to earth after twenty three years in the delta quadrant. voyager captivated the hearts and minds of people throughout the federation, so it seems fitting that on this, the tenth anniversary of their return, we take a moment to recall the sacrifices made by the crew. corruption charges were brought today against a ferengi"
"computer, end display."
hello.
what's your name?
harry. what's yours?
sabrina.
naomi's daughter?
ah ha.
you've gotten so big.
i don't remember you.
i haven't come to one of these reunions in four years.
why?
i've been on a deep space assignment.
for four years?
"compared to how long i was on voyager, it seemed like a long weekend. can you find your mother for me?"
ah ha.
i'd like to say hi.
"oops. here you are, captain."
"thank you, admiral. i haven't seen her since she was a baby."
it's amazing how fast you've all grown.
how's tuvok?
not well.
i thought maybe i'd go see him tomorrow.
"oh, that would be nice."
i'm sorry i missed the funeral. i should have been there.
"you were on a mission. everyone understood. it's so good to see you, harry."
doc!
"mister paris. voyager's pilot, medic, and occasional thorn in my side. where have you been hiding yourself?"
i've been busy.
new holonovel?
i'll make sure to get your input before i send it off to my publisher. aren't you going to introduce me to your date?
"mister paris meet lana, my blushing bride."
you're married?
tomorrow is our two week anniversary.
"well, congratulations. my invitation must have gotten lost in subspace.."
"oh, you should be flattered. we took a page from your book and eloped."
joe has a real flair for romantic gestures.
joe?
i decided i couldn't get married without a name.
it took you thirty three years to come up with joe?
it was lana's grandfather's name.
"oh. oh, so you're not a"
a hologram? no.
"frankly, mister paris, i'm surprised you'd even ask. i thought we were beyond those sorts of distinctions."
"are you kidding? i think it's great. i'm in a mixed marriage myself, remember?"
"speaking of which, where is that wife of yours?"
the high council had a lot of questions.
what did you tell them?
"the truth, with a klingon twist. i told them that my beloved former captain, who had saved my life many times in glorious battle, would be honoured to submit korath's house for consideration."
do you think it will work?
"i'm just the federation liaison, but i'd like to think i have some influence. you still haven't told me why you're trying to help korath."
he's an old friend.
would this old friend have anything to do with the mission that you sent my daughter on?
"sorry, b'elanna, but you know i can't talk about that."
couldn't you at least have waited until after the reunion? she really wanted to be here.
"she'll be home soon, i promise."
"may i have everyone's attention, please. ten years ago tonight, this crew returned home from the longest away mission in starfleet's history. twenty three years together made you a family, one i'm proud to have been adopted by. let's raise our glasses to the journey."
to the journey.
and to those who aren't here to celebrate it with us.
"ladies and gentlemen, meet the borg."
"over the course of this term, you're going to become intimately familiar with the collective. you'll learn about the assimilation process, the borg hierarchy, and the psychology of the hive mind. and when it comes to your performance in this class, my expectations are going to be no different than the borg queen herself. perfection. this semester, we are very fortunate to have a special guest lecturer. the woman who literally wrote the book on the borg. admiral kathryn janeway."
"thank you, commander. i'm glad to be here. a question already, cadet?"
"i suppose it could wait until after class, admiral."
"as they say in the temporal mechanics department, there's no time like the present."
"in the year 2377, you aided the borg resistance movement known as unimatrix zero."
sounds like someone's been reading ahead.
"i thought you had a question, cadet."
"yes, ma'am. when you informed the queen that you were going to liberate thousands of her drones, could you describe the look on her face?"
admiral? some of us were talking before class and we were curious. how extensive was seven of nine's involvement with unimatrix zero?
"i'd, er, prefer not to discuss seven of nine."
"yes, ma'am. sorry."
excuse me.
"okay, er, who can tell me a little about nanotechnology?"
"i'm sorry to pull you out of class, admiral."
did you see it?
"yes, ma'am."
and?
it works.
korath has agreed to the exchange?
yes.
but?
he's insisting on handing it over to you personally.
"i'll be there as soon as i can. good work, ensign paris."
"hello, tuvok."
the light.
"oh, i'm sorry."
i know you.
"that's right. i'm your friend, kathryn janeway, remember?"
you're an impostor.
"no, tuvok. it's me."
admiral janeway visits on sunday. today is thursday. logic dictates that you are not who you claim to be.
how are you?
i am close to completing my work.
i'm glad to hear it.
it is difficult with so many interruptions.
i'm sorry. would you like me to leave?
you may stay.
"tuvok, there's something i need to tell you. it's very important. i'm going away and i may not see you again. commander barclay and the doctor will continue to visit. they'll bring you anything you need."
the doctor comes on wednesdays. commander barclay's visits are erratic.
"goodbye, tuvok."
you must be the only doctor who still makes house calls.
what are your symptoms?
i'm perfectly fine.
for thirty three years you fought me every time you were due for a physical. now you ask me to give you one ahead of schedule?
i'm taking a trip. i just wanted to get our appointment out of the way before i left.
that's all?
that's all.
hmm. the good news is you're as healthy as you were the first day i examined you.
"well, now that's out of the way, have a seat. we didn't get to talk much at the party."
"no, i don't suppose we did."
"so, how's married life?"
wonderful. you should try it.
"oh, i think it's a little late for that. marriage is for the young, like your wife."
"i can only hope she ages as gracefully as you have. i, of course, will be the same handsome hologram twenty years from now as i am today."
i've been meaning to ask you. are you familiar with a drug called chronexaline?
we've been testing it at starfleet medical to determine if it can protect biomatter from tachyon radiation.
and?
it's very promising. why do you ask?
i need two thousand milligrams by tomorrow afternoon.
why?
that's classified. will you get it for me?
"of course, admiral. you'll have it by oh nine hundred."
thank you.
download complete.
this should be everything you need.
the shuttle?
waiting for you at the oakland shipyard. i wish you'd let me come with you.
"sorry, reg, but this is my mission. besides, if you leave there won't anyone to teach those eager young cadets about the borg."
oh. i made you some fresh tea for the trip. not that replicated stuff.
"thank you, for everything. i wouldn't have been able to do this without you."
"oh, don't remind me."
"any final words of advice for your old captain? wait, don't tell me. i'm being impulsive. i haven't considered all the consequences. it's too risky. thanks for the input, but i've got to do what i think is right."
"i know it wasn't easy living all these years without her, chakotay. but when i'm through, things might be better for all of us. trust me."
tom. tom?
i'm sleeping.
it's time.
for what?
i'll give you one guess.
paris to
"paris to sickbay, it's time."
"relax, mister paris. can she stand?"
affirmative.
then i suggest you report to sickbay.
what about b'elanna?
"her, too."
"right, of course. maybe we should take the transporter. hey, wait for me!"
hmm.
what do you mean by hmm?
"you're going to have a very healthy baby, but not tonight."
tell me you're joking.
"you're experiencing false labour, lieutenant."
again?
"as i explained the last time, it's a common occurrence, especially among klingons."
i want this thing out of me now.
misdirected rage. another common occurrence among klingons.
can't you induce?
i wouldn't recommend it
"if this keeps happening, we'll never get any sleep."
you think it's bad now?
when?
oh four hundred.
how many false alarms does that make?
three that we know of.
that baby is as stubborn as her mother.
harry's starting a pool to see who can guess the actual date and time of birth.
"tell him to put me down for next friday, twenty three hundred hours. anything else?"
crewman chell's asked about taking over in the mess hall full time.
neelix left some pretty big pots and pans to fill. does mister chell feel he's up to the challenge?
apparently so. he's prepared a sample menu.
plasma leek soup? chicken warp core don bleu?
"if his cooking's as bad as his puns, we're in trouble."
"oh, i don't know. i wouldn't mind giving his red alert chili a try. feel like having lunch?"
"i'd love to, but i've already made plans. rain check?"
absolutely.
what's all this?
"a picnic. according to my research, this is an appropriate third date."
you didn't have to go to this much trouble.
if this makes you uncomfortable i could prepare a less elaborate meal.
"no, don't change a thing. this is perfection."
"in the interest of fair play, i should inform you that mister kim has never defeated me at kal-toh."
you should've listened to me.
"kal-toh is as much a game of patience as it is of logic. an experienced player will sometimes take several hours to decide his next move, and in some cases even days may be necessary to"
kal-toh.
you beat him.
congratulations.
"i'm sure it was just beginner's luck, sir. i'd offer you a rematch, but i'm due in astrometrics."
"he may have to go, but i'm free and feeling lucky."
"if you'll excuse me, ensign."
"it's just a game, tuvok."
icheb's an exceptionally bright young man. did it occur to you that he might simply be a better player?
my loss was the result of another lapse in concentration.
i am detecting lower neuropeptide levels.
as i suspected. my condition is deteriorating.
it's a minor change. we knew it would happen. i simply have to increase your medication.
"thank you, doctor."
"commander. i understand your desire for privacy, but maybe it's time we informed the captain."
i will inform her if and when the disorder begins to affect the performance of my duties.
of course.
your move.
"red, grid three thirteen."
tricky.
how's brax?
"wonderful. thanks for asking. i know i can never replace his father, but"
i have no doubt the boy looks up to you.
"orange, grid ten twelve. i haven't told anyone, but i'm thinking of asking dexa to marry me."
she'd be wise to accept.
that's enough of my love life. how about yours?
i don't have a love life.
oh? what about your relationship with commander chakotay?
it's your turn.
"actually, it's yours. at least tell me how he liked the picnic."
it was an enjoyable activity for both of us. thank you for suggesting it.
any time. what is it?
long range sensors are detecting extremely high neutrino emissions accompanied by an intermittent graviton flux approximately three light years away.
a wormhole?
i'm not sure. i'll need to conduct more scans.
we can finish our game tomorrow.
i'll contact you at the usual time.
the emissions are occurring at the centre of the nebula. there appear to be hundreds of distinct sources.
which could translate to hundreds of wormholes.
"the radiation is interfering with our sensors, but if ensign kim's enthusiasm turns out to be justified, it would be the most concentrated occurrence of wormholes ever recorded."
any idea where they lead?
"not yet, but if just one of them leads to the alpha quadrant."
"who knows, harry? it might take us right into your parents' living room."
"alter course, mister paris. ensign, when you speak to your mother, tell her we may need her to move the sofa."
71 53 53 31 71 53 53 31 71 53.
"sorry if i pulled you away from something important, sir, but he won't let anyone near him and i thought you might"
"you did the right thing. his condition's never been associated with violent behaviour,"
he seems more frustrated than violent.
long range sensors have detected no trace. her disappearance remains a mystery. i am deeply concerned.
"what are you concerned about, tuvok?"
her disappearance.
whose?
53 31 71 53.
he's been repeating those same numbers over and over again. 53 31 71. it might be a stardate.
"stardate 53317. if my memory files are accurate, that was the day captain janeway was abducted by the kellidians. is that who you're talking about, tuvok? captain janeway?"
her disappearance remains a mystery.
"no, you solved that mystery, tuvok. you rescued the captain and brought her back to voyager safe and sound. remember?"
"i am deeply concerned, deeply concerned."
"do you think if the admiral paid him a visit, showed him that she was all right?"
"unfortunately, she's out of town right now. i'm not sure when she'll be back."
she's never coming back! her disappearance remains a mystery. i'm deeply concerned. deeply concerned.
"voyager to pathfinder. come in, pathfinder."
"doctor! what a pleasant surp. oh, i've forgotten about our golf game again, haven't i?"
"relax, reg, it's not until next week. i'm here because i need to get in touch with admiral janeway."
"oh, she's out of town."
i know. did she tell you where she was going?
"er, i'm afraid it, it never came up. i mean, is something wrong?"
i'm not sure. i paid a visit to tuvok this morning. he seemed to think that she was in some sort of danger.
"well, you know better than anyone how confused tuvok can get."
"yes, but i've been worried about the admiral, too."
why?
"two days ago, she asked me for a large quantity of an experimental medication. when i asked her why she needed it, she said it was classified."
"then you shouldn't be telling me about it, should you?"
i spoke to director okaro at starfleet intelligence. he assured me that the admiral hasn't been involved in any classified work since she began teaching at the academy.
you know how sneaky these intelligence people can be. maybe he was just trying to throw you off.
"maybe. but still. she's been talking for months about how excited she is to be teaching with you. then, just as the semester begins, she goes away without even telling you where. don't you find that a little strange?"
"i, i'm sure that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation, doctor. i'm sorry, i have some p-papers to grade."
"you're stammering, reg."
s-s-so?
i haven't heard you do that in years. i think you do know where she is.
"she is one of the most decorated officers in all of starfleet history, and i'm, i'm sure she can take care of herself."
you wouldn't be saying that unless she was doing something dangerous.
you are putting words in my mouth.
"tell me where she is, reg."
"welcome to the house of korath, admiral."
i love what he's done with the place.
kuva'kor li'ju!q mah.
petaq! dabeq chu'magh an'noq.
what was that about?
he said your demeanour was disrespectful.
i hope you told him i didn't mean to be rude.
"i told him if he didn't show you more respect, i would break his arm."
you are your mother's daughter.
korath is waiting. we should go in.
"sorry, but this is where we part ways."
excuse me?
"you're dismissed, ensign."
"but, admiral, i really think that"
i can take care of myself.
"with all due respect, i've been working on this for six months, and"
and you've done an exemplary job. but it's over. understood?
"yes, ma'am."
i happen to know your parents are anxious to spend some time with you. take a few days leave. go and see them.
a cardassian disruptor. i've modified it to emit a nadion pulse.
"impressive, but that's not what i've come for."
no. you've come for something far more dangerous.
where is it?
somewhere safe.
i went to a great deal of trouble to get you your seat on the high council. now give me what you promised.
i've scanned your shuttle. it appears that you've made some interesting modifications. your shield generator is of particular interest.
it's not for sale.
then what you want isn't available either.
we had an agreement.
show the admiral out.
maybe chell should add nebula soup to his menu.
shields?
holding.
bridge to astrometrics.
go ahead.
any more data on those neutrino emissions?
"negative, captain. i still can't get a clear scan."
distance to the centre?
six million kilometres.
what is it?
"i'm detecting a tritanium signature, bearing three four two, mark five five."
"whatever it is, it's too close."
evasive manoeuvres.
is it a ship?
possibly.
"another tritanium signature, right on top of us."
tom!
get us out of here now.
vessel identified: uss voyager. we will pursue and assimilate.
"no. they haven't compromised our security. let the vessel continue, for now. i'll keep an eye on them."
there's no evidence that the cube detected us.
where is it now?
approximately three light years away.
how could they not have seen us? we came within ten metres of their hull.
the borg wouldn't knowingly risk a collision. the radiation must have interfered with their sensors as well.
"if they can't detect us, we should go back."
i wouldn't recommend it. my analysis of the tritanium signature suggests there were at least forty seven borg vessels inside the nebula.
we can't just give up on those wormholes.
"oh yes, we can."
what if we try to modify
"i'm sorry, mister kim. you may be the captain someday, but not today."
"tom, what are you doing when your shift ends?"
no plans. why?
i've been thinking. you and i should have some fun. one last adventure before you get too busy being a father.
did you reserve some holodeck time?
i've got a better idea.
this is your idea of fun?
it'll work. we just need to make a few modifications to the flyer.
: we might as well just hand it over to the borg.
how could that happen with the best pilot in the quadrant at the helm?
nice try.
"if we go to the captain together, she'll be much more likely to approve my plan."
i don't want her to approve it.
where's your sense of adventure?
i left it in that nebula and i'm not going back for it.
don't you want to find a way home?
"i am home, harry."
captain proton would never walk away from a mission like this.
"captain proton doesn't have a wife, and a baby on the way."
"if you're here for my daily report, it's not complete."
actually i'm here in an unofficial capacity. i was wondering if you'd like to get together again.
to do what?
"well, that all depends on your research. would a quiet dinner be an appropriate fourth date?"
i believe it would be a more suitable fifth date.
i'm willing to skip ahead if you are.
"you're fine, aside from some minor inflammation around your biradial clamp. let me know if it starts to bother you. is there something else?"
"do you remember three months ago, when my cortical node shut down?"
how could i forget.
you said it might be possible to remove the fail-safe device that was causing the problem.
has it been giving you trouble again?
"no, but i've reconsidered your offer to extract it."
i've been hoping you would.
you said it would require several surgeries.
"actually, in anticipation of your change of heart, i've been studying the problem in more detail. i now believe i can reconfigure the microcircuitry with a single procedure. you'll be free to experience the full ranges of emotions. everything from a hearty belly laugh to a good cry."
how soon can you do it?
"today, if you'd like."
my shift ends at eighteen hundred hours.
"it's a date. speaking of dates. once the fail-safe is gone, you'll be free to pursue more intimate relationships."
i'm aware of that.
"if you decide you need help with that aspect of your humanity, i'm always at your disposal."
i appreciate that.
really?
yes. but i already have all the help i need.
"ah, of course. you'll undoubtedly be running more simulations with the chakotay hologram."
"no, actually. i'll see you at eighteen hundred hours."
maktah hoon janeway takt.
i've reconsidered your offer.
i thought you might.
"i'll give you the shield emitter, but not until i've inspected the device you're offering. to make sure it's genuine."
you question my honour?
"if you were honourable, you wouldn't have changed the terms of our agreement. show it to me, or i'm leaving."
this will do just fine.
stop her!
"computer, deploy armour."
lay in a course for these coordinates.
what do you want?
"you'll pay for your deceit, ghuy'cha! the house of korath won't rest until you've drowned in your own blood!"
"i'd love to stay and chat, but i'm on a tight schedule."
"computer, warp six."
approaching designated co-ordinates.
all stop.
warning. vessel approaching. vector one two one mark six.
harry. and people are always saying that space is so big.
"lower your shields, admiral. prepare for transport. i'm taking you into custody."
"you have no grounds to take me into custody, captain."
"reg told the doctor everything, and the doctor told me. now please, admiral, stand down."
on one condition. you let me explain why i'm doing this.
you have no idea what the consequences would be.
i know what the consequences are if we do nothing. so do you. i have a chance to change all that.
if starfleet command knew what you were trying to do
you haven't told them?
the doctor and i decided to keep things in the family.
what about your crew?
i told them i needed to take you back to starfleet medical because you'd contracted a rare disease.
i hope it isn't terminal.
"no, but it has been known to affect judgment."
"i know what i'm doing, harry."
"do you? can you say with absolute certainty that it'll work? because if you can't. even if it weren't a violation of every rule in the book, it would still be far too risky. what."
"i'm remembering a young ensign who wanted to fly into a borg-infested nebula, just to explore the remote possibility that we might find a way home."
"if i remember correctly, you stopped me."
we didn't know then what we know now.
"our technology may have advanced, but"
"i'm not talking about technology, i'm talking about people. people who weren't as lucky as you and me. you said you and the doctor wanted to keep things in the family. but our family's not complete any more, is it? i'm asking you to trust my judgment, harry. one last time."
am i early?
"no, you're right on time. something wrong with the door?"
i didn't think it would be discreet to be seen carrying flowers to the first officer's quarters.
your research? i should put these in water.
i've been told that anticipation of the first kiss is often uncomfortable. i wanted to alleviate the tension.
that was very considerate of you. what about the second kiss?
i'd have to check the database. it may indicate
senior officers report to the bridge.
next time we deactivate the comm. system.
what is it?
"judging from the tachyon emissions, some sort of temporal rift."
how's it being generated?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
"if starfleet command finds out i had anything to do with this, they'll demote me back to ensign."
"you worry too much, harry. it's turning you grey."
"propulsion's online, plasma flow's stable. this device of korath's, it produces too much tachyo-kinetic energy. it could burn itself out by the time you get where you're going. you wouldn't be able to get back."
i always assumed it was a one way trip.
you're sure i can't talk you out of this? right. stupid question.
"kim to the rhode island, one to beam back."
"computer, activate the chrono-deflector."
deploy armour.
unable to comply. ablative generator is offline.
evasive pattern beta six. open a channel to the rhode island.
"harry, i'm under attack. how fast can you get back here?"
i'm detecting nadion discharges on the other side of the rift.
weapons fire?
it's possible. the signature appears to be klingon.
red alert.
"stand by for transport, admiral."
"you know where i'm going, harry, and it's not to your ship."
your structural integrity is failing.
"just get these klingons off my tail. computer, activate the tachyon pulse and direct it to these spatial and temporal coordinates."
there's a vessel coming through the rift.
klingon?
"no, federation."
we're being hailed.
on screen.
recalibrate your deflector to emit an anti-tachyon pulse. you have to seal that rift.
"captain, a klingon vessel is coming through."
"close the rift. in case you didn't notice, i outrank you, captain. now do it."
i did what you asked. now tell me what the hell is going on.
i've come to bring voyager home.
welcome aboard.
it's good to be back.
fresh coffee.
would you like a cup?
"no, i gave it up years ago. i only drink tea now. i told the curator at the museum that if he wanted to make the ready room more authentic, he should always keep a steaming pot of coffee on the desk."
voyager's in a museum?
"voyager is a museum, on the grounds of the presidio. on a clear morning, you can see alcatraz from here."
you made it back to earth.
"unfortunately, our favourite cup took a bit of a beating along the way. it was damaged during a battle with the fen domar."
who?
you'll run into them in a few years.
you know what? i shouldn't be listening to details about the future.
"oh, the almighty temporal prime directive. take my advice. it's less of a headache if you just ignore it."
"you've obviously decided to, or you wouldn't be here."
a lot's happened to me since i was you.
"well, i'm still me, and this is still my ship. so no more talk about what's going to happen until i decide otherwise. understood?"
"all right. let's talk about the past. three days ago, you detected elevated neutrino emissions in a nebula in grid nine eight six. you thought it might be a way home. you were right. i've come to tell you to take voyager back to that nebula."
it was crawling with borg.
"i've brought technology that'll get us past them. oh, i don't blame you for being sceptical. but if you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?"
"for the sake of argument, let's say i believe everything you're telling me. the future you come from sounds pretty good. voyager's home, i'm an admiral. there are ways to defend against the borg. my ready room even gets preserved for posterity."
"so, why would you want to tamper with such a rosy timeline? to answer that, i'd have to tell you more than you want to know. but suffice it to say, if you don't do what i'm suggesting, it's going to take you another sixteen years to get this ship home, and there are going to be casualties along the way. i know exactly what you're thinking."
you've also become a telepath?
"i used to be you, remember? you're asking yourself, is she really who she says she is, or is this some sort of deception? for all you know, i could be a member of species 8472 in disguise. have your people examine my shuttle. tell them to take a close look at the weapons systems and the armour technology. in the meantime, the doctor can confirm my identity."
"my scans of the admiral's cerebral cortex turned up something interesting,"
what is it?
i'm not sure. i've never seen this kind of implant before.
alien technology?
the microcircuitry has a starfleet signature.
of course it does.
admiral?
"you invented it. twelve years ago, from my perspective."
"i'm sorry, admiral, i didn't realise."
"what, that i was eavesdropping? i may be old, but my hearing's still excellent, thanks to your exemplary care over the years."
"so, this implant i'm going to invent. what does it do?"
it's a synaptic transceiver. it allows me to pilot a vessel equipped with a neural interface.
"fascinating. tell me, what other extraordinary breakthroughs am i going to make?"
doctor.
"sorry, captain, but you can't blame a hologram for being curious."
just finish your report.
"yes, ma'am. my scans indicate the two of you are genetically identical. the admiral is you, approximately twenty six years from now."
"hello, seven."
the technology aboard the admiral's ship is impressive. much of it appears to have been designed to defend against the borg.
could we install these systems on voyager?
"the stealth technology is incompatible, but i believe we can adapt the armour and weapons."
"well, captain?"
do it.
"computer, begin regeneration cycle."
"seven of nine, tertiary adjunct of unimatrix zero one. it's been too long."
what do you want?
do i need a reason to visit a friend?
we're not friends.
"no. we're more than that, we're family. and while we're on the subject of old friends, i see that voyager has just gotten a visitor, and she's come from the future. tell me why."
"you may be able to communicate with me while i'm regenerating, but i'm no longer a drone. i don't answer to you."
i've extrapolated voyager's trajectory. i know that you're returning to the nebula. i suggest you alter course.
why should we comply?
"you've always been my favourite, seven. in spite of their obvious imperfections. i know how much you care for the voyager crew. so i've left them alone. imagine how you'd feel if i were forced to assimilate them."
voyager is no threat to the collective. we simply want to return to the alpha quadrant.
"i've no objection to that. but if you try to enter my nebula again, i'll destroy you."
warning. regeneration cycle incomplete.
her cortical node was exposed to a low-energy em surge. it could have been much worse.
it was the borg queen. she wanted to make sure i'd be able to deliver a message. she said she'd assimilate voyager if we attempted to re-enter the nebula.
why is it so important to her?
it doesn't matter. she's not going to be able to make good on her threat.
i wish i shared your confidence.
you would if you'd had as much experience with the queen as i have.
it was one thing to attempt this when we thought it was a secret but if the borg are monitoring us.
there's no guarantee they won't try to assimilate voyager even if we don't go back into the nebula.
is that supposed to be reassuring?
"i'm not saying the borg aren't dangerous, but from my perspective, they're thirty years behind the times."
we shouldn't push our luck.
"luck's not going to have anything to do with it. i know, you don't want to hear too much about the future, but let's just say i ran into the borg a few more times before i made it home. if i hadn't developed technology and tactics that could defeat them, i wouldn't be standing here today."
"we'll maintain course for the nebula, but we'll stay at red alert. and i want continuous scans for borg activity."
i heard what happened. are you all right?
i'm fine.
"because if you need time to rest, i am in charge of the duty roster."
it would be inappropriate to allow our personal relationship to affect your command decisions.
you're right. this is a time to keep things professional. report.
there's no sign of borg activity within a ten light year radius.
"that's good news, crewman."
"yes, sir. but we shouldn't underestimate the collective."
the admiral seems confident we can make it past them.
captain janeway is more cautious.
"our chances would be good with one kathryn janeway on the bridge, but with two, i'd bet on this ship any day. if we do make it back to earth, what are your plans?"
i assume starfleet will want to debrief me. and then i suppose i'll attempt to find a useful position somewhere. you?
"i don't know yet either. but wherever i end up, i'm going to make sure it's in transporter range of you."
i don't want this whole system crashing because of one faulty relay. install new ones.
"yes, ma'am."
and i need an update on the inductor capacitance.
"yes, lieutenant."
b'elanna.
shouldn't you be on the bridge?
is there something wrong with the pilot requesting a systems report from the chief engineer?
the last report i got said the comm. system was working perfectly.
"okay, you caught me. i'm checking up on you."
i'm fine.
your back?
i'm ignoring it.
"well, i would offer to give you a massage, but then everybody would want one."
"you know, for a starfleet fly boy you're pretty sweet."
so how's it going?
"this armour technology that the admiral brought? it's incredible. i hate to sound like harry, but we might actually make it this time."
"well, you don't seem too happy about that."
"oh, i'm happy. it's just that i'd actually gotten used to the idea of raising our daughter on voyager. and now i might end up delivering her at starfleet medical instead of sickbay."
"that wouldn't be so bad, would it?"
not as long as you're with me. and i want the doctor. i don't want some stranger.
you would have to take him offline to keep him away.
"if we do make it home, where do you think we'll live?"
"well, we could always stay with my parents for a while. you're right. bad idea."
"of course, it probably doesn't matter to you anyway. you fly boys are all the same. you'll probably take the first piloting assignment that comes along and leave me home to change the diapers."
not a chance.
bridge to engineering.
"go ahead, captain."
deploy armour.
"yes, ma'am."
armour integrity at ninety seven percent.
tuvok?
integrity holding at ninety percent.
maintain course.
they're looking for ways to adapt.
"port armour integrity down to fifty percent, forty percent."
"mister paris, attack pattern alpha one. target the lead cube and fire transphasic torpedoes."
target the second cube.
distance to the centre?
less than one hundred thousand kilometres.
what the hell is it?
"mister paris, alter course to enter the aperture at coordinates three four six by four two."
belay that. i asked you a question. what is it?
the road home.
it's more than that. it's a transwarp hub.
you once told me there were only six of them in the galaxy.
that's correct.
"you knew this was here, but you didn't tell me about it. why?"
i'll answer all your questions once we're back in the alpha quadrant.
take us out of the nebula.
captain?
you heard me.
"i gave you an order, lieutenant. proceed to the aperture."
"this is my bridge, admiral, and i'll have you removed if necessary. take us out."
"aye, captain."
this hub connects with thousands of transwarp conduits with end points in all four quadrants. it allows the collective to deploy vessels almost anywhere in the galaxy within minutes.
"of all the borg's tactical advantages, this could be the most significant."
it's no wonder the queen didn't want us in that nebula.
so how do we destroy it?
"the structure is supported by a series of interspatial manifolds. if we could disable enough of them, theoretically the hub would collapse."
"this is a waste of time. the shielding for those manifolds is regulated from the central nexus by the queen herself. you might be able to damage one of them, maybe two. but by the time you moved onto the third, she'd adapt."
there may be a way to bring them down simultaneously.
"from where, inside the hub? voyager would be crushed like a bug."
what about taking the conduit back to the alpha quadrant and then destroying the structure from the other side?
"this hub is here. there's nothing in the alpha quadrant but exit apertures. while you're all standing around dreaming up fantasy tactical scenarios, the queen is studying her scans of our armour and weapons. and she's probably got the entire collective working on a way to counter them. so take the ship back into that nebula and go home before it's too late."
find a way to destroy that hub. let's take a walk.
i want to know why you didn't tell me about this.
because i remember how stubborn and self-righteous i used to be. i figured you might try to do something stupid.
we have an opportunity to deal a crippling blow to the borg. it could save millions of lives.
"i didn't spend the last ten years looking for a way to get this crew home earlier, so you could throw it all away on some intergalactic goodwill mission."
maybe we should go back to sickbay.
"why, so you can have me sedated?"
so i can have the doctor reconfirm your identity. i refuse to believe i'll ever become as cynical as you.
am i the only one experiencing déjà vu here?
what are you talking about?
"seven years ago you had the chance to use the caretaker's array to get voyager home. instead, you destroyed it."
i did what i knew was right.
you chose to put the lives of strangers ahead of the lives of your crew. you can't make the same mistake again.
"you got voyager home, which means i will too. if it takes a few more years then that's"
seven of nine is going to die.
what?
"three years from now. she'll be injured on an away mission. she'll make it back to voyager, and die in the arms of her husband."
husband?
"chakotay. he'll never be the same after seven's death, and neither will you."
"if i know what's going to happen, i can avoid it."
"seven isn't the only one. between this day and the day i got voyager home, i lost twenty two crew members. and then of course there's tuvok."
what about him?
"you're forgetting the temporal prime directive, captain."
the hell with it.
"fine. tuvok has a degenerative neurological condition that he hasn't told you about. there's a cure in the alpha quadrant, but if he doesn't get it in time"
"even if you alter voyager's route, limit your contact with alien species, you're going to lose people. but i'm offering you a chance to get all of them home safe and sound today. are you really going to walk away from that?"
"your concern is appreciated, captain, but premature. it will be several years before the symptoms become serious. until then, the doctor can manage my condition with medication."
is it true what the admiral said? that there's a cure in the alpha quadrant?
"it is called a fal-tor-voh, and it requires a mind meld with another vulcan."
what about the other vulcans on voyager?
none of them are compatible.
"but members of your family are? if you knew that returning to the alpha quadrant was your only chance for recovery, why didn't you object when i asked you to help find a way to destroy the hub?"
"my sense of logic isn't impaired yet. if we succeed, millions of lives will be saved."
what about your life?
"to quote ambassador spock, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
"i appreciate your candour, admiral, but captain janeway is my commanding officer. i won't disobey her."
"i'm not asking you to. i simply want you to tell her that in your opinion, destroying the hub is too risky, the cost too high."
i can't do that.
even if it means avoiding the consequences i mentioned?
"now that i know about those consequences, they're no longer a certainty. but even if they were, my death would be a small price to pay for the destruction of the transwarp network."
"i have known you for a long time, seven. longer than you've known yourself. you are thinking that collapsing the network is an opportunity to atone for atrocities you participated in while you were a drone. it's time to let go of the past and start thinking about your future."
my future is insignificant compared to the lives of the people we'd be saving.
you're being selfish.
selfish? i'm talking about helping others.
"strangers in a hypothetical scenario. i'm talking about real life. your colleagues, your friends, people who love you. imagine the impact your death would have on them."
"excuse me, admiral. i have work to complete."
"once inside, we'd fire a spread of transphasic torpedoes."
they'd be programmed to detonate simultaneously.
"if the torpedoes penetrate the shielding, the conduits should begin to collapse in a cascade reaction. in order to avoid the shock wave, we'd have less than ten seconds to exit the hub."
"a long time ago, i made a decision that stranded this crew in the delta quadrant. i don't regret that decision. but i didn't know all of you then, and voyager was just a starship. it's much more than that now. it's become our home. i know i could order you to carry out this plan and none of you would hesitate for a second, but i'm not going to do that. you know the crewmen who work under you, and you know what your own hearts are telling you. so we're not going to attempt this unless everyone in this room agrees. no one will think less of you if you don't."
captain?
"go ahead, harry."
"i think it's safe to say that no one on this crew has been more obsessed with getting home than i have. but, when i think about everything we've been through together, maybe it's not the destination that matters. maybe it's the journey. and if that journey takes a little longer so we can do something we all believe in, i can't think of any place i'd rather be, or any people i'd rather be with."
to the journey.
"hear, hear."
to the journey!
"coffee, black."
i thought you gave it up.
i've decided to revive a few of my old habits.
"oh? what else, besides the coffee?"
"oh, well. i used to be much more idealistic. i took a lot of risks. i've been so determined to get this crew home for so many years that i think i forgot how much they loved being together, and how loyal they were to you. it's taken me a few days to realise it. this is your ship, your crew. not mine. i was wrong to lie to you, to think i could talk you out of something you'd set your mind to."
you were only trying to do what you thought was right for all of us.
"well, you've changed my mind about that. and i'd like to help you carry out your mission. maybe together we can increase our odds."
maybe we can do more than that. there's got to be a way to have our cake and eat it too.
we can't destroy the hub and get voyager home.
are you absolutely sure about that?
"there might be a way. i considered it once, but it seemed too risky."
that was before you decided to revive your old habits.
i don't know why i ever gave this up.
"it's about time. i'm not getting any younger, you know."
you're sure you want to do this?
"no, but voyager isn't big enough for both of us."
"good luck, admiral."
"you, too. captain. i'm glad i got to know you again."
any word from the admiral?
we lost contact as soon as she entered the hub.
did the borg give her any trouble?
"her vessel was scanned by several cubes, but none approached her, sir."
are we keeping things professional again today?
"yes, commander."
"you're not joking, are you."
no.
what's wrong?
nothing. i'm just busy.
i think i've gotten to know you a little better than that.
i'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me as though we're on intimate terms.
we are on intimate terms.
not any more.
what the hell is going on?
i've decided to alter the parameters of our relationship.
you mind telling me why?
"we both have dangerous occupations. it's possible one of us could be seriously injured, or worse. i believe it's best to avoid emotional attachments."
"maybe you can just flip some borg switch and shut down your emotions, but i can't."
i suggest you try. it will make things less difficult for you if any harm should come to me.
why are you suddenly so concerned about that? is there something i should know?
the admiral suggested that your feelings for me will cause you pain in the future. i can't allow that to happen.
"seven, any relationship involves risk. and nobody can guarantee what's going to happen tomorrow. not even an admiral from the future. the only certainty is how we feel about each other here and now. if you think i'm going to let you end this because of what might happen, then you need to get to know me a little better."
"try to relax, lieutenant."
if you tell me to relax one more time i'm going to rip your holographic head off.
i hope you don't intend to kiss your baby with that mouth.
tell me this isn't another false alarm.
this isn't another false alarm.
i can't believe it.
"oh, believe it!"
i might actually win.
what?
"the baby pool. i picked today, fifteen hundred hours."
i'm so glad i could accommodate you&gt;
"don't celebrate yet. klingon labour sometimes lasts several days.  of course, i'm sure that won't be the case here."
bridge to lieutenant paris. we're ready to get underway.
"captain, i'm afraid"
go.
but
"no buts, fly boy. if this mission is going to succeed we need our best pilot at the helm. don't worry, the doctor will be here with me."
"is there a problem, mister paris?"
"on my way, captain."
let's get this show on the road.
voyager has altered course. current position spatial grid three six two. trajectory one one two mark five.
"i don't know how you do it. all those voices talking at once. you must get terrible headaches. if you're calling drones to assimilate me, don't bother."
i don't need drones to assimilate you.
"i'm not actually here, your majesty. i'm in your mind. i'm"
"using a synaptic interface. if i were you, i wouldn't waste my time trying to trace the signal."
"for the moment, it's beyond your abilities."
what do you want?
to make a deal. captain janeway thinks i'm here to help her destroy your transwarp network.
that's beyond your abilities.
"oh, i know that. and i tried to explain it to my naive, younger self, but she wouldn't listen. she's determined to bring down that hub."
she'll fail.
"yes, but she has weapons that i brought from the future. i believe you're familiar with them."
transphasic torpedoes. we will adapt.
eventually. but not before voyager does a great deal of damage. i'm willing to tell you how to adapt to those weapons now.
in exchange for what?
send a cube to tractor voyager and drag them back to the alpha quadrant.
you're asking me to believe that the incorruptible kathryn janeway would betray her own crew.
"not betray them, save them from themselves. i brought technology to help voyager get home. but the captain's arrogant, self-righteous, and her officers are so blinded by loyalty that they're prepared to sacrifice their lives just to deal a crippling blow to the borg."
but you'd never try to harm us.
i've become a pragmatist in my old age. all i want is to get that crew back to their families.
you wish to ensure the well-being of your collective. i can appreciate that. i'll help you. but it'll cost more than you're offering.
what do you want?
your vessel and its database.
"i told you, i'll show you how to adapt to their torpedoes."
insufficient.
"if i let you assimilate technology from the future, there's no telling how events would be altered."
you're willing to alter the future by getting voyager home now.
"oh yes, but there's a difference."
"do what all good pragmatists do, admiral. compromise."
all right. i'll give you the shuttle. after voyager arrives safely in the alpha quadrant.
you've already lied to your younger self. how do i know you're not lying to me?
i guess you'll just have to trust me.
"that won't be necessary. you underestimate me, admiral. while we've been talking, my drones have triangulated your signal."
"computer, deactivate the interface. deploy armour."
very clever. hiding right on my doorstep. were you planning to attack us from inside the unicomplex? not feeling talkative?
you and i don't need words to understand each other.
take us in.
"aye, captain."
voyager has entered aperture eight two three. access transwarp corridor zero nine. redirect vessels to intercept at subjunction
corridor. nine. voyager. uss. s zero zero nine transwarp transwarp intercept.
must be something you assimilated.
what have you done?
i thought we didn't need words to understand each other.
you've infected us with an neurolytic pathogen.
just enough to bring chaos to order.
"the admiral's succeeded, captain. the conduit's shielding is destabilising."
"now, mister tuvok."
voyager will be destroyed.
they're ahead of the shock wave. they'll survive. captain janeway and i made sure of that. it's you who underestimated us.
sphere six three four. they can still hear my thoughts.
"i may have assimilated your pathogen, but i also assimilated your armour technology."
"captain janeway is about to die. if she has no future, you will never exist, and nothing that you've done here today will happen."
what the hell is it?
a transwarp aperture. it's less than a light year from earth.
how many borg vessels?
"we can't get a clear reading, but the graviton emissions are off the scale."
i want every ship in range to converge on those coordinates now.
"yes, sir."
aft armour is down to six percent.
hull breaches on decks six through twelve.
"i can't stay ahead of them, captain."
the armour is failing.
where's the nearest aperture?
"approximately thirty seconds ahead, but it leads back to the delta quadrant."
"mister paris, prepare to adjust your heading."
"yes, ma'am."
"we've got eighteen ships in position, nine more on the way."
open a channel.
"open, sir."
"this is admiral paris. use all necessary force. i repeat, all necessary force."
"sir, there's a vessel coming through."
"mister paris, what's our position?"
right where we expect it to be.
"the transwarp network has been obliterated, captain."
we'll celebrate later. mister tuvok?
cease fire.
we did it.
we're being hailed.
on screen.
sorry to surprise you. next time we'll call ahead.
welcome back.
it's good to be here.
how did you
"it'll all be in my report, sir."
i look forward to it.
"thanks for your help, admiral janeway."
sickbay to the bridge.
doctor to lieutenant paris. there's someone here who'd like to say hello.
"you'd better get down there, tom."
"yes, ma'am."
"mister chakotay, the helm."
"aye, captain."
set a course for home.
where no man has gone before.
doctor cochrane would be proud of you.
i know the whole speech by heart. when's it going to be ready to fly?
let the paint dry first.
"no, i mean the ship."
not for a while. it hasn't even been built yet. you know that.
how big will it be?
pretty big.
bigger than ambassador pointy's ship?
"his name is soval, and he's been very helpful. and i've told you not to call him that, jonathan."
"well, billy cook said we'd be flying at warp five by now if the vulcans hadn't kept things from us."
well they have their reasons. god knows what they are.
drop your weapon! i mean it!
"i don't understand a word you're saying, but i guarantee you i know how to use this."
the ventral plating team says they'll be done in about three days.
be sure they match the colour to the nacelle housings.
you planning to sit on the hull and pose for some postcards?
"maybe. god, she's beautiful."
and fast. warp four point five next thursday.
neptune and back in six minutes. let's take a look at the lateral sensor array.
give me a second.
"slow down. there, those are the ports that buckled during the last test. they need to be reinforced.  great, you scratched the paint."
sorry. orbital six.
"captain archer, sir."
go ahead.
admiral forrest needs you at starfleet medical right away.
who was chasing him?
"we don't know. they were incinerated in the methane explosion, and the farmer's description was vague at best."
how did they get here? what kind of ship?
they were using some kind of stealth technology. we're still analyzing our sensor logs.
i'd like to see those logs.
the klingons made it very clear they want us to expedite this.
it happened on our soil.
that's irrelevant.
"ambassador, with all due respect, we have a right to know what's going on here."
you will be apprised of all pertinent information.
and just who gets to decide what's pertinent information?
admiral.
jon. i think you know everyone.
not everyone.
it's a klingot.
a klingon.
where'd he come from?
oklahoma.
a corn farmer named moore shot him with a plasma rifle. says it was self-defense.
"fortunately, soval and i have maintained close contact with kronos since the incident occurred."
kronos?
it's the klingon's homeworld.
this gentleman is some sort of a courier. evidently he was carrying crucial information back to his people.
"when he was nearly killed by your ""farmer."""
ambassador soval thinks it would be best if we push off your launch until we've cleared this up.
"well, isn't that a surprise. you'd think they'd have come up with something a little more imaginative this time."
"sarcasm aside, captain, the last thing your people need is to make an enemy of the klingon empire."
"if we hadn't convinced them to let us take klaang's corpse back to kronos, earth would most likely be facing a squadron of warbirds by the end of the week."
corpse? is he dead?
"excuse me, is that man dead?"
his autonomic system was disrupted by the blast but his redundant neural functions are
is he going to die?
not necessarily.
let me get this straight. you're going to disconnect this man from life support even though he could live. now where's the logic in that?
klaang's culture finds honour in death. if they saw him like this he'd be disgraced.
they're a warrior race. they dream of dying in battle. if you understood the complexities of interstellar diplomacy
"so that's your diplomatic solution, to do what they tell you. pull the plug?"
"your metaphor is crude, but accurate."
"we may be crude, but we're not murderers. you're not going to let them do this, are you?"
the klingons have demanded that we return klaang immediately.
admiral.
we may need to defer to their judgement.
we've been deferring to their judgement for a hundred years!
jon.
how much longer?
"until you've proven you're ready,"
ready to what?
to look beyond your provincial attitudes and volatile nature.
"volatile? you have no idea how much i'm restraining myself from knocking you on your ass. these klingons, they're anxious to get their man back. fine. i can have my ship ready to go in three days. we'll take him back home, alive."
this is no time to be imposing your ethical beliefs.
dan?
what about your crew? your comm. officer's in brazil. you haven't selected a medical officer yet.
"three days, that's all i need."
admiral.
"we've been waiting for nearly a century, ambassador. this seems as good a time as any to get started."
listen to me. you're making a mistake!
"when your logic doesn't work, you raise your voice? you've been on earth too long."
i had a feeling their approach wouldn't sit too well with you. don't screw this up.
i heard this platform's been approved for bio-transport.
i presume you mean fruits and vegetables.
i mean armoury officers and helmsmen.
i don't think i'm quite ready to have my molecules compressed into a data stream.
they claim it's safe.
"do they indeed. well, i certainly hope the captain doesn't plan on making us use it."
"don't worry, from what i'm told, he wouldn't even put his dog through this thing."
this is ridiculous. i asked for plasma coils and they sent me a case of valve sealant. there's no chance i can have these weapons online in three days.
we're just taking a sick man back to his homeworld. why do we need weapons?
"didn't you read the profile report on these klingons? apparently, they sharpen their teeth before they go into battle."
"no doubt mister tucker will reassure me that my equipment will be here tomorrow. keep your shirt on, lieutenant."
"is it me, or does the artificial gravity seem a bit heavy?"
feels all right. earth sea level.
my father always kept it at point eight g. he thought it put a little spring in his step.
"after being raised on cargo ships, it must've felt like you had lead in your boots when you got to earth."
beautiful. lock it off right there.
"i believe you missed a spot. commander tucker, ensign travis mayweather. he just arrived."
our space boomer.
how fast have you gotten her?
warp four. we'll be going to four five as soon as we clear jupiter. think you can handle it?
four point five.
"pardon me, but if i don't realign the deflector, the first grain of space dust we come across will blow a hole through this ship the size of your fist."
"keep your shirt on, lieutenant. your equipment'll be here in the morning."
ghlungit !tak nekleet.
ghlungit !tak nekleet.
very good. ghlungit !tak nekleet.
ghlungit !tak nekleet.

ltrunghi !krgltt!

!krgltt!
tighten the back of your tongue. !krgltt!
!krgltt! !krgltt!
keep trying. you've almost got it.  i'll be right back.
there's two more weeks before exams. it's impossible for me to leave now.
you've got to have someone who can cover for you.
"if there was anyone else who could do what i do, you wouldn't be so eager to have me on your space ship."
hoshi
"i'm sorry, captain. i owe it to these kids."
i could order you.
"i'm on leave from starfleet, remember? you would have to forcibly recall me, which would require a reprimand which would disqualify me from serving on an active vessel."
i need someone with your ear.
and you'll have her in three weeks.  what's that?
klingon. ambassador soval gave us a sampling of their linguistic database.
i thought you said the vulcans were opposed to this.
they are. but we agreed to make a few compromises.
what do you know about these klingons?
not much. an empire of warriors with eighty poly-guttural dialects constructed on an adaptive syntax.
turn it up.
think about it. you'd be the first human to talk to these people. do you really want someone else to do it?
since when do we have vulcan science officers?
since we needed their star charts to get to kronos.
so we get a few maps and they get to put a spy on our ship?
admiral forrest says we should think of her more as a chaperone.
i thought the whole point of this was to get away from the vulcans.
"four days there, four days back, then she's gone. in the meantime, we're to extend her every courtesy."
i don't know. i'd be more comfortable with porthos on the bridge.
here we go. come in.
this confirms that i was formally transferred to your command at oh eight hundred hours. reporting for duty.
is there a problem?
"no, sir."
"oh, i forgot. vulcan females have a heightened sense of smell. i hope porthos isn't too offensive to you."
i've been trained to tolerate offensive situations.
"i took a shower this morning. how about you, captain?"
i'm sorry. this is commander charles tucker the third. sub-commander t'pol.
trip. i'm called trip.
i'll try to remember that.
"while you may not share our enthusiasm about this mission, i expect you to follow our rules. what's said in this room and out on that bridge is privileged information. i don't want every word i say being picked apart the next day by the vulcan high command."
my reason for being here is not espionage. my superiors simply asked me to assist you.
your superiors don't think we can flush a toilet without one of you to assist us.
"i didn't request this assignment captain, and you can be certain that when the mission's over i'll be as pleased to leave this ship as you'll be to have me go.  if there's nothing else?"
that'll be all.
"when zefram cochrane made his legendary warp flight ninety years ago, and drew the attention of our new friends, the vulcans. we realised that we weren't alone in the galaxy. today we're about to cross a new threshold. for nearly a century, we've waded ankle-deep in the ocean of space. now it's finally time to swim.  the warp five engine wouldn't be a reality without men like doctor cochrane and henry archer, who worked so hard to develop it. so it's only fitting that henry's son, jonathan archer, will command the first starship powered by that engine.  rather than quoting doctor cochrane, i think we should listen to his own words from the dedication ceremony for the warp five complex thirty two years ago."
"take her out, mister mayweather. straight and steady."
"how are we doing, trip?"
ready when you are.
prepare for warp.
"course laid in, sir. request permission to get underway."
the coordinates are off by point two degrees.
thank you. let's go.
where's klaang?
the humans have him.
did you lose anyone else?
two of my soldiers were killed. one of them was a friend. can you prevent it?
our agreement doesn't provide for correcting mistakes. recover the evidence.
"i will, i promise you. when will we speak again?"
don't be concerned with when.
love what you've done with the place.
those are immunocytic gel worms. try not to shake them.
what'd you think of earth?
intriguing. i especially liked the chinese food. have you ever tried it?
i've lived in san francisco all my life.
"anatomically, you humans are somewhat simplistic, but what you lack biologically you make up for with your charming optimism, not to mention your egg drop soup. be very careful with that."
what's in there?
an altarian marsupial. their droppings contain the greatest concentration of regenerative enzymes found anywhere.
their droppings?
if you're going to try to embrace new worlds you must try to embrace new ideas. that's why the vulcans initiated the interspecies medical exchange. there's a lot to be learned.
"i'm sorry i had to take you away from your programme but, our doctors haven't even heard of a klingon."
"please, no apologies. what better time to study human beings than when they're under pressure? it's a rare opportunity. and your klingon friend. i've never had a chance to examine a living one before."
ensign mayweather tells me we'll be to kronos in about eighty hours. any chance he'll be conscious by then?
there's a chance he'll be conscious within the next ten minutes. just not a very good one.
"eighty hours, doctor. if he doesn't walk off this ship on his own two feet, he doesn't stand much of a chance."
"i'll do the best i can. optimism, captain!"
"you're upside down, ensign."
"yes, sir."
care to explain why?
"when i was a kid, we called it the sweet spot. every ship's got one."
sweet spot?
"it's usually about halfway between the grav-generator and the bow plate. grab a hold of the hatch. no, on either side. now push off. push off."
wow!
it takes practice. ever slept in zero g?
slept?
it's just like being back in the womb.
the captain tells me you've been to trillius prime.
"it took the fourth, fifth and sixth grades to get there. i've also been to draylax and both the denebian moons."
i've only been to one inhabited planet besides earth. nothing there but dust-dwelling ticks. i've heard the women on draylax have.
three. it's true.
you know that first-hand?
"first-hand, second-hand, third-hand."
i guess growing up a boomer has its advantages.
"got an empty seat here, commander."
sorry. dinner with the boss tonight.
the grand canyon?
no.
big sur aquarium?
sightseeing was not one of my assignments.
all work and no play. everyone should get out for a little fun now and then.
all our recreational needs are provided at the compound.
come in.
you should've started without me.
sit down t'pol tells me she's been living at the vulcan compound in sausalito.
no kidding. i lived a few blocks from there when i first joined starfleet. great parties at the vulcan compound.
it might be a little easier using your fingers.
vulcans don't touch food with their hands.
can't wait to see you tackle the spare ribs.
don't worry. we know you're a vegetarian.
looks delicious. tell chef i said thanks.
"of course, sir."
"you humans claim to be enlightened, yet you still consume the flesh of animals."
grandma taught me never to judge a species by their eating habits.
"enlightened may be too strong a word, but if you'd been on earth fifty years ago, i think you'd be impressed by what we've gotten done."
you have yet to embrace either patience or logic. you remain impulsive carnivores.
"yeah? how about war, disease, hunger. pretty much wiped 'em out in less than two generations. i wouldn't call that small potatoes."
it remains to be seen whether humanity will revert to its baser instincts.
"well, we used to have cannibals on earth. who knows how far we'll revert? lucky this isn't a long mission."
human instinct is pretty strong. you can't expect us to change overnight.
"with proper discipline, anything's possible."
"warp four point three, sir."
not much of a change.
i don't know. does anybody else feel that?
feel what?
"those vibrations, like little tremors."
you're imagining it.
"bring us to four four, ensign."
there! what do you call that?
the deflector's sequencing. it's perfectly normal.
perhaps you'd like to go to your quarters and lie down?
ponfo mirann.
"i was instructed to speak english during this voyage, and i'd appreciate it if you'd respect that."
it's easy to get a little jumpy when you're travelling at thirty million kilometres a second. should be old hat in a week's time. archer.
"this is doctor phlox, captain. our patient is regaining consciousness."
on my way. hoshi.
pung ghap! pung ghap!
what's wrong?
the translator. it's not locking onto his dialect. the syntax won't align.
dujdaj hegh!

"i'm not sure, but i think he's saying something about eating the afterlife?"
try the translator again.
i'm going to need to run what we've got through the phonetic processor.
majoa blmohgu!
"he says his wife has grown ugly? i'm sorry, captain. i'm doing the best i can."
excuse me. his pre-frontal cortex is hyperstimulated. i doubt he has any idea what he's saying.
hljoloaoqu'na!
"i think the doctor's right, captain, unless stinky boots has something to do with all this."
oaogu'na!
"that's the warp reactor again, right?"
oaogu'na!
"bridge, report."
"we've dropped out of warp, sir. main power is"
we're losing power on all decks.
i think i just saw something off the starboard bow.
what?
i don't know. it might have just been the sensors going down.
auxiliary power should have kicked in by now. do you know how to tell him to shut up?
shut up!
you may have to sedate him. i need to get to the bridge.
captain! there's someone here.
crewman!
suliban.
we've got state of the art sensors. why the hell didn't we detect them?
mister reed thought he detected something right before we lost power.
the starboard sensor logs recorded a spatial disturbance.
looks more like a glitch.
those weren't glitches in sickbay.
i want a complete analysis of that disturbance. where do we stand on weapons?
i still have to tune the targeting scanners.
what're you waiting for?
captain.
the klingon seemed to know who they were. see if you can translate what he said.
right away.
captain. there's no way you could have anticipated this. i'm sure ambassador soval will understand.
you're the science officer. why don't you help trip with that analysis?
the astrometric computer in san francisco will be far more effective.
"we're not going to san francisco, so make do with what we've got here."
you've lost the klingon. your mission is over.
"i didn't lose the klingon. he was taken, and i'm going to find out who took him."
"how do you plan to do that? space is very big, captain. a shadow on your sensors won't help you find them. this is a foolish mission."
come with me.
i'm not interested in what you think about this mission so take your vulcan cynicism and bury it along with your repressed emotions.
your reaction to this situation is a perfect example of why your species should remain in its own star system.
"i've been listening to you vulcans tell us what not to do all my entire life. i watched my father work his ass off while your scientists held back just enough information to keep him from succeeding. he deserved to see that launch. you may have life spans of two hundred years, we don't."
you are going to be contacting starfleet to advise them of our situation.
"no, i'm not. and neither are you. now get the hell out there and make yourself useful."
"what have you found, doctor?"
"mister klaang was right about one thing. he's a suliban. but unless i'm mistaken, he's no ordinary one."
meaning?
"his dna is suliban but his anatomy has been altered. look at this lung. five bronchial lobes, you see. it should only have three. and look at the alveoli clusters. they've been modified to process different kinds of atmospheres."
are you saying he's some kind of a mutant?
"yes, i suppose i am, but this was no accident, no freak of nature. this man was the recipient of some very sophisticated genetic engineering. watch this. subcutaneous pigment sacs. a bio-mimetic garment. and, the eyes are my favorite. compound retinas. he most likely saw things even your sensors couldn't detect."
it's not in their genome?
"no, certainly not. the suliban are no more evolved than humans. it is very impressive work, though. i've never seen anything quite like it."
how about this?
it's just background noise. your sensors aren't capable of isolating plasma decay.
how can you be so damn sure what our sensors can do?
vulcan children play with toys that are more sophisticated.
"you know, some people say that you vulcans do nothing but patronise us, but if they were here now, if they could see how far you're bending over backwards to help me, they'd eat their words."
your captain's mission was to return the klingon to his people. he no longer has the klingon.
"i realize he's only a simple earthling but did it ever occur to you that he might know what he's doing? it's no secret starfleet hasn't been around too long. god knows you remind us of that every chance you get, but does that mean the man who's been put in charge of this mission doesn't deserve our support? then again, loyalty's an emotion, isn't it?"
any luck?
not really.
my analysis of the spatial disturbance mister reed saw indicates a stealth vessel with a tricyclic plasma drive.
"if we can figure out the decay rate of their plasma, we'll be able to find their warp trail."
"unfortunately, your sensors were not designed to measure plasma decay."
are you sure it's safe to stand so close to that?
what've you got?
"i've managed to translate most of what klaang said, but none of it makes sense."
nothing about the suliban?
nope.
does that name ring a bell to you?
"they're a somewhat primitive species from sector three six four one, but they've never posed a threat."
"well, they have now. did he say anything about earth?"
the word's not even in their database. it's all there. there were only four words i couldn't translate. probably just proper nouns.
"jelik, sarin, rigel, tholia. anything sound familiar? t'pol?"
rigel is a planetary system approximately fifteen light years from our present position.
why the hesitation?
"according to the navigational logs salvaged from klaang's ship, rigel ten was the last place he stopped before crashing on your planet."
why do i get the feeling you weren't going to share that little piece of information?
i wasn't authorised to reveal the details of our findings.
"the next time i learn you're withholding something, you're going to spend the rest of this voyage confined to some very cramped quarters. understood? archer to helm."
mayweather.
"go into the vulcan star charts and find a system called rigel, then set a course for the tenth planet."
"yes, sir."
where is it? where is it!
{du bogh) i don't know.
we're not going to harm you. tell me where it is.
i don't know.
are you certain he's telling the truth?
absolutely certain. the drugs are working.
{hovme luphom. pente dao? enterprise dahjaj?) did you leave it on your ship? is it on enterprise?
{du boqh guch)i don't know what you're looking for.
{biheqh rigel wo'tul) what were you doing on rigel ten?
i was sent to meet someone.
{doh?) who.
{majqa rot. sarin poh ni) a suliban female named sarin.
{dah sarin saj'kogh?) and what did sarin give you?
{rqgh) nothing.
keep him alive while i'm gone.
"as soon as we've tied down, we'll be descending into the trade complex. it has thirty-six levels."
"your translators have been programmed for rigelian. however, you'll encounter numerous other species. many of them are known to be impatient with newcomers. none of them have seen a human before. you have a tendency to be gregarious. i suggest you try to restrain that tendency."
you forgot to warn us about drinking the water.
"doctor phlox isn't concerned with the food and water, but he does caution against intimate contact."
"the vulcans told us klaang was a courier. if he was there to get something, then whoever gave it to him might know why he was taken. it was only a few days ago. a seven foot klingon doesn't go unnoticed."
what in the world?
it's nothing that concerns us.
five or six days ago? do you realise how much traffic we process in a single day?
this was a one man klingon scout ship.
what species are you?
humans. we're called humans.
"elkan nine, raise your approach vector by point two radiants. it was seven days ago. a k'toch class vessel."
does it say who he was here to see?
what is says is that he arrived at docking port six and was given a level one biohazard clearance.
you don't seem to be very interested in what people do here.
our visitors value their privacy. it wouldn't be very tusoropko tuprova pro the business they're in.
it's all right. rigelian uses a pronominal base. the translator's just reprocessing the syntax.
do you have any records of a suliban vessel coming in around the same time?
suliban. i don't know that word. your device must still be malfunctioning.
would you like to meet them? i can arrange it.
is this where you saw klaang?
"i'll show you where, but first you should enjoy yourselves. which one would you prefer?"
we should get going.
"are those real butterflies, or some kind of holograms?"
sir.
yes. absolutely. right.
t'pol to archer.
go ahead.
hey.
"central security claims to have no record of klaang, but they told me about an enclave on level nineteen where klingons have been known to go. something about live food."
where on level nineteen?
"the easternmost subsection, by the geothermal shafts."
i'll meet you there as soon as i can. archer out.
what are you doing? leave the kid alone!
don't get involved.
do you see what she's doing? he's going to suffocate!
"they're lorillians. before the age of four, they can only breathe methyloxide. the mother is simply weaning her son."
could've fooled me.
"humans can't refrain from drawing conclusions. you should learn to objectify other cultures, so you know when to interfere, and when not to."
"gentlemen, gentlemen. perhaps you would prefer to watch the inter-species performance?"
"you don't know anything about klaang, do you."
"of course i do, but there's no reason to hurry."
inter-species performance?
"lieutenant, this man has no intention of helping us."
perhaps another time.
i can't believe we fell for that.
we are explorers.
isn't an enclave supposed to have people?
enclave can mean a lot of things.
t'pol said something about live food. i don't see any restaurants.
hello! excuse me!
ha'quj jeg! they looked klingon to me.
"archer to t'pol. t'pol, come in."
maybe we should get back to where there are more people.
there are plenty of people right here.
stay behind me.
you're looking for klaang. why?
who the hell are you?
my name is sarin. tell me about the people who took klaang off your ship.
i was hoping you could tell me. they looked a lot like your friends outside.
where were you taking him?
how come you don't look like your friends?
would you prefer i did?
what i'd prefer is that you give me klaang back.
so you could take him where?
home. we were just taking him home. you'd better be careful. i'm a lot bigger than you are.
"if you're thinking about harming me, i'd advise against it."
what are you doing?
why were you taking klaang home?
"you know, under different circumstances, i might be flattered by this, but."
that's never happened before.
"i've been given the ability to measure trust, but it requires close contact."
you're suliban
"i'm a member of the cabal, but not any longer. the price of evolution was too high."
evolution?
some of my people are so anxious to improve themselves that they've lost perspective.
so you know i'm not lying to you. now what?
klaang was carrying a message to his people.
how do you know that?
i gave it to him.
what kind of message?
"the suliban have been staging attacks within the klingon empire, making it appear that one faction is attacking another. klaang was bringing proof of this to his high council. without that proof, the empire could be thrown into chaos."
why would the suliban want that?
the cabal doesn't make decisions on its own. they're simply soldiers fighting a temporal cold war.
temporal? you've lost me.
they're taking orders from the distant future.
what?
we can help you find klaang but we don't have a starship. you'll have to take us with you.
where's your vessel?
on the roof. docking port three.
this way.
trip!
find klaang.
where's the pod?
over here!
"no, it's this way!"
"come on! lieutenant reed, this is archer. come in."
"you're breaking up, can't read."
we're on the roof. you need to get up here as quickly
as you can.
"we've been trying to reach you, captain. we're back in the shuttle."
ask him where they are. this storm's getting worse.
"captain, what's your location? the weather is definitely"
great!
"like i said, it's back there."
i've never seen lightning in a snowstorm before.
the storm's kicking up too much interference. i can't isolate human biosigns. they could be anywhere in the complex.
try vulcan biosigns.
i found her.
get hoshi to the ship. now!
go!
enterprise needs its captain! give me the weapons!
i said go!
the starboard thruster's down!
ignore it. take us up.
we need instructions.
open a channel. sub-commander t'pol to enterprise.
go ahead.
we'll be docking in four minutes. have doctor phlox meet us in decon.
acknowledged. is someone wounded?
the captain. i'm taking command of enterprise.
i can't do it!
"yes, you can. take her up, straight and steady."
damn.
you can't be afraid of the wind. learn to trust it.
it shouldn't take more than a few moments.
is this really necessary?
"the others scanned negative. you two, unfortunately, were exposed to a protocystian spore. i've loaded the appropriate decon gel into compartment b."
tell mister mayweather to prepare to leave orbit.
how's the captain?
i'm treating his wound.
will he be all right?
eventually.
"correct me if i'm wrong, but aren't you just kind of an observer on this mission? i don't remember anyone telling me you were a member of starfleet."
my vulcan rank supersedes yours.
apples and oranges. this is an earth vessel. you're in no position to take command.
"as soon as we're through here, i'll contact ambassador soval. he'll speak to your superiors and i'm certain they'll support my authority in this situation."
you must really be proud of yourself. you can put an end to this mission while the captain's still unconscious in sickbay. you won't even have to look him in the eye.
"your precious cargo was stolen. three suliban, perhaps more, were killed, and captain archer has been seriously wounded. it seems to me this mission has put an end to itself. turn around."
let's say you're right. let's say we screwed up just like you always knew we would. it's still a pretty good bet that whoever blew that hole in the captain's leg is connected somehow to the people who took klaang.
i fail to see your point.
"captain archer deserves a chance to see this through. if you knew him, you'd realise that's what he's about. he needs to finish what he starts. his daddy was the same way."
you obviously share your captain's belief that my people were responsible for impeding henry archer's accomplishments.
"he only wanted to see his engine fly. they never even gave him a chance to fail. here you are, thirty years later, proving just how consistent you vulcans can be."
"very nice, very nice. your myofibres are fusing beautifully."
how long have?
less than six hours. i thought it best to keep you sedated while the osmotic eel cauterized your wound.
thanks.
"how are you doing, captain?"
that depends. what's been going on the last six hours?
as your highest ranking officer i assumed command while you were incapacitated.
"are we underway?  you didn't waste much time, did you?"
is he fit to resume command?
as long as he returns for more eel therapy tomorrow.
how long before we get back to earth?
"earth, sir?"
we're currently tracking the suliban vessel that left rigel shortly after you were injured.
you got their plasma decay rate?
"with mister tucker's assistance, i modified the sensors. you now have the resolution to detect their warp trail."
what happened to this is a foolish mission?
"it is a foolish mission. the suliban are clearly a hostile race with technology far superior to yours, but as acting captain, i was obligated to anticipate your wishes."
"as acting captain, you could've done whatever the hell you wanted to do."
i should return to the bridge.
dismissed.
"modifying the sensors was her idea, sir."
what are the symptoms of frostbite?
"your appendages blister, peel and turn gangrenous."
i think i have frostbite.
let me see.  doctor phlox may have to amputate.
i never had to worry about frostbite in brazil.
they're getting too far ahead of us.
match their speed.
i'm not authorised to go beyond four four.
engineering.
mister tucker.
would you please give the helmsman permission to go to warp four point five.
"it's okay, travis. i'll keep an eye on the engine."
"enterprise starlog, captain jonathan archer. april 16th, 2151. we've been tracking the suliban ship for ten hours, thanks to our science officer, who came up with a way to tweak the sensors. computer, pause. i save her life, and now she's helping us with the mission. one good turn deserves another doesn't sound very vulcan. resume log. i have no reason to believe that klaang is still alive but if what the suliban woman told me is true, it's crucial that we try to find him. computer, pause.  have you ever known a vulcan to return a favour? no, neither have i. resume log. i still haven't decided whether to ask sub-commander t'pol about this temporal cold war. my instincts tell me not to trust her. computer, pause. archer to t'pol. report."
"if you're feeling well enough to come to the bridge, captain, now would be a good time."
it's a gas giant.
"from the looks of it, a class six or seven."
class seven. the suliban vessel dropped to impulse a few hours ago and altered course. their new heading took them through its outer radiation belt.
we've lost them.
yes.
move us in closer. anything?
the radiation's dissipated their warp trail. i'm only picking up fragments.
you finished helping us?
"lieutenant, run a spectral analysis of the fragments."
there's too much distortion. the decay rates don't even match.
calculate the trajectory of each fragment.
sir?
"you heard her. recalibrate the sensor array. narrow band, short to mid range."
"aye, sir."
measure the particle density of the thermosphere.
your instincts were right. those fragments weren't from one suliban ship
"they were from fourteen, and all within the last six hours. i believe we have found what we're looking for."
how are your targeting scanners?
"aligned and ready, sir."
bring the weapons online and polarise the hull plating. lay in a sixty degree vector. we're going in.
did sarin give them anything?
i don't know.
what do you know?
they followed us here.
"looking for klaang, or for you?"
i don't know but i will destroy them before they locate the helix.
"we didn't plan to involve the humans or the vulcans. not yet. sarin's message cannot reach kronos. if the humans have it, you must stop them."
sensor resolution's falling off at about twelve kilometres.
travis?
"i'm okay, captain"
our situation should improve. we're about to break through the cyclohexane layer.
i wouldn't exactly call this an improvement.
liquid phosphorous. i wouldn't have expected that beneath a layer of cyclohexane.
you might think about recommending seat belts when we get home.
it's just a little bad weather.
we've got sensors.
level off. go to long range scans.
i'm detecting two vessels bearing one one nine mark seven.
put it up.
impulse and warp engines.
what kind of weapons?
we're too far away.
"sir, i'm picking up something at three forty two mark twelve. it's a lot bigger."
all sensors. get whatever you can. go tighter. bio-signs?
"over three thousand, but i can't isolate a klingon. if there is one."
"that was a particle weapon, sir."
"bridge, we're taking"
damage down here. what's going on?
just a little
trouble with the bad guys.
i suggest we return to the phosphorous layer.
take us up.
captain.
what've you got?
it appears to be an aggregate structure comprised of hundreds of vessels. they're held in place by an interlocking system of magnetic seals.
"there, right there. these bio-readings are not suliban."
we can't be certain they're klingon.
"even if it is klaang, we'd have a tough time getting him out of there"
we could always try the transporting device.
we've risked too much to bring him back inside out. would the grappler work in a liquid atmosphere?
i believe so.
"bring it online. one more time, mister mayweather."
the ventral plating's down!
hold your position.
the lead ship's closing. seven thousand metres. six thousand.
we should ascend.
hold your position.
one thousand metres. forward plating's offline.
"now, mister reed."
the ship's in the launch bay.
ask me another one.
all right. what's this?
the pitch control.
"no, that's the pitch control. this is the guidance system."
pitch control. guidance system. got it.
the docking interface. how do you deploy it?
"release the inertial clamps here, here, and here then initialize the coaxial ports."
good. where's the auxiliary throttle?
hmm. it's not this one
"with all due respect to commander tucker, i'm pretty sure i could fly this thing, sir."
"i don't doubt it, but i need you here."
"there, that's it. the auxiliary throttle."
"captain, that charge contained a proximity sweep. if we remain here, they're going to locate us."
"you're gonna have to speed this up a little, travis."
"how complicated can it be? up, down, forward, reverse. we'll figure it out."
we'll be back before you know it. have mayweather plot a course for kronos.
there's a vulcan ship less than two days away. it's illogical to attempt this alone.
i was beginning to think you understood why we have to do this alone.
you'll have other opportunities to demonstrate your independence.
never put off 'til tomorrow.
you both could be killed.
"am i sensing concern? last time i checked, that was considered an emotion."
"if anything happens to either of you, the vulcan high command will hold me responsible."
come in. you finished?
sir.
"this should reverse the polarity of any mag-lock within a hundred metres. once you've set the sequence, you'll have five seconds. one more thing."
ah. our new weapons.
"they're called phase pistols. they have two settings, stun and kill. it would be best not to confuse them."
time to go. the ship is yours.
what's that?
travis said not to worry about that panel.
that's reassuring.
hold on.
that one was a lot closer.
"if we change our position, they'll have to start from scratch."
"if we change our position, the captain will have no way of finding us."
i think we're there.
bring the docking interface online. the coaxial ports.
open.
let's go.
where is it? it was right here.
"bank starboard, ninety degrees."
there you are.
that's the upper support radius. drop down right below it. start a counter clockwise sweep. a little more. a little more.  right there.
stun seems to work.
grab on to something.
"this is ridiculous! if we don't move the ship, captain archer won't have anything to look for when he gets back."
we're going to need that ear of yours. move us away five kilometres.
in what direction?
any direction.
this is going be easier than i thought. it's okay. we're getting you off this thing.
i really don't want to have to carry you out of here. you okay? i think he gets the idea. give him a hand.
qu'taw bob.
be quiet.
"you tell him, big guy."
give me the box.
thanks.
get to the ship. i'll be right behind you.
captain?
"it worked, trip."
where are you?
still on the central core. get klaang back to enterprise.
"what about you, sir?"
get him to the ship. you can come back for me.
"it's going to be hard to isolate your biosigns, so stay as far away from the suliban."
as you can.
"believe me, i'll try."
raq'o jadich!
"i don't particularly like the way you smell, either."
majqa!
"i don't get it, this is right where they're supposed to be."
the charges are getting closer again.
"another five kilometres, lieutenant."
"at this rate, the captain'll never find us."
"wait a minute, i think i've got something."
amplify it.
it's commander tucker.
all i hear is noise.
it's just a narrow notch in the mid-range. he says he's about to ignite his thruster exhaust.
"coordinates, one fifty eight mark one three."
laid in.
"ahead, fifty kph.  shaya tonat."
you're welcome.
"two kilometres, dead ahead."
initiate docking procedures.
"i'm only picking up two bio-signs. one klingon, one human."
turn this ship around. now.
our mission is to return the klingon to his homeworld. another rescue attempt could jeopardize that mission.
the captain specifically told us to come back for him.
"as commanding officer, it's my job to interpret the captain's orders."
i just told you his orders. what's there to interpret?
captain archer may very well have told you to return for him later because he knew how stubborn you can be.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
you might've risked klaang's life in a foolish attempt to swing back and rescue the captain.
i can't believe this!
the situation must be analysed logically.
i don't remember the captain analyzing anything when he went back for you on that roof.
that is a specious analogy.
is it.
you're wasting your time. klaang knows nothing. it would be unwise to discharge that weapon in this room.
what is this room? what goes on in here?
"you're very curious, jon. may i call you jon?"
am i supposed to be impressed that you know my name?
i've learned a great deal about you. even more than you know.
"well, i guess you have me at a disadvantage. so why don't you drop this invisible man routine and let me see who i'm talking to?"
hull plating's been re-polarised.
"stand by impulse engines. mister tucker, status."
the auto-sequencer's online but annular confinement's still off by two microns.
that should suffice.
easy for you to say.
"if the suliban have re-established their defences, we'll have no other option."
"you wouldn't have come looking for klaang if sarin had told you what she knew. that means you're no threat to me jon, but i do need you to leave this room.  now."
"this chameleon thing is pretty fancy. was it payment for pitting the klingons against each other, or a trophy from your temporal cold war."
i was going to let you go.
really? then you obviously don't know as much about me as you thought you did.
on the contrary. i could've told you what day you were going to die but i suppose that's about to change.
what's the matter? no genetic tricks to keep you from getting knocked on your butt?
what you call tricks we call progress. are you aware that your genome is almost identical to that of an ape? the suliban don't share humanity's patience with natural selection.
"so to speed things up a little, you struck a deal with the devil."
we have four more coming up off starboard.
"can we dock, ensign?"
these aren't ideal conditions.
"mister tucker, we're going to plan b."
now!
"bridge, we've got him! sorry, captain. we had no other choice."
malja'gor.
wo'migh oagh! q'ala.
something about disgracing the empire. he says he's ready to die.
pog!
chugdah hegh. volcha va.
i'll take that as a thank you.
i don't think they have a word for thank you.
what did he say?
you don't want to know.
come in. i've just gotten a response to the message i sent to admiral forrest. he enjoyed telling the vulcan high command about the suliban we ran into. it isn't every day he gets to be the one dispensing information. i wanted you both to hear starfleet's orders before i inform the crew.
orders?
your people are sending a transport to pick you up.
i was under the impression that enterprise would be taking me back to earth.
it would be a little out of our way. admiral forrest sees no reason why we shouldn't keep going.
son of a bitch.
i have a feeling doctor phlox won't mind staying around for a while. he's developing a fondness for the human endocrine system.
i'll get double shifts on the repair work.
i think that outer hull's going to need a little patching up. let's hope that's the last time somebody takes a shot at us.
let's hope.
"t'pol, would you stick around for a minute? ever since i can remember, i've seen vulcans as an obstacle, always keeping us from standing on our own two feet."
i understand.
"no, i don't think you do. if i'm going to pull this off, there are a few things i have to leave behind. things like preconceptions, holding grudges. this mission would've failed without your help."
i won't dispute that.
"i was thinking. a vulcan science officer could come in handy, but if i asked you to stay it might look like i wasn't ready to do this on my own."
perhaps you should add pride to your list.
perhaps i should.
it might be best if i were to contact my superiors and make the request myself. with your permission.
permission granted.
i hope nobody is in a big hurry to get home. starfleet seems to think that we're ready to begin our mission. i understand there's an inhabited planet a few light years from here.
"we've detected it, sir. sensors show a nitrogen sulfide atmosphere."
probably not humanoids?
that's what we're here to find out. prepare to break orbit and lay in a course.
"i'm reading an ion storm on that trajectory, sir. should i go around it?"
"we can't be afraid of the wind, ensign. take us to warp four."
i didn't realise you spoke slug.
"wish i did. she doesn't look any better, does she."
"she? we haven't been able to determine its gender yet, if it has one."
i should have left her where i found her.
nonsense. you're on a mission of exploration. there's something to be learned from every lifeform.
she wasn't meant to be in this environment.
i promise to do my best to keep it alive.
he's going to make you all better.
actually i was thinking more about my pyrithian bat. he won't eat anything once it's dead.
we've routed some more power to sickbay. let me know if it's enough.
this should do fine.
how's sluggo?
doctor phlox thinks this argon lamp should help. she's barely moved all day.
we've been out here for two weeks and the only first contact we've made is with a dying worm.
come in.
scans of the sectors ahead.
shush. hear that?
hear what?
"a squeak. something's squeaking. i think it's coming from under the deck plating, but every time i get close to it, it stops. if i can't isolate it i'm going to have to tear the whole flooring up."
that would be unfortunate. the scans of the sectors ahead indicate little chance of finding inhabited planets.
how about the vulcan star charts?
we have limited data on the course starfleet has assigned you.
"there are thousands of star systems along this path. there must have been something that piqued your people's interest. a sentient species, a trinary star cluster."
we don't select our destinations by what piques our interest.
vulcans always need a logical and pragmatic reason.
"my people don't share your enthusiasm for exploration.  space is vast, captain."
i'm sure you're aware that only one out of every forty three thousand planets supports intelligent life.
"i took exobiology, i know the statistics, but we're travelling at warp five. there's got to be someone out here. come in."
i'm sorry.
i'll leave you to your exploring.
trip tells me that sluggo's not faring too well.
"no, sir, but the doctor's doing the best he can. sir, my quarters are on e deck, starboard section five."
yes.
"the stars are going the wrong way, sir."
wrong way?
"on both my training tours, i had port side quarters. i'm having trouble sleeping."
because you're on the
"the wrong side of the ship, yes, sir. i spoke with ensign porter. he said he's be willing to switch, with your permission."
you got it. can't have my comm. officer falling asleep on the bridge.
"i appreciate it, captain."
"is there something else, hoshi?"
"no, sir. thank you."
ready.
fore and aft target scanners are aligned.
activating simulation j6. target acquired.
simulated launch.
"five seconds to impact. three, two, one."
wonderful.
we're only off by three metres.
"only three metres. three metres could mean the difference between hitting a weapons port and a warp core. instead of disabling a vessel we'd end up destroying it, and probably ourselves in the process."
we'll get it right.
all this should have been dealt with before we left earth. have they detected any inhabited planets or vessels?
not yet.
good.
i hope you don't expect everyone we run into out here to be hostile. in twenty three years i don't think my folks ran into a problem more than a half dozen times.
i don't believe you were ever out quite this far.
do you think that makes a difference?
"all i do know is until we get these targeting scanners working properly, the further we are from everyone else, the better."
seems like everybody else on board is itching for a first contact.
how's it going?
"not well, sir. we've corrected the problem but we're still off by point oh two percent. it's unacceptable."
are you sure it's not the simulations that are off?
there's only one way to find out.
how long would it take to arm a few torpedoes?
"moments, sir."
archer to t'pol.
"yes, sir."
prepare to drop out of warp. it's time for a little target practice.
acknowledged.
"thank you, captain."
"come on, travis. we've got to find mister reed something to blow up."
"try to locate an asteroid field, a comet. just do it quickly, i want to get back to warp."
"yes, sir. we made a trip once from livinius to belarn prime. two and a half light years. nearly nine months without running into a soul. there were five kids on board. we were at each others throats within a matter of weeks. first officer and my mother came up with the idea to teach us how to play geography. you know, you say amazon river, which ends in an r. i say rhode island."
which ends in a d. dralax.
"x, x."
now there's always
"don't tell me, i know an x. xanadu."
that's not a real place.
doesn't matter.
of course it matters.
"well, you used an alien planet, dralax."
i thought you said this game kept you from arguing.
load another one. let's try again.
rotate the targeting axis by point five microns.
point five microns.
mister reed.
"if i refocus the infrared scanner, i might be able to compensate."
how long will that take?
the better part of a day.
"resume course, ensign."
sir.
we're not going to sit on our butt for twenty four hours. make your modifications. we'll run another test first chance we get.
anyone sitting here?
"no. please, sit down, sit down."
sluggo any better?
"i'm afraid not. try the potatoes, they're delicious."
resequenced protein.
"yes. the flavour's remarkable. on my homeworld, people would never think of speaking during a meal. considered a waste of time. it's taken me a while, but i've grown quite attached to it."
wasting time seems to be all we've been doing. starting to get a little antsy.
antsy?
restless. we've been on the move for two weeks and haven't seen a damn thing.
every moment's been an adventure for me. humans are so unpredictable. have you seen the quantities of food crewman namod consumes?
not really.
have you smelled ensign socorro after she exercises? she gives off a fragrance not unlike the adrenal gland of a nausicaan. and crewmen bennett and haynem over there. do you see them?
"if i'm not mistaken, they are preparing to mate. do you think they might let me watch?"
it's good to see you're enjoying yourself.
bridge to captain archer.
how big is it?
approximately ninety two metres in length.
doesn't seem to be moving very fast.
it's not moving at all.
that's odd. where's the nearest star system?
almost three light years away.
they could be running some kind of a deep space experiment. maybe we should go have a look.
if you insist on allowing your curiosity to dictate your actions.
we insist.
"range, five thousand kilometres."
the vessel's hull is comprised of tritanium and disilicon polymers.
"i'm not getting anything on their propulsion system, but it may be offline. something, isn't it."
"if they have weapons, they're not charged."
any comm. activity?
"no, sir."
"run this through the translation matrix. my name is jonathan archer. i'm captain of the starship enterprise. we're on a mission of peaceful exploration. oh, we come from the planet earth. we're sending you a pulsar grid that should help you locate our star system. did you rotate the frequencies?"
"i'll try it again. no response, sir."
"captain, mind if i push in on the venting ports around that hatch?"
go ahead.
are those venting ports or hull breaches?
"bring us in a little closer, travis. let's get a look at the other side. those look like scorch marks."
the residue indicates oxidation and thermal shock effects. it could be the result of a high yield particle impact.
you mean weapons.
possibly.
are we close enough to scan for biosigns?
"yes, but scanning their ship's interior might be seen as a violation of privacy."
anything?
"if there is anyone home, you can bet they know we're out here."
then why haven't they responded.
not everyone chooses to answer the door when they hear a knock. it would be best to resume our previous course.
see if you can find another hatch. diameter?
point nine metres.
scan for biosigns.
there are a number of lifeforms aboard.
humanoid?
their cellular activity is below the threshold of your sensors.
maybe they're in trouble. sick or something.
maybe they're not interested in visitors.
"mister reed, how long to prep a shuttle?"
half an hour.
there are a number of protocols we haven't tried.
get started.
"she may have a point, captain. i could try hailing them on theta-band frequencies."
"suit up, ensign."
"me, sir?"
the ship is yours.
"is there a problem, commander?"
i want to go with you.
i'm bringing a translator and a security officer. why would i need an engineer?
"what makes you think you can open the hatch, or turn the light on for that matter."
"we've got beacons, trip."
"that ship could have a lot of decks. you might need someone to help you figure out the turbolifts. okay, i've got a better reason why you need an engineer. because your engineer signed onto this mission of exploration so he could do a little exploring. he didn't sign on to sit in engineering while you three get to break into that ship."
we're not breaking in. we're just going to see if everything's okay.
you're chomping at the bit to find out what's in there. why should i be any different?
"we just got out here, trip. there's going to be plenty of time to go exploring. right now i need you on enterprise, down with your engine. this ship's a little young to be without her chief engineer."
"when i used to dream about this mission, the last thing i envisioned was having a vulcan on board who continuously sucked the air out of the room. well, she's right. whoever's on that ship might no want us nosing around. but i can't assume that's the case, can i? maybe they could use our help. computer, pause.  hey, you know that you and cheddar don't get along.  resume personal log. before we left, admiral forrest said we'd be making history with every light year, but we're not going to do that sitting on our hands. computer pause. come in. ensign."
"sorry to bother you, sir."
it's not a problem. cheese?
"no, thank you."
everything work out all right?
sir?
with the swapping quarters.
"yes, that's fine, thank you. i was thinking, captain, i might be a lot more helpful to you if i stay here and keep an open comm. link. that way i'll have immediate access to the linguistic database."
can't you tie your universal translator into the database through the comm?
it's not the same. the lag time is tripled.
"well, i'd rather wait a few seconds if it means having you on site. for all we know, the ut won't work. you'll be our only back-up. anyway, it should be exciting. half the crew would give their eye teeth to be going over there. what's wrong?"
the environmental suits. they make me a little claustrophobic.
claustrophobic. and you took a job on a spaceship?
"you talked me into it, remember."
i don't recall reading about any problems during your zero-g training.
"well, i just, i bit my lip and got through it."
well you're just going to have to bite your lip again. i need you over there.
"yes, sir."
"what is it, hoshi? is something else wrong?"
"no, i'd better get back to the launch bay."
"hang on, i'll come with you. that's the last time, porthos."
"going to war, lieutenant?"
"can't be too careful, sir."
you've seen too many science fiction movies. we just need the three phase pistols. put the rifles back.  what are you rated for?
i've been cleared on em sidearms and class three pulse rifles. i've never seen one of those.
"malcolm will check you out on it first chance he gets. don't worry, it handles pretty much like an em-33."
is this necessary?
just a precaution.
"just our luck, no release. shouldn't be a problem though. i can place micro-charges here and here."
"hold on a second, malcolm."
sorry.
"enterprise, we've got access. we're boarding the vessel."
"well, at least we know they're bipeds."
what gives you that idea?
the ladder.
"come on. nitrogen-methane atmosphere, and it's cold. minus twenty degrees."
"there's power going through here, but not much of it."
captain.
molecules look like amino acids.
blood?
these icons look like they represent frequency bands.
communications.
"if it is, it's offline. maybe that's why they didn't answer our hails."
they may have been in no condition to answer our hails.
"guys, does any of this make sense to you? anything?"
could these be power couplings?
and these could be transfer conduits. could be a schematic to their power layout.
"yeah, one diagram for each deck."
and what's this?
"that's midship. one deck below. if we're right, something down there is drawing a lot of power."
let's go see if we're right.
some sort of hydraulics.
"whatever it is, it hasn't been here very long."
"hoshi, where are you going?"
i don't think you need a translator.
stay here.
their bodies are being flushed out with some kind of fluid.
are they all?
"all dead, sir. i'm afraid so."
they're clean.
how many?
i don't know. about a dozen.
fifteen.
they're being drained of something. whoever did it went to a lot of trouble. my guess is they're coming back.
we should leave.
there are fifteen dead people over there. we can't leave.
"your reason for boarding that vessel was to provide assistance, if assistance was required. clearly, it no longer is."
you're telling me that we should just leave them there?
"what's the alternative? your intentions were admirable, captain, but nothing can be done for that crew now and if we remain here your crew could be put in jeopardy."
archer to the bridge.
"mayweather here, sir."
go to warp three. resume course.
"aye, sir."
"not long after i became a physician, there was an explosion on a cargo ship orbiting my homeworld. i was part of the first medical team to arrive. there were seventeen bodies on the bridge alone. i'd never seen that many dead people in one place before. very disturbing. you have nothing to be ashamed of."
i screamed like a twelve year old.
we're all frightened by unfamiliar things. you should be grateful that your body of experience doesn't include rooms full of corpses.
nobody else screamed.  has she been eating?
"not so far. she has been under a great deal of stress, but i'm hoping this protein concentrate whets her appetite."
i'm a translator. i didn't come out here to see corpses hanging on hooks.
it goes without saying that you're going to encounter the unexpected.
not corpses on hooks.
"have you ever considered that you might be happier back at the university, teaching? i did it for years. it was quite rewarding."
i'm an exo-linguist. i graduated second in my class. i spent three years in starfleet training. i was jonathan archer's first choice for this mission. every inhabited world we come to is going to be filled with language. some will have hundreds of them. he needs me here.
if she doesn't take these nutrients i'm afraid she won't survive.
are you sure that's what she eats?
it's close enough.
i shouldn't have brought her on board. maybe i could ask the captain to try to find a planet with an argon rich atmosphere.
it might be easier just to feed her to my bat.
she needs to get back to an environment that is more suited to her.
perhaps some place where she could teach.
what kind of pasta is this? it's great.
chef told me. i don't remember.
not too spicy for you?
it's fine.
"malcolm's anxious to run another weapons test, especially after what happened. tea?"
"no, thank you."
captain?
"sure, thanks."
i heard they were humanoid. is that right?
humanoid.
did they look anything like us?
they were in uniform.
but you didn't recognise the species.
"they were crewmen, murdered on their own ship. fifteen dead crewmen."
i detected a stellar nursery along our present course.
i saw one once through the big lens outside anchorage.
a closer view might alleviate some of the crew's tension.
"what's the matter, the tension bothering you?"
not in the least.
"must be great not to let things bother you. no remorse, no guilt. what if they were vulcans? think you would have reacted the same way?"
they weren't vulcans.
"i said, what if they were vulcans. would you have just left them there, hanging like slaughtered animals? don't you think maybe you would have taken them down, tried to figure out who they were, made some effort to contact their families?"
we don't know where they came from. it would be very difficult to locate their families.
"we didn't even try.  what about you, what if they were humans? would you just stick your tail between your legs and run, leave them there to rot? am i the only one who's having a problem with this?"
"you said it yourself, sir. whoever killed those people are probably coming back."
"so we should avoid confrontation cost, is that what you're saying? is that what you vulcans do? bury your heads in the sand and then just fly on by?"
we vulcans would have never gone on board that ship in the first place.
"you got an answer for everything, don't you."
"we have a code of behaviour, and we try to obey it."
"you may not believe this, but humans have a code of behaviour too. it took a few thousand years, but i think we're starting to get it right. i can't believe i almost ignored it."
"we've reversed course, sir. we should be back at the coordinates in five hours."
you don't have a problem with the environmental suit?
not at all.
"good. we're going to need you to examine the bodies, try to identify their species. while you're at it, it wouldn't hurt if you can figure out what's being done to them."
"i'll see what i can do, captain."
you wanted to see what's going on over there. now's your chance. i can't think of a better way to find their people than through their own comm. system. you're going to need to get it up and running.
"aye, sir."
hoshi will decipher their language and compose a message. hopefully it'll make sense.
captain.
"i'm sorry, ensign."
i'll bring a security detail.
there's no one over there who can hurt us. stay here and work on those targeting scanners. prepare to suit up at fourteen hundred hours. dismissed.
how were they killed?
"different ways. this one was given a lethal dose of chloraxine. the first three back there were shot. particle weapons, i believe. this fellow hasn't suffered as much cellular decay. he's our best candidate for a post-mortem. care to assist?"
yeah.
maybe it's a log. what do you think?
beats me. could be a laundry list or instructions on how to conquer the universe.
the grammar sounds bimodal.
their transceiver's intact. let's hope the next time we make first contact it isn't with a room full of corpses.
let's hope.  ship. ship.
just what i thought.
what?
a zymuth gland. it releases triglobulin into the blood. that's what all these tubes and pumps are about. whoever did this is trying to collect triglobulin.
what for?
"oh, for any number of reasons. to create medicines, vaccines, some species have even been known to use it as an aphrodisiac."
aphrodisiac?
it's quite a common practice. i'm surprised you're not familiar with it.
"humans used to collect the bile of black bears, grind down rhino horns, things like that, but not people."
it's worth noting that triglobulin is very similar to human lymphatic fluid.
how long before the transceiver's online?
a minute or two. i can't get enough of this. an alien spaceship sending off a message to who knows where.
"the quicker we get this done, the quicker we can get back to the ship."
it's your second away mission in two days.
"yeah, great."
i wish i had an ear for languages. the captain's going to need a translator with him a lot more often than an engineer.
"distress. two other teachers and i once took a hydro-skimmer out onto a small tributary in the amazon. you know, to see the wildlife. sloths, pink dolphins, all kinds of snakes."
wow.
"it gave me the creeps. if i didn't like being around anacondas, you can imagine how i feel about suliban or whoever butchered the crew of this ship. i'm going to ask the captain to take me home."
you serious?
i should have never left the university. i'm not suited for this.
give it a try. you'll be fine.
you weren't here yesterday. i saw those bodies and fell apart. the captain needs a translator he can count on. someone who shows a little grace under pressure. that isn't me.
you can't be sure of that.
oh yes i can. distress. distress.
kunatsila.
i think i've got it. ship in distress.
dukdum dor kunatsila.
t'pol to archer.
go ahead.
"there's a vessel approaching, captain. it's power signatures match the scans you took of those bio-pumps."
it appears that whoever killed that crew has returned.
"time to go, doc."
"trip, hoshi, docking hatch, now."
"distance, sixty thousand kilometres."
bridge to armoury.
armoury.
we have a potentially hostile vessel approaching. are you prepared to defend the ship?
that depends. how long till it gets here?
"ten minutes, maybe less."
"then the answer is most likely no. the scanners are still out of alignment. look, if you wanted me to hit a stationary dairy barn, then i could accommodate you, but not a moving"
vessel.
"do the best you can, but i need you on the bridge in five minutes."
archer to t'pol. deploy the docking arm.
arm extended.
how close are they?
eight thousand kilometres.
what kind of weapons?
our sensors can't penetrate their shielding.
have you tried hailing them?
yes.
there's been no response.
try again.
the pod's on the arm.
t'pol to archer. they're still not responding.
they're charging weapons.
they're targeting our engines.
we're almost in. stand by to jump to warp.
doors.
archer to the bridge. it doesn't feel like we've gone to warp.
our port nacelle has been damaged.
have malcolm arm the torpedoes.
report.
"we're dead in the water, sir."
they seem to have stopped firing. they're closing on our position.
malcolm?
"both forward tubes loaded and ready, sir."
stand by starboard tube.
"yes, sir."
fire.
stand by port tube.
ready.
fire.
"trip, warp status?"
the nacelle's been completely depolarised. i'm afraid we're stuck here for a while.
what was that?
"a sub-molecular bio-scan. you've been probed, ensign. we've all been probed. they have no doubt discovered that your lymphatic systems contain some useful compounds."
get to the armoury. start distributing hand weapons.  post security teams at level
"sir, another vessel just dropped out of warp."
they're on an intercept course.
let's see it.
they're hailing us.
put it up.
captain?
he's from the same species as the murdered crew.  they must have picked up your distress call. tell him the ship above us killed the crew of the cargo vessel. they're about to do the same to us.
"i told him what you said, sir, but i doubt it made any sense."
what do you mean?
this isn't exactly spanish we're dealing with here. i'd be lucky if i'm getting half the vocabulary right.
they've locked onto us with some kind of stabilising beam.
use the impulse engines. get us the hell out of here.
"i can't, sir. their beam's disrupting all our propulsion systems."
"it seems he got the part about killing the cargo ship crew but he believes we did it, sir. at least i think he does."
tell him we sent the distress call. why would we kill his people and then do that?
"i think i understood this one. he says the distress call came from his ship, not ours."
we needed their frequencies. going there was the only way to find them.
something about dna scans. he wants to know why we were there two years ago.
two years ago?
"he probably means two days, sir. the phonetic processor's still having trouble locking on. i'm not certain, but i don't think he's going to help us."
they're fifty metres above us. forty nine.
"the pumps. tell them to run scans on the bio-pumps that are hooked up to the corpses. they'll see they're not our technology. have them compare the power signatures to the ship that's about to land on our roof. where are they, malcolm?"
they've stopped at about ten metres.
"i'm having trouble with the word pump, sir. i've got the processor searching for synonyms. the translator's not making a whole lot of sense to him, sir. he's getting frustrated. i think he's running out of patience, captain."
then forget the translator. do it yourself.
do what myself?
talk to him.
"that's impossible, sir. i haven't even learned their basic conjugations."
"talk to him, hoshi. it doesn't have to be perfect."
"you don't understand. i don't even know how to say pump. i'll get it all wrong, it'll just make things worse."
things can't get much worse.
sir.
"captain, they've started drilling into the hull."
"hoshi, hoshi, i need you to do this. we all do. that's why you're here."
uta doi ura.
again.
uta lora ista. urasta mistavor.
what'd he say? ensign.
they're targeting the vessel above us.
we've got impulse back.
move us away.
"captain, i may be wrong, but i think i've got the scanners aligned. permission to launch a torpedo."
granted.
"nice of them to wait until we got clear. all stop.  i think we may have just made a friend, thanks to you."
"this isn't exactly like the place you came from, but it's close enough. it's not that hard to adapt. you're going to do just fine here."
how can you eat that stuff?
it's healthier than that.
at least this tastes like something.
i guess it just takes a more discriminating palate to appreciate vulcan cuisine. do you know there are over five thousand subspecies of termites on loracus prime?
i thought we were headed for a nebula.
anybody hear about this?
not a word.
i wonder if somebody lives there?
there's a lot of plant life. it might be an oxygen atmosphere.
"what do you think, first contact?"
i don't see any cities or agriculture.
maybe they live underground or in the water.
is that snow on those mountains?
you'd think the captain would make an announcement or something.
"well, call him."
t'pol.
"seventeen percent oxygen, eighty one percent nitrogen."
sounds like home.
any people?
"the planet supports a diverse ecology, but there are no signs of humanoid life."
"still, someone may have a claim on it. we don't want to go waltzing into their back yard. scan for marker buoys, beacons, man-made satellites."
"none in range, sir. looks like no one's planted a flag just yet."
"prep a shuttlepod, mister tucker.  i like the looks of the northern continent. see if you can find a good place to set down."
"yes, sir."
captain. there are a number of protocols you may want to consider.
protocols.
"vulcan ships would begin by sending automated probes down to collect more detailed scans. if the planet proved to be minshara-class, we would then conduct a geophysical survey from orbit."
minshara-class?
suitable for humanoid life.
how long would all that take?
six or seven days.
you expect us to sit up here for a week while probes have all the fun?
this planet has been here a long time. it will still be here in seven days.
"i understand that you have a more cautious approach, but we didn't come out here to tip-toe around.  get the pod ready."
i'd like you to put together the survey team. i assume that's not a violation of protocol?
thanks.
i tried some plomeek broth this morning. it was very good. vulcan food is interesting.
did you sterilise the sample containers?
yes. thanks for choosing me for this mission.
you were selected because your specialty is entomology. this planet has a diverse insect population.
great.
you'd have better luck making friends with a housefly.
i know.
wow.
worth every light year.
set us down just east of those hills.
aye sir.
where no dog has gone before.
i almost forgot what fresh air smells like.
"the atmosphere contains trace elements of nitrogen dioxide, chloromethane."
put that thing away. take a minute to enjoy yourself. the sky ever get this blue on vulcan?
occasionally.
we're walking on an alien world light years from earth or vulcan. doesn't that impress you?
i've been to thirty six minshara class planets. this experience is only marginally different.
perfect. hold it right there.
smile. be sure to get a copy of that to the vulcan high command.
"you have your assignments. we'll rendezvous here at nineteen hundred hours, unless the captain wants us to pose for more pictures."
i'm afraid my log entry isn't going to do this justice.
a cabin in these woods would be nice.
"three weeks in deep space, you're ready to jump ship?"
"don't worry, i'm not going anywhere. you guys would be lost without me."
"it's beautiful all right, but i couldn't call a place home unless it came with a pair of warp nacelles."
boomers.
archer.
"is there a problem, captain?"
"no, no problem."
why?
we were scheduled to rendezvous fifteen minutes ago.
"sorry, we lost track of time. we'll be right there."
we've identified several nocturnal marsupials. i'd like to keep crewmen cutler and novakovich with me overnight to study them.
i'm glad to see you're getting into the spirit of things. pick you up in the morning.
"captain, if it's all right with you, travis and i'd like to stay as well."
we would?
when was the last time you slept under the stars? there's plenty of camping gear in the pod.
"this isn't shore leave, this is a research mission."
"why can't it be a little bit of both? research isn't the only reason we're out here. pitch your tent, commander."
"thanks, captain.  don't worry, we'll keep out of your hair."
"keep in mind those cargo vessels weren't equipped for rescue operations, so the captain wasn't sure what to do when he picked up the distress call. but it wasn't a ship that sent the signal. it was a life-pod from one of the old y-500-class freighters."
those were retired decades ago.
"exactly. the pod had been drifting in space for sixty three years. bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. human. the assistant engineer, george webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assigned to open it. took him over an hour to cut through the hull. he said the metal felt strange, cold to the touch."
of course it was cold. it was floating in space for sixty years.
"he could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when he finally got it open the pod was empty. no body, nothing. a few days later, webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew, muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. then one day he locked himself in engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. he almost destroyed the ship. then he sealed himself in a life pod and ejected it."
i assume the captain went after him.
"the reactors were too badly damaged. some people say it was an alien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of a dead crewman. i never knew what to believe, but webb is still out there, drifting. when the subspace noise is real low, some comm. officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. beep, beep."
it's highly doubtful that a distress beacon could function continuously for sixty three years.
let me guess. no ghost stories on vulcan.
"that's it, to the left of that trinary cluster."
what?
our sun.
are you sure?
"yeah, positive. just another speck of light no different than any other."
when i was a kid i'd go camping with my buddies. we'd spend half the night looking up at the stars wondering what our own sun would look like from this far away.
now you know.
are you okay?
"headache. if it's all right with you, i'd like to lie down for a while before we get back to work."
certainly.
has anyone heard the one about the haunted comet?
wait a minute. you notice something? fireflies are gone.
"nice going, travis, you scared off the bugs."
maybe it's the ghost of george webb.
looks like we might have ourselves a little weather.
a front is approaching from the south west.
it must be gusting at eighty kph.
this is nothing compared to a hurricane coming up through the florida keys.
try flying through an ion storm at warp two.
did you hear that?
what?
someone's out there.
it's the wind.
ow! son of a bitch!
what is it?
there's something in my bag.
give me your boot.
what for?
so i can squash it.
are we allowed to squash alien life forms?
if they're inside your sleeping bag.
"there it is, wait a minute. where'd you put the phase pistols?"
you wanna shoot a bug?
i'm just going to stun it.
t'pol to tucker.
go ahead.
"is there a problem, commander?"
"oh no, just an eight inch scorpion thing inside our tent."
do you require assistance?
i think i've got it under control.
"no not there, it's over there."
"t'pol, you said you found a cave this afternoon."
less than half a kilometre from here.
i think we're going to need it.
come in.
nice catch. you'd make a good two metre man. too bad we don't have a pool on board.
a shame. a wind storm's moving across the northern continent. it looks like a nasty one.
survey team?
"they've taken shelter, but i'd recommend pulling them out. i've got a shuttlepod on standby."
archer to t'pol.
"yes, captain."
what's your status?
we've relocated into a cavern.
mister reed thinks we should come down and get you.
a landing under these circumstances might be difficult. we'll be protected until the winds diminish.
we'll keep an eye on the storm. let us know if you need anything.
understood.
"keep the pod on standby, just in case."
"aye, sir."
who's got the food packs?
nope.
travis?
"not me, sir."
we must have left them at the campsite.
i'll go.
be careful.
trip? hello?
was anybody outside just now?
"just you, why?"
there's someone else out there.
what?
near the campsite.
i think we've had enough ghost stories for one night.
it's no story.
"we've scanned the planet, it's uninhabited."
"i'm telling you, i saw three people."
three? what did they look like?
it was too dark.
sub-commander?
"other than ourselves, there are no humanoid life forms here."
there could be something wrong with your scanner.
it's functioning perfectly. perhaps you imagined seeing them.
they looked pretty real to me.
ethan?
there's someone back there. i heard voices. are you going to tell me i'm imagining things too? it's not safe here.
we don't know that. they could be friendly.
then why are they hiding? why don't they come out and say hello? we should leave.
"where do you propose we go, back out into the storm?"
it's better than being trapped in here.
"slow down, crewman. that's an order."
ethan!
stay here.
travis.
i'll be back shortly.
where are you going?
"if there's someone back there, i intend to find them."
ethan!
travis! i saw one.
it came right out of that rock like it was a part of it.
that could explain why they're not showing up on our scanners.
it's too dangerous. we should go back.
who were they?
excuse me?
"well, who were you talking to?"
talking to? there's no one here.
we've lost novakovich and we're apparently not alone. there's some kind of lifeform down here.
can you make it back to the cavern?
"we're heading there now, sir."
the captain's on his way. we're getting out of here.
"not a moment too soon. from what i saw, these things live inside the rock."
"i performed a geological analysis. the rocks are composed of limestone and cormalite, nothing more."
"she's lying, commander. i saw her talking to them."
crewman?
in there. there were two of them.
she's mistaken.
"no, i'm not. why won't you tell us what's going on? what do they want?"
i've got a fix. twenty kilometres northeast.
"archer to novakovich. ethan, respond."
who's there? who is that?
this is captain archer. we're attempting to land. i want you to get back to the cavern.
go to hell!
i have no reason to deceive you.
"neither does she. you keep claiming these creatures don't exist, but the rest of us have all seen them. that's a little strange, don't you think?"
"i can't explain what you've seen, but i assure you i didn't speak to anyone."
"i'd like to believe you, but you vulcans don't exactly have a spotless track record when it comes to being honest with us."
your point?
you've held things back before. you might be doing it again.  tucker here.
"we're closing in on your position, trip. there's a clearing a hundred metres from the cave entrance. get to it."
i'm reading them. two kilometres due west.
"i'm taking us down. there's a lot of wind shear near the surface. activate the auxiliary landing thrusters. altitude seventy metres, forty metres."
i'll have to try a different vector.
starboard.
i see it.
thruster four's down. we're leaking plasma coolant.
almost there.
"sir, we can't safely land in this wind with a thruster out."
archer to tucker.
"captain, aren't you forgetting something?"
we're going to have to wait
until the wind dies down. try to manage till then.
"we'll do our best, sir."
if you run across
"any more of these aliens, try to make contact."
see what you can find out about them.
understood.
you okay?
never better.
you heard the captain. he wants to know about your friends. what are you going to tell him? what are you going to tell him?
this is pointless.
"is it? we're stuck down here for god knows how long with a bunch of rock people who, for all we know, are staring at us from these walls right now. not to mention a crewman out there who probably won't last the night. now if we're going to get through this, i need to know what the hell's going on. you beginning to see my point?"
"i share your concern for crewman novakovich, but as i told you"
you couldn't care less about him or any of the rest of us. that would require some of those useless human emotions.
your emotions are beginning to affect your judgment. you're becoming irrational.
you've never seen me irrational.
"sir. i hate to add to our problems, but we're running low on water."
great. we'll have to conserve what's left.
that won't be necessary.
i detected water about sixty metres in that direction.
how do we know you're not going in there to talk to your friends?
join me if you'd like.
"it could be a trap, commander."
i can survive without water for several days. can you?
sit down.
you heard me.
how's he doing?
not good. his biosigns are very erratic.
try him again.
enterprise to novakovich.
can you hear me? ethan.
"mister reed, can you get a lock on him?"
"yes, sir."
looks like our only choice.
understood. stand by.
"there's a problem, sir. there are contaminants in the matter stream. the phase discriminator can't seem to isolate the debris."
reed to sickbay. medical emergency.
what are you doing?
working.
on what.
scans i took this afternoon.
find anything you want to tell me about?
there's nothing of scientific interest on this planet. our mission here was a waste of time.
that's what you'd like us to think. let me see that thing.
the readings are in vulcan. you won't understand them.
"no, but hoshi would. this could be evidence."
of what?
your little conspiracy.
i was wrong. there is something of interest here. i've learned a great deal about human behaviour.
oh?
"under stress, you become volatile. you're a far more dangerous species than i previously believed."
your people have been telling us that kind of crap for a hundred years. looks like you finally found a way to put us back in our cage.
sir?
"imagine the news back home, travis. enterprise crew found dead. six weeks into their historic voyage, the bodies of all eighty two crewmembers were located on an uninhabited world. a vulcan ship made the unfortunate discovery. cause of death remains a mystery. but what the vulcans won't say is they know exactly who attacked us. in fact, they arranged the whole thing. they lured us down here so they could sabotage our mission."
"you were the one who found these caves, and it was your idea to stay overnight."
i didn't ask you or mister tucker to join us.
"we know you're here. why don't you show yourselves? you're not afraid of us, are you?"
"there's no one there, commander."
maybe you're waiting for the others to come down so you can kill us all at once. did you see that?
all i see is a delusional engineer.
"sounds like you're getting a little volatile yourself, sub-commander. i thought you had your emotions all locked up. having a little problem, are you?"
commander! there!
you think i'm going to wait around here for you to slaughter us? i'll blow this whole cave apart if i have to. i know you hear me!
human skin is a resilient organ. these wounds should heal nicely.
can i talk to him?
"yes, but i doubt he'll make much sense. have you ever heard of tropolisine."
no.
it's a psychotropic compound known for its hallucinogenic effects. this crewman's bloodstream is filled with it.
"if it was down on the planet, why didn't our sensors pick it up?"
"normally, it's found in certain flowering plants. perhaps your sensors weren't calibrated to detect it."
or perhaps it wasn't there until that damn wind started.
how long will the effects last?
"now that he's back on enterprise, he should be alright in three or four hours."
will this tro-
tropolisine.
will it affect t'pol as well?
"there's no way to know. it might affect her to a lesser degree, or a greater degree."
archer to t'pol.
"yes, captain."
we have novakovich.
and i have a phase pistol pointed at my head.
what?
my suspicions were
"right on the nose, captain. our little vulcan here is"
not what she appears to be. never was.
what are you talking about?
there's some kind of
"creatures down here. they hide inside solid rock. travis and i have both seen them. cutler saw two of them talking to t'pol. they're up to something but of course, she denies it."
listen to me. you've all been exposed to a psychotropic compound. it causes heightened anxiety
hallucinations.
are you telling me those creatures aren't real?
the compound comes from the pollen of a flower. we think it was blown down from the mountains when the wind started. the doctor's run tests on novakovich. he thinks he's going to be okay in a few hours. so if you can get
"as deep as you can into the caves, your symptoms should dissipate around the same times."
"we didn't imagine this, captain."
you dealt with simulations very close to this in starfleet training. you're familiar with mind-altering agents. we'll be down to get you as soon as the winds let up.
"you're not down here, captain."
you don't understand what's going on.
"put your weapon down, trip. that's an order."
t'pol?
"he's lowered his phase pistol, sir."
have you been affected?
"yes, but only slightly."
try to hold on. archer out.
get to the bridge. i want a weather report.
travis.  you still with me? i need you on your feet. those things could come back at any time. listen to me. i'm giving you an order.
"what's wrong? ensign?  what'd you do to him? i can see why you get along so well with them, sneaking around in the shadows. that's second nature to you vulcans, isn't it."
"i have no idea what you just said, but it didn't sound very nice. you're making a mistake working with her. she'll stab you in the back first chance she gets. tell you what. come out and we'll settle this peacefully. whatever she told you about humans, it's not true. you can see for yourself. say something!"
"what are you doing her? yes, sir."
"i know, i know, but they're not giving me much choice. i've got to protect my crew. i understand, mister velik, but i can't do that."
they're trying to kill us.
nice try.
"the centre of the storm's already passed over them, but the system spans some five hundred kilometres. we won't be able to land a shuttlepod before dawn."
when's that?
nine hours.
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead.
please report to sickbay immediately. it's urgent.
i thought you said he was going to be fine.
"i did, but each tropolisine atom contains a stray neutron. when it started to break down in his bloodstream it released an undetectable toxin. i've injected him with inoprovalene but i think it may be too late. if i'd run a submolecular scan i might have anticipated the complication, but there was no reason to. at least, there didn't seem to be. i can't tell you how sorry i am, captain."
what about the others?
they spent less time exposed.
"i've got four people down on the surface, doctor. i need to know if they're going to be dead when we get there in the morning."
"stay awake, travis. i can't afford to have you going out on me."
"i'm trying, sir."
"cutler, you okay?  if you're waiting for me to pass out, you're wasting your time. you might as well have your friends come out now, do whatever they're going to do."
t'pol.
how are you doing?
who's that?
"it's the captain, trip. are you all right?"
"he's irrational, sir. mayweather and cutler are nearly unconscious."
both of you listen to me very carefully. novakovich may be dying.
"turns out the pollen contains some kind of toxin our sensors hadn't detected. he's responding to medication, but his odds of recovery would be a hell of a lot better if we'd treated him sooner. the doctor and malcolm are synthesizing ampoules of inoprovalene. we're going to have to use the transporter to get it to you, but it's imperative that you inoculate yourselves as soon as possible. do you understand what i'm saying?"
"taking an injection isn't going to change a damn thing, don't you see that? they're planning something, captain. first us, then all of you."
"what's going on, hoshi?"
"she says trip's going to kill her, and i don't think she's imagining it."
say one more word of that gibberish and i'm going to split you in two.
"trip, listen to me."
the pollen's affecting her too. think about it. you've heard of people suffering from dementia who revert to their native language.
she can't help it.
"the only thing that's affecting her are those rock people. if i can stop her now, i can save enterprise."
"trip, how long have we known each other?"
what's that got to do with anything?
remember when your ev pack froze up on titan during the omega training mission? you got nitrogen narcosis. you started to try to take off your helmet. you remember what i'm talking about?
what's your point!
i ordered you to keep your helmet on.
"you were delirious, thought you were going to die, but you obeyed that order because you trusted me."
i'm asking you to trust me now.
"take the injection, then we'll deal with these rock people."
"too late, captain. i'm not going to die with a hypospray in my hand."
trip!
no! it's not going to happen.
all right.
"forget the medicine. i think it's time i explain what's really going on, but just stand by for a minute. i need malcolm to target your position."
then i'll give you your orders.
archer to phlox. the sooner
the better.
understood.
how close can you get it?
i think i can safely place it two metres inside the mouth of the cave.
good.
captain? hello? i'm waiting for that order
but i can't wait much longer.
"all right, trip. this is a major breach of security, but i'm going to have to trust you."
go ahead.
starfleet sent us here to make contact with a silicon-based life form. t'pol was the only person granted clearance
to speak with them. seems they've met vulcans before.
why couldn't you tell me that?
"when a mission's classified top secret, i don't ask why."
"if it was so top secret, then why'd you let us all come down to the surface? let us spend the night?"
the winds.
"we never thought the storm would drive you into the caves. that's where these rock people live. they didn't want anybody in there except for t'pol, so they're not too happy right now. i'm sure you can understand that."
"they've even threatened to destroy enterprise. now, t'pol needs to explain to them why you're all there, but she's not going to have much credibility with you pointing a phase pistol at her."
"if they agree to listen to her, you'll need to lower your weapon. if they don't, i'm going to have malcolm destroy the cavern. sacrificing four more crewmen is a small price to pay to save enterprise."
i understand.
"now, i'm going to ask hoshi to tell t'pol everything i just told you in vulcan."
you got a problem with that?
go ahead.
ensign.
"she says play-acting isn't exactly a vulcan tradition, but she'll do her best."
hope she knows the difference between stun and kill.
"they've agreed to talk to her, trip, so lower your weapon"
and act real friendly.
no.
"you didn't shoot me last night, did you?"
i'm afraid i did.
i was hoping it was all just a bad dream.
are they gone?
they were never here.
what?
there were no rock people. you were all hallucinating.
the pollen?
yes.
then what about that speech you gave to the wall?
"the captain felt that if i played along, it might help to persuade you to lower your weapon. you'd grown increasingly illogical and violent. something about splitting me in two."
"a pretty good performance. look, i know i kind of shot my mouth off last night."
you were under the influence of the pollen. we all were.
challenge you preconceptions or they'll challenge you.
commander?
"that's something mister velik used to say. tenth grade biology class. he was a vulcan scientist (who came to teach us about life on other worlds. i'd never seen a vulcan before, not up close. he scared the hell out of me."
perhaps it's not too late to follow his advice.
"ow, i must have twisted up my neck. how's novakovich? do we know?"
the captain says he's going to be fine.
archer to the bridge.
"lieutenant reed, sir."
what the hell's going on?
we are having a little trouble with the gravity plating on e deck. i hope it hasn't caused you
any inconvenience.
"oh, no, no, no, not at all. any idea when you might get it back online?"
"commander tucker says it should be any minute now, sir."
thank you.
not a very adventurous breakfast.
plomeek broth is a traditional morning meal on vulcan.
"ah, but you're not on vulcan. you should try these blueberry pancakes. they're quite delicious."
i sampled human food on several occasions. it didn't agree with me.
give it some time. the vulcan digestive tract is highly adaptable.
i prefer to eat the foods i'm accustomed to.
"there's an old saying. when in fellebis, do as the fellebians do."
it's difficult enough having to smell all this. eating it is out of the question.
"water, carbonated."
now that's adventurous.
we're getting reports from c deck that it's down to twelve degrees. ensign almack is working on it.
"well, tell him to hurry up. if the relays up there get too cold, they're going to start cutting out on us.  engineering."
"we've got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle, sir."
we'll get to it as soon as we can.
aye. sir.
any luck?
we know it's got something to do with the plasma exhaust. the flow's been restricted for some reason and it's screwing up half the systems on the ship.  tell billy to purge the aft manifold.
sir.
you think it might be a good idea to drop out of warp?
"give me a minute, sir. i think we can figure it out."
tucker to bridge. might be a good idea to drop out of warp.
"going to impulse, sir."
"commander, i think i've found the problem."
something's distorting our wake pattern.
you're right. the plasma exhaust shouldn't be flaring that close to the ship.
em residue in the exhaust ports?
"no, we checked. they're clean."
"malcolm, if we ignited the plasma exhaust, what kind of damage would it do to the nacelles?"
sir?
how much damage?
"if we polarize the hull plating, it should be all right as long as we maintained at least half impulse."
"go to half impulse, ensign."
"aye, sir."
put up a4.
record all aft sensors.
hull plating.
both nacelles are at maximum.
stand by to ignite a charge at eighty metres due aft.
"fire. play it back, slowly. go back and freeze it at the flashpoint. creep it forward a little. there."
looks like we've got ourselves a hitchhiker.
they must be using some sort of stealth technology.
i wonder how long they've been there.
long enough to throw half our systems out of whack. i'm sure they know we've detected them. open hailing frequencies.
our ship-to-ship sensors are malfunctioning. i can only give you audio. translator's active.
this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. i don't need to tell you where we are. your presence is disrupting a number of our systems. please back away to a distance of at least ten kilometres and respond.
harm us.  your request. we ask you not to harm us. we are complying with your request. we ask you not to harm us.
"they're moving off, sir."
"we have no intention of harming you, but i wouldn't mind an explanation."
i apologise for any damage we've caused. our engines are malfunctioning and we've been using your plasma exhaust to replenish our teraphasic coils. it's allowed us to share your warp field.
their warp reactor is offline.
"we can't help you unless we can see you, so why don't you disconnect whatever stealth device you're using."
i'm giving you forty milligrams of mirazine.  it should shorted the decompression process by half.
that still leaves three hours. can you recommend a good book?
i'll be briefing you on their propulsion systems.
sure you don't want me coming back at night?
"three hours of decompression in each direction, makes more sense to stay until the job's done."
i've sent them your dietary requirements.
"they claim to have the ability to synthesize protein and carbohydrates, but there's no telling what it may taste like. try to be diplomatic."
three days on an alien ship.
remember to mind your manners.
we've got a seal.
just about ready.
it's too bad the ship-to-ship sensors are down. would have been nice to get a look at them.
i'll just think of it as a blind date. tucker to enterprise.
archer.
"here i go, sir."
keep your comm. channel open. we'll be right here.
here you go.
don't forget to come back for me.
i don't know. we are kind of busy. have fun.
hello?
hello?
try to maintain your normal rate of respiration.
this stuff's burning my lungs.
maintain your normal rate of respiration. the discomfort will subside.
"commander tucker's calling again, sir. he's rather anxious."
put him through.
"how long's it been, sir?"
about five minutes longer than the last time you asked.
how's the breathing?
"a lot easier, but i prefer air i can't see."
they told us the air would clear up during the last half hour of decompression.
i feel like i've been in here for a week.
"you've only got forty five minutes to go, trip."
be patient.
hey. good boy. there you go.
"blue one. green three. yellow two. orange five. yellow three. red four. green two. whoa, whoa, that's too fast. i'm not a computer."
i hope the acclamation process wasn't too stressful.
"blue three, yellow six, orange four."
the perceptual tests are the best way to determine whether you're ready for our environment.
we've prepared a meal for you.
"not right now, thank you."
we strongly recommend that you get some rest.
i think i'd like to take a look at that engine room of yours.
it's one deck above us.
these are the teraphasic coils. the wider ones have lost their cohesion.
"i'm sorry, you lost me. i'm having trouble concentrating with all this noise and light."
are you certain you don't want to rest for a while?
i don't know what i'm certain about.
"mister tucker again, sir."
"put him through. yeah, trip. how's it going?"
not good. i don't think i'm going to be much help over here. i'm having a little more trouble adjusting than i thought i would.
what's the problem?
"i feel like i've got a fever. i'm having trouble focusing, breathing. i really think i need to get back, captain."
"stand by for a minute. t'pol, put me through to trena'l."
stand by.
captain archer?
my man's not doing so well over there.
he'll be fine.
"with all due respect, i've known commander tucker for eight years. he's tough as nails. if he says he's having problems, i've got to believe him."
when he came out of decompression he refused to rest. i strongly suggest he'd lie down for a while.
you really think that'll make a difference?
we have a good deal of experience with alien visitors.
i told trena'l you'd try to get at least an hour of shut-eye. he says that should do the trick.
"i just want out, sir. i'm not kidding. i can't take much more of this."
"trena'l says they've dealt with this before. just one hour. if you're not feeling better, we'll bring you back."
"it's not going to work, captain."
"take a nap, trip. that's an order."
archer out.
we've prepared sleeping quarters for you. it's not far.
your captain sent the recording . he thought it might help you relax. are you feeling better?
what's that?
our food. it grows all over the ship. would you like some? it's very sweet.
i think i'll pass.
this is the closest we could come to water.
trust me.
did that hurt?
not really.  it's kind of nice. does that happen when you people touch each other?
something similar. have you had enough?
a man needs a lot of fluids when he's under the weather.
"if you're feeling well enough, we really should get back to the repairs."
could we take some of those with us?
are the injector cells aligned with the primary coil?
aligned and locked. you're not going to believe this. they've got grass growing on the floor. real grass. it's even green. is vulcan grass green?
"have you tested the ion matrix, commander?"
"the grass releases some kind of vapour, helps them metabolize their food. smells just like a freshly mowed lawn."
"the ion matrix, commander."
"oh, right. i've recharged the assembly. is it up to point four yet?"
point four three.
keep pumping up the gradient. if we can get it up to point five the coils should come back online
all by themselves.
sounds like trip's feeling better.
"before you know it, he'll have that engine room running like a well-oiled machine."
tucker to captain archer.
"go ahead, trip."
we're nearly ready to bring the warp reactor online. shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
"just think, yesterday you would have done anything to get out of there."
tucker out.
it will take a while for the coils to regenerate. come with me. there's something i want you to see.
watch this.
that's thera. it's where i come from.
"the depth perception is incredible. what is it, a 3-d simulator of some kind?"
it's holographic.
not like any hologram i've ever seen.
"it seems real, doesn't it."
how do you?
resequenced photons. come with me.
the perspective's changing.
we could walk all the way to the city and you'd never know we're still in this room.
sit down.
we're still in the same room and this isn't a boat.
it's a boat. it's just resequenced
resequenced photons.
exactly.
"if we had one of these on enterprise, i'd never ask for shore leave."
you don't have any dermal plating. how do you detect other people's moods?
"we don't. well, actually we do, but we do it through observing behaviour, getting to know someone."
"the follicles on your face. if i'm not mistaken, they've grown. do they have a purpose?"
"not that i know of. normally we shave them off with something called a razor, but i haven't had the chance since i've been here."
do you mind?
go ahead.
does that hurt?
not in the least.
more water?
"no, this is a game we play. watch."
go ahead.
are there any rules to this game?
it takes four hands to work.
your favourite food is catfish.
how the hell did you know that?
what's mine.
"your what, favourite food?"
yes. concentrate. what's my favourite food.
dutara root. how'd i know that?
"i wasn't certain the granules would work with your species. captain archer saved your life once, about four years ago."
this is one hell of a game. you find me attractive.
"you like having people find you attractive, don't you?"
sometimes.
reactor room to ah'len. the coils are coming back online.
understood. you'd better stand up.
decompression any easier coming back?
"three hours is three hours. you can't imagine what it was like over there, travis. food growing on the walls, teraphasic warp coils, boxes full of pebbles that make you telepathic."
what were the xyrillians like?
"a little shorter than us, weird scales on their faces, but otherwise pretty much like you and me. it sure was something. reminded me why i signed on. but it is good to be home."
i hope your mission hasn't been overly delayed.
getting a chance to meet other species is our mission.
i see you've got the visual back online.
hoshi. trena'l wanted to thank you again.
": i realise how difficult it must have been, adapting to our environment."
"it was worth every minute. as long as those coils stay charged, you shouldn't have a problem maintaining a stable warp field.  thanks for taking care of me when i wasn't feeling so hot."
it was worth every minute. good luck to you.
"nice work, commander."
"i appreciate the opportunity, commander."
i for one won't miss the malfunctions their proximity was causing.
"return to our previous heading, travis."
"aye, sir."
didn't they feed you over there?
"you should've come with me, malcolm."
i heard about the holographic recreation.
"it wasn't like any visual simulator i've ever tried. it was more like actually being there. you could smell the ocean, feel the salt air on your skin."
"if we had one of those on board, i can only imagine what it would be used for."
"i don't know if they can recreate people with it, but it sure did a hell of a job on landscapes."
make any friends?
"ah'len, one of their engineers. she's the one who showed me the holographic chamber."
is she the one you thanked for taking care of you?
yeah.
interesting scales.
she did have a certain sensuality to her.
"so, did you get a look at their weapons?"
i don't even know if they had any. have you tried these scrambled eggs? tastes just like the real thing today.
maybe you were allergic to something over there.
"well, i cleared bioscan."
"nevertheless, you'd better have doctor phlox take a look at it."
"as far as i know, i've never been allergic to anything."
"i don't believe you're having an allergic reaction. tell me, did your visit to the xyrillian ship involve any romance?"
what?
were you intimate with anyone?
"doc, i was over there to repair a warp reactor. what are you talking about?"
it seems you did a little more than repair work.
meaning?
this is a nipple.
i beg your pardon?
"ah, the blastocyst is located between the sixth and seventh intercostals."
what the hell are you talking about?
"i'm not quite sure if congratulations are in order, commander, but you're pregnant."
"here,do you see that cell cluster? that is the embryo.i assume you'll be happy to know that it's not technically your child."
what do you mean?
"when reproducing, the xyrillians only utilize the genetic material of the mother. the males simply serve as hosts."
"that's comforting, but how the hell did i get knocked up?"
"we don't have any data on their mating procedures, but i wouldn't think it would be that difficult for you to recollect a sexual encounter."
three days. you were only there for three days and you couldn't restrain yourself.
"i'm telling you, captain, i was a complete gentleman the entire time."
i imagine that's a question of how you would define gentleman.
"the only female i had any contact with was ah'len, their engineer. other than repairing the reactor, all she and i did together was go into that holographic chamber they've got. she showed me some home movies, simulations of their planet, but i didn't lay a hand on her. there's got to be some way to get this thing out of me without hurting it. can't you create a surrogate chamber or something?"
the embryo has integrated with your pericardium. i wouldn't be comfortable extracting it without more information on the gestation process.
this engineer wanted you to see her planet?
so?
"perhaps the next step would have been to meet her holographic parents. if i'm not mistaken, on some planets that's a precursor to marriage."
"we took a ride in a row boat. i swear, captain, nothing happened."
there had to be a somewhat lengthy physical contact to transfer this much genetic material.
trip.
"i've been in starfleet for twelve years. do you think i'd jeopardise my career by messing around with some alien engineer on a three day mission? i considered myself a diplomat from the minute i set foot in that vessel. well, there was that box of pebbles."
pebbles?
"yeah, she had it on the boat. but it was no bid deal. we just stuck our hands into these granules for a few minutes. it's a game they play, let's you read each other's minds. they weren't even real, they were holographic just like everything else in the room."
doctor?
"without a sample of these telepathic granules it would be impossible to make a determination, but they could have served as the transferral medium."
one of the first things a diplomat learns is not to stick his fingers where they don't belong.
captain?
"if we're going to safely remove this life form from commander tucker, we'll have to find the xyrillians.  why don't you and malcolm see what you can do about locating their ship."
"yes, sir."
is trip well enough to return to his duties?
"what, are you kidding? i'm fine."
"you'll probably feel a bit nauseated in the mornings, so get sufficient rest and exercise and see me at least once a day. that nipple may not be the only surprise your body has in store for you."
"you think we could keep this between the four of us, at least for the time being?"
you got it.
dillard.
sir?
look at this lift.
sir?
it's an accident waiting to happen. this safety bar's a metre off the floor. what use would it be for a small person?
a small person?
"a short alien, a child. this thing's a deathtrap."
"look at this handrail. put your hands here while this is going up or down, it'll take your fingers right off."
"why would someone put their hands there, sir?"
never mind.
are you certain you made the correct sensor modifications?
"yes, absolutely certain. their last trajectory?"
we've altered our course to match.
how do we know they haven't changed their heading?
"we don't, but we've compensated to detect their stealth telemetry. we should be able to locate them."
it may take a while. why exactly are we trying to find that ship?
yes. i thought you provided all the services they required.
"if you'll excuse me, i'm not feeling very well."
"perhaps a little lunch might help. i hear chef has prepared rigelian sausage.  being vegetarian i can't speak from experience, but i'm told it's quite succulent."
i think i'm just going to go lie down for a while.
"commander, if we tune the uv sensors to the omicron band, we should be able to isolate their plasma trail a good deal faster. do you think you could spare a minute just to help me recalibrate them?"
i'm afraid this isn't a very good time.
sorry i'm late.
no problem. how you feeling?
i thought we all promised to keep this under wraps.
i haven't said a thing. doctor?
not a word.
i knew it. she probably let it slip the minute she left sickbay.
but sub-commander t'pol promised to keep your pregnancy a secret.
"where i'm from, vulcans aren't known for keeping promises."
"well, what makes you think she's told anyone?"
"all you have to do is see the way they whisper, talk behind my back. you know what happened this morning? ensign hart pulled my chair out for me. i'm telling you, it was t'pol and you can be sure it was intentional. what's that?"
chicken tetrazzini.
did you cut yourself?
"i wish. i don't want to ruin you appetites, but take a look at this."
"just how many of these am i going to grow? and while we're on the subject, are they going to go away again afterward?"
"one would think. then again, i have no experience with this species."
great.
"you know, it's been over a week, trip. we have to start considering the possibility that we're not going to find the xyrillians."
what's that supposed to mean? are you saying i'm going to deliver this baby?
"i believe he's saying a good deal more than that. once the child is born, it may well rely on you in some way to care for it."
i'm the chief engineer. i spent years earning that position. i never had any intention of becoming a working mother.
"you know, the doctor was saying that the gestation period will only last another five weeks, six at the most."
"you should expect to begin experiencing some unusual symptoms. hormonal changes mostly, mood swings, heightened emotions."
i suggest you stick with the civilian clothes. seems to help hide the bulge.
how much bigger is this thing going to get? i'm already the laughing stock of the ship.
i'd love some more of this.
"yes, sir."
"i'd like you to start seeing the doctor every eight hours. as your delivery date gets closer, he should be able to start figuring out what your postnatal responsibilities might be."
postnatal responsibilities?
you may very well be putting those nipples to work before you know it.
there's a bright side to all of this.
yeah? what's that.
"as far as we know, this is the first inter-species pregnancy involving a human."
got something.
looks like their signature.
"coordinates oh seven eight mark six, three million kilometres. change our heading to intercept. bridge to archer."
go ahead.
"we may have found the xyrillian ship, sir."
thank you.
on our way.
what have you got?
"we're approaching the coordinates. i've analysed the stealth telemetry, i believe it's them."
"drop down to impulse. hoshi, try to get an image."
doesn't look very stealthy to me.
go tighter.
if the starship profiles the vulcans gave us are correct
"they're correct, lieutenant. that's a klingon battle cruiser."
where the hell are the xyrillians?
"it appears your repairs didn't last very long. if i'm correct, they're hiding in the klingon's plasma wake."
hoshi?
"the translation programme should be in pretty good shape, sir."
"sir, with all due respect, do we really think this is a wise idea?"
"if we're going to speak to the xyrillians, we can't do it without the klingons knowing about it. open a channel. this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. we respectfully would like to ask for your assistance with a little problem we're having."
"sir, they're charging weapons."
polarize the hull plating.
grab hold of something.
and another one.
why are they attacking us?
they're not. if they wanted to destroy enterprise they would have done it.
so i guess that's their version of a warning shot across our bows.
"i don't recommend being the recipient of another warning like that, sir."
"should i lay in a new course, captain?"
"no, stay where you are. hail them again."
"sir, look at their starboard nacelle. the power's fluctuating just like ours did when the xyrillians were riding in our wake."
they're responding.
what gives you the right to approach a klingon warship?
"please accept our apology, but i need to ask you a question."
and what would that be?
"have you been experiencing any unusual malfunctions? problems with your gravity plating, propulsion, environmental controls?"
you've been monitoring our systems. for how long?
"we haven't, i promise you. the same things happened to us a few days ago. your problems are being caused by a small stealth vessel that's been riding in your wake. they're using your plasma exhaust to fuel their warp coils."
find this vessel.
"wait a minute, wait a minute. they're harmless. we need them, alive. just give me a chance to explain."
find them!
there are thirty six aboard.
bring their captain to me and execute the others.
didn't you hear what i said? i need them alive.
what you need is to turn your puny ship around and leave. these aliens violated our security and disrupted our systems. both are considered acts of war against the empire.
i assure you that any damage they've done was unintentional. they're simply trying to get home.
"they won't get home, but i'm more than willing to hasten their journey to sto-vo-kor."
sto-vo?
the afterlife.
"you really don't want to hurt these people. they're actually very kind. they just had some bad luck with their engines. when we confronted them, they complied with all our requests."
you're wasting my time.
"less than one month ago, captain archer stood in the high council chamber in kronos. the chancellor himself called him a man of honour, a brother. enterprise is the ship that found klaang and returned him to the empire. without klaang, your houses would be at war with each other. jonathan archer is the man who carried out that rescue. you are in his debt. you would be demonstrating both honour and wisdom to grant his request."
"i'm the one who repaired their warp reactor, or at least i thought i did. i spent three days on their ship. they have some amazing technology. if you don't kill them, i'm sure they'd share it with you, teach you how to use it."
what kind of technology?
"well for one, they've got some incredible holography. i don't know how advanced klingon holograms are, but these are like nothing i ever saw before. press a few buttons and you'll be standing on a hillside overlooking kronos. it's unbelievable. couldn't hurt to take a look, unless the decompression cycle frightens you."
"i am frightened by nothing, petaq."
"if you agree to enter their vessel, i'd appreciate it if you took my chief engineer with you."
he talks too much. i'll bring a security team.
he was there for three days. they trust him. it'll make things a lot easier.
"if their technology amuses me, i may spare their lives. i don't need your engineer to help me make that decision."
there's another reason. commander tucker has some unfinished business with the xyrillians.
i am not interested in your engineer's business.
there's a pregnancy involved.
"i thought you said you were there to fix their warp reactor, not to impregnate one of their females. this should be a lesson to you. forget it happened."
i'm afraid that's not going to be so easy.
show him.
captain vorok has agreed to consider releasing your ship in exchange for one or two of your holographic simulators. it would be a good idea to cooperate.
this is a topographical survey of our capital.
i'd be pleased to give you a demonstration.
the reactor worked fine for six days then went offline again. how did you find us?
"it wasn't easy, but we were very motivated."
i don't understand.
i had no idea this could happen with another species. if i'd known.
"no need to apologise, but i would be real appreciative if you could get this out of me, assuming it's safe."
it's still early enough to transfer the embryo to another host. she looks very healthy.
"it's a girl, huh?"
you can see my house from here. can this technology be adapted to our power matrix?
i'm sure we can make the appropriate modifications.
"as soon as the installation is complete, the xyrillians will be free to go."
"i appreciate your co-operation. i hope the next time we meet, we can be of some help to you."
"listen to me very carefully. our debt is repaid. we have no interest in meeting you again, and if we do, i promise, you'll regret it."
the only thing worse than spending three hours in a decompression chamber with a bunch of klingons is doing it twice in one day. i smelled things in there i hope i never smell again.
"trena'l told me that at full impulse, they can probably get home in less than a month."
no more hitch-hiking?
"that business about the klingon chancellor calling me a brother, was that true?"
klingons are known to exaggerate. i saw nothing wrong with doing the same.
your appetite seems to be back to normal.
just eating for one again.
i've run a check through the starfleet database. you might be pleased to know that this is the first recorded incident of a human male becoming pregnant.
just how i always wanted to get into the history books.
this was their first view of it.
"if you don't look too close, you'd think it was earth."
breaking ground on the town hall.
is that captain mitchell?
"no, i think that's mitchell."
are we there yet?
"three hours seventeen minutes to go, sir."
travis has been digging through the archives.
"there's tons of data here. crew manifests, survey photos, weekly status reports. i was hoping to find something, a clue to what happened."
you'd be the first.
"i've been fascinated by terra nova since i was a kid, sir. i always thought lost colonies affected boomers more than anyone else. something about people who choose to live off-world."
"captain, do you think anyone's still there?"
i'll let you know in about three hours and seventeen minutes.
terra nova?
i'm surprised you've never heard of it.
i'm not familiar with the early years of human space exploration.
really? every school kid on earth had to learn about the famous vulcan expeditions.
name one.
history was never my best subject.
"it was called the great experiment. could humans colonise deep space? they'd already build new berlin on the moon, utopia planetia on mars, even a few asteroid colonies, but all within our solar system. when they found an earth-like planet less than twenty light-years away, it was hard to resist."
"it took them what, nine years to get there?"
"nine years there, nine years back, but they made it."
my grandfather remembered seeing their first transmissions when he was a kid.
what happened to them?
"people have been trying to answer that question for a long time. no one's heard from terra nova in over seventy years. after the colony was built, relations with earth became strained. the space agency figured nothing succeeds like success, so they decided to send another vessel."
"the colonists protested. they'd been there five years, this was their home. they didn't want another two hundred people arriving. the folks back on earth argued that there weren't any other habitable planets within reach, but the colonists dug their heels in. there were a few angry messages sent back and forth, then one day nobody heard from them again."
why didn't you send a vessel to find out what happened?
"nine years there, nine years back, it would have been a pretty long trip."
a vulcan ship could have made the journey in far less time. why didn't you ask them?
asking favours of the vulcans usually ends up carrying too high a price.
"my experience with humans is limited, but i've come to learn that they're quite resourceful. terra nova may still be there, captain."
two hundred thousand kilometres.
let's see it.
i promised my dad i'd see this place someday.
put us in orbit over the colony.
"terra nova colony, this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. we've come from earth. please respond."
"no answer, sir."
any biosigns?
"no, but the colony appears to be intact. i'm also detecting low levels of surface radiation."
from what?
i can't tell.
let's take a look.
closer.
looks like a ghost town.
let's hope the ghosts can give us some answers. how bad is the radiation.
less than eight hundred millirads. a few hours of exposure shouldn't pose a risk.
"trip, take the bridge. travis."
a housing unit.
"no sign of weapons fire, only rust."
"whatever happened, i've got to believe they tried to let earth know about it."
we've got the schematics for the communications tower.
good. see if the data buffer's intact. we might be able to access their last transmission logs.
"aye, sir."
walk the perimeter. see what you can find.
"judging by the isotope decays, the radiation levels seventy years ago would have been lethal."
"if that's what killed them, where are the bodies?"
maybe they left the planet before it could affect them.
that would have been difficult. that's a bulkhead. they designed their ship to be disassembled. that's how they built the colony. it was a one-way trip.
hello?
"we're not alone, sir. there's someone in the forest."
we're on our way.
i believe he went in there.
you get a look at him?
"yeah, he appeared to be a couple of metres tall, biped, odd-looking scales."
this leads to a network of caverns that extend for several hundred metres.
archer to mayweather.
"go ahead, sir."
get back to the shuttle and grab a pair of flashlights. make it quick.
"yes, sir."
"it'd be best if i went first, sir."
after you.
captain.
my name is archer. we're looking for some people. i was hoping you could help us.  we're not going to hurt you. we're just trying to find out what happened to them.
which way?
t'pol to captain archer.
captain?
"we're under attack, and i think we just took a wrong turn. we could use a little help navigating down here."
"just a moment. in approximately three metres, a tunnel will branch off to your left."
take it.
i don't see a tunnel.
"correction, ten metres."
"i'm all right, sir."
malcolm?
malcolm?
where's malcolm?
go.
take us up.
"if those aliens killed the colonists, they could kill malcolm too."
those weren't aliens. they're human.
"i don't get it. if they're human, why were they shooting at us?"
archer to the bridge. what have you found?
we've got a
"pretty good picture of those caverns, and we've picked up fifty two biosigns so far. all human."
the only one i'm interested in right now is lieutenant reed. we've got to get him out of there.
have you found him?
"yes, sir. he's about ninety metres below the surface."
"he's not responding to hails, captain, but he's alive."
have doctor phlox join us in the situation room.
"aye, sir."
"if these are the descendants of the original colonists, they've never seen other humans before. maybe we look as strange to them as they did to us."
twelve point six kilometres worth of tunnels. looks like they even dug a few wells. the geology's a little shaky. some of these passageways have collapsed.
they may have been driven underground by the radiation.
have you figured out what caused it?
not yet.
what do they do for food?
"many species feed on underground fauna and flora. tubers, fungi, insects."
they also hunt some kind of burrowing animal. where's malcolm?
"right here, sir. there are two people with him."
can we use the transporter?
he's too deep.
"a section of this tunnel is collapsed. it's empty. if we could get into it, we could clear the obstruction with phase pistols. we'd be less than twenty metres from lieutenant reed."
what about these two? we have to assume they're armed.
a stun grenade would solve that problem.
"i don't want to risk any more casualties. despite how they look, they're still human. we've got to find some way to talk to them."
they didn't seem too eager to talk.
if i can't make first contact with other humans i don't have any business being out here. malcolm was shot. grab your medical kit and meet me at the launch bay.
"right away, sir."
captain.
try to find out what irradiated the surface. you and hoshi get to work on that data buffer. i want to know if they tried to send any messages to earth.
do you think they know we've returned?
hard not to hear a shuttlepod landing on your roof.
i'm unarmed. i just want to talk.
i'm concerned about my officer. i'd like to see him.
fancy meeting you here.
how's the leg?
"i've lost a bit of blood, sir, but i don't think it's too serious."
"may i have my medical supplies, please?"
human?
that's right.
what's that?
my name is phlox. i am a denobulan. i'm captain archer's physician.
you tracked from earth on a sky ship.
it's called enterprise.
"to what, gut the rest of us?"
no. we're here to find out what happened to the colony. we came to help you.
novans have had enough help from you.
we're not so easy to hunt as diggers. go back to the overside or we'll seal your passage.
"i told you, we're not here to hurt anybody."
"take that one, and don't track back."
"all right, but he won't be able to get through these tunnels on one leg. my doctor needs to treat him."
what makes you think we're here to hurt you?
humans hurt novans.
why do you think that?
"they gutted us. our families, our before-families."
i don't understand.
"poison rain. i was no taller than a digger, but i can still see back. we lived on the overside, then the humans dropped the poison, burned our skin, gutted the grown ones. there was no place to go but here."
"to the underside. i think i know what you're talking about. the poison rain, it was some kind of radiation. i don't know what caused it but i'm sure it wasn't humans."
"he can walk, more or less, but i'll need to get him back to sickbay to remove the projectile."
"i know this'll be hard for you to accept, but you're the descendants of human beings. your ancestors colonised this planet over seventy years ago. they came from earth, just like i did. i don't know what happened, but maybe we could work together and find out."
he speaks in shale.
"if that's your way of calling me a liar, give me a chance to prove what i'm saying. my sky ship has tools that can help us find out what happened here."
no.
are you aware that your mother is sick?
"this is one of the tools the captain spoke of. it can tell me all kinds of things about the inside of your body. she has an illness that we call lung cancer, but it's easily cured."
"doctor phlox can make her well, but she'd have to come back to our ship."
this is shale. they want to trap us on the overside to gut us.
how long of a day would it take?
not long. a few hours at most.
hours?
she'd be back before the sun rises on the overside. let us help you.
we track together. this one stays.
he needs to be treated as well.
he'll be fine for a few hours.
"don't worry about me, sir. i was just getting used to the place."
probably best if you lead the way.
"that's enterprise. it's a lot like the ship that brought the colonists to this planet. it was called the conestoga. maybe you were born on board, or were you born after your parents got here?"
my parents were novans. they came from the overside.
no more! let me out!
open the passage.
just a few more seconds.
open it.
it's all right.
my apologies for any discomfort.
is she healed?
not quite. first we have to determine how far her sickness has spread.
"that is you. the inside of you, anyway. this picture will tell me what kind of treatment she'll require. interstitial tumours. the malignancy has spread to her lymphatic system. she'll need a series of cytolitic injections."
injections?
medicine. he's just going to give her some medicine.
i'll need a few minutes to synthesise it.
i've got some other pictures you might like to see. one of my crewmen found these in our database.
they might help you remember what it was like living on the overside before the poison rain.
it's human shale. they're confusing your path. you'll lose your tracks in this.
i'm just trying to help you see how you got here.
all i see is digger filth.
"well look again. because whether you want to believe it or not, we're both human."
bury your drawings.
"doctor, keep me posted."
how far away is it?
about five hundred kilometres north.
how deep?
"it's been partially filled in by erosion over the years, but i'm reading impact fractures down to nearly two thousand metres."
comet or an asteroid?
an asteroid. a large one. the tectonic analysis puts the impact at approximately seventy years ago.
the poison rain.
the geology was comprised primarily of beresium ore. the thermo-shock would have created a radioactive cloud that probably covered the northern hemisphere for more than a year.
"they spent all those years getting here, and for what?"
"that's an old mk-33, isn't it? or is it a 34? impressive body armour you're wearing. did you make it yourself? right. i don't suppose there's a lavatory on the premises, is there? i wouldn't mind freshening up a little. no. didn't think so."
is your belly hollow?
that all depends. what's for dinner?
digger meat.
looks a little undercooked.
humans are like damp moss. they rot on the underside.
not bad.
come in.
"it's a transmission, sir. it's the last one anyone made, as far as we can tell. it was still in the buffer."
it's captain mitchell.
"no matter how angry logan's threats may have seemed, there had to have been a way of dealing with this other than attacking us. nearly half the adults are dead, including doctor tracey, and everyone else is getting sick, except for the younger children. if they have any chance of surviving, the least you could do is have the vulcans send a ship for them, but for all i know they were the ones you talked into attacking us. you wanted terra nova enough to do this? well it's yours now, but i doubt you'll be very pleased with what you find when you get here."
"mark logan was the head of the opposition, the ones who were against a second wave of settlers. supposedly, he threatened to fire at any ship that came into orbit."
the irony is that captain mitchell's message never reached earth. the debris in the atmosphere was too dense.
"so, for some reason, the young kids survive and begin living underground. their last memories of their parents are hearing them blame humans for destroying the colony. the idea that humans are the enemy has been embedded in them for more than two generations. this isn't going to be easy."
sickbay to archer.
go ahead.
"could you come see me, please."
is everything all right?
nadet's cancer has been eliminated.
nice work.
"but i found something quite troubling. both she and her son are showing signs of microcellular decay in their endocrine systems. their underground water supply has probably become contaminated. i don't have any medication to treat this, and it's only going to get worse."
would bringing them to the surface help?
t'pol says the soil and foliage is going to remain irradiated for at least another decade.
how's she doing?
she's as disagreeable as she was before i treated her.
bring them to the situation room.
we are not leaving.
"it's not safe for you anymore. when the asteroid hit, the fallout contained certain poisons. humans under the age of four or five can usually build up an immunity to them. that's why they survived."
"for the last two or three generations that immunity kept you all alive, but now the poisons have gotten into your water supply. as captain archer says, it is no longer safe."
you humans tried to gut our go-befores when they lived on the overside. now you're trying to gut us.
"doctor phlox just saved your life. perhaps you should give him the benefit of the doubt. after all, he's not human. neither am i."
"giant rocks falling from the sky. shale, it's all shale! take us back."
i went through about two to three hundred photographs before i found this.
"look familiar, nadet?"
"it's the overside, before the poison rain."
and what about the people?
humans.
what were humans doing in your colony before it was destroyed? i think i can help answer that.
"you're sure none of these people look familiar? from the data we retrieved on this photograph, we're pretty sure this woman's name was vera fuller. ring a bell?"
it's the medicine they put in you. they're confusing your path. we need to leave.
look closely.
vera fuller. what do you remember?
shale! they're trying to trap you.
vera had a daughter named bernadette. she'd be about seventy five now in earth years.
nadet? bernadette? you say this is me?
"they're trying to make us leave the underside. if we're not back before day, your crewman will be gutted. take us back."
is her treatment finished?
i should take one more thoracic scan.
"fine. as soon as you're done, bring them to the launch bay. sub-commander."
"there are fifty eight human beings in those tunnels and they're all going to die if we don't get them out of it, and what do they think? they think we're a bunch of hostile aliens trying to take their colony over."
stun grenades.
what?
"commander tucker's continued to enhance the sensor resolution of their tunnels. we could transport stun grenades to specific locations, detonate them, and use both shuttlepods to bring them back to the ship."
"and then what, put them in chains?"
i'm sure mister reed could devise appropriate restraints.
"what the hell do you think this is, a slave shi? we can't relocate them by force."
the alternative was made quite clear by doctor phlox.
we have to convince them that returning to earth is the right thing. we can't take them by force.
are you certain it is the right thing?
what are you talking about?
"when you get them back to earth, what will you do? send them to school, teach them to read and write, wear human clothing, eat human food, teach them to live on the surface, enjoy the sunshine?"
"you're damn straight. they're human beings. it's their birthright. it might take a little while, but they'll adapt. it's a hell of a lot better than dying down in those tunnels."
"they've lived in those tunnels for three generations. you can't just pluck them up and bring them to a strange world and hope they'll learn to conform. you'd be destroying their identity, destroying the novan culture."
archer to tucker.
captain.
get up here on the double and bring your maps with you.
"the debris cloud reached to about here, ten or twelve degrees north of the equator."
southern hemisphere?
unaffected by the asteroid.
captain archer.
"go ahead, doc."
the two novans are in shuttlepod one. will you be escorting them back to the surface?
"i'll be there in a couple of minutes. there's got to be similar underground topography on one of these southern continents. caves, caverns. find them. put that on a padd for me. and it wouldn't hurt if they were crawling with those, what do they call them, diggers."
"your planet has three large islands to the south. we call them continents. the climate is nearly identical to your overside. we don't know how similar the underside is, but my people are working on that now. the important thing is, the poison rain never fell there. you'd be safe. your children would be safe. you could even spend time on the overside if you wanted to."
if our tunnels are infected you wouldn't want them so badly.
"we don't. we only want to help you, make you healthy."
was that photograph of vera fuller and her daughter shale? do you really believe we created it to trick you? you're human. so am i. humans help each other.
"when we track back to the underside, we'll return your crewman only if you promise to leave."
"i've got the landing site locked in, captain."
"would you at least talk to your people, tell them what i proposed?"
our thrusters are down.
fire them up again.
"pod one to enterprise, we've got an emergency."
is anyone hurt?
"we're okay, but getting out of here is going to be tricky. can you give us the coordinates"
captain?
i think we're done dropping. how far have we gone?
you're down about eight metres. looks like a couple of the abandoned tunnels gave way.
open it. open it.
"hold on. trip, if i open the port hatch, what am i going to find?"
open it!
you're on the floor of a stable tunnel. you should be okay.
you're going to have to build a rig to get this pod back on the surface.
"aye, sir."
we're in the downslope passage. we need to pass the cut-through to get to your crewman. give me your pistol.
what are you talking about?
"if you want to see your human alive, you'll give me your pistol."
stay here with the shuttle. keep your comm. open.
help!
hold on a second. do you hear that?
help! help me! can anyone
it's akary.
help! help!
he must have fallen when your sky ship quaked the tunnels. are you hurt?
i'm leg-broke. the wood has me sealed down.
would you risk your bones to save a novan?
"i'll do what i can, but i doubt i can make it down there."
"we'll track together, but you'll need to trust me."
the water's rising. we have to hurry.
i need you to give me my phase pistol. my gun.
"why, so you can go free your hostage?"
so i can free this man. it's your turn to trust me.
give me a hand. ready.
captain.
how are you holding up?
"not badly, all things considered, but i really wouldn't mind getting this bullet out of my leg."
tell them. tell them what archer said about the islands to the south.
they promised to leave. let them go. we'll be fine here.
"we're not fine. none of us is fine. we're rotting, all of us."
they've promised to leave.
"i've seen back. vera fuller was my mother. that girl in the picture was me, a human girl. our go-befores shared the same path. we should listen."
ever heard of judge crater?
crater?
disappeared in the early twentieth century. how about amelia earhart?
no.
"1937. never found a trace of her. a lot of people spent years, decades, trying to figure out what happened to them, but neither of those mysteries holds a candle to terra nova. and we solved it!"
"did more than that. those people were a year or two away from extinction. we didn't just find them, we saved their lives."
all these years wondering about that colony. i never thought i'd become part of their history.
"tell you what, travis. why don't you put together the report for starfleet. if i'm not mistaken, it'll be headline news back home."
"the terra nova puzzle, solved at last, as told by ensign travis mayweather."
"thank you, sir."
"maybe it's just me, but it seems like these vulcan star charts take all the fun out of it. we're supposed to be explorers, aren't we?"
that's the general idea.
where's the exploration in going places people have already been?
"well, for one thing, we've never been to these places. for another, remember that protostar we ran across last week?"
yeah.
i'm not seeing it here.
"are you saying those vulcan star charts aren't all that accurate? if that's true, good luck getting them to admit it."
come in.
"you wanted to see me, captain."
"as a matter of fact, mister tucker and i were looking at these star charts. there's a planet a few light years off our current heading."
i'm familiar with it.
well the data indicates there's a remote outpost right here on the northern hemisphere.
p'jem.
i take it this p'jem is under vulcan jurisdiction?
it's an ancient spiritual retreat. a remote sanctuary for kolinahr and peaceful meditation.
kolinahr?
the vulcan purging of emotion.
that sounds interesting. how do you think they'd feel about a visit?
"p'jem is a place of quiet contemplation, captain. i'm not certain we'd be welcome."
"it's because vulcans think we smell bad, isn't it?"
it's not every day we get a chance to see an ancient vulcan monastery. i'd say a stop-over's too good a chance to pass up. unless you disagree?
i'll research the proper protocols.
good. archer to helm.
go ahead.
prepare to lay in a course correction. t'pol will give you the coordinates.
understood.
"well, you must be looking forward to visiting the sanctuary."
it was the captain's idea.
but such an opportunity to appreciate your cultural history.
"it is a vulcan sanctuary, if that's what you mean."
"precisely my point. you'll be able to introduce some of your own people to your new crew. oh, i believe i see the source of your misgivings. being seen with a human crew."
it could create a certain awkwardness.
may i?
"i confess i feel awkward on this ship myself, sometimes, out of place. but what is that vulcan motto? infinite diversity."
in infinite combinations.
"and what is diversity but a celebration of differences. i wonder if you might remind me about our mission on this vessel. please, indulge me."
our mission is to make contact with those whom humans consider new life and new civilisations.
"in other words, to seek infinite diversity."
i suppose so.
"well then, it seems to me a cultural exchange between your vulcan brethren and your human crew is simply a furtherance of that mission."
they don't even know we're coming?
it wasn't possible to hail them. the monks consider technology a distraction from their spiritual pursuits.
i don't like dropping in on people unannounced.
"it won't be a problem as long as we observe the proper protocols. when we arrive, we'll be greeted by a vulcan elder. you should not speak to him or any member of the order unless spoken to first. if they appear to be meditating, do not approach them or attempt to make conversation. also, maintain quiet at all times and do not touch or disturb any artefacts, relics or ornamentation. if we arrive at their time of communal kolinahr it's likely we'll be turned away. at the conclusion of our visit we'll be offered the stone of j'kah as a gesture of salutation. accept it, then bow slightly and observe a respectful silence for approximately five seconds."
i thought starfleet training was tough.
you say this is a place to purge emotions? looks like somebody had to purge pretty bad. he bashed the door in.
"the temple is almost three thousand years old, commander. you can't expect it to be in pristine condition."
he says we have arrived at the time of kolinahr. the order must remain in silent reflection throughout the lunar cycle. they are not to be disturbed.
"oh, that's too bad. at least we got to see the place."
"your service honours us. before we leave, may i request the offering of the j'kah stone for my distinguished guests."
please wait.
something wrong?
it's probably nothing.
but?
"this is the main atrium. there should be more than one member of the order present, and the icon in that shrine is perched at an odd angle."
"oddly perched, huh. we'd better call starfleet command."
"that's not all, captain. the vulcan elder seems agitated."
you call that agitated?
"you know, i think the oldest monastery i ever visited was in ngari, tibet, but it wasn't nearly as big as this place."
i've heard it can take days to explore this site.
it'd take at least that long to clean the place up.
"forgive the disarray. kolinahr encourages the members of our order to face their vestigial emotions. the repercussions can sometimes be violent. please. this is the stone of j'kah, which represents the foundation of all we believe. a life of order and control through logic."
"ishte acula bestalma itok, j'kah."
"what's all that mean, anyway?"
"it is a traditional litany, passed down for generations."
does it mean i get good luck or something?
"you're thinking of the blarney stone, captain, or when you pat the buddha's belly."
"i guess you're right. too bad we didn't bring a camera, huh, commander?"
"please, you must leave now."
you ever been to san francisco zoo? now there's something you should see.
friends of yours? somehow i didn't think so.
stop looking at me.
"okay, okay. don't get your antennas in a twist."
why didn't you tell us one of your people was aboard?
it's an earth vessel. i didn't know.
"what does that mean, earth? what is that?"
it's where we're from. it's our homeworld.
"why did you come here? answer me, pink skin."
this planet was along our course. we only came to visit the sanctuary.
liar. what's your mission? are you a supply ship bringing them more surveillance equipment?
we're not bringing them anything.
you brought her.
she's my science officer.
so you admit you're working with the vulcans.
"i'll admit i have a vulcan science officer and that i came here out of curiosity. now, if you don't mind my asking, what are you doing here?"
"hey! he's telling the truth. we came for a visit, that's all."
we scanned your ship in orbit. you're very well armed for people who came for a visit. you and the pink skins have proven what we already knew. this is far more than a sanctuary.
"i'll enjoy having you, as a prisoner."
now these guys are agitated.
"they're andorians, captain. they're known for their suspicious and volatile nature."
andorians?
"yes, sir."
our two species are from neighbouring systems. we've been in conflict for many years.
they resent our superior reasoning and our technology. they even believe that we intend to mount an invasion on their homeworld.
"in order to alleviate tensions, we negotiated a treaty, but some andorian factions still believe we're bent on conquest."
what do they want with a three thousand year old temple?
"they believe we are hiding a long range sensor array. this is a place of introspection, captain. there are no spies her, and no technology."
"so what are you going to do, just sit here and let them ransack the place?"
"typically, they make a great display of their indignance. when they find nothing, they leave."
the andorians were here twice before and both times left within a day. unfortunately your arrival has amplified their suspicions.
you've endangered us all.
no good deed goes unpunished.
the shuttle's sensors should have picked it up.
they went to visit some monks. why would they scan for alien ships?
"it should be standard procedure, that's why. in any event, there it is."
there what is?
"a vessel, not vulcan, and it's less than one kilometre from our shuttlepod."
not a lot of room on that landing platform. maybe they're just some other visitors.
"well, i for one would like to know who these visitors are. and why havenn't we heard from the landing party?"
you can't expect them to check in every ten minutes.
maybe that should be standard procedure as well.
"you sure you're not over-reacting? they're probably just taking a tour, observing some kind of meditation ritual."
where's the sensor array?
from what i'm told there isn't one.
where is it!
i don't know.
you humans obviously have emotions. i find it curious that you'd select a vulcan as your science officer.
"believe me, she wasn't my first choice."
why a vulcan?
why a vulcan?
she was assigned to us by the vulcan high command.
you take orders from the high command?
"no. for the last time, we just came to see the temple.  that's my ship, enterprise. they're trying to contact me."
enterprise.
yes. i'm looking for captain archer.
he's a prisoner of the andorian imperial guard. we know you're in collaboration with the vulcans.
let me talk to the captain.
your ship
is under constant surveillance. arm your weapons or make any attempt to approach the surface and i'll kill the hostages.
wait!
i've lost the signal.
try t'pol or commander tucker.
no response.
have the launch bay put shuttlepod two on standby.
you heard what he said. if we try to send more people.
"i don't take orders from a comm. voice, ensign. not unless that voice belongs to the captain. take a look at the vulcan database. see if it has anything on these andorians."
"aye, sir."
we've searched all the chambers in the eastern tower.
have you checked the living quarters?
not yet.
perhaps if we decapitate one or two of those monks he'll start telling us the truth.
"is that something you could live with, captain?"
i've already told you the truth.
how long have you lived on the earth ship?
nine weeks and four days.
the smell must be intolerable.
"you get used to it, and i was given a nasal numbing agent."
whose idea was it to visit this place? these guys are serious. they're going to start killing you people if they don't find what they're looking for.
there is nothing to find.
i don't think they're buying that. not this time. loks like there are four of them. i saw some kind of scanning console. they talked a lot about searching rooms.
you'd think they could find whatever it is they're looking for with those antennas of theirs.
they answered a hail from enterprise. they threatened to kill us all if anyone attempts a rescue.
mister reed wouldn't be that reckless.
"i didn't recruit my tactical officer to sit on his butt when he's threatened. the andorians smashed our communicators. the longer we're out of contact the more likely malcolm will put together a landing party, warning or no warning."
"knowing him, a heavily armed landing party."
"it's just a matter of time. so if anyone has a suggestion, i'm all ears. no offence."
there is an option. a transmitter. it's very old.
you said you had no technology.
it hasn't been used in many years. it may not even be working.
i never met a busted radio i couldn't fix.
where is this transmitter?
in the catacombs.
catacombs.
"please listen to me, captain. there are hidden passages beneath us where we keep our most sacred relics, our honoured dead. if the andorians discover them they will damage our culture in ways you can't begin to understand."
"for people without emotion, you sure have a flair for the dramatic."
"master haadok, one of the founders of p'jem. the transmitter is this way."
fellas.
what's down there?
the reliquary. our most sacred artefacts are kept there. this is the transmitter.
looks like a krellide power cell.
there is one to spare.
no thanks. it'll just get in my way.
it's only going to get colder.
you take it.
you need it more than i do.
do the andorians have a transporter?
no.
that gives us the element of surprise. we could bring an assault team right into the atrium.
the sound of the transporter alone would alert the guards. they'd start firing before the team was fully resequenced.
what about this room? by the time the andorians detected the transport we'd be armed and ready.
for what? a fire fight in close quarters with a dozen monks at risk?
if you've got any better ideas?
there's room in here.
i'm fine.
you're freezing.
it's been twenty four hours since i took my nasal numbing agent. the cold is preferable to the odour.
come on.
"an armed assault would put all of our lives at risk, not to mention the destruction of the sanctuary itself."
i'd say our lives are already at risk.
tensions between andoria and vulcan are high. any casualties would only make matters worse.
"it seems like you're letting them walk all over you. they come in here, they smash your relics, they beat up your people, then you just sit back and wait for them to walk away?"
we don't believe in responding to violence with violence.
"i admire your ethics, but right now a little violence might help."
you're beginning to sound like an andorian.
"you know, i came here hoping to gain a little insight into the vulcan mind. it looks like i'm getting it. you people think you're so damned enlightened."
"problem? i'd like to find a peaceful solution too, but i don't think that's going to happen. however we end up dealing with this, i need to know i can count on you."
are you questioning my loyalty?
i just want to know where we stand.
i have never disobeyed your orders.
"sir, you're wearing a hole in the deck plating."
what is it?
"transmission from the surface. it's a modulated em signal, very weak."
put it through.
"enterprise, this is commander tucker. repeat, enterprise, this is commander tucker."
"this is enterprise. we can barely read you, commander."
what's your status?
guess you heard we kind of walked into a hostage situation. the whole place has been taken over by andorians.
"andorians, yes."
i've been reading about them in the vulcan database. militaristic.
blue skinned.
that's them.
"well, what do they want?"
they seem to think this place is some kind of a spy station.
they're looking for a sensor array. the captain says to sit tight.
he doesn't want to provoke them any more than we already have. he also said to tell you we're working on a way out of here.
are you certain we can't negotiate?
the captain came back from his last negotiation with a face full of bruises.
we'll be in touch.
understood.
do any of these tunnels lead to the outside?
no.
what about this reliquary?
no one's entered it in years.
to do so would be blasphemy.
"i saw an old stairwell down there, maybe a metre wide. it was right about here."
that would almost be directly beneath the atrium.
there were three dim lights coming from the top. it looked something like this.
how many times do we have to search the same rooms?
are you losing faith in our mission?
"we've looked everywhere, we've run a thousand scans."
"the vulcans are very deceptive. it's here, i'm sure of it. if we back down now, everything we've fought for is meaningless. if nothing else, remember that, keval."
hey! can you hear me? hello? anybody out there?
i need to speak with you alone. i have some information for you.
what is it.
"well, for one thing, i needed some fresh air. you ever been stuck in a room full of vulcans for twelve hours?"
the information.
"i'll bet their robes haven't been washed since the time of surak. have you heard of him? vulcan philosopher. he's the one who got everybody to start purging their emotions. i don't know about you, but i've learned really a lot since i got here."
what did you come to tell us?
"well, that depends. what do you want to know? all right, information. did you know that over seventy percent of the organisms on my homeworld are bacteria."
what?
"and here's something i think you'll find interesting. there was a man in canton, ohio who once rolled a ball of string over six metres in diameter."
he's wasting our time. take him back.
there was a famous astronomer on earth.
tycho brahe. he lost his nose in a duel over a math equation.
you must enjoy pain.
"please, please, i can't stand another minute with the vulcans. please."
"a light at the end of the tunnel. you know what to do, commander."
"yes, sir."
"i don't have to tell you, captain. we don't condone these actions you are about to take."
"no, you don't have to tell me. just try and stay out of the way and everything will work out fine."
phase pistols on stun.
"stun, sir?"
"the captain's instructions were quite explicit. it's a console, ensign. it won't bite."
"no, it'll just scramble your molecules."
crewman?
"we've heard stories, sir. it might not be safe."
i've heard the same stories. now get up here. coordinates set?
"aye, sir."
then energise before we change our minds.
what is it?
some kind of energy fluctuation.
we detected an energy surge. it came from this chamber.
perhaps you have faulty equipment.
or perhaps you have equipment we don't know about.  watch them.
this is it.
"most vulcans smell of dust, but you're different."
something sure smells.
"did you say something, pink skin?"
"this can't be right. i'm detecting three new biosigns, all human."
where are they?
they're within twenty metres.
where!
i can't pinpoint the signal.
try boosting the proximity sensors.
i've heard about your mating rituals. that vulcan women force their men to fight each other to the death. would you like me to kill someone for you?
leave her alone.
would you like me to kill him?
find them.
they're very close.
will you be all right?
go ahead. i'll cover here.
keval!
this way.
two of them got away. they went down into the catacombs.
"i hope you're pleased, captain. you've turned a place of solitude into a war zone."
where are the phase pistols?
"here, sir."
"if he wakes up, stun him again. let's go."
i'm going with you.
violence is no longer our way.
we must protect what is ours.
they're down this passage. thirty metres.
it leads to the reliquary. only members of the high order are allowed to go inside.
we'll do our best not to look at anything.
"i can't permit it, captain."
what would you suggest we do?
i'll disarm them myself.
you ever use one of those? i didn't think so. the andorians have seen your sacred relics. a couple of humans won't make much of a difference.
captain.
hold your fire. you might want to take a look at this.
i don't believe this.  does that thing have imaging sensors?
yes.
take all the pictures you can.
place your weapons on the ground. i will kill him if necessary. give that to me.
"violence in a sanctuary, captain?"
"very disrespectful. boy, did it feel good. all this time they've been calling these monks liars, and all this time they've been right."
they've got enough equipment down there to see what any andorian is having for breakfast.
i've completed my scans.
give it to him.
sir?
give it to him.
you've got what you came for. now get out of here.
how do we know you won't attack our vessel.
the vulcans violated your treaty. your people ought to know about it.  you have a problem with that?
your communicator.
t'pol to enterprise.
go ahead.
the andorian ship will be leaving the surface momentarily. they're free to go.
acknowledged.
we're in your debt.
thanks for the tour.
looks like we're going about warp four point five.
human children have such fertile imaginations. sub-commander.
these were sent by my nephew's fourth grade class. i thought the crew might like to see how excited folks at home are about our mission.
i'm going to put this one up in sickbay. would you like one for your quarters?
"this rendering is crude, yet surprisingly accurate."
some of these kids are pretty talented. which one do you want? this one's nice. or maybe you want first contact. or how about this one?
we're dropping out of warp.
"for those of you who aren't near a window, you might want to find one. there's something pretty amazing off starboard."
senior staff
please report to the bridge.
"i've checked the vulcan database, sir. no previous sightings."
that means we discovered it.
archer's comet.
"take us closer, ensign."
aye sir.
ever seen anything like that in your astronomy books?
"wow, that's one big snowball."
the diameter is eighty two point six kilometres.
i always wanted to chase a comet. maybe we should spend a few days following this one.
vulcan and human scientists have researched hundreds of comets. they've proven to be little more than rock and ice.
"except this one's bigger than any comet humans have ever seen. that's got to be worth a look. stay with it, travis."
"aye, sir."
"milk, cold."
catching up on your reading?
i came for a tea.
stay away from the zariphean blend unless you want to stay up for the next three days.
"caffeine has little effect on vulcan physiology. green tea, hot."
you want to join me? i could use the company.
i'm very tired.
"tell me about it. i put out about a hundred fires in engineering this afternoon and missed dinner. then somebody told me chef made a pecan pie, and suddenly my life brightened. it's been my favourite since i was a kid. care for a bite?"
no thank you.
it's delicious.
it's mostly sugar.
"what, vulcans don't have a sweet tooth? it may not be good for the body, but it sure is good for the soul. mmm, i feel better already."
must be a real page turner. you all right?
"i'm fine, commander. goodnight."
sweet dreams.
eisilium?
it's an extremely rare mineral. this comet appears to contain large quantities of it.
i've never heard of eisilium.
vulcan chemists have only obtained small amounts. they've never been able to study it in detail.
this could be your chance. can we collect a sample with the transporter?
most of the eisilium deposits are at least twenty metres beneath the crust.
that's too deep to get a lock.
"we've got the portable drilling rig, sir."
the comet's certainly big enough to land on. we could take a shuttlepod.
"i'd advise setting down near one of the two poles. if you're out of direct sunlight, the surface ice will be more stable."
how long would you need?
shouldn't take more than three or four hours.
you up for a little comet walk?
by all means.
get started.
"captain, i'm detecting a vessel closing on our position. it's vulcan."
the starship ti'mur.
hail them. this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise.
i'm captain vanik.
pleased to meet you.
"you're a long way from earth, captain. are you lost?"
not at all. just taking a look at this comet.
our sensors detected it two days ago. we also decided to investigate.
really? my science officer tells me that vulcans that vulcans aren't very interested in comets.
"actually, it's your interest in the comet that we're investigating."
we plan to send a drilling team to the surface to collect core samples. you're welcome to participate.
"if you have no objection, we'd like to remain here and observe."
stay as long as you want.
t'pol.
i'd love to know what they're really doing here. you don't find anything strange about them suddenly showing up?
perhaps they're simply curious.
"curious? that doesn't sound very vulcan to me. this isn't the first time we've caught them lurking around. remember three weeks ago, the planetary nebula?"
that was nothing more than a survey ship.
so why didn't they respond to our hails? why'd they go to warp when we headed toward them? i'm starting to get the feeling they're looking over our shoulder a little too often.
that seems unlikely.
"we'll see. fine. if vanik is the kind of guy who likes to watch, let him."
i've never stood on a comet before.
has anyone?
good question.
i've only seen snow twice in my life.
"well, then it's only fitting that we commemorate the occasion."
you mean plant a flag?
"no, too predictable."
snowball fight.
the ev suits would take all the fun out of that. we'll just have to see how the spirit moves us when we get there.
"commander, you wanted to see me?"
"take a look at something, will you? i've been running diagnostics and i found some kind of power surge in the transceiver array."
looks like an encrypted transmission. it came from the vulcan ship.
who was it sent to?
you're sure this was sent to her quarters.
i wish i wasn't. did she say anything to you about it?
not a word. we had an agreement. she promised not to speak to the vulcans without telling me.
looks like she's having some trouble keeping her promises. should i have hoshi decrypt it?
tell her it's top priority.
"whenever you're ready, captain."
you sure you want me here for this? i've got a lot of work to do.
"stay put, commander. this is important. start the recording. to the students of miz malvin's fourth grade class at the worley elementary school in kenmare, county kerry, ireland. this is captain archer aboard the starship enterprise. on behalf of the entire crew, i'd like to thank you for your transmission. we all got a real kick out of your drawings and letters. you asked a lot of interesting questions. i wish we had time to answer all of them, but if we did that, we wouldn't get much exploring done. so i've selected a few, and hopefully our answers will give you a better idea of what life is like out here. liam brennan asks 'what do you eat?' for the most part, the same things you eat at home. our chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to turkey with all the trimmings. we have a hydroponic greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables, and we can also replicate certain foods with our protein resequencer. here's one from geoff miles. 'is dating allowed on enterprise?' well, it's not discouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a starship. most of our crew share quarters with at least one other person, so it wouldn't exactly be practical. but if two crewmembers decide that they really like each other, there are a lot of places they can go to look at the stars. chloe o'shannon wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' i think i'll give that one to my communications officer, ensign hoshi sato."
"well, chloe, that's a very good question. we use a device called the universal translator. it's like an alien dictionary with hundreds of languages programmed into it, and it can learn new languages very quickly, but it doesn't always work, and when that happens it's up to me to try to translate. i'm sure i don't have to tell you it can be really hard sometimes. one wrong word can mean the difference between saying 'take my hand' or 'take my life'. so far i have managed to do pretty well."
"thanks, hoshi. here's one from molly mccook. 'when you flush the toilet, where does it go?' that sounds like an engineering question, so we'll ask commander charles tucker, our chief engineer. trip."
"pause it, will you?"
"a poop question, sir? can't i talk about the warp reactor or the transporter?"
it's a perfectly valid question.
"the first thing you've got to understand is we recycle pretty much everything on a starship. that includes waste, and the first thing that happens to the waste is it gets processed through a machine called a bio-matter resequencer. then it gets broken down into. hold on."
they're going to think i'm the sanitation engineer.
you're doing fine.
"so the waste is broken down into little molecules and then they get transformed into any number of things we can use on the ship. cargo containers, insulation, boots, you name it."
"very enlightening, commander. gabrielle witty wants to know if germs can live in space."
"ah, i believe i can answer that, captain. hello, children. i'm doctor phlox, the ship's physician. i'm from a system called denobula triaxa and i feel very honoured to be part of this important mission. germs. they may be tiny but they are among the most resilient organisms known to medical science. they can survive almost anywhere, on your kitchen counter, under your fingernail, in the vacuum of space. over two hundred million space-dwelling microbes have been catalogued. one of the most virulent species lives inside grains of interstellar dust. polycocyx astris. they can drift in a dormant state for millions of years and still cause a nasty cold. i once discovered a peculiar colony of spores on the hull of a"
"thank you, doctor. fascinating. i think we've taken up enough of miz malvin's classroom time. by the way, we've included some pictures of a comet we're studying. we think it might be the biggest one ever discovered by humans or vulcans. that's what's so exciting about being on enterprise. you never know what you're going to find next. we miss earth, but hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home. captain archer, out."
how'd it go?
"the beauty of ice is that it records everything like a blank page. the farther down you drill, the farther back in time you go."
lieutenant.
yes?
what do you think?
hand me the plasma torch.
archer to lieutenant reed.
"go ahead, sir."
"how are you doing, malcolm?"
we're just about to set the charges.
i'm sure i don't need to remind you we're being observed.
"no, sir."
we want this to go as smoothly as possible.
make a good impression.
right.
"so tell me,"
who's the sculptor?
"it won't be there for long, sir."
archer out.
any luck?
sorry it took so long. the code was pretty complex.
what's it say?
it's in vulcan. you'll have to run it through the translation matrix.
you didn't read it?
i didn't feel it'd be right.
thanks.
come in.
"well, we decrypted the message."
and?
it's not exactly what we expected. it's a letter.
what did it say?
it's personal.
what do you mean?
"very personal. you could order me to tell you, sir, but you wouldn't be happy if i did."
why the hell was it encrypted?
"that's what i want to know. maybe vulcans encrypt all their personal letters. all they had to do was send it through regular channels, mark it personal, and we'd have left it alone. but no, they had to encrypt it, force me to start snooping. i feel like i got caught with my hand in the cookie jar."
"let it go, trip. come on, it was an honest mistake."
i can't let it go. i've got to tell her.
how's that going to help?
it's the right thing to do. at least i'll be able to look her in the eye without feeling guilty.
you're a good man. you might want to take a phase pistol with you.
i might need one.
got a minute? in private?
"excuse us, crewman."
"did you ever, did you ever do anything totally by mistake that you weren't very proud of?"
no.
"did you ever come across something that you thought was one thing so you reacted in a certain way, but then it turned out to be something completely different?"
"your point, commander?"
i found out about your message from the vulcan ship.
it was a personal matter.
why wasn't it sent through normal starfleet channels?
that takes time. the letter was important.
so they sent it in code? do you have any idea how suspicious that looked?
you read my letter?
"believe me, i don't feel very good about it."
i have more letters in my quarters. would you like to read those as well?
i'm trying to apologise here.
archer to t'pol.
"yes, captain."
please report to my ready room.
has anyone else read the letter?
no.
i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention it.
"i won't, i promise."
"i thought i'd invite captain vanik for a visit. if he's so interested in how we do things, he might as well come see for himself. once he realises we're not going to blow up the galaxy, maybe he'll leave us alone."
i'm sure he'll appreciate the gesture.
dinner's a good way to break the ice. i was hoping you might give chef some menu suggestions.
certainly.
"a little food, a little wine."
vulcans don't drink wine.
you know what i mean. just help me make him go away.
when did these symptoms begin?
two days ago.
perhaps you slept in an awkward position.
i haven't slept.
for two days? something on your mind? it appears to be a tension headache. you know anything said between us is strictly confidential. would you like to talk about what's troubling you?
no.
"i don't know if there's anyone on this ship you would feel comfortable talking with, but if there is, it might feel good to get whatever's bothering you out in the open.  this is a simple analgesic. i can give you something later to help you sleep this evening, if you'd like."
"thank you, doctor."
the ears are a nice touch.
i thought so.
we should get out more often.
don't get too comfortable. this landscape is about to change. reed to enterprise.
go ahead.
charges are set.
stand by. inform the vulcans we're about to make a very loud noise.
"aye, sir."
archer to reed.
"yes, captain."
blast away.
understood.
impressive.
i was hoping for a little more symmetry.
i'll get the drill.
"if i'm not mistaken, you're flying a surak class ship."
you're not mistaken.
"you can get her up to, what, six, six point five?"
six point five.
i'd love to get a look inside those nacelles.
our warp systems are classified.
"a few years back i was a guest aboard a maymora class ship, the yarahla. captain tok. do you know him?"
not personally.
"oh. we made a run to a dark matter nebula. i helped set up the graviton telescope. most fun i've ever had on a space walk. those vulcan ev suits are something else, like you're flying around inside your own little starship."
you're easily impressed.
something wrong with your pok tar?
no.
"if it's not to your liking, i'm sure our chef can prepare you something else."
i've already eaten.
hope you saved room for dessert.
"after dinner, i thought you might like to take a look around. enterprise may not be surak class, but she's quite a ship."
perhaps another time.
tea?
i only drink water.
"you know, for people who claim not to be explorers, you sure do get around."
i hope our presence here is not proving inconvenient.
"on the contrary, it's nice to know no matter how big the universe is, there's always a vulcan ship nearby."
"so, captain, tell us about yourself."
excuse me?
"on earth, it's customary to exchange personal information with someone you've just met."
we have this peculiar habit of actually talking during meals.
i've noticed. what would you like to know?
"i don't know. where were you born, how long have you been captain, any hobbies?"
"i've served in the vulcan space programme for seventy six years, fifteen of them commanding the ti'mur."
i believe this is captain vanik's first visit aboard an earth vessel.
we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
i have none. humans have never held much interest for me.
"well, where did the time go? seems like you just got here. i'm sure you're eager to get back to your ship so i'll trouble you with just one last question.  how long to you plan on spying on us?"
"if we were spying, captain, you would have never detected our presence. your inexperience and your arrogance are your enemies, not us."
please show captain vanik to the launch bay.
shanshot tumora camosh.
what'd he say?
"captain, you should take a look at this."
archer to lieutenant reed.
"go ahead, sir."
how's it going?
"we hit a layer of magnesite and cracked a drill bit, but we've replaced it."
you may want to pick up the pace a little bit.
sir?
the comet's rotational axis shifted when you set off those charges. in about two hours the shuttlepod will be facing the star.
the temperature's going to shoot up by a couple of hundred degrees. i want you out of there before then.
"we'll be done with time to spare, sir."
be sure you are. archer out.
come in.
you decide to tell me what vanik said?
"please, sit down."
i've never seen your quarters before. cozy.
you know you're not supposed to have an open flame on the ship.
i was given permission from the captain. they're for meditation.
"so, what can i do for you?"
doctor phlox believes that it might help if i was to discuss my problem with someone i felt comfortable confiding in.
"you want to talk to me? well, i'm not sure i'm going to be much help. i mean, i've only been in three relationships and they all went bust. are you sure you wouldn't rather talk to hoshi or ensign kimball? she's married."
"you were far from my first choice, but speaking with someone else would mean more people knowing about my situation."
i'll do anything i can. what's your problem?
you read the letter.
yes.
"then you know that unless i leave enterprise immediately, my wedding plans will be cancelled."
have you talked to?
koss.
have you talked to koss about all this?
we haven't spoken in many years. marriages on vulcan are arranged during childhood. i've only met koss four times.
how can you be in love with a guy you've only met four times?
it's assumed that we'd eventually develop an affection for one another.
so his parents send you an ultimatum? he doesn't have a say?
his parents planned the union. it's their decision.
"boy. where i come from, arranged marriages went out with slavery."
are you going to give me advice or criticize my people's tradition.
i'm still a little fuzzy on why they threatened to call it off in the first place.
the ceremony was supposed to take place next week. when i decided to remain on enterprise i requested a postponement. koss's parents were insulted that i would put off our plans to serve on a human vessel.
"well, vanik can take you home. why don't you go marry koss, then come back?"
it's customary for a husband and wife to reside together for at least one vulcan year.
maybe he can come to enterprise.
he's an architect. it would be illogical for him to live aboard a starship.
this whole thing sounds illogical.
"your advice, commander."
what do you want to do?
that is irrelevant.
"no, it's not. it's very relevant. do you want to go back and marry this guy, spend a year with him, ten years, a hundred years, or do you want to stay on enterprise?"
i have an obligation.
you've got an obligation to yourself. you've spent the last year around humans. if there's one thing you should have learned it's that we're free to make our own decisions. there's a lot to be said for personal choice.
"if you'd spent the last year on vulcan, you would have learned that our commitment to tradition outweighs personal choice."
"i respect your customs, but this marriage was arranged when you were a kid. a lot's happened since then. people change."
vulcan's don't.
really.
"my obligation is to my culture, my heritage. it has to take precedence."
sounds to me like you already made up your mind. why the hell did you ask me here?
it was a mistake. i apologise.
did it ever occur to you that you might have postponed the wedding because subconsciously you wanted to get out of it?
that would imply that my subconscious mind controls my decisions. it doesn't.
well it happens to humans all the time. maybe you're picking up some of our bad habits.
travis!
i'm okay. ah!
what?
my knee.
you rest here.
i'm all right.
okay.
"well, let's get you to the pod. i'll come back for the gear if there's time."
at least take the core sample. we shouldn't go back to the ship empty-handed.
almost there.
it might be faster without the suits.
"yes, and a lot colder."
what's that?
i hope i never see snow again.
you all right?
we should have never ignited the thrusters.
"well, it's not like we had a choice."
you two okay?
more or less. how far did we drop?
about eighteen metres. we'll get you out of there.
just give us a few minutes.
we're not going anywhere.
bring the grappler online.
the mouth of that chasm's a little narrow.
i'll get you in close enough.
do you see them?
bring us in another fifty metres. two metres starboard. a little more.
the vulcan ship's hailing us.
"take a message, i'm busy."
captain vanik wants to know if we require assistance.
tell him we've got everything under control.
"there, right there. synchronise to the rotation. almost got it."
"one hit, one miss."
one'll be fine. reel them in.
the pod's hit an outcropping. it's wedged in. take us a few metres to port. we might be able to pull them around it. those eisilium deposits are disrupting the maglock. i'm losing them.
ease them back down.
they've fallen another nine metres.
let's try it again.
"captain, they're moving out of the sunlight. the surface ice is recrystallising."
in less than an hour that chasm will be sealed up again.
then we'd better hurry.
there is another option. captain vanik.
i'd rather leave him out of this.
his ship has a tractor beam that won't be affected by the eisilium.
reset the grappler.
vanik offered to assist us. there's no shame in accepting.
we can do this on our own.
"i don't like him any more than you do, captain, but a tractor beam sounds like a pretty good idea right now."
"vanik expects you to refuse his offer. he sees humans as arrogant, prideful. why not prove him wrong? you can save them, or you can let your pride stand in the way. you're human. you're free to choose."
they've got us.
"go ahead, enterprise."
this is captain vanik of the vulcan ship ti'mur. stand by to ignite your engines and return to your ship.
"i thought you might want to take a look at the data we collected. you helped us bring it back, it's the least we can do."
"as your science officer told you, we have little interest in comets."
that tractor beam of yours is quite something. any chance we could take a look at the specifications?
that information is classified.
i thought it might be.
we'll be leaving within the hour. is there anything else we can help you with?
you've done more than enough. see you around.
you don't have much time. i assume you're all packed.
"captain, with your permission, i'd like to transmit a message to the ti'mur, to send to vulcan."
go right ahead.
thank you.
what was that all about?
it's personal.
morning everyone.
"morning, sir."
what have we got today?
we've detected several phenomenon. a j'ral class supernova remnant approximately three light years off our course.
that's interesting. what else?
a cluster of three neutron stars. very unusual.
"how about that, three stone-cold stars. pretty exciting, huh?"
anything else?
there is one other thing that might be worth swinging by to take a look. a minshara class planet about four and a half light years away.
any life signs?
"only about five hundred million. if our scans are right, it looks like there's a whole civilisation down there."
you might have put that on the top of the list.
put us into orbit at five hundred kilometres.
i'm not picking up any other ships or satellites.
should we hail them?
who? i'm picking up dozens of cities on each continent.
let's hold off a second. we don't know whether they're using high-band frequencies or smoke signals.
the latter's more likely. i'm not detecting any em transmissions.
pre-industrial?
let's take a closer look.
"do you see that, just off the coast."
i've got it.
looks like an old clipper ship.
it's almost like travelling back in time.
i cannot wait to get down there.
i'd advise against that. it's standard protocol to wait until a society develops warp drive before initiating first contact.
"those are vulcan protocols, not human."
starfleet would be wise to adopt them. there's no way to know how our arrival would affect the evolution of their society.
so what are you suggesting we do?
our sensors can gather a great deal of data from orbit.
"give me a tighter view of the city, hoshi."
can you get tight enough to see their faces?
"freeze that. they don't look so different. what do you think, trip?"
"i think you're right, captain."
you'd be recognised immediately as outsiders.
"not if we look like them. starfleet could've sent a probe out here to make maps and take pictures, but they didn't. they sent us so we could explore with our own senses."
you okay?
the acoustic relay is picking up dozens of languages. i could spend the next ten years studying this place.
"well, let's hear some of it."
it'll take a while to work out a translation matrix for all of them. we'll be able to narrow it down for you once we pick a landing site. i did find the one word you might want to remember. akaali. it's the name of their species.
a farm?
"it's remote and sparsely populated. if you're exposed, there's a reduced risk of cultural contamination."
"this must be why aliens are always landing in cornfields. so, who do we send first?"
"it should stand up to scrutiny as long as you don't look too close. here, see for yourself."
it itches.
"you mustn't touch it, ensign. the irritation will subside."
are you sure i'm the right person for this?
"if the translator goes down, you'll be able to handle yourself better than any of us."
the anterior crests aren't quite symmetrical. i'll just add a little more definition to the right side.
we don't need it to be too perfect.
"of course, captain."
t'pol to archer.
go ahead.
please report to the bridge.
is there a problem?
i'm detecting neutrino emissions from a city on the eastern continent.
what's causing it?
possibly an antimatter reactor.
these people don't even have indoor plumbing.
maybe some of them are more advanced than others.
or maybe we're not the first visitors. what about non-indigenous biosigns?
"i'm not reading any, but at this range it's hard to be certain."
"trip, t'pol, let's head down to sickbay.  let the quartermaster know we'll need three more sets of clothing."
my feet would be a lot happier in my own boots.
what's this?
identification papers. everyone in the city has to carry them.
t'pol.
t'pol.
over here.
i've got it too. the reactor's about eight metres under this building.
looks like some kind of curio shop.
i guess we'll have to wait until morning.
there could be a lot more people around then. it might be easier to get a look at this thing tonight.
except we're on the wrong side of this door.
not for long.
"seventy eight light years to get here, our first act is breaking and entering."
maybe you don't have to mention this part in your log?
trip.
going as fast as i can.
archer to t'pol.
"go ahead, captain."
i think we found what we're looking for.
acknowledged. we'll meet at your coordinates.
back here.
the neutrino emissions are off the meter. it's got to be through here.
it's some kind of magnetic barrier.
can you disable it?
i'll try.
who are you? what did you do to that door?
"nothing, honest."
i want to know what you're doing here.
you don't need to point that weapon at us. we're collectors. we're picking up an antique.
a real collector would've waited until the shop was open. you're not here to pick up any antiques. i've been watching the shop for weeks. i know all about your evening deliveries.
deliveries?
people are getting sick. some are even dying because of what's going on in here. did you know that? move away from the door.
was that necessary?
she was armed.
"let's try not to shoot anyone else while we're here, okay?"
i'll try.
"the reactor signature's coming from the other side of that door, but it's protected by some kind of energy field."
we should go. it'll be dawn soon.
what about her? we can't just leave her here.
hoshi.
"her name's riann, she's an apothecary."
i'll meet you back at the shuttle.
what did you do to me?
nothing. you just collapsed.
that's the second lie you've told me. you're not very good at it. why did you bring me back here. did garos tell you to? are you working for him?
garos?
you don't know who i'm talking about. he owns the shop you broke into.
i'm not working for anyone. i just wanted to make sure you got home all right.
"wait. if you don't work for him, what were you doing in there?"
"there's something strange going on in that shop. i don't know what, exactly, but i'm trying to figure it out. i'm an investigator from another city."
which city? who sent you?
"i can't tell you anymore than that, not right now."
i suppose telling me nothing is better than another lie.
my colleague's waiting for me. i've got to go. you said something about a sickness. i wanted to come back tomorrow and talk to you about it. will you be here?
you didn't tell me your name.
jon.
jon. how far away is this city?
"even if we flatten the building with a torpedo barrage, it probably wouldn't make a dent in that energy field."
"what about the shop itself, can you scan underneath it?"
that's strange. sensors aren't
"picking up anything under the shop. no basement, no bedrock. it's like the building's sitting on nothing at all."
there must be some kind of dampening field in place.
"keep you sensors locked on that shop. if you notice anything else out of the ordinary, let me know right away."
understood.
"that woman, riann, said something about people getting sick."
"i think we may have seen some of them. mottled skin, lesions on their faces."
"if we can get one of these people to the ship, doctor phlox might be able to tell us what's wrong with them."
"i'd advise against that. if i'm not mistake, the fear of alien abduction caused a great deal of apprehension on your planet for centuries. perhaps we should talk to the shopkeeper first."
"welcome, gentlemen. if i don't have what you're looking for, i'm certain i can find someone who does. can i help you?"
we noticed antiques in the window. my friend here is an amateur collector.
were you looking for something in particular?
these are interesting.
you won't find a more varied collection in the entire city. this is the pride of my entire collection.
who's it supposed to be?
"draylan, the mythical ruler of the afterworld."
"you're not from this province, are you?"
"no, and neither are you. your dna doesn't match any other lifeform on this planet."
nor does yours. i see why you have a fondness for masks. who are you?
i'm captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. we're explorers from the planet earth.
earth? i never heard of it. how did you know i was here?
we picked up the signature from your reactor.
"now that you know who we are, maybe you could tell us what you're doing here."
"i'm an explorer as well. at least, i used to be. i'm from the malurian system. two years ago i led a survey mission to study the akaali. we had no plans to remain here, but after a few months i found myself quite taken with these people, so i decided to stay."
"if you enjoy the simple life so much, why do you have an antimatter reactor in your basement?"
"there's nothing nefarious about it, i assure you. the reactor powers a fabrication device. it allows me to make food and clothing."
"i don't know if you've heard, but there's an illness spreading through this area. some people seem to think you're the cause of it."
i see you've met our apothecary.
you know her?
"she's been making baseless accusations against me for months. there's a lethal virus spreading among the akaali, but it's indigenous. i certainly didn't bring it here. unfortunately these people don't have the medical technology to cure it, so this woman blames the newcomer, me."
"if you wouldn't mind, we'd like to take a look at this reactor of yours."
"perhaps some other time, captain. excuse me. welcome. if i don't have what you're looking for i'm certain i can find someone who does. gentlemen."
his reactor's got an awful lot of power for a fabrication device.
he could probably feed and clothe half the continent with it.
archer to t'pol.
go ahead.
how soon can you meet us?
yes.
hello again.
hello. who's your friend?
her name's t'pol. she's helping me investigate garos's shop. you two have something in common. t'pol is a scientist as well.
your facility's impressive. would you mind?
if you're careful not to touch anything. you two are from the same province?
not exactly.
must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to yourself.
"i'm sorry, i don't mean to be evasive."
"yes, you do."
"turn down that flame, please."
i was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about this illness.
why don't you tell me why you were in garos's shop.
"we were trying to get into the basement. we think there's some kind of machine there, something he's not supposed to have."
what kind of machine?
"we're not sure, but it may be indirectly connected to this epidemic. if you can tell us what you know, we might be able to help."
"i can't tell you much. people are dying and i can't determine why. drop this in the water, carefully. i learned of the epidemic about eighteen months ago. my brother was one of the first victims."
i'm sorry.
"at first i thought it was some kind of airborne contagion, but it never spread beyond this part of the city. i'm sampled the soil, the water, i can't find anything out of the ordinary."
why do you believe this garos is involved?
the first cases occurred here
a few hundred metres from his shop. that was just one month after he arrived.
you said something about evening deliveries.
"every few nights, someone carries crates from his shop to different places outside the city. when i've gone back in the morning, crates are gone. hand me that."
that's why you were watching his shop. you thought we were there for the crates.
tea. would you like some?
"jon, may i speak with you?"
i'd love a cup.
did you get what you need?
i should return to the ship and begin my analysis.
"all right, you and the others head back."
what about you?
"i'll stay here, see if i can earn more about garos and these shipments."
"the longer you remain, the more you risk cultural contamination."
these people are suffering from something a lot worse than cultural contamination. we've got to find out what it is.
enjoy your tea.
quite impressive. did you say this is a pre-industrial society?
yes.
"her methods may be unrefined, but this woman is using forensic techniques far more sophisticated than i would've expected. isn't it extraordinary? thousands of sentient species in our little corner of the cosmos, each one discovering science in their own unique way."
had this woman been born on vulcan or earth i'm sure she would have made a fine physician. here's our culprit. the water sample's contaminated with tetracyanate 622.
i'm not familiar with it.
"it's a synthetic compound primarily used as an industrial lubricant, usually under the strictest safety protocols. it's quite toxic."
could this be responsible for the epidemic?
"if it's managed to seep into the ground water, absolutely."
i'll notify the captain.
samples from three new subjects indicate no
did you say something?
sorry. i mutter when i'm writing sometimes. it's an old habit.
i have a similar one. i talk to my dog.
"my mother bought me a tousorobco once, but it tuployo pludak."
what was that?
are you all right?
all right? i'm all right.
"someone was walking this way, but he turned and went around the corner. i thought if we pretended to be"
i understand.
i want you to head back.
not before i see what's in those crates. help me open this.
move!
have you ever seen anything like that?
"actually, i have."
stay here.
jon!
it's all right. he's not dead.
"is there anything else you'd like to tell me, jon?"
if your ship can travel to so many stars then why would you come here?
to meet you.
me?
"not you personally, but your people."
why? we're so backward compared to you.
if you take away our technology we're not that different.
come on.
they're mining some kind of veridium isotope.
veridium is primarily used to manufacture explosives.
i'm not surprised.
did you find any traces of tetracyanate?
their drill bits are saturated with it. we've got to shut this all down. the reactor seems to be powering the entire operation but i can't use my phase-pistol. i'd risk blowing up half the city.
"captain, let me come down there and take a crack at it."
i doubt that we have that much time. our best shot is the transporter. i'll see what i can do about disengaging that dampening field. give me a few minutes.
understood.
i don't suppose you read malurian.
can't you use your device?
it wasn't designed for that.
what are we looking for?
there's an energy field surrounding the shop. it's keeping my ship from seeing what's in here. one of these controls should turn it off.
"here. this is tengala street. here's the shop. this outline could have something to do with the energy field. wait, what are you doing?"
"if the blue line represents the dampening field, this blue button should control it."
what about the yellow dots?
what about them?
how do we know they don't represent the field? maybe it's the yellow button.
the blue one's lit.
that's what worries me.
we could debate this all day. blue or yellow?
blue.
there's a ship approaching.
from where?
it must have been in a geosynchonous orbit on the other side of the planet.
i'm picking up multiple weapon platforms. they're armed to the teeth.
we're being hailed from the surface.
the captain?
i don't think so.
on screen.
i suggest you leave this system at once or my ship will open fire.
i want to speak with captain archer.
that won't be possible. he's dead.
the ship's firing.
"my vessel is capable of firing ten of those charges simultaneously. again, i suggest you break orbit."
"how did you learn about this facility, captain? was it from a somewhat ugly tellarite merchant perhaps?"
i told you. we detected your reactor from orbit.
i forgot. you're explorers.
we're trying to help these people. what you're doing here is contaminating their water supply.
"there are five hundred million akaali on this planet. a few thousand won't be missed. i'm willing to let you go, provided you promise not to return. we've instructed your ship to send down a launch vehicle to take you and the woman."
she belongs here.
"believe me, she'll be better off on your ship. now step away from the control panel, captain."
"if anyone walks through either of these doors, aim this and pull the trigger."
they're recharging weapons.
prepare to leave orbit on my order.
belay that! keep this ship right where it is.
"i don't have to reiterate that i outrank you, mister tucker. ensign."
engineering.
"billy, stand by to vent the nacelles on my order."
"yes, sir."
we're not going anywhere.
"i didn't say leave orbit, i said prepare to leave orbit. i have no intention of abandoning the captain, dead or alive."
the dampening field's down.
anything?
i've got a fix on it.
transfer the coordinates.
the forward hull plating's depolarising.
evasive manoeuvres. keep us within transporter range.
i'll try.
return fire.
they've got some kind of energy shielding. our weapons are ineffective.
it's the captain.
put him through.
how's it going up there?
a malurian vessel's opened fire. we're taking damage.
and the reactor?
we're trying to get a lock on it now.
are you all right? he said you'd been killed.
"don't worry about me, just get the reactor."
jon.
we've lost lateral thrusters.
"commander tucker, status."
this'd be a lot easier if you'd stop rocking the boat.
how long?
i've almost got a lock.
i can't shake them.
"even if we get the reactor, how are we going to keep them from taking it back?"
"if they want it so badly, maybe we should give it to them."
i've got a lock.
(starboard tube's loaded.
"stand by to go to full impulse. now, commander."
fire.
their shielding is down.
"come about, ensign. target their weapons array."
the oil lamp.
what about it?
there should be at least a litre of residic oil in the container below it. residic oil ignites at three hundred and ninety eight degrees. you wouldn't happen to have anything that gets that hot?
archer.
"the reactor's been destroyed, captain. we've disarmed the malurian ship. should we disable their engines?"
"no. they're about to leave, but first they need to pick up three passengers. archer out. i don't think you're going to have time to pack up your shop."
tell them to take the entire dose.
just one?
that's all they'll need.
what if garos comes back?
i've notified t'pol's people. they're going to look in on you from time to time.
they could stop by for tea.
you bet. it's probably best if you keep all this to yourself.
who'd believe me anyway? where is your starship headed now?
"there are lots of inhabited planets to see, but i doubt many will be this memorable."
is your translator broken again?
i'm sorry? i don't understand a word you're saying.
hauled down in the corner of the end zone. touchdown!
like to see you make that catch with the gravity plating at earth sea level.
i doubt you could throw the ball ten metres on earth.
one more reason not to go.
did you find out what was causing that vibration in module two?
"the cargo handlers at jupiter station. they didn't balance the load. shaw and i, we, er, we trimmed it out."
keep an eye on it.
"bridge to captain keene. we're under attack, sir. it's the nausicaans."
drop out of warp. charge the plasma cannon.
archer.
"sorry to disturb you sir, but i have an incoming transmission from starfleet command. it's admiral forrest."
put him through.
"yes, sir."
admiral. good to see you.
"you too, jon, what i can make out."
we're getting ready to deploy the first subspace amplifier. should clear up reception a bit.
whatever you have to do to keep those reports coming. the scans of that comet were incredible.
something tells me you didn't call at four in the morning to talk about comets.
"i hate to do this to you jon, but we're turning you around."
sir?
"we picked up an automated distress signal from a cargo freighter, the ecs fortunate. the nearest starfleet vessel is three weeks away at its maximum warp, but you could be there in a day and a half."
what's the problem?
we're not sure. they're not responding to hails. i'd like you to check this out. give them any assistance they need.
we're on our way.
forrest out.
i think our day's going to start a little early.
"the earth cargo ship fortunate. y-class freighter, maximum speed warp one point eight. crew complement twenty three."
not counting newborn babies.
ensign?
"i grew up on a j-class, a little smaller but the same basic design, and one thing i can tell you is that at warp one point eight you've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. that's how my parents wound up with me."
do you have any helpful information on this vessel beyond its recreational activities?
"for example, what kind of weapons they carry."
"well, typically nothing more than a low-yield plasma cannon, but most freight haulers would've upgraded the first chance they got."
why is that?
"think about it. you're a dozen light years from home with twenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold, armed with nothing but a pop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. what would you do?"
i'm reading hull damage. their warp reactor's offline and most of their primary systems are down.
any other ships in the region.
"none, captain."
"open a channel. fortunate, this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. fortunate, please respond."
their comm. systems may be down.
i'm reading twenty four biosigns.
have doctor phlox meet us in the launch bay.
easy does it. there's a lot of debris out here.
aye sir.
some of it doesn't appear to be from the fortunate.
"on the bright side, i'm only picking up inorganic material. no bodies."
the main hatch is damaged. no chance we'll get a positive seal.
there should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side.
permission to come aboard.
"granted. i'm matthew ryan, first officer."
"jonathan archer, captain of the enterprise. sorry we couldn't meet under better circumstances. what happened here?"
nausicaans. they tried to board us. we managed to fight them off but not before we took a few bruises.
nausicaans?
"pirates, sir. they've been attacking freighters in this sector for years. my parents had a run-in with them once. they were lucky to come out of it alive."
your parents ran freight?
"still do. an old j-class, the horizon."
i've got repair teams standing by. what can we do?
"oh, we can handle this ourselves, captain, but thank you."
"if you didn't need our help, why did you send out a distress call?"
"one of our younger crewmembers panicked, hit the emergency beacon. with our comm. down we had no way to tell starfleet to ignore it."
where's your captain?
he was wounded in the attack. i'm in command until he's back on his feet. i'm sorry we took valuable time away from your mission.
"mister ryan, i'm a physician. if your captain or anyone else is hurt, it wouldn't be right for me to leave without seeing them."
he's got a lot more experience than any freighter medic i know.
we've come an awfully long way. it would be a shame to turn around without lending a hand.
is he going to die?
not any time soon. the nausicaan weapon disrupted his neural pathways. i've started him on a cortical regeneration but it'll take some time.
how long?
"two days, maybe three."
"since we have to stick around, we might as well help you get your ship up and running."
that's all right.
"i understand you're used to doing things on your own, but we're here. use us. we might be able to upgrade your hull plating, your weapons. couldn't hurt the next time you run into these nausicaans. the sooner you're back at warp, the sooner that cargo you're hauling gets to where it's supposed to go."
you're letting them send over more people?
"a few engineers, that's all."
we can't have people crawling all over the place.
we'll keep them where they're supposed to be.
and what if they find him?
"what do you want me to do, throw him off the ship?"
anything? keep at it. i want those codes.
"trip'll get a kick out of this, it's older than he is. the quartermaster won't have anything like it but engineering should be able to make one for you."
we've got our own machine shop.
i'm sure your guys have their hands full. we're happy to do it.
that's a transporter.
enterprise came with all the trimmings.
i've read about them. have you been through it?
"not yet. most of the crew is afraid, but i'm kind of curious to try it out."
they say that for a split second you can actually feel yourself in both places at once.
why do you think i want to try it.
so you were on the horizon?
"i was born on her, halfway between draylax and vega colony."
how do your parents feel about you leaving?
"i've still got my sister and her husband aboard the horizon, but i know my dad expected me to take over at some point."
then why'd you leave?
"i had to figure out where i wanted to spend the rest of my life, and i was pretty sure it wasn't on the draylax - vega run. besides, the horizon didn't have transporters to play with."
"these valve seals are shot. we'll have to synthesise some new ones. give me about forty minutes. if you want, our resident boomer here can give you a tour."
thanks. i've already seen most of the ship.
you missed the best part. the only warp five engine in the fleet.
i've heard about it.
once they get installed in the next generation of freighters it'll change a whole lot of things.
even with a warp three engine you'd be able to cut a five year cargo run down to six months.
warp one point eight works just fine for us. any faster and there'd be no time to enjoy the trip.
"save room for dessert, home made ice-cream."
you eat this well all the time?
chef's the best in starfleet. i heard the captain had to call in a lot of favours to get him on board. it's good you stayed away from the resequenced meat loaf. they still haven't gotten that right.
resequenced? this tastes real.
that's because it is.
you know the last time i had a steak? eighteen months ago. all we've got left now are hydroponics and nutri-paks.
i remember those. what did we used to call them?
mystery meals.
my dad was a pretty good cook. he could do magical things with those nutri-paks.
when it was someone's birthday my mother would bake a cake. we knew batter than to ask what it was made of.
didn't stop you from eating it.
"oh, no way."
your parents on the fortunate?
no. they were on the north star.
were you on board?
"yeah, i was one of the survivors. i went to the fortunate after that."
i'm sorry.
running freight is dangerous.
you ever think about doing something else?
you mean join starfleet?
the food's not bad.
was this premeditated? buy me lunch and give me the recruiting pitch?
"no, but you've spent more time in space than most starfleet captains. there are three more nx class ships on the drawing boards. they're going to need experienced people."
"if starfleet gets all the good crews, who does that leave to run the freighters?"
"don't worry, not everybody's going to go."
you did.
you think leaving the horizon was easy for me? that i just took off because i got tired of the food? that ship was my home.
so why'd you leave it? why did you abandon your family.
"being in starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me. my parents weren't happy i left, but they respected my decision."
did they? or were they just saying what you wanted to hear so you wouldn't feel guilty. commander tucker should be done with my valve assembly by now. thanks for lunch.
come on.
why is power being rerouted from internal sensors to the weapons systems?
maybe you didn't notice. we were in a battle.
the battle is over. i'll remove the bypass.
that's all right. you can just leave them.
"ready or not, here i come. have you seen nadine?"
no.
have you seen nadine?
"i'm sorry, i don't know which child is named nadine."
thanks.
i just told him the truth.
t'pol to archer.
go ahead.
"the repairs are almost finished, captain."
acknowledged.
"but there is something i need to speak to you about, in private."
those engine parts mister tucker gave you working out okay?
"some of the connections were off by a few microns, but they should be fine."
good. doctor phlox tells me captain keene's condition is improving.
"well he's still unconscious but the burns are healing, thanks to your doctor."
anything else we can do?
"thanks, but we're anxious to get underway. goodbye, captain."
there's one other question i'd like to ask you. are there only humans on board your ship?
"i think one of the kids has a teneebian skunk as a pet, if that's what you mean."
it isn't.
t'pol's scanner picked up a nausicaan biosign.
are you saying we've got a stowaway?
you know that's not what we're saying. why don't you tell us what's going on over there.
"well, what are you talking about?"
my bioscans indicated this nausicaan was injured.
"okay. not that it's any of your business, but there is a nausicaan aboard. he's my prisoner."
what gives you the right to take prisoners?
"they have been attacking our ship for months, stealing our cargo. they nearly killed my captain. now what gives them the right to do that?"
i want to see him.
and what would you do? take him back to nausicaa? they'd probably give him a medal.
what do you plan to do with him?
that is my business. starfleet doesn't have any jurisdiction over what goes on aboard my ship.
"you're right, but there is one thing i do have jurisdiction over. archer to tucker."
"go ahead, captain."
i want you to remove all the spare parts and equipment you installed on the fortunate.
sir?
"you heard me, trip."
you wouldn't do that.
watch me.
he's in there.
where?
he's tied up over there.
"i'm reading one biosign, but it's not nausicaan."
don't do this.
get down.
"under the circumstances, i defer to your experience."
ryan! you're making a big mistake.  go.
"captain, there's a breach."
ryan!
what was that?
what the hell's going on over there?
there are four biosigns on the module. it's the away team.
tucker to captain archer.
are you all right?
we're fine. i don't want the fortunate leaving.
understood. hail them.
no response.
they're charging weapons.
polarise the hull plating.
the fortunate has fired its weapons.
"trip, report."
"they're getting a little trigger-happy, sir. stand by. load starboard tubes three and four. target their engines."
"aye, sir."
they're jettisoning our pod. their warp drive's coming online.
fire.
enterprise to archer.
"how're you doing, trip?"
"we're okay, sir. we didn't take too much damage, but the fortunate just went to warp."
follow them.
"captain, considering our rate of decompression, i'd suggest enterprise retrieve us as quickly as possible."
"belay that, trip. send a shuttlepod over here to pick us up. we've sprung a leak."
on our way.
"we're trying to track their warp trail, but their plasma cannon knocked out our long range sensors."
how long till they're back online?
mister tucker says at least four hours.
"we don't know where they are, but we know who they're looking for. the nausicaans. ryan's after revenge, sir."
"a very primitive emotion, but it would explain his irrational behaviour."
"it's rational to him. those pirates attacked his ship. that's his family. if we want to find the fortunate, we need to find the nausicaans."
the frequencies.
you're not very skilled at interrogation. i could give you some lessons.
give me the frequencies.
you know my shipmates will come for me.
i'm counting on it.
"that wasn't so difficult, was it."
you nearly killed him.
remodulate the weapons.
what about the nausicaan?
keep him locked up. we might still need him.
we've got what we wanted. let's just get him off the ship.
how?
an escape pod.
so his friends can pick him up and he can tell them to change their shield modulations? what was the point of all this?
i've been asking myself the same question. we've always dealt with the nausicaans without taking hostages or beating information out of them.
"if we don't show them that we're serious, they're never going to leave us alone."
how would the captain want us to handle this?
"i'm responsible for this ship now, and i need to know that you are going to help me do whatever it takes to protect her."
we've taken enough casualties. it's time we started inflicting some of our own.
anything?
no. try bypassing circuit l-47.
"aye, sir."
i don't know what's going on with that guy. i can understand taking on those pirates. i probably would have done the same thing. but firing on a starfleet vessel? he's got a lot more than pirates to worry about now.
"never thought i'd see a y-class running from any ship i was on. when i was growing up on the horizon, anything that happened on board you handles yourself. if someone on the crew got into a fight, you just worked it out. you took care of your own. if starfleet suddenly showed up and told my father what he could and couldn't do on his own ship?"
things are changing. ryan's going to have to figure that out.
maybe he already has and he just doesn't like it.
got it. sensors are back online.
come in.
"do you have a minute, sir?"
i think i can squeeze you in.
"what's on your mind, travis?"
"permission to speak freely, sir?"
any time.
i'm worried that we're not handling the situation the right way.
go on.
you know i'd never question your orders.
you served on one of those freighters. i want to hear your opinion.
"maybe ryan's right. maybe this isn't any of our business. if he doesn't want our help, why force it on him."
so you think we should just let ryan take on the nausicaans?
"don't underestimate a freighter crew, sir. my father never ran into any trouble he couldn't handle himself, nausicaans included."
so what happens to the nausicaans?
sir?
suppose ryan finds the ship that attacked him. maybe it's been damaged and the fortunate is more than a match for them. what do you think ryan'll do?
he'd probably try to blow them out of the sky.
"i don't know about you, travis, but that doesn't sit right with me. human beings have a code of behaviour that applies whether they're starfleet officers or space boomers, and it isn't driven by revenge. just because someone isn't born on earth doesn't make him any less human."
"you're right, sir. i suppose i should understand that more than anyone."
any other orders of mine you'd like to question?
"not today, sir. thank you, sir."
are you sure?
i've seen that hull signature enough times.
the new shield frequencies?
loaded and standing by.
"bring the cannons online, drop out of warp."
"they're just sitting there, a hundred kilometres ahead near a small asteroid."
put it on the viewer.
they've seen us. lay in an intercept course. full impulse.
we're closing. twenty kilometres. they're firing. the hull plating is holding.
can you get a weapons lock?
we're out of range.
then get us into range.
"ten kilometres, nine. cannons locked on target."
return fire.
they've gone behind the asteroid. i've lost the lock.
this must be where they offload stolen cargo.
i'm getting us out of here.
hold your course.
ryan!
we still have their shield frequencies. lock weapons on the first ship and fire.
again.
no effect.
are you sure you programmed the right frequencies?
i used the ones he gave us.
go to warp!
the reactor is offline.
"full impulse, then. hull plating to maximum."
we've lost impulse. they're hailing us.
our scans show you have one of our crewmen aboard. i assume you're here to return him.
he's our prisoner.
he won't be for long.
they've latched onto us.
"captain, long range sensors are detecting weapons fire."
who's doing the shooting?
"it's difficult to be sure at this distance, sir. looks like some kind of plasma discharge. i can't rule out our boomer friends."
lay in a course.
"aye, sir."
"they're in the access corridor, section d."
how many?
three.
pass out weapons.
we know what they're after. why not just let them have him&gt;
"we fought them off before, we can do it again."
"it was one ship, not three."
weapons.
we should pull back.
"it's the fortunate, sir, and three smaller ships."
nausicaans.
polarise the hull plating. drop us out of warp. are we in range?
two hundred thousand kilometres ahead.
put it up.
there are four nausicaan biosigns on board the fortunate and i'm detecting weapon discharges.
hail the nausicaans.
"which ship, sir?"
lets see who answers.
we'd better get him to the infirmary.
he's going to be okay.
i told you they'd come for me.
shut up.
we're involved in a rescue operation.
there's a lot of firing going on for a rescue.
we want our crewman back.
he wouldn't be there if you hadn't attacked them in the first place.
perhaps we have an opportunity here to improve relations between your people and mine.
we're happy with our relations the way they are.
i have a proposal for you. we'll get your man back and then you'll let the fortunate continue on her way.
you're facing three of my ships. we are not interested in your proposals.
we've scanned your ships. mister reed.
fore and aft plasma cannons. i doubt those shields of theirs would hold up to our torpedoes.
"you're not sneaking up on an old freighter this time. this is an nx class starship. take a good look, because you'll be seeing more of them. now, you can reconsider my offer or you can take your chances."
"if you think you can convince them to return our crewman, do it quickly. otherwise we'll be forced to take our chances."
enterprise to ryan. this is jonathan archer. we're ten thousand metres off your starboard bow. i know you can hear me. why don't you think about what's best for your crew and let us help you?
what a relief. starfleet's come to save the day.
i've spoken
to the nausicaan captain. he's willing to let the fortunate go if you turn over his crewman.
"what, and you believe him? you believe they're just going to let us fly away?"
i've got an armoury of torpedoes that will make sure they do.
"what about next time, when another freighter gets jumped"
in the middle of nowhere. what then?
you've got a chance to stop this before anyone else gets hurt.
i'm dealing with them the only way they understand.
"one of the nausicaan ships has locked weapons on us, sir."
this has gone on long enough. now you're putting my crew in danger. release that hostage.
"he's my prisoner, and i'm going to handle"
this in my way.
"what are you going to do, kill him?"
"oh, you again."
"sir, with your permission. you think killing one of them is going to accomplish anything?"
"what, your captain decide a little boomer to boomer talk would persuade me?"
just shut up and listen to me. i don't give a damn about you any more.
i'm just thinking about my family.
what have they got to do with this?
what's going to happen to the next freighter that runs into the nausicaans? what if it's the horizon and they have to pay the price for your
stubborn stupidity.
i'm doing this for them.
the hell you are! this isn't about protecting cargo ships.
that is just what it's about.
"don't kid yourself into thinking you're doing this for some greater good. this is about revenge, nothing else."
"the nausicaan ships are firing, sir."
return fire. starboard tubes three and four.
you don't like me because i left the horizon to join starfleet. you're afraid that if more people do that there won't be anyone left to run the freighters. maybe you're right
maybe not. but if you don't let your hostage go
the nausicaans are going to kill you and your crew.
"port tubes one and two, fire."
and then there'll be twenty three fewer people out there to run those freighters.
no maybes.
hold your fire! take him.
"the nausicaans are powering down their weapons. they're moving off, sir."
need a hand?
"just a little stiff. thank your doctor for me. i've got some drilaxian whisky stashed away, if you'd like to join me."
i'm on duty.
"too bad. if you've never had it, you're missing one of the galaxy's real pleasures. i'm reducing mister ryan's rank to able crewman. he gets to spend the rest of the trip purging hydraulic pumps."
"if you think he's going to be a problem, we could take him back to earth."
"no, we take care of our own. besides, that would leave me a man short."
understood.
i made him my first officer because i trusted him with my ship. it's going to take him quite a while to earn that back.
"his intentions were good, but someone should teach him to accept help when it's offered."
"the ones that grew up out here feel they have some special claim, that this particular stretch of space is theirs. they see another ship within ten light years, they get jumpy."
they're going to be seeing a lot more ships than they're used to.
"the ships get faster. it's progress, i suppose. my family's been on the fortunate for three generations. now, i'm going to need at least a warp three engine to stay in business."
"maybe that's not so bad. at warp three, help's a lot closer than before. you won't have to go it alone."
"going it alone's all i've ever done, and for some of us it's the reason we're out here. a chance to prove ourselves."
i think you've already done that.
"well, we'll adapt, we always have, but things just won't be the same."
good luck.
sure you won't join me for that drink?
"thanks, but my crew's anxious to get underway. next time."
this wasn't part of our agreement.
you failed in your last mission. the klingon empire is intact. you knew there would be consequences.
"please, i won't disappoint you again."
"we'll restore it, but only if you succeed in your next mission."
but you're disabling me.
you won't need enhanced vision where you're going. proceed with the extraction.
hold the door. where were you last night?
i decided to turn in early.
"well, you didn't miss much."
what'd they show?
night of the killer androids.
that bad?
we've got fifty thousand movies in the database. there must be something worth watching.
you could always read a book.
lieutenant.
ensigns. enjoy the show last night? those were two hours of my life i'd rather have back.
"good morning, sir."
"morning, daniels. i thought this was taylor's shift."
"i switched with him, if that's all right with you."
no problem.
"sir, i noticed we changed course. may i ask why?"
there's a stellar nursery not far from here. we detected several ships inside. we thought we might go say hello.
"very good, sir. more orange juice?"
"no, thanks, i'm fine."
what have you got?
"we found one of the ships, sir."
put it up.
it appears to be a transport vessel.
hail them.
they're responding.
can i help you?
my name is archer. i'm captain of the starship enterprise. we're from earth. we thought we'd introduce ourselves.
pleased to meet you. what do you want?
nothing. we're new to this region and we're eager to make contact with other species.
oh.
"if you don't mind my asking, what brings you here?"
a job. i'm escorting a group of spiritually minded men on a pilgrimage to the great plume of agosoria.
"the, the what?"
"every eleven years, one of the protostars gives out a neutron blast. these gentlemen believe it's a sacred event. if you ask me, i think it's just another ball of hydrogen."
when is this great plume due to erupt?
tomorrow.
mind if we join you?
it's your time to waste.
i'd like to extend an invitation to you and your passengers to visit enterprise.
i'll ask them if they're interested. i prefer to stay with my ship.
"understood, mister?"
fraddock. captain fraddock.
looks like we could be having guests. tell chef to prepare something.
seal's good.
welcome aboard. captain jonathan archer. it's customary on earth to greet someone with a handshake.
i'm prah mantoos. may agosoria embrace you into his cycle of renewal.
thanks.
these are my fellow celebrants. we've travelled many light years from different worlds to watch this event.
"i'm commander tucker, chief engineer, and this is our science officer, sub-commander t'pol."
"for you, captain."
it's beautiful. what exactly is it?
a clock. it charts time from the beginning of the universe.
voo-sinteel.
it's a spirit traditionally consumed as the plume reaches its full brilliance. you'll find it enhances the experience.
"mmm, i'm sure it does."
you're very generous. i'm afraid the only thing we have to offer you is our hospitality.
that will be more than enough.
our chef has prepared a meal in your honour.
"normally we fast during the time of agosoria, but in this case i suppose we can break with tradition."
please.
"four months, three weeks and"
six days.
you've travelled a great distance in a short period of time.
warp five will get you where you're going pretty fast.
we've seen a lot since we left earth but i have to say that this place is definitely one of the highlights.
"i'm pleased you appreciate its beauty, captain. to us, it's more than just a simple stellar nursery. according to our sacred text this is where the universe began."
"and the great plume of a, ager?"
agosoria.
agosoria. how does that fit in?
it represents the continuing cycle of creation.
"it's not unlike the hindu faith, commander. they also believe that the universe goes through repeated cycles of rebirth."
"i didn't realise you were familiar with earth religions, doctor."
"oh, yes. in fact, while i was there i made it a point to study a number of them. i spent two weeks at a tibetan monastery where i learned to sing chords with the high lamas. i attended mass at saint peter's square. i was even allowed to observe the tal-shanar at the vulcan consulate."
i understand vulcans are a deeply spiritual people.
our beliefs are based on logic and the pursuit of clarity.
"do you follow a particular faith, captain?"
i guess you could say i try to keep an open mind.
"many who see the great plume are often inspired by it. perhaps you will be, too."
did you get to meet them?
"two, briefly."
what were they like?
quiet. they're taking a tour of the ship.
looks like the captain's going all out.
i hope he's not planning to show them the armory.
"don't worry, lieutenant. they didn't look like the types who'd go around stealing military secrets."
"still, we're not familiar with these species. tactical systems should be off-limits. starboard targeting sensor's out again."
should i call engineering?
"no. i'll take care of it. it'll only take a moment. you have the bridge, ensign."
aren't you going to take the chair?
what?
you're in command.
i'm fine right here.
haven't you ever wondered what it's like?
i can wait till i'm promoted.
okay.
nice fit.bridge looks a lot different from here. think anyone would mind if i fired a torpedo?
permission to take my station?
"sorry, sir."
"the gravimetric field displacement manifold, commonly known as the warp reactor. just think of it as a great big engine but instead of using electricity or chemical fuel it runs on antimatter. see this swirling light? when matter and antimatter collide it creates a whole lot of energy. we channel that energy through those conduits over there. they lead to the two large glowing cylinders you may have seen on the outside of the ship."
the nacelles.
that's right.
which contain warp coils that create the subspace displacement field.
i see you already know a thing or two about starship engines.
i'm a warp field theorist.
"oh. well, i guess that covers the basics. any questions?"
how do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix?
good one. i'll bring up the schematic of the reactor assembly and you can see for yourself. if you'll just come with me. we use a series of magnetic constrictors to align the positron stream.
if any stray particles escape backups automatically kick in. during one of our training tests we momentarily lost the primaries and the backups.
about a billion positrons cut through the plating on three decks. nearly caused a hull breach. we spent a month redesigning the system. it hasn't given us a single problem since.
we're being hailed by captain fraddock.
he's probably calling about the weather.
on screen.
you might want to focus your sensors on that plasma lightning up ahead.
we're aware of it.
you ever been in a plasma storm?
twice.
then you know it can get a little bumpy. i suggest we try and go around it.
agreed. ensign.
i'm already on it.
"there's your heart, lungs, liver, another heart. every organ. this imaging device also allows us to examine your genetic structure. ah, you'll be happy to know you're in perfect health. who would like to go next?"
excuse me. archer to the bridge. report.
"we're circumnavigating a plasma storm, captain."
it's just turbulence from the outer edge.
they're very common in this region. i'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
"that one hit our port bow. power's down on c-deck, subsection four. no other damage."
ensign.
the storm's moving in our direction. i'm having trouble getting around it.
what about the transport ship?
he's far enough ahead. he made it past.
we've got a power surge in the impulse relays. here's a good example of how we can reroute the energy flow to protect our critical systems.
i'm afraid we have to cut the tour a little short. i'll be on the bridge.
report.
we're losing main power.
trip.
what's happening?
that last bolt struck the warp manifold!
"we've got an antimatter cascade, sir!"
"if it reaches the warp reactor we're going to  i think we're all right, captain. the cascade stopped in its tracks."
"good work, trip."
"it wasn't me, sir."
sorry about the bad weather.
we're used to it. i'm just grateful there was no serious damage.
"if any of your group would like to watch the great plume from our mess hall, they're welcome to come back tomorrow."
i'll let them know.
"have a great time, doctor."
"i plan to, captain. thank you for letting me spend the night with these people."
i'll expect a full report in the morning.
"aye, captain."
hope to see you tomorrow.
tucker to captain archer.
"go ahead, trip."
can you come down to engineering for a minute?
on my way.
"what is it, trip?"
take a look at this.
what?
right up there. see that conduit?
yeah.
it's an antimatter junction. it stopped the cascade from reaching the warp reactor.
what are you getting at?
"somebody got in here and disconnected it from the primary antimatter feed. if they hadn't, that cascade would have continued right into the reactor core, and this ship would have gone up just like the great plume of agosoria."
one of your staff?
i already asked. nobody seems to know anything about it.
sounds to me like you've got a hero who's a little reluctant about taking credit. talk to them again. whoever did this deserves a commendation.
"i'm telling you, sir, i don't think it was one of my people. they would have said something."
i spoke with every one of them.
how about the warp theorist?
"him, too. none of them went anywhere near that conduit. if i told you i did it, would there be some kind of reward?"
"thank you, captain."
maybe it was the cycle of renewal.
"if anyone comes forward, you'll let me know?"
"oh, you'll be the first."
"sir, i need to speak with you."
why don't you talk to one of my bridge officers. i'm a little busy right now.
it's important.
"i'm sorry daniels, i've got my hands full."
it's about the suliban.
what about them?
i've reason to believe that one of the pilgrims who came aboard today is a suliban soldier. his name is silik. he's the man you fought with on the helix.
how the hell do you know what i did on the helix?
it might be best if we discussed this in private.
my ready room.
i think it'd be better if we went to my quarters.
what?
"you'll understand when we get there, sir."
"oh, please, have a seat. i'm sorry about the mess. sometimes i think my bunk-mate majored in chaos theory."
what is that? that doesn't look like starfleet issue.
"that's because i'm not a member of starfleet. not that i wouldn't be honoured to be one, sir, especially after spending time"
who are you? how do you know what happened on the helix?
did silik tell you who he was working for?
"i'm the one asking questions, crewman."
did he mention the temporal cold war?
what do you know about that?
"a great deal more than you do, sir."
"if you're not a member of starfleet, then who are you?"
i work for a different kind of organization. we make sure that people like silik don't interfere with historical events.
i've never heard of a group like that.
that's because it doesn't exist yet.
so you're telling me you're some kind of a time traveller?
that's one way of putting it. maybe this'll help clear things up.
this is how we keep an eye on what's going on. you might call it a temporal observatory. i know this must seem a little overwhelming.
overwhelming doesn't quite cover it.
"i come from right about, right about here. approximately nine hundred years from now."
are you human?
more or less.
and the people giving silik orders?
they're from an earlier century. from about here. they can't manifest themselves physically in the past. they can only partially materialise to deliver information.
but not you?
in the years that followed we eventually perfected the process.
sounds dangerous.
"when time travel was first developed, it wasn't long before people realised that laws had to be made. all the species who had the technology agreed that it would only be used for research."
but it wasn't. that's what the temporal cold war is all about.
look at this. this is a group of anthropologists from 2769 observing the construction of the great pyramid at giza. they're doing it using the proper procedures set forth in the temporal accord. but there are factions that ignore those procedures.
why are you telling me all this?
silik is the one who prevented the reactor breach.
"are you implying silik was sent here to save my ship, and if he hadn't we would have been destroyed today?"
i am not implying anything. all i'm saying is that i was assigned here to capture silik when he came aboard. he is a threat and i need you to help me capture him.
"you're from nine hundred years in the future, and you need my help?"
the suliban have been given genetic enhancements that allow them to evade most sensors. they're nearly impossible to detect.
i've noticed.
i have special equipment that can help track silik but it'll be far more effective if i can tie it into your internal sensor grid. i'll need access to main engineering and your command codes. but we have reason to believe that the twenty second century is a front in this cold war. what happens here could affect millennia to come. it's imperative that we find out who silik is working for and what they're trying to do.
if i decide to help you i can't do it alone. i need to inform some of my crew.
the fewer the better. you're asking me to capture someone who just saved my ship. why should i trust you?
you like your scrambled eggs soft. have i ever brought them to you any other way?
you sure you don't want a glass?
i'm sure. the vulcan science directorate has studied the question of time travel in great detail. they found no evidence that it exists or that it can exist.
"the suliban woman i spoke with, sarin, she also used the phrase temporal cold war."
that's what daniels called it?
the same words.
that proves nothing.
what about the suliban's genetic engineering? phlox says it's far beyond their abilities.
"that doesn't mean that it was given to them by visitors from the future. until daniels can offer you concrete proof, i'd remain extremely skeptical."
"i'm telling you, he pushed a button on this device and the whole room changed."
"on the xyrillian ship i was in a holographic chamber where i could've sworn i was in a boat at sea. if what daniels says is true, then silik saved enterprise. maybe we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth."
"if there's even a possibility that this cold war exists, we can't ignore daniels' request."
bridge to captain archer.
"yes, hoshi."
"we're approaching the protostar, sir"
and the transport ship is requesting permission to dock. some of the passengers would like to take you up on your offer and observe it from the mess hall.
initiate docking procedures. i'll be right there. one of them might be silik. we don't have time to debate this any longer.  i want you to help daniels.
"i always knew we'd be meeting people from other planets, but other centuries? you're not buying any of this, are you?"
if daniels could travel through time why not simply go back one more day into the past and prevent silik from boarding this ship in the first place?
maybe that's plan b.
or maybe he's really not from the future.
then why make up such a crazy story?
he could be trying to conceal his true intentions.
i thought you scientists were supposed to keep an open mind.
there's a difference between keeping an open mind and believing something because you want it to be true.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
"roja durana tua teenan, captain. that is a traditional greeting on the morning of agosoria. it means, may the plume light your way."
i take it you enjoyed your visit.
"oh, it was mesmerising. four hours of ritual prayer followed by the kaana-sah, a series of exercises designed to purify the body. i think i strained a leg muscle, but it was well worth it."
how many decided to join us?
"eleven, i believe. the others wanted to observe the star from their ship."
so that leaves six on the transport?
i didn't take a head count but that sounds about right.
did any of them seem out of place?
how do you mean?
did they all take part in the rituals?
"as far as i could tell, but our eyes were closed most of the time. is there something wrong, captain?"
"no, just curious."
you seem a little preoccupied.
it's been a long night. glad you had a good time. enjoy the view.
i will.
my equipment draws a lot of power. i'll need another twenty megawatts routed to your sensor grid.
commander?
the grid can handle it. so i take it your brother isn't really an orbital engineer at jupiter station.
"actually, i don't have a brother."
and you didn't grow up in illinois.
"oh, i'm from a place called illinois, sir. just not the one you're familiar with."
it's good to know earth will still be around in nine hundred years.
that depends on how you define earth.
beg your pardon?
you might want to initialise the grid. i'm ready to download the biometric parameters.
right. what's this?
it's very delicate. please don't.
please don't touch it.
"you know, we've got a little pool going in engineering where we try to guess how far the ship will travel each day. i don't suppose you could give me a tip on tomorrow's distance."
i'm afraid we don't monitor events quite that closely.
one of the power relays is offline.
must have been damaged during the plasma storm. j-37. it's about three metres behind that bulkhead.
i'll take care of it.
j-37?
try it now.
"i know, i know, your breakfast is two hours late. don't give me that look. if it's any consolation i missed my breakfast, too."
what's the problem? you're not getting any cheese.
"if you're thinking of calling for help i'd advise against it.  i'm not the one you should be worried about, jon."
what are you doing here?
i thought you might want to thank me. i saved your life. the least you could do is return the favour. there's someone here trying to find me. i need to know who it is.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i detected tachyon radiation. you don't have anything that emits tachyons. who's looking for me?
i don't know.
"did they tell you that ridiculous story about their noble efforts to protect history? the great temporal accord? they're lying to you, jon. none of it is true. whoever contacted you is working for another faction. they didn't come here to protect history. they came to alter it. who do you think was responsible for the antimatter cascade that nearly destroyed your ship? it was them. i was sent to prevent it."
"and why would you want to do that? the first time we met, you tried to kill me."
i saved your ship because i was instructed to.
by whom? what does enterprise have to do with your temporal war?
"i'm not privy to that kind of information, but i can tell you this. whoever's looking for me is a danger to your crew. if you want to continue on your mission you'll help me find them."
t'pol to captain archer.
archer here.
we've finished the modifications.
thanks. i'll be there in a few minutes.
mister daniels is eager to get started.
he'll have to wait a few minutes. archer out.
"you've been very helpful, jon."
it's beginning.
how long before we see the plume?
"well, that's hard to predict. every cycle is unique. would you care to recite the invocation of renewal with us?"
i'd be honoured. goran tonia agosoria.
yoraya.
yoraya uralan porporo gost.
goran tonia agosoria. yoraya uralan porporo gost.
totonya tur eeta dura.
totonya tur eeta dura.
tyana morita.
tyana morita.
does this mean it's working?
it's working.
what is it?
"suliban biosigns. he's somewhere on this deck. i can't isolate him, but he's close. call lieutenant reed. tell him to seal off c deck. and it wouldn't hurt if he could get down here with a security team."
what's that?
you two should go.
we're not leaving.
go! bring help. go.
evacuate engineering. everybody out!
did they tell you that the twenty second century was going to be your final resting place?
"still skeptical? tucker to captain archer. captain, are you there?"
he's in his quarters.
tucker to doctor phlox.
"yes, commander."
meet us in the captain's quarters on the double.
on my way.
"easy, captain. aside from a nasty headache, you're going to be fine. you were stunned by a particle weapon."
it was silik. i guess he decided not to try and kill me this time.
"he wasn't quite as generous when it came to daniels. he's dead, sir."
have our guests left yet?
"no, the plume is just beginning."
enterprise to captain fraddock.
fraddock.
i'm looking for one of your passengers. have any of the ones who were here returned in the last hour or so?
none.
you're sure?
the hatch has been sealed the entire time.
thanks. archer out.
mister reed.
"yes, sir."
we've got a suliban loose on the ship.
i want you to lock down every outer door and exit hatch. post security teams on all decks.
understood.
do you think you can find him using daniels' sensors?
i can sure as hell try.
get to engineering.
"yes, sir."
"t'pol. thanks, doc."
captain?
it's gone. he took it.
took what?
the device i told you about. the one daniels used to show me all those things. that kind of information could give an advantage to whomever silik's working for.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
someone just used our comm. system to transmit a message.
what kind of message?
"it's encrypted, sir."
anything?
"i'm sorry, captain. i can't make heads or tails of most of this. these might represent suliban bio-signs but i wouldn't bet on it."
"b-deck, service junction 59. somebody's trying to bypass the lock out codes for launch bay two."
tell malcolm to meet me with a security team.
"captain, i've got something that might give you a leg up."
looks like he slipped through here. we could remove these conduits but it would take some time.
sir?
stay here.
"very clever. careful, jon. it would be a shame to trigger another antimatter cascade. there'd be nobody here to stop it."
put that device on the floor.
it would be in your best interest to let me take it.
"you keep saying you're here to help us, but i can't stop wondering what kind of genetic enhancements you'll get for bringing back that little prize. eyes in the back of your head? a pair of wings?"
"that's a cynical attitude, jon. i thought your species was more trusting."
there's a vessel approaching no bigger than a shuttlepod. it's suliban.
i'm not going to ask you again. put it down.
you're going to kill me after i saved your life?
"you may have endangered your future, jon."
bridge to captain archer.
yeah.
a suliban vessel just took something in and went to warp. should we go after them?
no. let 'em go.
come in.
the transport ship has left. we're ready to resume course. have you learned how it works?
not a clue. starfleet's in store for one hell of a report. i'm not quite sure where to begin.
i'd be glad to help.
"first thing in the morning. i don't know about you, but i could use a good night's sleep."
agreed.
"mister reed, assign new quarters to daniels' roommate and seal off cabin e-14. it's off-limits til further notice."
"aye, sir."
"god knows what else is in there. let's get back on the road, travis."
"echo two is away, sir. a clean launch."
it's made contact with echo one.
how long before we get subspace online?
i'd like to send a few test transmissions to calibrate amplifiers. an hour.
my guess is we have a lot of people on board waiting to call home.
"a vessel is dropping out of warp, captain. twelve kilometres dead ahead."
put it up.
look familiar?
i don't recognise the configuration.
good. hail them. this is the starship enterprise. what can we do for you? my name is jonathan archer. we're on a mission of exploration from the planet earth. hoshi?
"the channel's open, sir."
"do you need assistance? if you don't want to talk, that's fine but, you dropped in on us.  was it something i said? did you get anything on sensors?"
no.
no what?
"no biosigns, no propulsion or weapon signatures, no readings at all."
are there inhabited systems nearby?
none.
why fly right up to us just to give us the silent treatment?
maybe they got our signal but it didn't make any sense to them. our translator is far from perfect.
i wouldn't take offense. not every species has motives that can be understood in human terms.
maybe they checked us out and decided we weren't very interesting.
us? not interesting?
let's calibrate the subspace amplifier. at least the people back home want to talk to us.
sir?  i tracked them down. it took me all week.
where are they?
kota baharu. it's in malaysia.
what time is it there?
a little after nine at night.
that shouldn't be too late. let's break in that new amplifier. i'll be in my ready room.
is he all right?
he's fine.
is he in some kind of trouble?
"no, sir. malcolm's doing a great job. i'm sure you know it's his birthday in a couple of days."
"yes, yes, it is. september 2nd."
we haven't seen our son on his birthday for quite a few years.
he called from san francisco to let us know he'd been assigned to enterprise but we haven't heard from him since.
"what are malcolm's duties on your ship, captain?"
he's my armoury officer.
"well, his grandfather would be pleased. he was an ordinance officer himself in the royal navy."
it must be in malcolm's blood.
the reeds have been navy men for generations.
until malcolm decided to join starfleet. i suppose the ocean wasn't big enough for him.
"he's a long way from home in any case, mister reed. i'd like to do something for his birthday, make him a special dinner. i was hoping you could tell me what he likes to eat."
"captain, malcolm's never been comfortable making requests."
i'm not sure i understand.
he always ate whatever was put in front of him.
are you saying he doesn't have a favourite food?
not that he's ever told me.
"well, if you happen to think of anything you can always contact me through starfleet."
give malcolm our best.
i will.
"safe journey, captain."
how'd it go?
"could have gone better. apparently, he hasn't called home since we left earth. i want you to find out what he likes to eat."
"me, sir?"
but don't let malcolm know.
maybe this is more in chef's area.
"we're talking about a delicate assignment, hoshi. it needs your finesse."
"sir, i'm running a diagnostic on our subspace transceiver array."
"get some help if you need it, but make this a top priority. that's an order."
"yes, sir."
where were you at dinner?
i ate in my quarters. now that we've got the amplifier working i wanted to answer a few letters.
you missed t'pol's latest bout with chopsticks.
damn. dinner and a show.
i thought you were going to upgrade this.
"that is the upgrade. well if you want, i can change the colour."
what's the word from home?
"the usual, engineering updates. oh, and duvall got promoted. they're giving him the shenandoah."
duvall got his own command? thank god we're a hundred light years away.
and i got a letter from natalie.
"the natalie, from pensacola?"
yep. natalie from pensacola. looks like i've got a charge imbalance in this manifold. i'll get right on it.
trip.
"you know, they say long-distance relationships never work. well, this is about as long-distance as you can get."
you okay?
"oh, yeah. i just, i just wish i'd have had the chance to say goodbye face to face."
let me ask you something. do you spend much time with malcolm?
i was in the armoury yesterday for a few hours swapping out some power relays.
you talk about anything interesting?
power relays.
i talked to his parents this morning.
really?
"yeah.  sit. if i asked your parents what you like to eat, would they be able to tell me?"
"are you kidding? my mom would give you her recipe for pan-fried catfish, and wouldn't let you go till you promised not to screw it up."
malcolm's parents didn't know what his favorite food was. they didn't even know he was an armoury officer.
that's strange.
"it made me think. we don't know that much about malcolm, do we?"
bridge to the captain.
go ahead.
the alien vessel has returned.
guess we weren't so uninteresting after all.
they dropped out of warp five hundred kilometres dead ahead.
i had to reverse engines to keep from banging into them.
let's try this again.
"welcome back. i was hoping we'd have an opportunity to meet again. the primary mission of my ship is to make peaceful contact with other species. if there's anything we can do to assure you of our intentions  well, it's been nice talking to you. let's do this again sometime."
i'm picking up something.
can you translate it?
i don't think it's a language.
we're being scanned.
hull plating.
it's offline!
hard about.
"they've gone to warp, sir."
everybody okay?
"damage reports are coming in, sir. no one's been hurt."
what the hell was that about?
"captain, when they fired their weapon they dropped their shielding for about two seconds and i was able to take some scans."
what did you get?
"biosigns. at least fifteen, maybe more."
their dna doesn't match anything in our database.
it's a good thing they're gone. i doubt very much our torpedoes could've penetrated their shielding.
"stay on long-range scanners. if they come anywhere near us, i want to know. t'pol."
that support frame's bent. we'll need to reinforce it.
how bad is it?
if that last shot had been about a half a metre higher we'd be looking at stars.
hold it a minute.
"there were thirteen people working in this section captain, including yours truly. if that bulkhead had blown."
did your people run into as many hostile aliens when they first went into deep space?
it was a different time.
how so?
there were fewer warp-capable species.
this ship just isn't equipped to handle some of the threats we're coming up against. it's time we do something about that.
what are you suggesting?
"enterprise was fitted with phase cannon ports, but since we left spacedock a few weeks ahead of schedule the cannons were never installed."
i think it's time they were. we should head back to earth.
"just give us two weeks, captain."
i know we can do it. most of the stuff we need is already on the ship.
the armoury team at jupiter station is trained for this kind of work. if we're going to do this let's do it right.
my engineers are just as good as they are.
"i know that, trip, but we have other systems that could use overhauls. look at the bright side. you'll got a chance to say goodbye to natalie."
"sir, with your permission, we could at least begin the work, get a few things started for jupiter station."
it'll cut down the time we'll have to spend in spacedock.
do what you can. archer to mayweather.
"go ahead, captain."
we're heading home.
"this, ladies and gentlemen is a phase-modulated energy weapon. it's rated for a maximum power output of five hundred gigajoules. enterprise was designed to carry three of them. we have one, and it's only a prototype."
our job is to get it up and running and build two more from scratch. the captain is taking us back because he thinks this ought to be done by the boys in spacedock.
"far be it from me to question the captain's judgment, but commander tucker and i believe we can do this ourselves."
"that means double shifts. by the time we reach jupiter station, i don't want their engineers to have a thing to do but give us a wash and a wax. any questions?"
"are we expecting another attack, sir?"
"we all signed up for this trip because we wanted to do something no one had ever done before, not because we thought it'd be easy or safe. but we're not here to take foolish risks. the captain and the rest of the crew are depending on us to keep enterprise ready for anything."
"and once we get these phase cannons online, we'll have a lot more firepower to do just that."
so what are you standing around for?
"he once told me that he loved to eat octopus, especially the little suction cups, but i think he was pulling my leg. you can never tell whether my brother's joking or not. can i talk to him?"
we really would like to keep this a surprise.
"oh right, the dinner. i remember one time, this was at least ten years ago, he went for a whole week without eating."
really?
got by on nothing but water and a little apple juice.
why?
some sort of survival training. or was it a contest?
"when he started eating again, do you remember the first thing he wanted?"
he was so weak he could barely get out of bed. for two days all he had was protein concentrate.
"when you two were growing up he never said, hey, let's go out for pizza, boy, i'd love some indian food?"
not that i remember. malcolm isn't the easiest person to get to know.
i'm figuring that out.
"when we were training in san francisco there was a little restaurant on the embarcadero he liked to go to. they had a specialty, some kind of fish, i think."
what kind? halibut? swordfish?
no.
mahi-mahi? scallops?
i had sea bass.
great! and malcolm?
i don't remember.
"try, please."
maureen.
is that a fish?
"no, she was the waitress. that's why malcolm wanted to go there. he had a thing for her. i think he hates fish."
thanks.
so how's your secret mission coming?
"i've talked to his sister, his best friend, his uncle archie, his two spinster aunts. the most anyone seems to know about his eating habits is that he occasionally eats."
"ensign, if you want to know something about mister reed perhaps you should ask him."
anyone sitting here?
"er, no. please."
this is the first chance i've had to eat all day.
tell me about it. i haven't set foot outside the armoury since oh seven hundred.
how's your ravioli?
it's fine.
"nothing like a nice plate of pasta. you know, i used to love to cook but i never get a chance to anymore, and the way that chef protects the galley. one of these nights, i should fix something myself."
i'm sorry?
you'd love my enchiladas.
enchiladas?
"if you don't like them, i can fix something else. what's your favourite food?"
"i appreciate the offer, but it really isn't necessary."
aren't you getting a little tired of having to eat whatever chef happens to serve?
"no, he's a fine cook."
don't get me wrong. he's terrific. it's just that dinner in the mess hall can lack a certain personal touch. i've got a hot plate in my quarters.
that's very flattering. i'm just not sure it would be appropriate.
what do you mean?
"well, we work together and it just might be a little awkward, serving on the same ship."
"what does that have to do with?  oh! no, i didn't, i didn't mean to imply anything other than just making dinner, lieutenant."
"well, then, it's my mistake then."
"no, it's my fault. i shouldn't have. yeah, i'll just."
"no, please, finish your dinner."
"no, no, no, you've got a lot of work to do, so."
"captain, i'm detecting a ship dead astern. eight thousand metres."
let me guess. our shadow?
closing to seven thousand. six thousand.
polarise the hull plating.
"reed to bridge.  armoury, report. get to your stations. move."
warp drive is offline.
main power is down.
torpedoes.
tactical systems are down.
why don't you save time and tell me what isn't down?
the outer doors in launch bay two are opening.
seal them.
i can't.
get away from those men!
go. archer to sickbay.
"phlox here, captain."
"report to e deck, section seven. this is an emergency."
on my way.
security to captain archer.
go ahead.
"the aliens are gone, sir. they've launched their shuttle."
"bridge, report!"
"the alien vessel has gone to warp, but that last shot damaged our port nacelle. we're venting drive plasma."
doctor?
"i've stabilised them, but they were subjected to some rather invasive scans."
will they be all right?
"there could be some residual neurological damage, but i'm doing everything i can."
have you ever heard of anything like this?
no.
are there any vulcan records of a species that uses similar tactics? and i don't care how classified they might be.
"none that i know of, captain."
find out what you can.
tucker to archer.
go ahead.
we've got the plasma leak
"under control, but our port nacelle took a lot of damage."
how long before we can go to warp?
a couple of days.
what about impulse power?
that's the good news.
it should be back online in a few minutes.
"i'll take all the good news i can get. keep me posted, doctor."
there are no vulcan ships within scanning range.
"sir, we could try to contact the vulcan high command. they're only two days away at warp six. i'm sure they'd give us a hand."
i'm sure they would.
"i can't raise vulcan. it's funny. i ran a diagnostic after the attack, but now echo two won't respond."
that's because it isn't there.
what?
there's nothing but debris at the co-ordinates where we deployed the amplifier.
what about echo one?
destroyed as well.
"the stabiliser on cannon port two checks out okay, sir."
port two or port one?
"port one, sir. sorry."
get it right. start on those beam emitters.
"yes, sir."
targeting scanners will be online in an hour.
"we should be aligning them by now, not installing them."
you were a little hard on eddie. everyone's busting their tails to get this job done.
ow!
you okay?
"yeah, fine. i told them to depolarise these relays!"
what were you trying to do?
bypass the eps grid.
why?
"well, we could draw power for the cannons directly from the impulse engines."
are you trying to make this blow up in your face?
the relays were rated to handle that much power.
what if there's a surge?
i've thought of that. these inverters were designed to cut in at the first sign of an overload.
"we've got to do this by the book, or we'll end up blowing a bigger hole in ourselves than the bad guys."
i've run a dozen simulations. it's an acceptable risk.
"when it comes to modifying ship systems, why don't you let the chief engineer decide what's an acceptable risk?"
"sir, if we do this by the book, those aliens are likely to be back before we're done."
"i want to get this job done as quickly as you do, lieutenant, but not if it means taking shortcuts that could get our people killed."
"yes, sir."
don't you ever rest?
"you know, i can't sleep without the warp engines online. if i don't feel those vibrations, something just doesn't seem right."
"well, i hope you get them fixed soon because you look like hell."
"well, with all due respect, captain, you shouldn't be talking."
how's it coming?
"it'll be online by the end of the day tomorrow, guaranteed. could you check the dilithium alignment for me?"
sure. point oh six microns. at least we'll be flying home under our own power.
let me know if it drops below point oh three.
"i tried to get a message to the vulcan high command, but it didn't go through. if it had, we'd be expecting a surak class ship tomorrow, oh so politely offering to help us."
"well, the vulcans would have loved that. towing the pride of starfleet back to base."
maybe we should thank our visitors for blowing up the subspace amplifiers. it's holding at point oh five.
keep an eye on it.
you looking forward to seeing earth?
sure. i just didn't think i'd be seeing it so soon.
"this time, we won't be leaving before we're ready."
are your ears a little pointier than usual?
i nev
"i never said we didn't belong out here. i just wish we'd have launched with all our systems online, especially weapons."
"if we hadn't launched when we did, they'd have sent klaang back to kronos in a box."
"i keep reminding myself of that. but i rushed us out of spacedock because i had something to prove, and i risked the lives of eighty one humans, a vulcan, and a denobulan to do it."
don't forget porthos.
thanks.
"in the old days, astronauts rode rockets with millions of litres of hydrogen burning under their seats. you think they said, gee i'd love to go to the moon today but it seems a little risky? i think if you asked anyone on board whether they thought this mission was worth the risk you'd get the same answer from every one of them."
let me know when we're ready to go to warp.
"aye, sir."
have you still got those guns of yours hooked up to the impulse engines?
i'm just disconnecting them now.
hang on a minute. you're sure this'll work?
"yes, commander, i am."
"then based on the recommendation of the armoury officer, the chief engineer finds the level of risk acceptable."
"in that case, if the chief engineer wouldn't mind getting his hands dirty, i could use some help."
"my crew has managed to do in forty eight hours what would've taken the armoury team at jupiter station at least a week. to say that i'm proud of them would be an understatement. we're preparing our first test. everybody has their fingers crossed, including me."
you're sure there's nothing down there?
"yes, captain."
not even a microbe? i don't want to blow up something that could evolve into a sentient species in a couple of billion years.
there's nothing there.
archer to lieutenant reed. have you got a lock?
"yes, captain."
let's start small. shave a couple of metres off the top of that peak.
acquiring the target. full power to the primary coils.  phase cannons one and two standing by.
"mister reed, the honour is all yours.  i just asked for a little off the top."
check the cannons. be careful down there. the blast yield was ten times what we expected.
what happened?
something overloaded the phase modulators.
the plasma recoil blew out relays across decks c and d.
i'm getting an anomalous reading from launch bay two.
"trip, t'pol."
there. what's that?
you think that's what's causing the power surge?
it's very likely. it's putting out a tremendous amount of energy. over six hundred megajoules.
"they're toying with us. they want us to know they can destroy us whenever they want, even with our own weapons."
"whatever it is, it's tapped into most of our systems including internal sensors and communications on every deck."
activate visual sensor j-15. i assume you planted that device because you wanted to learn more about us.
"i'll be happy to give you a quick lesson. we're not here to make enemies, but just because we're not looking for a fight doesn't mean we'll run away from one. you may think you've left us defenceless, but let me tell you something about humans. we don't give up easily. we'll protect enterprise any way we can."
doctor?
"i'll be with you in a moment, ensign."
i see you released your patients.
they're going to be fine. i sent them back to their quarters to rest.
that's good to hear.
what can i do for you?
many times.
any idea what his favourite food might be?
"ah, the birthday dinner. well, the man loves a good breakfast."
like what?
"eggs, i've seen him eat a lot of eggs."
how does he like them?
"scrambled, poached, over easy."
maybe chef could make him a big omelette.
"oh, and he enjoys pancakes, on occasion. he has the odd habit of spreading peanut butter on them. sausage, that's another favourite. bacon too, come to think of it."
is there any one food in particular?
not that i recall.
breaking a vulcan encryption code would be easier than this.
"if anything comes to mind, i'll let you know."
i don't suppose scanning his taste buds would help?
"medically speaking, there's no accounting for taste."
thanks anyways.
bromelin!
sorry?
"i think i can help you, ensign, but it would mean going into mister reed's medical record. that information is confidential."
i'm under direct orders from the captain. couldn't you make an exception?
"under the circumstances, i suppose it wouldn't hurt. i've made it a point to study each crewman's medical history, and i remember noticing that lieutenant reed suffers from a number of allergies. let's see. dust mites, oak pollen, tropical grasses. ah ha ha, here it is. he's averse to various plant enzymes, including bromelin."
what does all of this have to do with what he likes to eat?
over the last several years he's been taking regular injections so that his body can tolerate bromelin.
a plant enzyme.
yes.
found in?
"among other things, pineapple."
pineapple!
this doesn't mean it's his favourite food.
"it's close enough. thank you, doctor."
it's them.
where are they?
"closing from astern, twenty thousand metres. fifteen."
should i try evasive manoeuvres?
"no. come about, and hold our position. bridge to the armoury. guess who's back."
we see them. both forward cannons are charged and ready.
get a lock and standby.
they've stopped. eleven thousand metres.
we're being hailed.
put it through.
defenceless.
prepare to surrender your vessel. you are defenseless. prepare to surrender your vessel.
shut it off.
"ten thousand metres, nine."
"mister reed, both cannons, fire."
"i'm reading a fluctuation in their shielding, but it's marginal."
five thousand metres.
"is that the best we can do, lieutenant?!"
"even if these cannons had been installed at jupiter station, they wouldn't be any more effective than they are now."
what about yesterday? i saw you blow something up the size of mount mckinley.
"yes sir, but that was due to an overload."
can you overload them again?
"sir, after the damage from the first time the plasma recoil would probably knock out two decks."
can you overload them again?
i believe so.
i'd rather knock out two decks than surrender this ship.
but sir.
hold on a minute. i think there's a way to handle the recoil.
how?
all that excess energy's got to go somewhere.
why not put it to use?
three thousand metres.
"if we repolarise the gravity plating to absorb the recoil,"
then we can shunt the energy to structural integrity.
sounds good to me.
the grav-plating wasn't designed
to withstand that much force.
we all understand the risks. get started.
"aye, sir."
one thousand metres.
malcolm?
"stand by. trip? we're ready, sir."
then fire!
their shields are failing.
torpedoes!
bridge to the armoury. everything okay down there?
we blew out the plasma relays on b deck but it's nothing we can't take care of. what about our friends?
i have a feeling
their repairs are going to be a little more extensive.
how'd the cannons hold up?
fairly well.
i'll have them back online within the hour.
the aft cannon should be working by the end of day tomorrow.
"good work. well, i see no reason for us to go back to jupiter station now. do you?"
no.
at least there's one good thing about coming back this far. we can drop another subspace amplifier.
"get on it. travis, resume our previous course."
"gladly, sir."
to our mysterious friends. i wish i could've seen the looks on their faces.
"hear, hear."
don't get too used to drinking on duty. but you did your jobs pretty damn well yesterday. i'd say that deserves a little celebration.
cheers.
"if you really want to thank us, how about letting us sleep in tomorrow?"
"permission granted. hoshi, what can we do for you?"
"sorry to interrupt, captain. i have that component that you asked for."
"great, put it down right here.  as long as we've got you here, malcolm."
happy birthday.
you shouldn't have gone to any trouble.
"oh, no trouble at all."
"mister reed, the honour is yours."
pineapple! that's my favourite. how on earth did you know?
we have our sources.
"good morning, everyone. be patient."
ah! someone had a busy night.
don't worry. i didn't forget you.
"now, let's try it without biting my fingers this time."
people are getting jealous. you get more letters from home than anyone on this ship. what's her name?
it's nothing like that. they're from doctor lucas. he's a colleague from the interspecies medical exchange.
i didn't know there were humans serving on denobula.
he's the first. he helped me get settled in when i came to san francisco. i'm trying to return the favour.
"i had a pen pal once when i was twelve, from brisbane, australia, and i loved getting her letters. it was like this little window into distant places with strange sounding names."
"the curiosity of an explorer, even then."
are we still on for later?
"oh, yes. i'm looking forward to it. if you think you're ready, we can tackle gerunds today."
i can hardly wait.
"my dear doctor phlox, it's me again, jeremy. i hope you are well. it's been a hell of a week here. wall to wall emergencies and three midnight deliveries. it's mating season, so you know how that goes. i thought human reproduction was complicated. you denobulans make us look like single-cell organisms."
"dear doctor lucas, sorry to hear about your difficult week. i know the rigours of mating season only too well. it might help to bear in mind that a dose of niaxilin can be quite effective in separating the two combatants. it sounds like you've settled into your new living quarters. that part of the city has some very lively kaybin bars along the river."
"up here, doc!"
"they're open all night, if i recall. please, don't venture inside them unescorted. they can be quite disturbing to the uninitiated."
he was trying to reroute a nitrogen valve and the seal blew. how bad is it?
"oh, it's superficial. only first degree burns. a little dermoline gel should do the trick."
"most of my work is fairly routine. scrapes and bruises, the occasional emergency. and you'll be pleased to hear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an alien doctor on board. i must admit, i wasn't planning to stay this long but the opportunity to observe your species on their first deep space venture has proven irresistible."
"lieutenant, i saved a seat for you."
"yeah, another time, doctor. i'm due back in the armoury."
"it's a bit daunting at times, trying to socialise with the crew, form friendships, but our profession guarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us. it makes interaction quite a bit easier."
it's just a little gastrointestinal distress.
he hasn't been himself lately.
"well, you've been feeding him cheese again, haven't you? you've got to learn how to say no, captain."
"no more dairy products, you hear that? doctor's orders."
i never thought i'd meet a species that forges such intimate bonds with lesser creatures. it's surprising the things you humans choose to invest your emotions in.
sorry to bother you with this.
no bother. he was one of my more co-operative patients today.
"thanks, doc.  see all the trouble you cause?"
"i've noticed how the captain seems to anthropomorphise his pet. he even talks to the creature although i'm fairly certain it has no idea what he's saying. then again, i've been known to speak to my pyrithian bat on occasion."
"we won't be going to america this time, but always i go with you wherever you go. understand? you go now, maria."
"no. i stay with you, roberto."
"no, maria. what i do now, i do alone. i couldn't do it if you were here. if you go, then i go, too. don't you see how it is? whichever one there is."
no! no!
we can go if you're bored.
"no, no. i'd like to stay and see what happens."
you won't be disappointed. the ending's classic.
"no, not the film. i'm sensing a rising emotional undercurrent in the room. i'm curious to see if it culminates in some kind of group response."
"they don't have movies where you come from, do they?"
"we had something similar a few hundred years ago, but they lost their appeal when people discovered their real lives were more interesting."
"still, it's nice to take a break from real life every now and then, don't you think?"
i suppose it is.
"i am you now, and you are me. now you understand and you're going well and fast and far"
something in my eye.
"stand up now and go and we both go. stand up, maria. remember, you're me too."
"it's remarkable, doctor. even fictional characters seem to elicit human compassion. my shipmates have calmly faced any number of dangers, and yet a simple movie can bring tears to their eyes."
temporal vein.
temporal vein. internal maxillary.
and what is the maxillary connected to?
posterior auricular?
very good. the external jugular.
"oh, er, superior vena cava."
and that leads to?
"oh, easy. the seat of all joy and sadness."
"physiologically, it is nothing more than a very efficient pump. what could possibly make you people think it is the source of all emotion?"
"you know, you may know about our cardiopulmonary system, but you have a lot to learn about the human heart.  this is me."
good night.
"oh, doctor. i just wanted to thank you. it was fun tonight."
you're welcome.
"er, they're showing another one next week. sunset boulevard. i think you might like it."
i'm sure i will.
"see you tomorrow? oh, sorry. i forgot denobulans don't like to be touched."
it's all right. i'm trying to shed some of my cultural inhibitions.
"oh, in that case."
good night.
"since we were on the subject of mating, i think crewman cutler may be romantically interested in me. i can't be certain, however. the pheromones of human females aren't as potent as denobulans'."
are there any inhabited systems nearby?
there's a minshara class planet less than a light year away.
"the ship's not answering our hails, captain."
"it's definitely pre-warp, sir. it could be unmanned. maybe a probe of some kind."
any biosigns?
"two, but they're very faint."
"bring it into launch bay two, and tell doctor phlox he might have a couple of patients."
we found your ship adrift. we thought we might be able to help.
trenakadula ta? morana dona?
i need a little more.
i'm jonathan archer. you're on the starship enterprise.
kandala vaganish. yoreta vala?
can you understand me?
who are you? what planet?
earth. we're from earth.
this is a warp vessel?
yes.
"we left valakis over a year ago, along with three other ships."
why?
you must have noticed our condition by now.
i detected the illness.
"twelve million of us died the year before we left. i can only imagine how many have died since. our doctors can't find a cure, but a more advanced people, people with warp technology, like you, your medical science must be more effective."
you've encountered other warp-capable species?
the m'klexa and the ferengi. they both visited our world. do you know them?
no.
are you the ship's doctor?
i am.
my people are dying. will you allow him to help us?
any thoughts?
"they did come looking for us, and considering they've already met two other warp-capable species the risk of contamination seems acceptable."
see what you can do.
thank you.
"if this letter arrives later than usual, doctor, i hope you'll forgive me. i've been presented with a rather unusual case involving a pair of alien astronauts. it may not surprise you that they landed in my sickbay through an act of human compassion. i said before that my duties entail the occasional emergency. emergencies, it seems, come in all shapes and sizes. i was once nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on matalas. captain archer is now asking me to take responsibility for over fifty million."
how are your patients?
"their condition is grave, but they're resting for now."
i'm sure you'll find a way to help them.
your syntax is improving. continue.
do you like the food?
the sauce is good but i don't care for this vegetable.
"eggplant's not a vegetable, it's a nostril."
it's a nostril?
a fruit.  i've noticed you and crewman cutler spending a lot of time together. is there something going on between you two?
"in denobulan, please."
are you two mating?
i believe the word you're searching for is dating.
"well, are you?"
"well, are you?"
i'm not exactly sure.
there are ways you can tell.  does she want to spend time with you? does she find excuses to  to make physical contact?
"well, she did kiss me on the cheek the other night."
"in denobulan, doctor."
do you have any advice?
i think you make a very cute washboard.
i beg your pardon?
couple. a cute couple.
it's pretty crowded out there. a lot of spacecraft and artificial satellites.
"nothing i can't avoid, sir."
"put us in a low orbit, travis. they're expecting us."
"the captain has committed all our resources to helping people he didn't even know existed two days ago. once again, i am struck by your species' desire to help others."
it seems the more aggressively we treat the illness the more resistant it becomes.
what's the current rate of infection?
one out of three.
it's a full blown epidemic.
these are in the most advanced stage.
you're treating them with a synthetic antibody?
"it's effective at first, but the disease mutates. once it moves into the respiratory system there's no way of controlling it. pulmonary failure usually follows in a few days."
"captain, treatment with priaxate should ease the symptoms in the sickest patients, at least temporarily. i can easily show the valakians how to synthesize as much as they need."
go ahead.
"i'll need all of the lab work you have, and case histories of patients in every stage of the disease."
certainly.
excuse me. we're the ones that brought him here. can you tell me how he's doing?
dak mul ahna.
i'm sorry. could you say that again?
we should assign some crewmen to watch doctor phlox and his equipment.
i don't think these people are about to steal anything.
"your experience with lesser civilisations is limited, captain. you might be surprised what a temptation our technology can be."
dak mul ahna. kal ah ku dah.
hoshi?
"captain, the ut can't translate his language."
"dukat ah pra kee, larr."
he doesn't speak the same language as you?
"no, he's menk. they're not as evolved as valakians but they're very hard workers."
they're indigenous to this planet?
is that so strange?
"on most of the planets we've encountered, only one species of humanoids survived the evolutionary process."
you two are not from the same planet?
"no. we may look alike, but the similarity ends there."
i don't see any menk patients here. where are they being treated?
they haven't contracted the disease.
have you looked into their immunity?
"it was one of the first things we pursued, but menk and valakian are physiologically incompatible."
"still, could be significant. i'd like to see your data on the menk as well."
of course.
"i had meant to transmit this letter by now but the valakian epidemic has been taking up most of my time. working with the physicians here has been quite fulfilling. i suppose it's the reason we joined the interspecies medical exchange, but i worry about falsely raising their hopes. despite captain archer's confidence in me i'm afraid the scale of the disaster may outweigh our best intentions. i've decided to enlist crewman cutler's help in my task."
so what are the menk like?
you'll have the chance to see for yourself. you're a trained exobiologist. i'd find your assistance in the field invaluable.
"thank you, doctor."
"on a personal note, the affection crewman cutler is showing has left me a bit perplexed, so i've decided to discuss it with the one person on board who might understand the complexities of the situation."
that's impossible.
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
my teeth were sealed with a tri-fluorinate compound twenty three years ago.
"well, normal wear and tear has allowed some decay to sneak in. see for yourself. there, on your anterior tricuspid."
i'm sure you have more pressing concerns. i'll come back later.
i'm waiting for the computer to analyse some tissue samples. it'll only take a moment to repair.
"open, please. wider. you've lived among humans for quite some time now, sub-commander. i'm curious, have you ever known them to mate outside their species? ah! there it is."
are you asking out of personal interest or scientific curiosity?
"both, i suppose. there's a crewman on board i've become close with. i think she's attracted to me."
"in my experience, humans lack the emotional maturity for interspecies relationships. they tend to be easily infatuated with things they find new. this crewman may simply be satisfying her curiosity at your expense."
open.
"sub-commander t'pol has a very pragmatic feel of the universe. i admire her logic although she lacks the instinctiveness that a more emotional response can provide. somehow, i find this unsettling."
there. that wasn't so bad. thanks for your insights.
be careful.
come in.
"you asked to see me, captain?"
i've just gotten a call from the director of the clinic. he's eager to hear if you've made any progress. doctor?
"i've developed a medication to ease the symptoms of the disease, but"
but?
"this epidemic isn't being caused by a virus or bacteria. the proteins that bind to their chromosomes are deteriorating. their illness is genetic. it's been going on for thousands of years, but the rate of mutation has accelerated over the last few generations. based on my projections, the valakians will be extinct in less than two centuries. i wish i had better news."
what about a cure?
genetic abnormalities on this level are very difficult to reverse.
but not impossible.
no. i still believe the menk immunity could be the key to a cure. i plan to study them in more detail.
take all the time you need.
"when i began to practice medicine i had no idea it would take me on journeys to other worlds. every species i encounter allows me to explore a new physiology. at the moment, i find myself in the enviable position of studying two humanoids from the same planet. it's a rare and exciting opportunity."
"tell them we'd like to run some tests, take samples of their blood. it will be completely painless."
kuhl toh bah.
kuhl pra toh bah aren so l'tee.
ylyn parum ta see ettaj.
he's says they'd be happy to help.
"as fascinating as the two species are from a biological standpoint, it's their ability to co-exist that intrigues me the most. the valakians are highly evolved, technologically advanced, while the menk are relatively primitive by comparison. to my surprise, the two seem to be living side by side, peacefully."
pra du matta.
pra ducat matta ku mampah.
koh utah?
he wants to know what you're doing.
have you learned enough menk to explain a molecular bio scan?
"doctor, er, esatta prah koo kuvalakii."
what'd you say?
i told him the doctor was looking inside of him.
thank you.
tik tik.
nan dah.
you're welcome.
neek. rasata. food.
did he just say food?
rasata. food.
have you been teaching him english?
"no, he must have picked it up by listening to us."
perhaps we've found an assistant comm. officer.
no food?
tik tik.
tik tik.
i haven't seen any crops or livestock. i wonder where they get this.
"larr, ku rasata gol dach?"
pah ku mano. nda tomah.
he says the soil here isn't good for planting.
gol dach puu kani valakii. hrat atiba si ohno.
the valakians don't let them live where the land is fertile.
"valakii fora tlet rasata kee, akem, pinj erana."
"the valakians give them whatever they need. food, clothing, medicine."
menk akata y valakii.
he says the valakians are good to them. they protect them.
"despite the menk's insistence that they're treated well, my human crewmates seem to see things differently."
"tik tik. well, that's the last one."
"they think the menk are being exploited by the valakians, so their first instinct is to rise to their defence, despite the fact that the menk don't appear to need or want a defender."
wait a moment.
impressive.
what'd he do?
he's grouped the samples together by family. cross-referenced by bloodlines and marriage if i'm interpreting the colour codes correctly. tik tik.
"on the surface the menk appear to be a primitive species, unsophisticated even by human standards. no offence. but their abilities appear to have been underestimated, even by myself."
"it seems like a vacation, if i didn't keep remembering why we were here."
i'm going to help larr finish packing up. he's back on duty at the hospital in an hour.
this really doesn't bother you.
what?
the way the valakians treat them.
"why should it? on most worlds with two humanoid species one would have driven the other to extinction. here, they've developed a symbiotic relationship that seems to work quite well."
they force the menk to live in compounds. they treat them almost like pets.
their culture is different. it's their way.
doesn't make it right.
"are you married, crewman?"
of course not. i would have told you.
i'm married.
you are?
three times.
"so, you have two ex-wives?"
i have three current wives and they each have two husbands not counting myself.
is that considered normal for denobulans?
quite.
why are you telling me this?
i've been getting certain signals from you that suggest you may be interested in a romantic relationship with me.
oh.
unless i misinterpreted those signals.
you didn't. but i still don't know why you're telling me this.
you need to know that my culture is different.
that doesn't matter.
it doesn't? this culture's different. that seems to matter to you a great deal.
"phlox, as far as your extended family goes i'm not interested in becoming wife number four. i just want to be your friend."
what do you mean by friend?
let's just see where it goes.
"captain, i'm glad you could come."
it was no problem. how are you feeling?
"the medication you gave us helps with the pain, but my prognosis hasn't changed."
we're trying to do something about that. i have a lot of faith in doctor phlox.
i wanted to thank you for getting me home before it was too late. it took us a year to get out to where you found us. you brought us home in a day.
we started out in ships very similar to yours. someday you'll be travelling just as fast as we are.
someday may not be soon enough. if your doctor can't help us we need to keep searching for others that can. we need warp drive. a million more of us will die before our next ship even leaves this system. with warp engines we won't have to wait for people to find us. we can seek help on our own.
you may not find that everyone you meet wants to help you.
"still, we have to try."
archer.
"it's phlox, captain. we've collected all the samples."
i'll meet you at the shuttlepod. archer out.
anything to report?
we've received twenty nine hails in the past two hours.
from whom?
"apparently, word of our arrival has spread quickly. other clinics are requesting help. two orbital spacecraft approached us while you were on the planet. they mistakenly believed that we already had a cure. we had to turn them away."
do you have a minute?
the valakians want our warp technology.
what did you tell them?
that i'd think about it.
and?
safe to say i know where you stand on the subject.
even if you give them our reactor schematics they don't have the technical expertise to build a warp engine.
they have no experience working with antimatter. i doubt they even realize how dangerous it is. they're not ready.
then your decision shouldn't be difficult.
we could stay and help them.
the vulcans stayed to help earth ninety years ago. we're still there.
"i never thought i'd say this, but i'm beginning to understand how the vulcans must have felt."
"trouble sleeping, captain?"
looks like i'm not the only one.
"actually, denobulans require very little rest, unless you count our annual hibernation cycle."
am i going to be without my doctor this winter?
only for six days.
maybe i'll join you. any progress?
"the research has been challenging, to say the least."
"a cure, doctor. have you found a cure?"
"even if i could find one, i'm not sure it would be ethical."
ethical?
we'd be interfering with an evolutionary process that has been going on for thousands of years.
"every time you treat an illness, you're interfering. that's what doctors do."
you're forgetting about the menk.
what about the menk?
"i've been studying their genome as well, and i've seen evidence of increasing intelligence. motor skills, linguistic abilities. unlike the valakians they appear to be in the process of an evolutionary awakening. it may take millennia, but the menk have the potential to become the dominant species on this planet."
and that won't happen as long as the valakians are around.
"if the menk are to flourish, they need an opportunity to survive on their own."
"well, what are you suggesting? we choose one species over the other?"
all i'm saying is that we let nature make the choice.
the hell with nature. you're a doctor. you have a moral obligation to help people who are suffering.
"i'm also a scientist, and i'm obligated to consider the larger issues. thirty five thousand years ago, your species co-existed with other humanoids. isn't that correct?"
go ahead.
"what if an alien race had interfered and given the neanderthals an evolutionary advantage? fortunately for you, they didn't."
"i appreciate your perspective on all of this, but we're talking about something that might happen. might happen thousands of years from now. they've asked for our help. i am not prepared to walk away based on a theory."
"evolution is more than a theory. it is a fundamental scientific principle. forgive me for saying so, but i believe your compassion for these people is affecting your judgment."
my compassion guides my judgment.
captain.
can you find a cure? doctor?
i already have.
"two days ago, when we first discovered the alien shuttle, i had no idea that i'd be facing a dilemma of this magnitude. for the first time, i find myself in conflict with my captain. but he is my captain and he's placed a great deal of trust in me. i believe i owe him the same. i only hope that he is willing to look beyond his sympathy for these poor people."
doctor.
captain.
i'm going down to the valakian hospital.
"sir, it would go against all my principles if i didn't ask you to reconsider what i"
"i have reconsidered. i spent the whole night reconsidering, and what i've decided goes against all my principles. someday my people are going to come up with some sort of a doctrine, something that tells us what we can and can't do out here, should and shouldn't do. but until somebody tells me that they've drafted that directive i'm going to have to remind myself every day that we didn't come out here to play god."
"i'd like to think, doctor lucas, that if i'd had the chance to talk to you face to face you'd have never let me even consider withholding my findings from the captain. but i'm ashamed to say that i almost did just that."
"phlox tells me this medicine will help ease the symptoms for a decade, maybe more. a lot can happen in that time. i wouldn't be surprised if you developed a cure on your own."
"and if we don't? with a warp capable starship, our chances would be greatly improved."
i'm sorry.
this will give you detailed instructions on how to synthesise more of the medicine.
we appreciate everything you've done.
if i hadn't trusted him to make the right choice i'd have been no better than the vulcan diplomats who held your species back because they felt you couldn't make proper decisions on your own.
"i came very close to misjudging jonathan archer, but this incident has helped me gain a new respect for him. happiness and health to you, doctor. your dedicated colleague, phlox."
you wanted to see me?
please.
for doctor lucas.
it'll go out first thing in the morning. everything all right?
"fine, fine. the past few days have been taxing."
want my advice? get out of sickbay.
yes. perhaps you're right.
good night.
good night. phlox to crewman cutler.
go ahead.
"i, er, know it's short notice, but i was wondering if you might like to join me for a little snack in the mess hall. i could use a friend right about now."
ten minutes?
thank you. sweet dreams.
you have a ten second firing window. ready?
ready.
go.
time.
any better?
"your hit to miss ratio is still below fifty percent. if those had been live rounds, you'd have blown out two or three bulkheads."
i never had this much trouble with the em-33.
"this is an entirely new weapon. unlike the em-33 you don't have to compensate for particle drift. just point straight at the target, and try and keep your shoulders relaxed. it's hard to aim accurately when you're tense. ahem."
you all right?
"yeah, fine. you'll get the hang of it. let's try for twenty seconds this time."
i thought we were staying at warp for the next few days.
we're approaching a gas giant. class nine.
so much for target practice.
we'll pick it up tomorrow.
the probe's entered the outer atmosphere.
can we clean up the signal?
"i'm trying, sir. there's a lot of em interference. it sounds very strange."
intense magnetic fields often create unique waveforms.
let's hear them.
siren calls. that's what we called them when i was a kid. my dad would put them through the speakers whenever we flew by a gas giant. it gave me nightmares sometimes.
"other than keeping ensign mayweather up at night, i'm not sure what we expect to accomplish here. there are four gas giants in your own solar system."
none of them are class nine. i think this one's worth a closer look.
"i'm reading an anomalous power signature in the lower atmosphere, and several biosigns."
get the probe closer.
"aye, sir."
we can travel faster than the speed of light. you'd think we could find a cure for the common cold.
you should be grateful. a human cold is so mild. i once had a patient with the kamaraazite flu. he sneezed so violently he nearly regurgitated his pineal gland.
i don't see how i could actually catch a cold on a hermetically sealed starship.
"oh, you may have picked up the virus from a piece of equipment. it could have been lurking inside a sealed container."
i did open a case of plasma coolant.
whoever packed that case was probably nursing a cold.
but that was back in spacedock five months ago.
"you underestimate the tenacity of a virus, lieutenant. it can lay dormant for months, adapt to whatever environment it finds itself in. this should ease the symptoms."
but the only cure i know of involves bed rest.
"no, that'll have to wait. the captain wants me on the team investigating that shipwreck."
"well, you won't be contagious inside an environment suit. just try not to sneeze in your helmet."
i'll do my best.
come in. hoshi.
"do you have a minute, sir?"
of course. what's on your mind?
"that shipwreck. we have no idea what type of life forms we'll find on that alien vessel, and there's a lot of interference in the atmosphere. are you sure the away team won't need a translator?"
"they have their uts, and we'll try to keep an open comlink."
"what about the language on the control panels, the hatches? they might need someone to help them find their way around."
are you trying to tell me something?
"i realise that i haven't always been the first one in line to volunteer for this type of mission, but i want you to know that i am prepared to go. took a while, but i think i finally got my space legs."
i never doubted that you'd find them. your timing couldn't be better. t'pol just asked me to assign you to the team. you'd better get to the launch bay before they leave without you.
"aye, sir."
i thought you were acquainted with the environmental suit.
i am. i'm just brushing up on the backup systems. i wouldn't want the emergency oxygen to fail during a hull breach.
"trust me, ensign. if there's a hull breach the pressure will crush you to something about this big."
"i requested you for your skills as a translator, but if you're uncomfortable."
"i'm perfectly comfortable. i used to find the suits a little claustrophobic, but i'm getting used to them. i'll see you in the shuttlepod."
"it's one hundred kilometres below us, still descending."
gravity's pulling it deeper into the atmosphere. at their current altitude the pressure is fifteen thousand gsc.
that's well within our hull tolerance.
"for the moment. but at the rate that vessel is sinking, we'll have an hour at most."
"you sound uncomfortable, sub-commander."
i'm merely stating facts.
we'll be on our way back well before we're in any danger. i for one have no interest in imploding a valuable shuttlepod.
or three valuable officers.
we've entered an eddy of liquid helium. we're clear.
that wasn't so bad.
one hundred metres.
is that a hatch on the port side?
i see it.
fifty metres. forty.
what's that?
it's just the proximity alarm.
twenty metres. ten. engaging docking interface.
"nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. carbon dioxide levels are high, but nothing's toxic. it's breathable."
you first.
perhaps we should leave the helmets on.
what is it?
you can't smell that?
no. this damn cold.
count your blessings.
you two might want to take a look at this.
"it says deck two, red sector."
what language?
klingon.
i thought you knew klingon ships. why didn't you recognise this one from the outside?
there are many classes of ships. i'm not familiar with all of them.
so i'm assuming you don't know how many klingons are on board.
i'm reading three biosigns. that way. all very weak.
how weak?
they're still alive. we should leave before they regain consciousness.
and what if they don't? the atmosphere's going to crush this ship like an eggshell pretty soon.
shouldn't we try to help them?
they don't want our help.
how do you know?
"they're klingons. to die at their post assures them a path to the afterlife. if we rescue them, they'd be dishonoured."
"well, i for one don't intend to just fly off and let these people die, honourable deaths or not."
"your compassion is admirable but misguided. if they awake and find us on their ship, they'll kill us."
how many are there?
"three on the bridge, but i'm detecting at least nine more biosigns on board."
you can't tell what happened to them?
"i'm detecting residual amounts of an carbon dioxide based neurotoxin, but it seems to have dissipated. there's not enough to affect us."
stand by. how long is the pod's hull going to hold up?
"at their present rate of descent, half hour, give or take."
t'pol.
"yes, captain."
"you've got twenty minutes to see if you can do anything for that crew, then i want you out of there."
understood?
i don't believe there's anything we can do in twenty minutes. i suggest we leave now.
you have a margin of safety.
captain? t'pol to enterprise.
damn interference.
or we've dropped out of comm. range.
we still have twenty minutes.
it doesn't make sense to place ourselves at risk when they'd rather die.
there must be something we can do. maybe they have a distress beacon we can activate.
i doubt you'll find one. klingons don't call for help.
what if we carry some of them into the pod? we could save three or four.
and if they wake up on the trip back to enterprise?
what's that?
it's our shuttlepod taking off.
try it now.
archer to t'pol. what's your status?
they're back in comm. range.
captain.
"shuttlepod one, respond."
"sir, they're heading into open space."
i'm picking up something.
duj-to! chak wa kah deesh paklah! kah deesh paklah!
sounds like klingon.
i'll try to tie in the ut.
"chak wa kah deesh paklah! kah deesh paklah! 'kiv duj in range. respond. we've been attacked by an unknown ship designation enterprise nx-01. any warships in range, respond."
set a pursuit course.
"aye, sir."
bring the grappler online.
we've got it.
"bridge to security. send a team to launch bay one. trip. the bridge is yours, travis."
"yes, sir."
everybody all right?
archer to the bridge.
mayweather.
have you still got a fix on the shipwreck?
"yes, sir."
transfer the coordinates to the launch bay. i'm going back for the boarding party.
"sir, the alien ship sunk another two thousand metres. it's below the shuttle's safety limits."
then polarise the hull plating. we'll take enterprise down.
there's got to be some way off this ship.
what about escape pods?
i don't know about the structural integrity of klingon escape pods. my guess is we're better off in here.
"it's irrelevant, lieutenant. klingons don't use escape pods. it would be considered an act of cowardice to abandon ship."
maybe we can use their comm. system to contact enterprise.
i doubt their comm. will penetrate the em field any better than our own. if we can access their helm controls we might be able to put this vessel into a stable orbit.
i haven't had much experience at piloting klingon ships.
we have no other choice.
"start translating those consoles. look for anything marked propulsion, helm, navigation."
"i'll try, but reading klingon is a lot different than speaking it."
we could always try waking one of them to help us.
"all right.  kolat chack tabak. plasma containment, maybe."
you're certain?
containment. i'm certain.
pu'dah dak cha. something they call photon torpedoes.
photon torpedoes? i've never heard of anything like that. what else?
"well, this all looks like weapons systems. torpedoes, tactical sensors, disruptor arrays."
what about this one?
i recognise pressure. ka'tahl. that can mean wall or barrier.
or hull?
maybe.
if i'm reading this correctly we've got a few hours at most. the hull integrity's failing.
then we'd better hurry. this appears to be the helm station.
i think you're right. quee nagah. impulse drive.
"good work, hoshi."
hoshi?
it says the pressure's failing in the j'khat bah. fusion manifold. do you know what that means?
"to quote our very own mister tucker, that means we're dead in the water."
archer to boarding party. come in.
"we read you, captain."
how are you holding up?
"we're doing okay, sir. it's nice to hear your voice."
what's your status?
"we've been attempting to restart their engines, but they appear to be offline."
don't worry about it. we're coming to get you.
"travis, how much farther?"
"ten thousand metres, but i'm having a hard time getting a fix on them. too much interference."
is our probe still working?
barely.
try using it to triangulate their position.
the probe's gone.
"sir, external pressure's at maximum."
i'm afraid we've got a little hitch in our rescue plan.
the hull plating's failing.
we'll be back for you as soon as we can.
"in the meantime, just sit tight."
"captain, you're breaking up. captain?"
release me. cowards! let me die on my feet.
"t'pol was right. there's a neurotoxin in her bloodstream. untreated, it could kill her within a day or two."
can you do anything?
i'm working on it.
t'pol said the klingons were unconscious. why is this one so lively?
she's showing the effects of hypothermia. my guess is she took refuge in a low temperature environment aboard her ship. the cold would have delayed the effects of the toxin.
i demand to speak to your captain.
"you know, i read if they sense a leader's weak, they'll try to kill him and take command."
i'm the captain.
i've never seen your kind before but you have made an enemy of the klingon empire.
"from what i've noticed, that's not hard to do. you stranded three of my people down there."
"you raided my vessel, infected my crew."
we didn't infect anyone. we boarded your ship to try and help.
liar.
"look, i don't know what happened to your crew but we had nothing to do with it. now your vessel is sinking deeper into the atmosphere and unless we do something, it'll be destroyed."
better that than let it fall into your hands.
"i've got three very capable people on your ship. let them help. if you tell them how to get the engines running, they can fly it out of there."
and fly it where? back to your world to steal our secrets?
no.
"when our birds of prey arrive, your ship will be destroyed."
remind me to stop trying to help people.
i found these schematics in the vulcan database. it's a raptor class scout vessel.
how long will it last down there?
"its hull's at least twice as thick as ours, reinforced with some kind of coherent molecular alloy."
"yeah, it's a tough little ship but it can't hold up under that pressure forever. what if we use duratanium braces to reinforce a shuttlepod? it won't look pretty but, it might hold up long enough for us to get our people out."
our only other option is for t'pol and malcolm to fix a broken-down klingon ship and fly it out themselves.
i don't think we're going to get any help from our guest in sickbay. get started on those braces.
keep an eye out for any klingon ships coming this way.
"aye, sir."
the one time we need our chief engineer is the one time we leave him behind.
come look at this.
"oonos thrott! nej jos mich ka xanant 'ach pagh q'tahl class planet. we destroyed their ship, but we've sustained damage in our port fusion injector. we've descended into the outer atmosphere of a q'tahl class planet to make repairs in case there are other xarantine ships in the area. my crew is falling ill and i have been unable to determine why. if we had died when the xarantine attacked our honour would be secure, but to fall victim to some disease, to be crushed into nothing in the depths of this miserable planet."
sounds like we need to find the port fusion injector.
"wait, i saw that somewhere. here. one deck below us. it's in the reactor pit."
reactor pit? could that be engineering?
could be.
this one?
no. that says something about plasma induction. here it is. port fusion injector.
i think i might have made a tactical error dealing with the klingon woman. i asked her for help. she could see that as a sign of weakness.
you been boning up on your klingon psychology?
"we've run into them three times, and every time they've wanted to destroy us. i'd love to figure out why."
"well, maybe the best thing is just to steer clear of them."
"that may not be so easy. we could use their help right now. if we can re-establish a comm. signal with t'pol and the others, the klingon woman could probably talk them through the repairs, but she's got a thousand generations of instinct telling her not to trust me."
maybe it's time you started thinking like a klingon.
sickbay to captain archer.
go ahead.
"you'll be pleased to know i've developed an antitoxin. there's an interesting wrinkle, though. when you have a moment i'd like to share it with you."
argh!
are you okay?
yes. i seem to be getting a little light-headed. must be the heat.
you're dehydrated. you need some water.
"i saw a galley on the schematics. deck four, blue sector. i'll see what i can find."
you shouldn't go alone.
watch yourselves.
"it's called gagh. it's a klingon delicacy, but only when they're alive."
they look like worms.
they are worms.
ugh!
targs. klingons prefer their food freshly slaughtered. are you all right?
i promised myself i wouldn't do this.
you're in a dangerous situation in an alien environment. your anxiety is understandable.
"don't you mean, for a human?"
you can't deny your nature.
"this may sound strange but i envy you sometimes. i know, another pesky human emotion, but there are times i wish i could just ignore my feelings. bury them the way vulcans do."
take my hand.
excuse me?
my hand. close your eyes.
think of yourself on a turbulent ocean. you have the power to control the waves.
"whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working."
focus. the waves are subsiding. the water is growing still. you're in control.
that was amazing.
"when we return to the ship, i'll teach you how to do it on your own."
thanks.
"lieutenant reed, report."
the hull pressure's approaching critical. this ship's about to be crushed.
it'll work.
"if you're wrong, you could destroy the ship."
"look, even with hoshi's help it could take hours just to find the fusion injector in here. we're out of time."
i say we try the weapons.
how do you know you can even access the tactical systems?
"if there's one thing on board this ship i ought to be able to figure out, it's the torpedoes."
i'd like to run one more structural diagnostic before you launch.
qapla'.
beg your pardon?
success. i decided to take your advice about thinking like a klingon. the vulcan database has about nine hundred pages on them.
learn anything?
plenty. they're driven by a warrior mentality. they tend to view anyone they meet as a potential enemy.
that may explain why our guest is so irritable.
"they also have a strong sense of duty. er, heh cho' mruak tah. death before dishonour. finish up that diagnostic. i'll be in sickbay."
going to go put your homework to use?
something like that.
please relax. if you strain against the straps you might hurt yourself.
what's that? is that what you used against my crew?
doctor phlox has developed an antidote to the neurotoxin in your system.
"is this how you plan to gain my trust? first poison me, then miraculously cure me?"
have you had a drink lately?
what?
"the bio-agent that affected you and your crew was consumed, apparently in alcohol."
"specifically, the toxin was bonded to a molecule unique to xarantine ale."
there was a raid.
"yes? i can understand your not wanting to talk about it, if the raid went badly for you."
the xarantines are no match for us! we attacked their outpost and took what we wanted.
and that included some xarantine ale?
did your whole crew drink it?
the triumph belonged to all.
"i'll take that as a yes. it was that ale that infected you, not us. think about it. when did your crew start getting sick? was it right after the raid? after you celebrated your victory?"
this is a trick.
"is it? how do you feel? better or worse since the injection? we can make enough of this for your entire crew, if it's not too late. what if this isn't a trick? what if we're telling you the truth? you'd be letting your crew die a very dishonourable death when you could have saved them. can you live with that?"
one thousand metres. two thousand. three thousand.
no effect! we're still sinking.
the shock wave dissipated before it reached us.
we'll need to detonate one closer next time.
the ship's hull is under enough pressure already. if you detonate a torpedo too close.
"and if i don't? we need to generate a large enough shock wave to push us into a higher orbit. to do that, the blast has to be big and it has to be close."
you heard the sub-commander. load two this time.
sensor resolution's dropping off.
this was your plan? to grope in the darkness and hope to stumble across my ship?
that's how we found it the first time.
what was that?
weapons fire.
where?
"bearing two nine seven mark two six one, down about two kilometres."
did it work?
"we've moved up, but only two hundred metres."
that's all?
"a compartment just collapsed. deck three, green sector."
this whole damn ship's coming apart. how many torpedoes do we have left?
six.
load two more.
it won't be enough.
load the weapons.
we already tried. it didn't work.
ensign.
she's right. we'll never reach a safe altitude climbing a few hundred metres at a time.
the longer we stand around arguing the more ground we lose.
fire them all. what if we detonated all the torpedoes at once?
"we may gain enough altitude, but i doubt we'd make it in one piece."
i don't know about you but i'm willing to take the chance.
we'll detonate at eight hundred metres.
"i was thinking more like five hundred. look, i didn't come all this way to get crushed in the atmosphere of some anonymous gas giant. loading ports one through six."
brace yourselves.
torpedoes armed.
what is it?
another explosion. there's a shock wave this time. hang on.
t'pol.
what have you been shooting at?
we used the shock waves to gain some altitude but it's only temporary. we'll start sinking again unless we can come up with a way to get this ship out of here.
i brought someone who should be able to help do just that. we're docking now.
i believe you've all met officer bu'kah. what's the status of their engines?
"the klingon crew made most of the necessary repairs before they were overcome, but the port fusion injector is still damaged."
i will tend to my own ship.
i didn't bring you down here just so you could die with your shipmates. my crew risked their lives to get this ship out of danger. i don't intend to leave until the job is finished.
"sir, there are two ships approaching at high warp. i think they're klingon."
how long till they get here?
sixteen minutes. we're being hailed. it's the captain.
on screen.
"this is klingon raptor somraw, hailing enterprise. request permission to disembark four passengers."
"well, i don't see why not."
i kept your seat warm for you.
"thanks. get ready to break orbit, travis. i think we've had about enough of this place."
"aye, captain. it's the raptor, sir. they're hailing us."
calling to say thanks?
i doubt it. put it through.
prepare to surrender your vessel.
"maybe your engineer neglected to tell you, but we just saved you and your crew."
"you violated our ship, accessed our weapons."
it was either that or stand by and watch you get crushed.
disruptors!
they're charging weapons.
"you wouldn't last ten seconds in a battle with us. you've got multiple hull breaches, your shields are down, and from what i'm told you're fresh out of torpedoes. if i were you, i'd take what little honour i had left and go home. fire one shot and i'll blast you right back to where we found you."
they're moving off.
get us out of here before their friends show up.
is someone going to get that?
you're closer.
t'pol.
this is doctor phlox. you'll be happy to know that you're now free of any microbes or parasites. your captivity in decon is over.
"are you sure, doctor? who knows what was living on that ship?"
what if we picked up something your scans can't detect?
"well, i'm quite sure you didn't. i've run every possible test."
"maybe you should run them again, doctor. i believe i'm developing a slight headache."
"of course, if you insist. i wouldn't want to miss anything."
"thank you, doctor."
that should buy us at least another half an hour.
"oh, i could stay in here all day."
"went to a spa once in mexico. the most relaxing place i've ever been, but it doesn't compare to this. oh, it certainly feels nice to be clean again."
it is pleasant.
do you smell that?
i don't smell anything.
exactly.
the loss to the vulcan people is incalculable. p'jem was one of our most revered sanctuaries.
"ambassador, we are very sorry for your loss, but with all due respect the high command has to take some responsibility. you were using the monastery as a surveillance station."
we were observing a dangerous and aggressive neighbour. the andorians wouldn't have found the station if your people hadn't interfered. they've been in space for six months and they've already destabilised an entire sector.
"i'm afraid i can't agree with that, ambassador. this was a volatile situation long before starfleet got involved. perhaps if you'd been a little more open with us, this tragedy might have been avoided."
we warned you something like this would happen. he's too impulsive. captain gardner would have made a far more suitable commanding officer.
the vulcan consulate doesn't make command assignments here.
"there was a time when your people sought our guidance. i regret that time has passed. i've been recalled to vulcan for consultation. in the meantime, our joint fleet operations have been suspended."
"yes, admiral?"
get me captain archer.
aye sir.
i noticed we changed course overnight.
i found a new system in the vulcan database. coridan. they're only a few light years away so i thought we'd take a look.
inhabited?
"just over three billion humanoids. apparently, the vulcans have a mining agreement with them. i had hoshi send a message to their chancellor and she invited us to visit their capital city."
then i'll start shining my boots.
"i think i'll just take hoshi, this time. the chancellor asked me to limit the number of people i bring down until they get to know us better."
oh.
"it's really too bad. according to the database, they've got the largest starship construction yards in the sector. they're supposed to have ships that can run circles around the vulcans."
better than six five?
"they say some coridan ships have reached warp seven, but that's just a rumour."
warp seven?
you should lend hoshi your camera. i'll be sure she takes lots of pictures.
you had me going there for a minute.
you're just too easy a target.
"so you're taking me, right?"
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"i'm receiving a transmission from starfleet command. it's admiral forrest, sir."
was anyone killed?
"the andorians gave the monks three hours before they started their bombardment. fortunately, they all got out in time."
how are the vulcans taking this?
not well.
i can't really blame the andorians for reacting this way.
jon.
if the roles were reversed the vulcans might have done the same thing.
the vulcans may have good reason for keeping an eye on them. i've seen the reports. these andorian commandos are a dangerous group.
that's the same crap the vulcans used to say about us.
"jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you've got to be more careful. earth can't be getting involved in inter-species conflicts."
i understand.
i'm afraid i've got some more bad news.
come in. have a seat.
i just spoke with admiral forrest. there's no easy way to say this. the andorians destroyed the sanctuary at p'jem.
were there any survivors?
"fortunately, the monks and the intelligence operatives were given advance warning. they're fine."
was there time to remove any of the relics?
i don't know. the high command believes we're to blame for this. they're sending a ship to take you back to vulcan. it'll be here in two days.
i won't have time to complete my scans of this sector. i'll ask ensign mayweather to finish them.
maybe i wasn't clear. this isn't a temporary transfer. they're reassigning you.
"i understand the situation, captain. i'm certain the high command will find you a suitable replacement."
am i the only one who has a problem with this? because you seem perfectly fine.
my assignment to the enterprise was only supposed to last eight days. it was unrealistic to expect it to continue indefinitely.
"the high command is looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame. they can't punish me so they're taking it out on my science officer. sounds like an emotional reaction, if you ask me."
i am largely responsible for what happened.
"don't give yourself too much credit. i was the one who found p'jem in the database, and i led the landing party. i want you to know i'm filing a protest with the high command."
that won't make any difference.
you don't know that.
"captain, i was assigned to enterprise not simply as an observer, but to represent the interests of the vulcan people. it's clear in the eyes of my superiors i haven't done that."
they have no right to do this to you. you're a part of my crew.
for another forty eight hours. was there anything else?
no.
"this is just another part of the joke, right?"
"sorry, trip, but i've got to take t'pol on this one. i need to spend some time with her alone."
: now i know you're pulling my leg.
t'pol's being transferred. a vulcan ship's on its way to take her back.
what?
meet me for lunch. i'll fill you in.
may i? i just heard about your transfer. i'm sorry you'll be leaving us. i'm sure you'll excel at whatever new assignment you're given.
i haven't received another assignment.
i assumed you were being promoted.
my superiors believe that i'm responsible for the destruction of the p'jem sanctuary.
do you agree with their assessment?
it's the logical conclusion.
"i'm certain the high command would reconsider your transfer if they knew everything you've done for this crew. you realise you're not the first vulcan officer to be posted aboard a human starship. the high command has tried this before but none of the others lasted more than a few weeks. they found their crewmates too chaotic and unpredictable. but you've been here more than six months and you haven't merely tolerated this crew, you've become part of it. isn't it logical to take pride in that accomplishment?"
pride is a human indulgence.
"i suppose it is. oh, i have it on good authority that several crewmembers are planning a gathering in your honour. i believe it's called a going-away party. i'd keep on alert if i were you."
"so, what do you know about coridan?"
"there are three billion inhabitants, mostly concentrated in several cities in the equatorial region."
"i wasn't asking for the statistics. your people have been coming here for decades. you must know something about their culture, the kinds of food they eat, what they do for fun."
the vulcan database doesn't contain that information.
of course not.
i am uncertain why i was chosen for this mission.
these people have never seen humans before. it makes sense for someone with a familiar face to make the introductions.
i have a lot of work to complete before the vulcan ship arrives.
"don't worry, i'll get you back in plenty of time. i just thought you might enjoy one final mission with your captain. or maybe i should just take you back to enterprise."
we're only a few minutes from the capital. returning to the ship now would be a waste of fuel.
enterprise to captain archer.
"go ahead, trip."
"we're reading a ship closing on you, fast."
i got it.
some kind of fixed wing aircraft.
did the chancellor say anything about sending an escort?
i don't think they're an escort.
alien vessel. reduce to one quarter power and adjust heading to three one seven mark five.
i'm taking evasive action. bring the plasma weapons online.
ready.
fire.
houdini could get out of this.
perhaps you should invite him on your next mission.
"harry houdini was a magician, an escape artist. he was famous for being able to free himself from any kind of restraint. rope, chains, anything."
that seems unlikely.
that's why he was called a magician. some people say he was double-jointed. i don't suppose vulcans are double-jointed.
unfortunately not.
a vulcan. what brings you to coridan?
"if you want answers, talk to me."
you're her superior?
that's right.
i don't recognize your species.
"i'm human, from the planet earth."
never heard of vulcans taking orders from anyone.
there's been a misunderstanding. we're here at the invitation of your chancellor.
"she's not my chancellor. that government is kept in power by the vulcans. if you're with them, you're on the wrong side."
what kind of weapon is this? if you won't tell me
it's a phase pistol.
we'll put these to good use. i'm curious about your starship. what can you tell me about it?
our protein resequencer can make chicken sandwiches.
stop! he's not a tactical officer. he's the ship's steward. we're here to prepare a banquet for your chancellor.
"your people have a reputation for truthfulness. you wouldn't be lying to me, would you, vulcan? now i understand. you're the captain, aren't you?"
perhaps.
"whoever you are, you picked the wrong time for a visit."
a steward?
"we believe your shuttle was forced down by members of a radical faction, but since the attack took place outside our sensor grid, your officers won't be easy to find."
you didn't tell us about any factions.
"they're a small group. we had no idea they were capable of an attack like this. but be assured, commander, your people are almost certainly still alive."
almost certainly?
"the radicals will want something in exchange for the hostages. they always do. side arms, dicobalt explosives. it's important that you don't give them anything."
is this how you protect your visitors?
you might have told us about your little war before you invited us down.
"we're not at war, commander. this is an isolated incident."
i don't care what you call it. we just want to know where are people are.
we are doing everything in our power to find them.
we're not going to sit on our hands and wait for a ransom note. start scanning for human and vulcan biosigns.
there are billions of people down there. it could take days.
it might be easier to locate the shuttlepod.
"i'll try, but if the pod's been powered down it's almost impossible to pick up its signature."
we've got to start somewhere.
ready?
yes.
go.
easy.
come on. go.
i think we got a little higher that time.
only a few centimetres.
that's not frustration i hear in your voice.
no.
"good. let's try it again. one, two, three."
ready?
yes.
go.
i think these are starting to come loose. how about yours?
"slightly. if we can turn around, face each other."
we might be able to untie these knots. you'd think the vulcan database might have mentioned these people were fighting a civil war.
the database is accurate. the coridan government doesn't view this as a civil war.
"i imagine your people are going to want their database back, too. well, they can have it."
can you reach the knot?
"i believe so. without the database you wouldn't have found this planet, or p'jem."
"you're not responsible for what happened. you didn't have any idea that your people had installed a listening post, or that there were andorian commandos there."
enterprise had no good reason to visit a vulcan sanctuary. i had the opportunity to protest but i chose not to.
it's clear that living among humans has caused my reasoning to become compromised.
i think i understand. you're running away because you're afraid to become one of us.
i am not running away.
then why aren't you fighting this transfer?
your people took something away from my father that meant a lot to him. they're not going to do the same thing to me.
go get his weapon.
stop!
it's definitely a ditanium signature about four kilometres outside the capital.
it's practically under their noses.
"from what we can tell, the entire capital is surrounded by a shanty town. there are almost as many biosigns on the outskirts as there are inside the city."
looks like these people have a lot to learn about building a free society. have you found human or vulcan biosigns?
not yet.
what about the pod's transponder?
"they must have switched it off. sir, i've got a rescue team standing by in the launch bay."
"hold on, malcolm. we don't even know if this is our pod. i don't want to go down and find it's some alien tractor."
it's our shuttlepod. i'm certain of it. all i'm suggesting is we go down and have a look around.
"sir, we're being hailed. audio only."
who is it?
i can't tell.
put them through.
is this enterprise?
yes. and you are?
"we're holding your captain and your steward. in exchange for their safe return we want forty of your phase weapons, the same type we found aboard your shuttle. you'll be hailed at this time tomorrow."
"wait, let me talk to the captain."
i'm sure you wouldn't want any harm to come to her. we'll rely on your full compliance.
hello?
they've cut transmission.
were you able to trace it?
they were using a triaxilating signal.
they called the captain 'her'. are we sure they've got the right hostages?
at least it sounds like they're still alive.
"for how long? we don't have forty phase pistols, we've got fifteen, and even if we give them to these people there's no guarantee they'll keep their word. we know where the shuttle is. we have to send a team down now while we still have the element of surprise."
we're getting another transmission.
probably thought of something else they want.
"it's not from the planet. it's coming from a vulcan ship, the ni'var."
put it up.
where's captain archer?
he's not here right now. can i help you?
inform him that we'll be arriving within the hour.
you guys made great time. we weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
you obviously made an error in your calculations. please have sub-commander t'pol ready to depart when we arrive.
we've got a bit of a problem. she's not here either. she and the captain were on their way to the capital city when they were kidnapped.
how convenient.
"i'm telling you, they were kidnapped."
how do you know this?
maybe the ransom demand we just received gave us a clue. they threatened to kill them both if we didn't give them what they want.
it would be irrational to kill the hostages. they would lose their negotiating position.
"maybe we're not dealing with the most rational people down there, did you consider that?"
"since the situation involves a vulcan officer, we will take over the investigation. it would be best if you refrained from any foolish endeavours."
what the hell's that supposed
i'm getting real sick of being cut off.
your vessel is ill-equipped to mount a rescue mission. you would most likely become captives yourselves. my team will penetrate their base of operations.
what does that mean?
sounds to me like you're planning an assault.
did it ever occur to you that that could get the captain and t'pol killed?
"we've dealt with this sort of threat in the past. swift, decisive action is the logical response."
you're awfully trigger-happy for someone who's repressed his emotions.
they've threatened the life of a vulcan officer. we must discourage any such incidents in the future.
this isn't your planet. maybe the coridan government has something to say about this.
i've already been in contact with the chancellor. she's given me full authority to implement this action.
"you don't really care what happens to them, do you? you probably wouldn't mind if they got caught in the crossfire. you'd consider it payback for what happened at p'jem."
it is not vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists.
not even if it saves lives?
any data you may have on the location of your captain and the sub-commander would be useful.
"sorry, we don't have anything."
warm up the shuttlepod.
we can't eat like this.
friendly.
can you pick up yours?
no.
"dig in, sub-commander. i don't think you'll be able to send this back for some plomeek broth."
i'm not hungry.
"i didn't ask if you were hungry. you need to keep up your strength, so eat. that's an order."
look at this.
we're being hailed. it's the vulcans.
here we go.
this is sopek. where's commander tucker?
he's unavailable at the moment. can i take a message?
i want to know where that shuttlepod was going.
what shuttlepod is that?
the one that left your launch bay nine minutes ago.
"i really wouldn't know, sir. we get shuttlepods coming and going all the time. it's a little like union station around here."
i want to know where commander tucker is.
"i'm sorry, your transmission's breaking up."
i guess not everyone gets to live in emerald city.
yeah.
you should have listened to the vulcan. he warned you against doing anything foolish.
what the hell are you doing here?
"looking out for you pink skins. if you had gone anywhere near that shuttlepod, you'd have been killed."
they left it in the open for you to find.
how do you know what sopek told me? that was a secure transmission.
"sopek is the senior vulcan officer in the sector. naturally, we keep him under close surveillance. we've been monitoring all vulcan transmissions and ship deployments since the incident at p'jem. we know they're preparing for a war against us."
"i'm no fan of the vulcans, but they're not warmongers."
"there's already a war going on, and the vulcans are in the middle of it. several rebel factions here are working to overthrow their government, a corrupt government that has very close ties to your peace loving, logical friends."
"so, you and the rebels figure you both have a common enemy."
"the hostage-takers have no plans to return your captain or the female. once you deliver the weapons, they'll be killed. fortunately for you, we have a relationship with the down-trodden here."
you tried to kill us last time we met. why are you trying to help us now?
"i haven't slept well since our encounter at the vulcan sanctuary. i don't like being indebted to anyone, least of all your captain."
you're right. you never would have found that spy station without his help.
"once he's free, my debt will be repaid in full. show them."
your people are being held here. these are barracks for the guards.
how many?
"at least four inside the compound, two more up on the wall here, and two guards outside the gate. all armed with particle weapons."
how'd you get this level of detail?
we have an operative inside the compound.
"unless he's going to take out these guards, you're not going to have an easy time getting all the way to the hostages."
it's not your concern.
it is if you get the captain killed. you're outnumbered four to one. wouldn't you like to improve those odds?
they could be useful.
give them their weapons.
"captain, can you hear me?"
trip?
"it's me and malcolm, sir. we're about half a kilometre away."
just the two of you?
"not exactly. we met up with some old friends down here. andorians. apparently, one of them thinks he owes you a favour."
he couldn't have picked a better time.
"one of the people guarding you is working with them. when he unties you, head for the gate. it's about twenty metres from the building you're in. until he shows up, just sit tight."
that won't be a problem.
"cold, isn't it? andorian ale?"
it'll warm you up.
who's that?
"oh, it's just my friend. nothing to"
"get off me. hey, let me go."
what the hell is going on?
get down.
vulcans! did you know they were planning to do this?
you're the ones who have their comm. system bugged.
our escape plan's shot to hell.
we've got to get them out of there.
"good to see you, captain."
what's going on?
vulcans crashed our rescue party.
thanks.
i believe this is yours. it's the scanner she gave me from the vulcan listening post.
seems you went to a lot of trouble to return it.
i'm here for only one reason. i need a good night's sleep. my debt is repaid.
your presence here is a violation of the tau ceti accords.
you lecture us about treaty violations?
put down your weapons!
i know better than to lower my guard around vulcans.
"look, we're all on the same side here."
let's get her to the ship.
she's no longer your responsibility. we'll treat her on the ni'var.
she's still my science officer. is the pod close?
"yes, sir."
let's go.
"you should be the one dying, not her."
how is she?
her injuries were quite extensive.
will she live?
i wish i could say.
"i know how you must feel. she saved my life once too. she can be a real pain in the ass. stubborn, arrogant. sometimes she makes me angry enough, i want to shove her out an airlock. i can understand why the high command's upset, but it took a lot of courage to step in front of that plasma bullet. do you really want to take her back home in disgrace?"
nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary.
"i'm not asking anyone to pin a medal on her. all i'm asking is that she be given a second chance. if a respected vulcan captain went before the high command and made a plea on t'pol's behalf, told them how she saved the life of a superior officer, wouldn't they think twice about this transfer?"
i can't return without her.
she's suffered extreme trauma. i wouldn't advise moving her for quite some time.
"i'm meeting with the high command in three days. perhaps, if there's time, i'll discuss this matter with them."
thank you.
what happened?
"whoa, whoa, whoa. you were shot. don't you remember?"
captain sopek?
"he's all right, thanks to you."
i'd like to return to my quarters.
i'm afraid you're going to have to stay here at least another twenty four hours.
you made quite an impression on sopek. i've got a feeling he's going to talk to the high command about that transfer order. i'd say the odds are pretty good you're going to be with us for a while longer.
you should have consulted me first.
it's probably not too late if you want to catch up to him.
that won't be possible. leaving sickbay would violate my doctor's orders.
"the captain said they'd be mapping this asteroid field, but i can't see head nor tails of them."
maybe it's another asteroid field.
"no, this is the one. two primaries, seventeen planetesimals."
"well, they weren't expecting us back for three days. maybe they finished and went off to do something else."
"well, with our sensor array down, we won't know when they get back until we see them. any luck with the comm?"
dead as a doornail. i don't understand it.
"well, no doubt you'll have your boys take this pod apart piece by piece once it's back in the launch bay."
i'd feel a lot more comfortable having everything in working order by the time enterprise gets back.
"well, tinker all you like. i've got a copy of ulysses here. i doubt i'll even be halfway through it by the time the ship gets back."
i'd rather realign every micro-circuit on this shuttle than try to wade through that baby.
british schools have a core curriculum. it serves to provide a well-rounded education. sometimes i think you north americans read nothing but comic books and those ridiculous science fiction novels.
i'll have you know that superman was laced with metaphor. subtext layered on subtext.
"oh, if only doctor cochrane had been a european. the vulcans would have been far less reticent to help us. but, no, he had to be from montana. he probably spent his nights reading about cowboys and indians."
"well, i don't recall any europeans figuring out how to build a warp engine."
commander.
"no brits, no italians, no serbo-croatians."
commander. i think you'd better come and take a look at this.
bring us in closer.
is it a ship?
"if the damn sensors were only working, we could. bring us around again. there. slow down."
come in. how are the tesnians doing?
dr. phlox can only keep twelve of them in the decon chamber at a time.
"what about the other, what is it, twenty two?"
he's rotating them. they seem to be doing fine on our atmosphere but they need at least six hours of boron gas a day. he says we've got enough to get them home.
have you learned their language?
"yes, sir."
what do they have to say?
they're pretty rattled. most of them have been on that ship for years. it's a lot to digest they lost everything.
they're alive. does the captain have any idea what happened?
"no, and he feels terrible about the damage to enterprise. he has no idea what went wrong. when they approached our docking port they lost control of their sensor array, and then a few seconds later their navigation system went out."
thank god their escape pods were working.
i saw the wreckage on the asteroid. there wasn't much left.
archer to mayweather. what's our eta?
"we should reach tesnia in about twenty hours, sir."
good work. that should get us back to our rendezvous co-ordinates well before trip and malcolm get there. let's drop out of warp for a few minutes. i want to inspect the damage to the launch doors.
"aye, sir."
who's in charge of engineering while trip's away?
lieutenant hess.
tell her to get a team working on a new starboard door for launch bay two.
everything else check out all right?
astrometrics detected what could be micro-singularities in the vicinity of the asteroid field.
micro-singularities are a vulcan myth. there's no scientific evidence that they exist.
our deflectors registered some unusual charged particles at the same time the tesnian ship began to malfunction.
any similar damage on enterprise?
"no, but our hull plating was polarised."
micro-singularities. if the vulcans had their way they'd blame them for the common cold.
how about the lifeboats? they could have launched the lifeboats before the crash.
they'd be here. they only go three hundred kph. they'd be right here waiting for us to return.
are we sure there are no survivors?
"commander, we have to figure out what we're going to do."
we can't just leave. that's enterprise. at least we should find the black boxes.
with what? we have no radio. nothing to pick up the beacons.
what's the range in our distress beacon?
it's offline.
i'm talking about the portable one. the one in the away kit.
"ten million kilometers, maybe twenty, but i highly doubt there'd be a ship anywhere close to that."
we've only got ten days worth of breathable air. how far to echo three?
at impulse? a lot more than ten days.
"well, if we could get close enough for it to pick up our distress beacon it'd relay the signal back to starfleet."
"i'm afraid the math doesn't work out, commander. it's going to take weeks, maybe months for our signal to reach echo three. by the time starfleet got a ship out here we'd be, we'd be long dead."
"but at least they'd find us. they'd get their shuttlepod back, a couple of well-preserved corpses."
sir.
which way?
which way to what?
echo three. which way to echo three?
"i told you, it's too far."
do you know which direction it is or don't you?
navigation is down.
that's not what i asked you.
you want me to guess?
"you come from a long line of navy men and you got a real good memory. look hard at those stars, find something that looks familiar and tell me which way to go."
sir.
that's an order!
i don't suppose you have a sextant handy.
i left it with my slide rule.  well?
"that blue giant, we may have gone by it. i'm not sure."
that's good enough for me. take one more low pass over the wreckage and then set a course.
"see you around, captain."
"personal log, lieutenant malcolm reed. november 9, 2151. by the time anyone hears this, by anyone, i suppose i mean anyone human, commander tucker and i will be long dead. it's my intention to recount the events that led to the destruction of the starship enterprise and to express my deepest feelings regarding my short but memorable service with starfleet."
"tell them i'd love to add my two cents, but i'm trying to get a little work done."
short but memorable service with starfleet.
"in order to test the targeting scanners on shuttlepod one, commander tucker and i had to get at least twenty thousand kilometres from enterprise. during our third trial, we experienced a brief but sizable jolt, and shortly thereafter realised that our sensor array had gone offline."
this sensor array is more than offline. it's totally fried.
"that our sensor array had gone offline.  we had no choice but to head back to the asteroid field where enterprise was involved in a mapping project. we found the ship destroyed, its debris strewn across a square kilometre of one of the larger asteroids. had our sensors been working we certainly would have done everything possible to determine the cause of the disaster, but as it was, with only a short-range distress beacon and limited air, we had no alternative but to set a course for echo three where someday this vessel and eventually this log, will be found. may god have mercy on our souls."
why don't you cut the crap and get back here and help me?
what would you like me to do?
"i don't know. you could hold this flashlight, or turn down the heat. whatever you want. i'm just getting a little tired of listening to all your pessimism."
"if there's something you need me to do i would be more than happy to comply, but i'm afraid pessimism is simply not an accurate description of my log entry. i'm just being realistic, commander."
we've got nine days. we're bound to find someone out here.
"at warp, perhaps, but at impulse?"
"vulcans, klingons, suliban, xyrillians, andorians. god knows who's going to be lurking around the next planet we run into."
"but that's just it, sir. at impulse, we're not likely to be running into any planets. not for at least six or seven years."
then somebody can run into us. you ever think of that? or see us on their sensors. the possibilities are endless.
i'll heat up some rations. unless of course you'd rather wait until we run into a vessel serving proper meals.
rations will be fine.
what are you in the mood for?
depends. what are you serving?
veal marsala. chilean sea bass. moo goo gai pan.
any meat loaf?
with gravy and mashed potatoes.
perfect.
kentucky bourbon.
"yeah, the captain was planning to give that to somebody. can't remember who. guess it's ours now."
what's that?
the sea bass.
any good?
it's lovely. thank you.
"captain archer claims you told him you weren't even aware that i was serving on enterprise. i find that difficult to believe, considering i wrote you twice in the weeks prior to our departure. now, it is possible that you never received those letters. you were, i believe, in the process of moving back to malaysia at the time. but you must have spoken to aunt sherry during that period, and i know she received my letters. i would hate to go to my death thinking that either of you felt i was trying to avoid"
malcolm! you've been at it for hours now. don't you think it's time to give it a rest?
"as i'm sure you must have heard that was my esteemed colleague, commander charles tucker. mister tucker doesn't share my belief that it is essential to say what must be said, to leave a record, tie up loose ends. mister tucker is labouring under the false hope that we are going to be miraculously rescued before we both suffocate."
"mister and mrs. reed, i realise that you've just begun a period of mourning and that i'll never get an answer to this question, but i got to ask it anyway. was malcolm always this cynical?"
"in a few days, when the reality of this situation actually begins to sink in, you might very well decide you want to record some logs of your own. you have my word, i will not interrupt you."
"i just need to get some sleep, malcolm! is that so hard to understand?"
we have less than nine days of oxygen left. it seems a waste to use it up sleeping.
"if i don't waste some oxygen sleeping, i'm going to start getting real cranky, and you don't want to spend your last nine days cooped up with me when i'm cranky. so turn that thing off and get some rest."
we're back.
"lie still, lieutenant."
what happened? how did we?
"you're a very brave man, malcolm. commander tucker's going to be fine, thanks to you."
i'm afraid i don't understand.
get some rest. there will be plenty of time to explain what happened in the morning.
sub-commander?
how are you feeling?
i'd feel a lot better if i knew what was going on.
captain archer would be quite annoyed with me if i told you of your heroics. i believe he's looking forward to doing that himself in the morning.
heroics?
i had no idea you could be so selfless in the face of such danger. most males of your species would have given in to their fear.
"well, since you're obviously not going to tell me what happened i suppose a simple good night will have to do."
vulcans can never ignore courage.
and this vulcan will never ignore lieutenant malcolm reed again.
"i can't say i've ever ignored you, t'pol. is it all right if i call you t'pol?"
yes. may i call you malcolm?
"i suppose so. but, if the truth be known, i've never much cared for the name malcolm. always seemed a bit too stuffy."
i think it's a lovely name. mol-kom is the vulcan word for serenity.
"well, then, perhaps i won't change it. pity, though. i was rather growing fond of the name stinky. i can't believe you just did that."
did what?
you smiled. i saw you smile.
vulcans don't smile.
this one does. i saw you.
"it was when i said stinky, wasn't it? you smiled when i said stinky. good morning, stinky. it's a lovely day,` isn't it, stinky?"
what's that?
i got the receiver working but the transmitter's a lost cause. who's stinky?
i beg your pardon?
you were talking in your sleep. you kept calling for some guy named stinky.
you repaired the receiver. what is that? is it a ship?
"you know, the range is very limited. it's probably just white noise. the sound of the galaxy laughing at us."
what the hell was that?
"i don't know, but it felt a little like whatever knocked out the sensor array."
we're losing atmosphere. pressure's down eight percent.
help me. we've got to find the hole.
without sensors it's not going to be easy to locate the breach.
then use your ears.
pressure's down twenty two percent.
the damn hole's too small.
where is it?
what are you doing?
it's nitrogen for the coolant tanks. just give me a few seconds.
now let's find that leak.
i got it. it's over here.
there's another one down here. put your finger on it until we can figure out what to do.
we've got some valve sealant in storage bin three.
have we got anything a little closer?
do you mind passing your meat loaf?
what?
i assume you've finished with it.
"and you came close to criticising my choice of cuisine. obviously, whatever hit us went clear through the pod."
"i'm afraid it did more than just puncture the cabin, commander. on it's way out it was kind enough to rupture one of the o2 cylinders."
great. how much closer to oblivion are we?
we've got less than two days of air left.
the skin of this pod is designed to deflect a meteor five times the size of this hole.
"in that case, i'd guess it wasn't a meteor. i wonder if something like it destroyed enterprise."
we'll never know.
always the optimist.
"we have forty hours of air left. what do you expect me to do, sit here and plan my wedding?"
i'm confident there'll be a charles tucker the fourth one day.
then maybe it's your wedding we should be planning. that's assuming we can find you a bride in the next day and a half. any suggestions?
there was a little bar in mill valley where all the starfleet trainees used to go.
the 602 club.
you know it?
i was there more times than i can remember.
"i met the girl of my dreams my first friday night there. she was the one. there's no doubt about it. we had it all figured out. where we'd live, how many kids we'd have. ah, ruby. whatever happened to you?"
ruby? you don't mean the waitress ruby?
you knew ruby?
i knew her more times than i can remember.
ouch.
seems we have more in common than we thought.
yeah.  would another half day be worth freezing your butt off?
what are you talking about?
"if we lower the thermostat in here to about minus-five centigrade, we should be able to use that power to enhance the efficiency of the atmosphere recyclers."
our last two and a half days freezing versus our last two days toasty warm. what a delightful choice.
i'd pick freezing. another half day's another half day.
freezing it is then.
and just what are you doing?
an officer at his best is always well-groomed.
nice to see you're developing a more positive attitude.
"actually, i was thinking about what our corpses would look like when they're eventually found. with no air in the pod, we should remain in fairly good condition."
"charming, but you're forgetting one thing, malcolm."
what's that?
"if i remember my honours biology course correctly, your hair and nails keep growing for quite a while after you're dead. i'm pretty sure that includes your beard."
thanks.
come in.
i've analyzed the scans we took of the tesnian ship right before it crashed. i believe they were hit by a micro-singularity.
you still chasing gremlins?
"this is no myth, captain. three of the singularities also hit enterprise. they collided with our hull plating here, here and here."
you're telling me these are tiny black holes?
"they were. the dispersal pattern suggests they dissipated on impact. this could be a significant discovery, captain. if we could get quantum sensor readings of the three impact points, we could authenticate our findings."
i'd be a little less concerned with winning the nobel prize right now and a little more concerned with trip and malcolm. their shuttlepod doesn't have the hull plating we do. they could be in for a rough ride when they get back to the asteroid field. better hail them. agree to a new rendezvous point.
i never intended to suggest that our crewmembers were less important than a scientific discovery. even one of this historic magnitude.
time's a-wasting.
"my dearest deborah. by this time i'm certain you've learned of the tragedy that befell the starship enterprise. you've also undoubtedly learned that my colleague, commander charles tucker, and i did manage to survive for a few days after the accident. it's during that brief time that i've chosen to correspond with you. although our relationship was short-lived, and at times tumultuous, i can't help but picture your beautiful smile. it gives me great comfort. think of me from time to time. cordially, malcolm."
a ship?
"it's a little more modulated than the last one, but it could be just a random gamma-ray burst."
my dearest rochelle. by this time i'm certain you've learned of the tragedy
wouldn't it be easier just to record one message and then add the dear whoever afterward? this is your fifth or sixth identical letter.
"that's not true. there have been subtle differences. i would never refer to rochelle as having a beautiful smile. with her, it was the eyes."
travis and hoshi couldn't have been more than twenty four or twenty five years old.
if the captain were here with us now i wonder if he'd feel guilty about bringing them on this mission.
not for a minute. they died doing what they loved.
i don't remember hoshi loving much about being in deep space.
she was coming along. she saved our asses on more than one occasion. i plan on letting her family know just how essential she was.
sounds to me like you do have some letters to record.
i'll wait to tell them in person.
"you know, your treacly optimism is beginning to get just a little bit tiresome."
unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell to half the girls in san francisco?
"at least i'm capable of accepting our fate. we're going to be dead in about thirty three33 hours. whether our beards continue to grow or not is of no concern to me. we will be dead! and unless some ship happens to cross our path, our bearded bodies will be discovered in about three or four years. is that optimistic enough for you?"
what's your problem with having a little hope?
what's your problem with facing the truth?
"you're a regular grim reaper, malcolm. anyone ever tell you that? well, if this little trip is a death sentence, then it would seem to me we're entitled to a last meal. what'll it be? i'm afraid our selection is somewhat limited."
i'm not hungry.
"well, then how about a drink?"
i don't drink on duty.
"are you serious? we're dead men, remember? what's the matter, lieutenant? are you afraid the autopsy will show your blood-alcohol level was too high to pilot a shuttle? ("
live a little. that's an order.
do you really think that's going to provide any heat?
the bourbon'll provide the heat. the candle's just for mood. to the brave men and women of the starship enterprise.
"you know that's going to consume oxygen, don't you?"
"we'll probably be dead five or six minutes earlier than we would have been. i can live with that. anyway, it seems to me as far as you're concerned, the sooner the better."
is that really how you see me? the eternal pessimist? the grim reaper? i don't want to die. what makes you think i want to die?
"because ever since we saw enterprise spread across that asteroid, you've done nothing but write your own obituary."
"i lost nearly everyone i cared about on that ship. those girls i talked about. rochelle, deborah, catelin. none of them worked out because i could never get very close to them. never got very close to my family either, for that matter, not that it's any business of yours. but with the crew of the enterprise, it was different. i was really starting to feel comfortable with them, and now the only one that's left thinks i'm the bloody angel of death."
"all of a sudden, five or six more minutes sounds kind of nice."
does that sound modulated enough for you?
modulated?
the radio. or is it just the galaxy giggling at us again?
"it can giggle all it wants, but the galaxy's not getting any of our bourbon."
"you know, it's funny. i was just beginning to think that captain archer was invincible, you know? just serving on the same starship as him made me feel safe for some reason. he had a knack for getting us out of trouble, didn't he."
"yeah, he's always been that way. when i first taught him to dive, it really got on my nerves. he'd come down to the keys at least once a month, and whatever it was i was teaching him, he'd get it the first time. did you ever try clearing your mask?"
clear my mask?
"everybody's got to do it before they get certified. you go down and the instructor fills your mask with water, and you have to clear it by blowing out through your nose. nobody likes to do it."
the captain?
"got it the first time. filled it with water a second time just so he could clear it again. i took him on a night dive once into some caves i'd been to a hundred times before, and for some reason i got a little lost. so what does archer do? he swims ahead of me and finds a way out."
i can't imagine why you'd have a problem with that.
i was the instructor. i'd been diving all my life. then big mister starfleet comes down and does everything faster and better than i could. that's when i decided to introduce him to old waldo.
and who was that?
"a green moray. it's said he's thirty years old. must've been two and a half metres long. so i took the captain into waldo's hole. told him there was some beautiful starfish inside, and he reached in. damned if old waldo didn't take hold of his forearm."
a moray eel? are you out of your mind.
"i was breaking just about every rule in the book, but he was wearing titanium mesh. i figures the worst thing that could happen would be that waldo would scare him a little. he deserved to have the piss taken out of him."
so?
"no such luck. he pulled waldo clear out of the hole. i don't think i'd ever seen that eel's tail before. he found some pressure point under it's lower jaw, right about here. waldo just let go. went back down his hole."
that must have been the last time the captain ever went diving with you.
"that's the thing. he found it all funnier than i did. he took me out to dinner that night. steaks, lobsters, kentucky bourbon."
"hey, what do you think of t'pol, hmm? do you think she's pretty?"
t'pol? are you serious?
"well, she's a woman, you know? i think she's pretty."
you've had too much to drink.
"don't tell me you've never looked at her, you know, in that way."
"nah, she's a vulcan."
"well, i think she's pretty."
"oh, god."
you ever noticed her bum?
what?
her bum. she's got an awfully nice bum.
to sub-commander t'pol.
awfully nice!
"it's probably nothing, right?"
it's definitely not nothing.
"well then, that means it's something. what is it? well, is it something or someone, because if it's someone"
shush!
sorry.
definitely someone.
"we have no way to respond, do we. this is like the plane flying over the desert island in a lost-at-sea movie."
malcolm!
sorry. happy endings. i must think happy endings.
"shuttlepod one, this is enterprise. please respond."
that's hoshi!
transmitting new co-ordinates.
that's impossible!
don't be so pessimistic. it's not impossible. it's hoshi. they're okay. enterprise is okay. it's hoshi!
"adjust your heading to the new coordinates. we will rendezvous in two days. commander and lieutenant, please respond."
rendezvous. what a beautiful word. what's wrong?
they're still two days away.
and we only have a little more than one day's air left.
and no way to tell them to get here sooner.
are you sure you got the coordinates right?
"yes, not that it matters."
lieutenant.
"they're probably travelling at what, warp two, warp three? compared to them, we're like a garden snail. where we go and how fast we get there is irrelevant."
if i purge the co2 filters it'll give us a little more air.
how much? an hour's worth?
probably less.
great. so when they reach us in two days we'll have been out of air for eleven hours. you ever try holding your breath for eleven hours?
"a train leaves new york at three a.m. heading west, while another leaves chicago at four thirty heading east. i never could figure those out."
"enterprise is going to wonder why we haven't responded, right? maybe they'll be concerned and increase their speed."
"maybe, but if we really want to get them to go to high warp we're going to have to attract their attention. something a little more dramatic than not answering their hails."
can they see us on their sensors?
"two days away at warp three? oh, they can see us, maybe not too clearly, but we should be a nice little blip on t'pol's viewer."
then we've got to get that blip to tell them to pick up a little steam. what if we fired our weapons?
they're nearly a quarter of a light year away. our plasma cannons have a range of less than ten kilometres. it would all still look like a single blip. it's going to take a lot more than that.
what if we jettison the impulse drive?
what good would that do?
"well, you could rig a self-destruct. i imagine that would make quite an explosion. maybe even big enough to make that blip do something odd."
"no, i can't blow up our engine. we'd be adrift, dead in space."
what's the difference between that and travelling at a snail's pace?
i'm an engineer. i won't blow up our only engine.
then i'll ask you again. ever hold your breath for eleven hours?
i think i have some micro-detonators in here somewhere.
how does it feel to be slower than a snail?
"i saw a great cartoon once. there were these two snails sitting on the back of a big old turtle and one snail turns to the other and says 'hold on, fred. here we go'."
"if i'm right, i get the rest of the bourbon."
"fine. less than twelve hours, you win. more than twelve and it's mine. go check the pressure gauge."
you check it. i don't think i can move my legs.
i can't believe we've been sitting here that long.
"come on, let's hear it. how much air's left?"
ten hours.
"that's probably the last bet i'll ever make, and i won. i should feel like celebrating, shouldn't i?"
"the whiskey's yours. now, why don't you give us a toast before you drink it?"
"ten hours for two men. if there were only one of us he'd have twenty hours, wouldn't he?"
great idea. why don't you climb up into the airlock and seal yourself in.
that's just what i was thinking.
any last words you want me to pass along?
yeah.
tell captain archer that it was one hell of an honour serving with him.
what are you doing?
"we don't know whether or not they saw our little display of pyrotechnics, but either way this'll double your chances."
you're crazy. now get down from there!
"sit down, lieutenant."
"if anyone should go up in there, it should be me. you're the chief engineer."
i'm also in charge of deciding who's going into this airlock. do i make myself clear?
commander.
what are you going to do? kill me?
"it's set to stun. i don't want to use it, but i will."
put it down!
go to hell!
stop trying to be a hero. it doesn't suit you.
what would you know about being a hero? it takes nothing but a coward to crawl up inside a hole to die.
"then go ahead and shoot me, but you better hope we don't make it, because if we survive the first thing i'm going to do is bust your ass back to crewman second class for insubordination."
"be my guest. i could use a little less responsibility. now, get down here."
who the hell do you think you are?
"your armoury officer, and perhaps your friend."
friends don't shoot each other!
"you know, i'm not a doctor, but i'm pretty sure you use up a lot more oxygen when you shout like that!"
so what are you saying? that you'd rather have enterprise find the two of us dead in here?
"that's exactly what i'm saying. if there's one chance in a thousand that they saw our impulse drive explode, that they increased their speed, i'll take that chance. i've invested far too much time trying to figure you out, mister tucker. i'm not about to accept that it was all for nothing."
we're back. how did?
"easy, malcolm. you fellows had a nice little bout with hypothermia."
the commander.
he's going to be fine.
it took nearly three hours go get your body temperatures back to normal.
you must have seen the explosion.
"hard to miss. you know, you guys only had two or three hours of air left."
"you don't say. we saw debris from enterprise on one of the asteroids. we assumed, we thought you were all."
"i'll tell you all about it in the morning. right now, the doctor needs to warm you up a few degrees."
sub-commander.
yes.
isn't there something you're supposed to say to me?
about what?
heroics. something about heroics.
"good night, lieutenant."
trip?
"mind if i call you trip? sleep well, my friend."
this text book is what you wanted me to see?
not exactly.
look familiar? this was my first astronomy book. my father got it for me on my eighth birthday. i used to stare at the cover for hours. the arachnid nebula. who'd ever have thought i'd get to see it in person. it's less than a light year away. we'll be there in a few hours.
from the library of admiral johnny archer?
i had high hopes when i was a kid.  yes?
"sir, there's a ship approaching at half impulse. they're hailing us."
do you know who it is?
hoshi says they're using a vulcan frequency.
doesn't look like any vulcan ship i've ever seen.
this class of vessel hasn't been used for a long time.
they're hailing us again.
is this the earth vessel enterprise?
it is. i'm captain jonathan archer.
"my name is tavin, captain of the vahklas. it's very good to meet you."
i get the feeling you weren't sent out here by the high command.
not quite. we're a civilian ship.
what brings you out this far?
i suppose you could say we're on a mission of exploration.
"from what i'm told, vulcans aren't that interested in exploring."
"we're not typical vulcans. i'd be happy to explain, but first i'd like to ask a favour."
certainly.
our propulsion and life-support systems are in need of repair. we'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer.
we'll see what we can do.
we've noticed the high command looking over our shoulders on several occasions as well.
that's good to know. i was starting to think they'd singled us out. our chef's had a lot of experience lately preparing vulcan dishes. t'pol says he's gotten pretty good at it.
what is that?
"oh, it's called chicken."
may i?
"of course. it's, er, meat, you know."
it looks delicious.
"so, when did you leave vulcan?"
eight years ago.
and in those eight years we've experienced more than most vulcans will in their lifetime.
you said you were explorers?
"yes, but it's not space we're exploring. it's ourselves."
mmm!
you're v'tosh ka'tur.
i'm sorry?
"vulcans without logic. it's a name the elders give to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it's not entirely accurate. we haven't abandoned logic. we've simply learned to exist without the need to continually repress our emotions. it's taken years of experimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two."
that's not possible.
here we are.
"logic is an essential part of vulcan existence, but it has to complement emotions, not exclude them."
you must know a great deal about emotion. you live on a human starship. that's not something that many vulcans would be comfortable with.
i am here as an observer.
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to offend you.
i'm not capable of feeling offence.
"my chief engineer tells me your repairs are going to take three or four days. we were going to use that time to explore the nebula, if you don't mind tagging along."
not at all.
i've never seen an engine this far gone. we're going to have to swap out every plasma relay in your reactor.
there are a lot of women on your ship.
"yeah, nearly a third of the crew."
"is it true you mate year-round, with any of them you choose?"
"you haven't been around humans too much, have you?"
"you're the first we've met, but i've heard a lot of stories. your people indulge their passions. do you really eat six meals a day?"
more like three.
and what about sleep? i understand you spend more than half the day in bed.
"eight hours. we sleep for eight hours. in my case, about six. when we're through here maybe we can get a bite to eat. i might be able to clear up some of your misconceptions."
"i'd like that, commander."
call me trip.
they've asked for any medical supplies we can spare and a thousand litres of plasma coolant.
"well, that shouldn't be a problem."
tavin has also requested the recipe for chicken marsala.
"tell him chef's recipes are usually classified but, we'll make an exception in this case. i thought you'd be spending a little more time getting to know our guests."
i've been busy.
"it seems to me like, you've been busy avoiding them. i can understand that you might not approve of what they're trying to do, but for all we know they're onto something."
that's unlikely.
is it? eight years. that's a pretty good track record.
just because they smile and eat chicken doesn't mean they've learned to master their emotions.
"maybe i'm just relieved to finally meet some vulcans who aren't giving me a hard time. then again, if they have found this balance."
"they're not the first ones to attempt this, captain. others have tried to reintegrate their emotions. they all failed. what they're doing is dangerous."
"unless my instincts are way off, they don't seem very dangerous to me. but i could be wrong. i can't order you to spend time with them, but i would encourage you to keep an open mind."
so this is the mess hall.
it is.
the crew must not have much of an appetite.
most of them are asleep. it's quite late.
could you show me how to operate this?
what would you like?
i'm not sure. i don't have much experience with human food. what's that?
mint tea.
that'll be fine.
"mint tea, hot."
thank you. it has a lot of flavour.
you can try something else.
"no, it's fine. i'm just surprised. do you like the taste?"
their selection of vulcan beverages is limited.
but it can make vulcan tea.
yes.
interesting.
unless you need further assistance
how long have you lived among humans?
i spent two years at the vulcan consulate on earth and seven months on enterprise.
that's a long time away from home. living here has obviously affected you in ways that you don't realise.
"you may be right. on occasion, i also drink chamomile tea."
and you have a sense of humour. a concept that most vulcans can't seem to grasp.
you're easily amused.
"there's that humour again. i'm curious, why do you stay here?"
captain archer needs a science officer.
is that the only reason? maybe you're more attached to these people than you'd care to admit.
what makes you say that?
your emotions are much closer to the surface than other vulcans. they're easier to read.
i have yet to mediate this evening. perhaps that's what you're sensing.
"this may surprise you, but we still meditate. the balance between emotion and logic requires constant discipline."
so you've said. you and your colleagues have chosen a reckless path.
have we?
history's shown that vulcans who attempt to embrace their emotions often revert to their primal nature.
"that's a myth. propaganda from five thousand years ago. our primal nature, t'pol, is not as dangerous as you think. commander tucker suggests that i try something called pizza. would you care to join me?"
"i've already eaten. another time, perhaps."
"is it what you imagined, sir?"
pictures don't do it justice.
it's big. over eight billion kilometres in diameter.
eight billion? are you sure?
according to sensors.
my astronomy book said it was only six and a half.
we'll have to send our readings to the publisher so they can put out a revised edition.
how long would it take to chart that thing?
several weeks.
my vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. we could help you complete the survey a good deal quicker.
we should have someone on your ship to monitor the data.  would you mind working from there?
no.
"glad you dropped by. take us in, travis."
look at that. i've never seen anything so beautiful. you'd probably consider that an emotional reaction.
not necessarily. it is aesthetically pleasing.
"pleasing. coming from you, that's practically an outburst."
it's curious that people who reject surak's teachings would display his likeness.
"we don't reject his teachings. we simply disagree with how they're interpreted. have you read his original text? he never intended for us to purge our emotions. he wanted us to master them, and then carefully integrate them into our lives."
i doubt many would agree with you.
that doesn't mean we're wrong.
what did you do on vulcan before you left?
i taught literature at the shirkar academy.
you gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a transport.
i don't have any regrets. i always knew there had to be more to life than just logic and reason. haven't you ever felt that way?
not recently.
but you did once?
once. i should take these readings back to enterprise.
"t'pol, you said that you meditated each night. tonight, don't. see what happens. i think you'll find your dreams will be far more interesting. you're a scientist. consider it an experiment."
where'd you hear that?
a vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the ritual during an earth expedition.
": they're not trying to kill the quarterback. they're just trying to keep him from throwing the ball or running with it. it's only a game, not a fight to the death."
i see.
you must think we're a bunch of barbarians.
"your species does have a reputation, but i've always suspected the stories were exaggerated."
"well, i hope you'll tell all your friends. set the record straight."
gladly.
"there's, er, something i've always wondered about vulcans. maybe you could clear it up for me."
please.
it's kind of personal.
go ahead.
"well, i've learned about your marriage customs. how your parents arrange the whole thing when you're young, stuff like that but, what about, you know."
"ah, you mean sex."
it's not a topic i've heard vulcans discuss.
"well, we do have it, if that's what you're asking."
am i interrupting anything?
"no, please join us, mister?"
reed. malcolm reed.
kov. we were just discussing vulcan mating rituals. most of my people are extremely uncomfortable talking about such things. so many inhibitions. vulcan males are driven to mate once every seven years.
seven years?
frightening.
"over the past few years, we've been developing methods to accelerate the mating cycle."
you up for seconds?
"i've had enough, thank you. back to work? a pleasure meeting you, mister reed."
likewise.
"sir, i'm picking up a transmission from echo three."
starfleet?
it's admiral forrest.
i'll take it in my ready room.
admiral forrest. good to see you.
"you, too, jon. i understand you have guests."
a vulcan crew. how'd you know?
"i got a call from ambassador soval about an hour ago. they're aware that you've docked with the vahklas, and they have a favour to ask."
a favour from me?
"a minister at the high command has a son on that ship, an engineer named kov. have you met him?"
i don't think so.
"well, apparently, the two of them had a falling out about nine, ten years ago. his father's tried to contact him several times since then, but kov won't respond."
what do they want me to do?
i hear these aren't your garden variety vulcans. can i assume you're on friendly terms?
yes.
"kov's father is dying, jon. he'd like to speak with his son. maybe you can encourage him somehow."
i'll see what i can do.
the high command let you keep your science officer. it wouldn't hurt to return the favour.
understood.
keep me posted.
our primal nature isn't as dangerous as you think.
do you like the taste? you must have learned a great deal about emotion.
why do you stay here?
"this is more than a simple headache. your blood pressure's elevated and i'm reading unusually high synaptic activity. it doesn't appear to be a virus or a bacterial infection. i'd like to run a cranial scan, just to be safe."
that won't be necessary.
it'll only take a moment.
"i believe i can explain my symptoms. last night i neglected to meditate before i went to sleep. as a result, i awoke feeling agitated. all i need is an injection of inaprovaline. twenty five milligrams should suffice."
"very well, doctor. it's not like you to stray from your routine. this wouldn't have anything to do with our visitors? you've been spending quite a bit of time on their ship."
i've become acquainted with one of them. he suggested that my dreams might be more interesting if i didn't meditate.
and?
he was wrong. they were unsettling. it was a foolish thing to do.
nothing that a little inaprovaline can't cure. i can understand why you'd be intrigued by their philosophy. maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it after one bad experience.
there are too many risks. it would be unwise to continue.
"you're probably right, but if you do decide to experiment further, keep in mind that they've been working at this for a number of years. you've only known them for two days. go slowly."
"thank you, doctor."
come in.
captain.
please have a seat.
the repairs to our propulsion system are going well. mister tucker's been very helpful.
that's good to hear.
is there a problem?
i called you here to pass along a message from your father.
you spoke with him?
"actually, it came through a vulcan ambassador. i'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your father is very ill. he wants you to contact him as soon as possible. if you'd like, my comm. officer can arrange the transmission."
"it's a kind offer, but i'll deal with this myself. thanks for the message."
"i know it's none of my business, but do you plan on contacting him?"
"the last time i spoke with my father, he said i'd brought shame to fifteen generations of our family."
"he's dying, kov."
"if it isn't too much trouble, would you please send a message back for me? tell him that we said goodbye a long time ago."
good morning. chamomile?
thank you.
how did it go?
the lateral sensors were out of alignment. i haven't had a chance to scan the disodium layer.
i mean last night. did you take my advice?
yes.
and your dreams?
i'd rather not discuss them.
it will get easier. tonight will be less disturbing.
i plan to resume meditating tonight.
you can't give up after one trial.
it was a mistake to try in the first place.
wasn't there anything enjoyable about the experience?
i'm reading over twenty million cubic metres of disodium as well as traces of ethylchlorate.
we can run the scans later. tell me about your dreams. your emotions were closer to the surface. it must have been intense.
it involved a memory. i was walking down a street in san francisco on earth.
why did you leave the compound?
i was curious about human recreation. i wanted to see it for myself.
so you broke protocol?
it was late. everyone in the compound had gone to sleep. i didn't see any harm in leaving for a couple of hours.
where did you go?
i simply walked. then i heard music.
music?
"it was unusual, chaotic, but i was drawn to it."
go on.
i went into a restaurant where musicians were playing. i sat at a table.
how did you feel?
i can't remember.
try.
i felt invigorated.
emotion. you felt emotion.
briefly. they finished playing and i returned to the compound.
"you could feel that way again, t'pol. it isn't difficult, and it's nothing to be afraid of. i can show you how."
you want me to talk to him?
from what i hear you've become fast friends. maybe you'll have better luck than i did.
"well, i'll try, but something tells me it won't be as simple as fixing an engine. he's got a lot of resentment."
do your best.
"aye, sir."
what about this tolaris fellow?
"well, i haven't really gotten to know him. he seems kind of quiet, though. a little sullen."
t'pol's been spending a lot of time with him lately.
is that a problem?
"two days ago she couldn't wait to get these people off the ship. i practically had to order her to work with him. now, they're almost inseparable."
"if i didn't know better i'd say you were a little jealous. if i was the only human on a ship full of vulcans and we ran into an earth vessel, i'd be spending as much time with them as i could. she likes being around her own kind. who doesn't?"
"well, let me know how it goes with kov."
"yes, sir."
mind meld?
"it's an ancient technique. it was abandoned centuries ago, but we've discovered that it can help us access our emotions."
how does it work?
"i'd begin by creating a telepathic link. we would be able to share our memories, our thoughts. in essence, we would become one mind. it's quite an experience, but it is profoundly intimate. are you prepared for that? if you'd like, we could try a more traditional form of guided meditation but it wouldn't be nearly as effective."
proceed.
"it's all right. close your eyes. try to focus on my voice. my mind to your mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. our minds are merging, our minds are becoming one."
it's not working.
"you're resisting. relax. my mind to your mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. our minds are merging, our minds are becoming one."
am i with you?
yes.
can you sense my thoughts?
yes.
you're doing well. i want you to think about that night when you left the compound. imagine yourself walking down that street.
good. now listen. can you hear the music? listen. now follow it. i can see why you were drawn to this place. it's unlike anything on vulcan. i'm not surprised
"it triggered an emotional response. you said you were invigorated, what else?"
i don't know.
"yes, you do. you're just not used to describing your emotions. you experienced other things. excitement about breaking protocol, apprehension about getting caught, and the music, the music made you feel elated. allow yourself to feel these emotions again. don't hold them back."
i have to return to the compound.
you're anxious. it's just another emotion.
let me go.
"stay with me, t'pol."
no!
stop.
no.
stop! this was a mistake.
you've made progress. don't give up now.
please go.
t'pol.
leave!
you're feeling anger. your emotions are breaking the surface. embrace them!  what a shame.
t'pol to sickbay.
i've already been through this with your captain.
are you sure you're making the right decision?
"if you knew my father, you'd understand."
"i don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but you've got a limited window of opportunity. once it closes"
"i consider you a friend, trip, and i appreciate what you're trying to do, but please don't. i have no intention of contacting him. i test-fired our port thruster last night. it's still off by twelve percent."
"well, probably a faulty injector. should be easy enough to fix. do vulcans dance? you know"
no. only when it's part of some tedious ceremony.
"i remember the first dance i ever went to. bayshore elementary panama city, florida. a girl i had a crush on, melissa lyles, was going to be there. so i spent weeks practicing the two-step with my brother. i wanted to make sure i was ready. she was wearing a red dress that night. prettiest girl there. all i wanted to do was ask her to dance with me, but i never worked up the courage to go over and talk to her. i caught her looking at me a couple times but, i ended up just standing in a corner with my buddies."
"interesting, but what does that have to do with our thruster problem?"
"it's been more than twenty years and i'm still kicking myself for not asking that girl to dance. you probably don't know this, but regret is one of the strongest emotions and one of the saddest. i have a feeling you haven't had a brush with it yet, but it sounds to me like you're pretty close. that's something you might want to avoid."
come in.
good morning.
morning. can i get you something? coffee?
"no, thanks."
have a seat. trip tells me the repairs to your ship are almost finished. you should be on your way pretty soon.
yes.
how's that survey coming along?
we'll be done this afternoon.
that's great news. i wanted to thank you for all of your help.
"it was the least we could do. besides, we've enjoyed spending our time here. you have an exceptional crew, captain."
starfleet's finest. sleep well last night?
well enough. you?
tossed and turned. always happens whenever we're exploring someplace new.
"i understand. well, if there's nothing more, captain, i'm eager to get back to work. we have another twenty million cubic kilometres to chart."
sorry to keep you. i'm afraid you'll be working alone today.
oh?
"sub-commander t'pol's in sickbay. from what the doctor tells me, she's in pretty bad shape."
that's unfortunate. what happened?
"you know damn well what happened. she told me about your, what did she call it, mind-meld? she said when she asked you to stop, you got angry. she said she had to force you away."
what happened between us is personal. it's not your concern.
you assaulted a member of my crew.
i did no such thing. mind-melds can be emotionally turbulent. she simply panicked.
"panic doesn't land you in sickbay. our doctor said she could have suffered neurological damage, thanks to you."
no one forced her to try the meld. she did it willingly.
you've been manipulating her ever since you came aboard.
"i am helping her shed a lifetime of repression, and you of all people should understand what i'm trying to do. you're human. i need to go see her."
t'pol's had enough of your help. stay away from her.
she is in a crucial stage of her awakening. she needs guidance.
"i told you, it's over."
i think that's for her to decide.
maybe i'm not making myself clear. sickbay's off-limits.
"you're in my way, captain. you'd be wise to let me leave."
"what's wrong, tolaris? getting angry? i thought you had that under control."
move aside.
t'pol's right. you've got a temper.
now!
go to hell.
you planned this.
"if i'd known i was going to get thrown across the room that hard, i might have tried a different approach. i think it's time you and your friends went on your merry way."
keep an eye on the intermix pressure. don't let it drift above five thousand.
five thousand.
and watch those injector ports.
"i will.  i thought you'd like to know, i got an update on my father. apparently, his condition's improved."
is that so?
"the surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. they say, with any luck it'll extend his life a few years."
i'm glad to hear it. that'll give you a little more time to think about making that call.
"i already did. my father's the one who gave me the good news. thank you, trip."
anytime.
come in.
is this a bad time?
not at all.
feeling any better?
has the vulcan ship left?
about twenty minutes ago.
"then yes, i'm feeling better."
you do this every night?
every night.
i think i finally understand why. i'll see you in the morning.
sure. sometimes they're even in colour.
is it enjoyable?
most nights.
i envy you. goodnight.
we couldn't do this in my ready room?
"nah, the captain's got to be in the captain's chair. tilt your chin up."
just take the picture.
you've got a stanchion growing out of your head. swivel to the right about ten degrees. every recruit walking into starfleet command is going to see this on the wall.
"it's a real honour, sir. seeing those starfleet captains every day gave us something to aspire to."
"there's a reflection from that status display.  could you kill the monitors in the situation room? come on, t'pol. the artist in oakland needs a good picture to paint from."
do vulcan captains have their portraits hanging at the high command?
"vulcans are revered for their accomplishments, not for the way they look."
"except for the really important ones, who get mummified."
why can't they just use a photo from my file?
"sir, i'm picking up a small planet on our current heading."
i thought there weren't any systems along this course.
"it's not a system, captain. it's just a planet."
put it up.
magnify.
it's a rogue. a planet that's broken out of its orbit.
lay in a course. let's take a closer look.
"aye, sir."
captain archer in command.
"give it a rest, trip."
this planet supports a diverse animal population.
how is that possible?
shouldn't the surface be frozen solid?
hot gas is vented from the planet's interior. most of the life forms are concentrated in those areas.
oases. any people?
no evidence of humanoid life.
i'm picking up a power signature near the equator. there's a ship down there.
try to hail them.
no response.
maybe they want to be left alone. a single ship on a dark planet? maybe they're on their honeymoon.
infrared's useless. there's too much heat coming from those thermal vents.
we should be right over that ship.
i'm scanning for a break in the canopy.
"if this is anything like the amazon, good luck."
i used to say i could land a shuttlepod with my eyes closed.
"well, the proof's in the pudding, captain."
"there's a clearing ahead, nine hundred metres, but it's not much bigger than the shuttlepod."
it doesn't have to be.
"captain, the vessel is that way, six hundred metres."
follow me.
"why don't you let me play captain for a while, malcolm? this reminds me of the rain forest in new zealand. i earned my wilderness merit badge there."
"you were a boy scout, sir?"
i was an eagle scout.
"oh, so was i."
really? how many merit badges?
twenty eight. you?
twenty six.
"oh, that's not bad, sir."
captain.
we spot any more creatures like that and we'll earn our exobiology badges.
"actually, i already have that one."
"a campsite, sir."
anyone home? we're from the starship enterprise. is there anyone here?
"i'm still not detecting any biosigns, but their ship's less than two hundred metres in that direction."
you and malcolm check it out. we'll stay here in case anyone shows up.
did you hear that?
yes.
anything?
"for a moment, i had a humanoid biosign. it's gone."
it's not gone.
dhk'tr! siskah tral p'kat.
nahk i'taree.
"captain, are you all right?"
everything's fine. these are the eska.
my name is damrus.
"this is t'pol, my science officer, and lieutenant malcolm reed."
pleased to meet you. your friends nearly shot me back there.
we're sorry. there are dangerous animals in the forest.
we've never seen other humanoids here before.
have we trespassed in your territory?
"this planet is no one's territory, but it's a special place for us."
what are you doing on dakala?
"we're just here to explore. we'd like to stay for a while, if that's all right. it's a big planet. we could find another landing site, but i was hoping you might enjoy the company."
you aren't exactly roughing it.
drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure.
mmm. no argument here. i'm curious why our sensors didn't detect you.
we use sensing cloaks. they keep the wildlife from spotting us.
are you studying wildlife here?
not exactly.
we're on an expedition.
"that drayjin you're eating, we killed it yesterday."
you're hunters.
our people have been coming here for nine generations.
to kill the indigenous species?
taking wild animals is part of our tradition. there are higher primates here. we don't touch them.
hunting went out of style on earth over a hundred years ago. that doesn't mean we don't appreciate your hospitality.
that gear you carry seems pretty elaborate to take down a few game animals.
don't underestimate the game on this planet. they often get the better of us.
i wonder if i might join one of your hunts.
i thought you people didn't approve.
"you were able to sneak up on us without being detected by our night-vision sensors. i'd like to see how you did that. i promise i won't kill anything, sir."
it's up to our hosts.
"if the bugs glow in the dark, at least you can tell when they've crawled into your sleeping bag."
"one more reason i am happy to spend the night in my own bunk. anyway, it's the things you can't see that i'd be worried about."
like those bore worms.
bore worms?
apparently they crawl into your ear to lay their eggs. have a nice night.
we can start with the entomologists then bring the other bioscience teams down. i'd recommend we limit the number of crewmen on the surface to six at a time.
sensible.
enjoying yourselves?
very much. thanks for sharing your camp with us.
"we're heading out in six hours. i suggest you get some sleep, if you're still planning to come along."
i wouldn't miss it.
good night.
good night.
night. i suppose i'll turn in then.
sounds like a good idea.
i think i'll sit up for a while.
have fun.
yeah.
jonathan. jonathan.
hello?
is someone there?
jonathan.
who's there?
"if the captain says he saw her, he saw her."
are there any others in your hunting party?
no.
certainly no human females. you sure she wasn't from your vessel?
i'm sure.  archer.
"mayweather here, captain. there are no other ships, on the surface or in orbit."
"thanks, travis. archer out."
nothing.
"she was young, long blonde hair. she was wearing some kind of a nightgown."
"a nightgown, sir?"
perhaps you were dreaming.
"it wasn't a dream. she said my name. she knew who i was and, i think i knew her."
sir?
"there was something about her. i, i've seen her before."
"on this planet, it's always night. you're surrounded by things you can hear, but not see. it can stimulate the imagination."
you wouldn't be the first person who looked into the jungle and saw something that wasn't there.
she was real.
"captain archer, what are the chances you'd encounter a half-naked woman who you think you know dozens of light years from your homeworld? go to sleep. if you're lucky, maybe she'll visit you in your dreams."
these can detect infrared.
among other things.
what are you going after today?
we saw a pack of fire wolves yesterday about six kilometres from here. it's a difficult hike.
i'll try to keep up.
we'd appreciate it. we only have two days left.
what's the hurry?
"to preserve dakala, our law states that we're allowed to hunt here for four days each year. then we have to leave."
hunters often wait decades for a chance to come here.
are those volcanic vents?
"yes. that area's particularly active. mineral springs, steam vents. it's quite spectacular."
could be worth checking out while malcolm's on his safari.
i'll get my camera.
"did you sleep well, captain?"
"yes, fine."
good. if you see any beautiful females today you'll be sure to let us know.
drayjin. a female. they're very unpredictable.
reminds me of yellowstone.
it's more like the grottoes of deneva prime. i'm detecting a large geothermal shaft sixty metres in that direction. i'd like to examine it. sir?
permission granted. stay in contact.
"so, she was wearing a nightgown? you think she's real."
i wasn't hallucinating.
"captain, it doesn't make any sense."
"i know. trip, have you ever known me to do anything foolish? i mean, really foolish?"
i remember a poker game at jupiter station once. other than that.
"last night i walked into an alien jungle, alone, chasing a woman who couldn't possibly have been there."
that might qualify.
it was like i was being drawn to her. like i didn't have any control over what i was doing. i can't explain it.
she must have been some woman.
wraith!
what is it? is there something out there?
it could be a plume of steam. they can fool our thermal scanners.
"well, let's find out."
no point in all of us chasing a sensor ghost. you two stay on the trail.
damrus.
take care of our guest. we'll catch up.
jonathan.
who are you?
how do you know my name?
"i need you, jonathan."
you're speaking english.
i need you to understand.
i know you. how is that possible?
"if you didn't know me, would you have come?"
you said you needed me. why?
you're different.
different?
what is it?
what's wrong?
harm.
i don't want to harm you.
not jonathan.
then who? who wants to harm you?
captain?
are you all right?
fine.
you disappeared on us. what are you doing out here?
just taking some scans.
hold him.
i'm trying. if you can't keep him steady.
"burzaan, you're going to be fine but you have to be still."
archer to enterprise.
what did that?
i didn't see it.
"go ahead, sir."
we split off to follow another trail.
tell doctor phlox to stand by.
"yes, sir."
"it was a drayjin. the females can be very aggressive, especially if they're protecting a nest."
the wound's deep. give me the bonding kit.
there's no internal damage but he's lost a great deal of blood.
we've got a doctor on board our ship. i've alerted him to stand by.
"we're prepared to deal with injuries here, captain."
we need him for the hunt. their doctor can help. we only have two more days.
"thank you, captain. obviously, we want him to have the best treatment."
let's get him back to the shuttlepod. you and malcolm go with him.
you should all return to your ship. we came to this planet aware of its dangers. you didn't.
i'm not ready to leave.
lieutenant reed reports they've docked with enterprise.
"thanks. t'pol, come in. i saw her again, near the thermal vents. she spoke to me."
what did she say?
she said she needed me. i think someone may be trying to hurt her.
i believe you should reconsider returning to enterprise.
and have doctor phlox take a look at me? there are no psychotropic compounds here.
"i wasn't hallucinating, and i wasn't dreaming."
so the only logical conclusion is that she is a real human woman?
"i don't know what she is. i know it's not possible for her to be human, but she's appearing to me for a reason and i'm going to figure out what it is."
how?
i'm going to find her.
i'll go with you.
no.
a well-armed hunter was nearly killed today. it would be foolish to go into the jungle alone.
"i have to. she's chosen to communicate with me. i don't know why, but i don't think she'd reveal herself if anyone else was around."
is that your only reason for going by yourself?
what?
"with respect, captain, i wonder if you would be so determined to find this apparition if it were a scantily-clad man."
"how's he doing, doc?"
it was a simple matter to synthesise his blood type for a transfusion. he'll be back on his feet in a few hours.
i'll let the captain know.
"commander, could you tell me what attacked him?"
"they call it a drayjin. it looks like a big nasty pig. kind of tastes like one, too."
i found cellular residue in the wound. it clearly doesn't belong to this gentleman. i assume it must have come from the animal that mauled him.
what am i looking at?
the cells are in a state of chromosomal flux. they're mutating. it's as if they're trying to change into something but can't quite figure out what. that must have been a most unusual pig.
hello? are you there?
i'm alone.
jonathan.
you're not a hallucination. you're real. i can touch you.
"real, yes."
"but you're not human, are you."
human?
"human, like me."
we are not like you.
we? there are more of you? where? i haven't seen others.
"we can become whatever you see. a tree, an animal, water, whatever you see."
i see a beautiful woman.
because you want to see a beautiful woman.
how do you know what i want?
i can see your thoughts. i see what eludes you.
you're telepathic. that's how you know my language.
i know more than your language.
then you must know why i'm so drawn to you. why i feel like i know you.
you do know me.
from where? why did you choose me?
you're different.
you said that before. how? who am i different from?
"the others. the only ones who have ever come here, before you."
you mean the eska.
do you know why they come?
to hunt.
"to hunt us, jonathan. we are what they prize above all else."
you lost the drayjin but at least you got some scars to show for it.
"well, thanks to your doctor i don't even have that."
to the captain and his fine physician.
"it was no problem, really."
"well, we have to drink to something since we came back empty-handed."
to good hunting tomorrow.
good hunting.
"so, how'd you lose them?"
"drayjin are migratory. by the time we got back, they moved on."
all those imaging sensors and you couldn't see where they went?
they're more elusive than you give them credit for.
apparently.
do you hunt on your own world?
yes.
then why travel light years to hunt here? seems like a long way to come just to shoot a few wild pigs.
we hunt more than wild pigs.
the prey here is different.
"boar, wolves, some large reptiles. it doesn't seem that different."
"imagine hunting something that can get inside your mind, sense your thoughts. is that different enough?"
what are you talking about?
wraiths.
you mean ghosts?
they might as well be.
"come on, fellas. that seems pretty far-fetched."
does it? you saw one yourself. your mystery woman. she was undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too close to camp.
but she looked human.
you don't even know if it was a she.
they're shape-shifters. they can look like anything. even people you know.
that's how they trick you.
"they sound like intelligent, sentient beings."
not the way you or i would measure intelligence. it's an instinctual response.
that's why we were tracking you the day you arrived. we thought they'd taken your form.
"they assume the exact characteristics of whatever they become. they turn into a rock, all you see is a rock. even on scanners."
"before we learned how to spot them they killed more of us than we did of them. my father came here with eight other hunters. they drove a group of wraiths into a blind canyon. my father was sure that they had them cut off. but when they moved in the wraiths were waiting. they'd read the hunters' minds. they knew their plan. my father made it out, but only two of his friends survived."
how do you catch them?
"in recent years, we learned when you corner them they panic, especially the young ones."
"when they're afraid, they emit a chemical signature. our scanners have been modified to detect it. it gives us an advantage."
they know damn well what they're doing.
"i find this as distasteful as you do, captain. i'm just not sure how we can stop them."
they're well armed and they know the terrain. i wouldn't want to try and take their weapons from them.
"we have no right to, in any case."
what right do they have to come to this planet and shoot the locals?
"hunting wild boar is one thing, but they're killing a sentient species."
"even if we stop them, their people will continue to come here and hunt. they've done it for hundreds of years."
unless we find a more permanent solution.
captain?
the hunters said the shape-shifters emit a chemical signature when they're afraid. that's what gives them away. you have a sample of their cells.
i've been analyzing their mutative ability. quite remarkable.
can you find a way to mask that chemical? that would shield them from the hunters' scans.
i'll start right away.
"we may not be able to stop them from hunting here, but we could level the playing field."
"evening, captain."
trip.
get you anything?
"no, thanks."
"milk, cold."
do you know any poetry?
you mean besides 'there was a young lady from ipswich'?
"when i was a kid, if i had trouble sleeping my mother would recite a poem to me. there was one i always asked for. had a funny name.  the song of the wandering aengus. i didn't learn till i was older that it was by yeats. 'i went out to the hazel wood because a fire was in my head.' anyway, the man in the poem catches a fish, and it turns into a beautiful woman with apple blossoms in her hair. she calls his name and then vanishes."
and?
"he spends the rest of his life searching for her. his vision of perfection, i suppose. something he could never quite find. it's her."
captain.
"when i listened to the poem i must have created an image of that woman in my mind. i haven't thought about it in years. that's why i didn't recognise her at first. she isn't someone that i ever knew, she's someone i imagined as a child. the elusive woman from the poem."
why do you think this shape-shifter reached into your mind and picked an image you'd almost forgotten?
i don't know.
maybe that poem's been on your mind more than you realise.
phlox to captain archer.
archer.
"captain, i may have found something."
"i'll be right there. she may just be something i envisioned a long time ago, but i'll be damned if i'm going to let anyone shoot her."
are you sure?
it's a wraith.
i'm not picking up a signature. it was probably just a drayjin.
i saw it shift. it's a wraith.
stay with it.
where is it?
i'm not picking up anything.
it has to be here. there's no way out.
"well, if it's cornered, it must be terrified. why can't we detect it?"
"it may not be afraid now, but it's about to be."
i'm all right.
something's wrong. we should have seen it.
maybe our scanners aren't working.
all of them?
we need to leave.
let's get back to camp.
how was the hunt? any luck?
what are you doing here?
we wanted to take a few more scans before we left. is everything all right?
we're fine.
you sure? you look pretty rattled.
our scanners are malfunctioning.
sorry to hear it. looks like you won't be taking home any trophies this year.
"strange, but we never failed on a hunt before you arrived."
i guess we must be bad luck.
are you there?
yes.
they're gone.
for now.
did you give the others the masking agent?
yes.
it'll keep you safe.
thank you.
i know who you are.
you remembered.
thank you for reminding me.
"never stop seeking what seems unobtainable. goodbye, jonathan."
don't forget me.
i won't.

i don't understand.

what?
"bok, megoron duk what i'm saying?"
sit down!
who the hell are you?
who we are is unimportant. do you command this ship?
i'm the captain.
what have you done to my crew?
they're sleeping. they won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
what do you want?
where is the location of your vault?
vault? i don't know what you're talking about.
maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
he understands.
"this is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship. we don't do any commerce. whatever it is you're after, you won't find it here."
"you carry no valuables of any kind? no precious gems, no latinum?"
i just told you.
liar!
"whoever you are, just take what you want and get off of my ship."
"cousin, maybe we should. we've made some good acquisitions already."
there's more here. he's hiding something.
i agree with krem. let's take what we have and go.
"what do we have? scanners, low-grade weapons."
nothing but trinkets.
don't forget about the females. some of them are worth their weight in latinum. if we leave now we can make the next slave market on stameris.
slave market?
"you're right, krem. pick out the females that will bring the best price."
i already have.
it was a pleasure doing business with you.
wait.
you've reconsidered?
"i'll show you where the vault is, if you let me keep half the gold."
gold-pressed latinum?
gold bars. hundreds of them. but i keep half.
ten percent.
forty.
fifteen.
thirty five and not a bar less. you'll never find the vault without my help.
twenty percent. final offer.
no deal. i'd rather you take the women and go.
"thirty-five percent. that's not a bad offer, ulis. maybe we should consider it."
"no. we'll find the vault ourselves. krem, start loading the merchandise."
why am i always stuck doing the menial labour?
make him do it.
"oh, not there. over here."
"if you're going to make a habit out of this, you might want to get a bigger ship."
it's not my ship. it's my cousin's.
really. i was getting the impression you were in charge.
this is only my first month on the job.
how do you like it so far?
my cousin's a skillful merchant. i'm learning a lot from him. you'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
"what do you need all this for, anyway? you seem to already have plenty of technology."
one can never have too much. the rules of acquisition say 'expand or die'.
rules of acquisition?
"that's rule number forty five. i've memorised all a hundred and seventy three, including the most important one. a man is only worth the sum of his possessions."
back on my home world that kind of thinking almost destroyed our civilisation.
you should've managed your businesses better. come on. we have a lot more moving to do.
we?
"so what do you do, split the profits equally between the four of you?"
"oh, my cousin determines the shares."
you must get a bigger percentage than your crewmates.
"actually, i get the smallest."
"oh, that doesn't seem fair. you're the one doing all the work."
my cousin knows what's best for me. he manages all my financial transactions.
really.
i don't have the lobes for business.
i assume he charges you for his services.
of course.
he wouldn't be a very good businessman if he didn't. never allow family to stand in the way of profit.
another one of your rules?
number six. my cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some day.
do you think you could bring me a glass of water?
it comes out of a dispenser in the mess hall.
i'll be right back.
"oh, do you think you could bring me some food while you're at it? whatever's left in the serving case. that is, if you haven't already taken everything."
"you all right, captain?"
never better. you?
"from what i can tell, you and i are the only ones on the ship still standing. i would've tried to wake some of the others but there's nothing left in sickbay to do it with."
i'm not surprised. these aliens are taking everything they can get their hands on.
who are they?
i don't know yet. can you get a phase pistol?
they've cleaned out the armoury.
there are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship. they can't have emptied every one of them.
"trust me, captain, i've already checked."
"i've got an idea, but you're going to need some help to pull it off. they used a hypospray to wake me up. it's in launch bay two."
this is pretty good.
glad you're enjoying it.
maybe we should take your cook with us.
do you mind?
commander.
you're going to be fine. just because a guy's in his underwear you think the worst.
i assume you have an explanation.
"doctor phlox made me clear bio-scan after i got back from that lunar survey. while i was in decon, something knocked out the entire crew. aliens are in control of the ship."
"that artefact you brought back from the lunar surface. it must have been placed there intentionally. when i opened it, the canister released some kind of gas."
this female is different from the others. what species is she?
she's a vulcan.
vulcan.
they're really not all that interesting once you get to know them.
i'd like to get to know this one. maybe i won't sell her. not right away.
trust me. she's got no sense of humor. she's always complaining.
krem.
you okay?
there are times i wish vulcans hadn't learned to repress their violent tendencies.
"come on, we've got work to do."
what about the others?
"i can't wake anybody else up. this hypospray is empty. let's go, unless you want to be sold into slavery."
there's nothing here.
you're not scanning deep enough. this is their vault. i saw one just like it on a gavarian ship.
why would they keep a vault in the medical bay?
"rule of acquisition number twenty three. nothing is more important than your health, except for your money."
i don't see a locking mechanism.
it must use some sort of magnetic seal. i'll need micro-charges to blow it open.
hold on.
this is a waste of time. we've only got three hours before they begin to wake. it'll take days to search every hatch.
"we'll find it, muk. be patient. open those."
empty.
ah! i found something.
gold?
"no,"
but it looks like quality merchandise.
splendid craftsmanship.
add it to the pot.
do i look like a menk to you? this beauty's going in my personal collection.
we agreed to split our profits.
you said this ship would make us rich. we'll be lucky if we break even.
we had a deal.
"i'm amending it. anything i find, i keep."
fine. i'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.
"what's wrong, ulis? can't find your pot of gold?"
what's all this?
"hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! don't touch."
if you're not going to help us you should return to the ship. and what are you doing?
looking for the vault.
"they're not going to put it on a map, you idiot."
"i know that, but look. if i'm not mistaken these are the captain's quarters."
so?
that's where you keep your latinum.
what's the quickest route?
we could take this elevator to this deck
and cut through here.
it's worth a look.
weapons! where is it coming from?
over here!
make it stop!
let's get to their captain's quarters.
where are my scanners? i left them right here!
you should be more careful with your acquisitions.
"oh, oh! open your bag."
no.
open it.
are you calling me a thief?
everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of your own mother's ears.
"please, gentlemen. we're partners."
partners don't rob from each other.
why would i bother taking some worthless scanners?
worthless?
i didn't put them there.
"oh, really? then who did?"
"i tell you, i don't know."
maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled inside. where's the other one? there were three.
don't look at me.
give it back.
get away.
come back here!
"you heard me, you no-good cheating liar!"
there. that one.
i'm surprised your friend didn't get electrocuted. you can't just yank out an antimatter injector like it was a light bulb.
would you mind?
i'll have to take the injector assembly offline.
warp core parts are in high demand.
"even if your cousin does find the vault, what makes you think he's going to share the gold with you?"
we have a contract.
"if you never see the vault, you'll never know what's in it. he could try to cheat you out of your share."
he wouldn't cheat me.
"what happened to 'never allow family to stand in the way of profit'? i've seen the way the others treat you. one of them said you have no talent for business. why not prove them wrong? i've got a proposition for you. help me capture your associates and i'll show you where the vault is. we'll split the gold, fifty-fifty. once they're in the brig you can fly off a wealthy man. you said you've always dreamed of having your own ship."
how do i know you won't double-cross me?
"you're the one holding the gun. think about it. no more taking orders, getting stuck with the menial work. i'll even throw in the vulcan female. so, what'll it be? opportunities like this don't come along every day."
get back to work.
it's your loss.
where is the vault? do you understand me?
i can't lock on to its language.
"it's a lower lifeform, you fool. probably the captain's next meal."
don't be so sure. look at the size of its ears.
"ooo, i could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the malurzian zoo."
there's nothing here. let's search the other quarters.
i've had enough of vault hunting for one day. you two have fun.
who's there?
one of the aliens is awake.
why aren't you asleep?
what's next?
where do you expect me to put it? there's hardly any room left on your ship. i think it's time you decided what you really want to keep.
i'll ask ulis.
"can't you make a simple decision by yourself? if you want to run your own ship someday, maybe you should start showing a little initiative."
i'm not the one in charge.
"and you never will be, with that attitude."
who's this?
my chief engineer.
why is he awake?
don't ask me.
are there others?
i haven't seen anybody.  you?
the anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two hours. maybe we used the wrong dosage. there could be others awake. we should leave.
not without the gold.
forget the gold. we'll never find it.
"if you want to leave, take one of their shuttlecraft. i'll be happy to keep your share."
you expect me to go empty-handed?
"you can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females."
that's not good enough.
it'll have to be.
"you'll regret this, ulis."
get out.
"grish, help me with the women."
wait. i'll show you the vault.
trip.
"leave the women here, and i'll let you have the gold."
"not another word, commander. that's an order."
i'm not letting them take my wife.
wife?
"she's not the one with the pointy ears, is she?"
"no. her name's hoshi, and you're going to keep your filthy hands off her. do we have a deal?"
"you take them anywhere near that vault, and i'll throw you in the brig for insubordination."
you don't give a damn about this crew. all you care about is your precious gold.
"i'm warning you, trip."
you're a greedy son of a bitch.
"what's your wife worth? five bars of gold, maybe six? let them take hoshi, and i'll give you ten."
what!
"all right, fifteen."
enough! i accept your offer.
you'll leave the women?
you have my word as a businessman.
follow me.
wait here. i'll go.
so you can cheat us out of our share? hide it in the bottom of your bag? i plan to count every bar of that gold myself before it leaves the vault.
we'll count it later.
"oh, i know you too well, ulis."
"if he's going, i'm going."
"me, too."
we can't all go. time's running out. someone has to stay and finish loading the ship.
that's krem's job.
i'm tired of doing this job. i don't want to do all the menial work.
krem.
it's time that i showed a little initiative. i have the lobes for business. you just never give me the chance to prove it.
get back to work!
"yes, cousin."
you sure told him.
get back to work.
my back.
what about it?
i think i pulled a muscle. it's an old water-polo injury. flares up every now and then. i just need to rest.
we don't have any time. if ulis comes back and we're not finished.
then you'd better get working.
where are we going?
bottom deck.
we already looked there.
you obviously didn't look in the right place.
after you.
have you come to rescue me?
how did you wake up?
whatever put the others to sleep didn't affect me in the same way. my body works differently than the humans.
humans?
"that's the name of their species. they're a terrible race. deceitful, cruel."
then why do you live with them?
"it wasn't my choice. i'm a captive here. they've enslaved me. please, take me with you."
you would make a handsome wife. do you know how to perform oo-mox?
"i'm well-trained in the arts of pleasure, but i'm not familiar with oo-mox."
my lobes. stroke my lobes.
like this?
yes.
and this?
"oh, yes!"
haven't we been through this section?
not yet.
i recognise that conduit.
we have a thousand conduits like that on this ship.
we're going in circles.
this way.
isn't there a more direct route?
that's the beauty of this thing. it's impossible to find unless you know exactly where you're going.
how much further?
keep your shirt on. it's close.
watch your head.
"is this your plan, to walk us to death?"
is this some kind of trick?
relax. we're here.
the vault?
it's all yours.
open it. open it!
better let me go in first.
why?
"knowing captain archer, he's probably rigged the place with booby traps. just give me a few minutes to check it out."
no! you could have a weapon hidden in there.
i'll go.
"not without me, you won't. you'll fill your pockets with gold."
take your hands off me!
we don't have all day.
get away from that hatch! out of my way!
thief! i want my share!
it's mine!
"get back, or i'll gnaw your hands off!"
my gold! my gold!
it's a trap!
"sorry fellas, bank must be closed today."
did it work?
perfectly.
do you have the key?
not that interesting. no sense of humour. always complaining.
i'll make it up to you.
how?
"five bars of gold? open these things, sub-commander. that's an order."
"yeah, porthos. you okay?"
i'm going to be contacting the vulcan high command as well as starfleet. if you come within a light year of any one of our ships you won't know what hit you.
you'll never see us again.
"if you want to be unshackled, you might think about showing krem here a little more respect."
vermin.
"release me, and i'll forget this ever happened."
"later, maybe. if you're nice."
"let me go, you idiot!"
shut up!  are you sure you want to stay here with the hu-mans? with my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune.
i'll let you have my latinum pen. the one you've always had your eye on.
no thanks.
my beetle-snuff collection.
makes me sneeze.
name your price.
"whatever he offers you, i'll double it."
krem! we're family.
i know a bolian female. i could introduce you.
i thought cajun food was hot.
"d'marr, what do you call that spice?"
hajjlaran. the warlords on preenos use it to test their courage.  you sure you won't have some?
my courage doesn't need testing.
"i have other items to trade. i can get you some triaxian silk for, say, another protein resequencer?"
i bet you'd look good in triaxian silk.
what we really need are engineering supplies.
"raw duratanium, dilithium ore."
"i'm sorry, i prefer to deal in more exotic goods. but, about two days from here there's a small system. you might find what you're looking for there."
we haven't detected any inhabited planets on long range scans.
it's not inhabited. not exactly.
what do you mean?
mmm! this is excellent. what is it again?
coffee. i can have my chef wrap up a few kilograms for you if you wouldn't mind telling us where we can find those supplies.
"captain, please. this isn't a matter of negotiation. i'm thinking of your safety."
ten kilos?
it's pure luck that i even found it.
found what?
"a ship, crashed on one of the inner planets. there were no lifesigns aboard, so i landed to claim my rights of salvage."
what'd you find?
"a transport vessel, largely intact. i could have stripped it bare and made a fortune."
why didn't you?
"the, er, crew objected."
you said there weren't any lifesigns aboard.
there weren't. there wasn't anything alive.
"what are you saying, the ship was haunted?"
"the atmosphere is thin, but breathable."
any biosigns?
"as the trader said, none."
"i've located the ship, sir."
let's see it.
no power signatures. it appears to be deserted.
"but are your sensors calibrated for ghosts? so far d'marr's batting a thousand. i'm reading duratanium, beryllium and dilithium."
i wonder what caused the crash.
there's no way to tell without a closer look.
let's get down there.
are we sure that's a good idea?
"you're not afraid it's really haunted, are you?"
"we don't know what happened to the crew. that ship could be a tomb. you really think we should be picking through it for spare parts, sir?"
"d'marr didn't say anything about bodies. captain, we've taken more damage out here than we ever expected to. there's enough duratanium down there to patch a lot of hull fractures."
"let's pay her a visit. if we feel the spirits don't want us there, we'll leave. malcolm, you have the bridge."
"aye, sir."
"travis, you're driving."
t'pol?
nothing.
"according to d'marr, engineering should be that way."
you and t'pol check it out. comm. us if you find anything we can use. or if you see any signs of the crew.
"aye, captain."
"everything okay, travis?"
"yes, sir. i was just wondering. if that trader left in such a hurry, why'd he bother to close the hatch behind him?"
what is it?
i heard something.
"rats, maybe?"
no.
"well, then you probably imagined it."
vulcans don't imagine things.
"it's nothing to be ashamed of. a spooky ship, a missing crew things going bump in the night. it'd give anybody the creeps."
the creeps?
"yeah, willies. heebie-jeebies. what, don't you get frightened every once in a while?"
no.
not by anything?
no.
that's too bad. nothing like a good scare.
fear is a primitive emotion.
"there's got to be something that scares you. heights, spiders?"
"when i was recalled from enterprise by the high command, i learned the crew was preparing a 'going-away' party. i found the prospect somewhat frightening."
"what do you think that trader really saw down here, sir?"
i don't know. maybe someone else wanted to salvage this wreck and they were trying to scare him off.
"that makes sense, except scavengers would've stripped this ship to the keel."
"this isn't turning into one of your famous ghost stories, is it?"
"would make a good one, sir."
what do you think? computer terminal?
"yes, sir. there's no power but the data modules look intact."
let's get them back to the ship see if we can find out what happened here.
"it's dilithium, all right. huh."
something wrong?
no. the crystals are in perfect shape. wouldn't be that hard to get this ship flying again.
what is it?
there's someone here.
you said there weren't any biosigns.
there aren't.
"if you're trying to scare me i appreciate the effort, but"
tucker to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're not alone down here.
we're on our way.
there's a space behind this bulkhead.
why didn't any of this show up on sensors?
there appears to be a dampening field in this section of the ship.
what's generating it?
i'm reading a power source but i can't pinpoint its location.
then let's do some pinpointing.
hi.
"sorry. it's okay, i'm not going to hurt you."
hey! t'pol!
is this your vessel?
can you understand me?
"i can tell you're surprised to see us. you probably think we're scavengers. i'll be honest with you, that was pretty much the plan. but we didn't know there was anyone here. believe it or not, we thought you were ghosts."
we were on our way back from our colony on kotara barath. we came under attack as we passed this system.
who attacked you?
"they didn't introduce themselves, they just opened fire."
we're a supply ship. we don't carry large weapons. we tried to defend ourselves.
the captain was able to make a crash landing. it's a miracle we all survived.
didn't you send out a distress call?
"if we had, it would have let the raiders know where we were."
so you set up this dampening field to hide.
we were afraid they'd come down and finish what they started.
how long have you been here?
nearly three years.
three years. you've made quite a home for yourselves here.
we didn't have much choice.
"well, you do now. our ship is big enough for all of you. we can take you home."
"you're very generous, captain, but our world is over a year away."
"well, we can't just leave you here."
"as you say, we've made a home for ourselves."
what about their engines?
their dilithium matrix is stable. they've got plenty of antimatter reserves. i think we can get this ship flying.
"we've tried, believe me."
we have resources you may not have. it's worth a shot.
"thank you, captain."
"oh! you startled me. that's twice in one day. you ever say anything? unless you're unable to say anything, in which case i apologize."
don't touch that. the power's been routed to our living area through that relay. it's very dangerous.
i'm glad you finally decided to speak up. thanks.
you're welcome.
you know a lot about your ship's systems?
my father's the engineer. he taught me how things work.
"well, stick around then. you can warn me about whatever else i need to keep my hands off."
"he's busy. don't bother him, liana."
it's okay. i could use the company.
my daughter has other responsibilities.
these relays are cross-circuited.
liana and her father rerouted power where they needed it. see here? they shunted helm control to airponics.
"efficient, but i'll need to reconnect the bridge systems."
i'll ask liana to give you a hand.
that's not necessary.
it'll go faster.
i can take care of it.
she knows the ship's system inside and out. she kept me from getting fried on a live plasma feed.
perhaps she can help you then.
what's that supposed to mean?
by the way you keep talking about her you obviously appreciate her technical expertise.
she's very competent.
so was the female engineer on the xyrillian ship.
"you're never going to let that go, are you."
i'm simply noting that the last time you found someone this competent you wound up carrying her child.
am i interrupting?
not at all. commander tucker and i were just discussing his previous repair experience.
i thought you might like something to eat.
"no, thank you.  i'm going to remove those power shunts on the bridge."
are you hungry?
thanks.
mmm. it's delicious. what is it?
it's called lorella. we grow it in the airponics bay. nothing'll take root outside.
i'm not surprised. it's amazing you were able to survive out here. why do i feel like it's feeding time at the zoo?
i didn't mean to be rude.
please. i wish more women paid that much attention to me.
do you know a lot of women?
"well, nearly a third of the crew is female."
"what about on, what did you call your planet?"
"earth. i've got lady friends back there, but nobody special, if that's what you mean. not anymore. what about your world? kantare?"
what about it?
"well, as soon as we get your engines fixed you'll be going back, seeing your friends. i bet you're looking forward to that."
commander? i hear you've been making progress.
we're getting there.
there is something else you might be able to help us with.
your computer core?
"it controls all the ship's vital functions. environmental systems, main power. you might say it keeps us alive."
these are optronic relays.
"yes, and the system's beginning to degrade. it could fail at any time."
i've worked on something like this. on a xyrillian ship.
then you can fix it?
i can try. i'll need some diagnostic gear from enterprise. why don't you come along?  i could buy you lunch.
"thank you, commander, but we still have a lot to do here."
you've been marooned for three years. a change of scenery for an hour or two couldn't hurt.
another time.
okay. i'll be back before you know it.
why can't i go?
you know why.
"what's wrong with seeing their ship, meeting some of their crew?"
i think you've met enough of their crew already.
these are good people. they want to help us. i promise not to say anything.
here.
this is where they say their engines were hit.
there's a lot of damage.
"impact damage, sir. no scorch marks, no melting. no indications of any weapons fire."
maybe they were hit by some kind of weapon we're not familiar with.
it's possible. they also say they haven't sent out a distress call because it'd give away their position.
"you're not buying that, either."
"they crashed three years ago, sir. whoever attacked them has to be gone by now. why are they still hiding?"
just because they're a little skittish doesn't mean they're up to something.
there's also their airponics bay.
what about it?
"it's not big enough to feed all the people on that ship, sir. not by a long shot."
how are they surviving down there? it doesn't make any sense.
do we still have their data module?
it's in shuttlepod one.
have hoshi download it. let me know as soon as she has anything.
"aye, sir."
how many people are on enterprise?
eighty three.
all humans?
mostly. you met t'pol. she's a vulcan. and doctor phlox is from a planet called denobula.
can i meet him?
"are you kidding? i'd never hear the end of it if i didn't introduce you. and there's porthos, captain archer's dog."
dog?
"oh, i guess you don't have a word for that. he's a mammal. four legs, big ears, kind of cute."
what does he do?
not much. he's the captain's pet.
"of course, his pet. i've never seen a dog before. can we see it?"
"well, i hope you'll have some time left for me."
i don't know. it sounds like i'm going to be very busy.
"so, tell me about kantare."
"oh, it's boring. i want to hear about the places you've been."
our mission's really just getting started. we haven't been to many planets yet.
where are you going next?
no idea. that's the fun part.
which planet was your favourite?
"if i had choose right now, i'd say this one."
archer to commander tucker.
go ahead.
could you come to my ready room?
"on my way.  billy, could you continue this lady's tour? i still owe you lunch. i'll meet you in the mess hall."
i hear you've been spending a lot of time with liana.
"did t'pol say something? sir, i swear i've been nothing but a perfect gentleman."
"i'm sure you have, trip. this doesn't have anything to do with that."
oh.
we were wondering if you'd noticed any strange behaviour from her or any of the others.
strange behaviour? what's going on?
"hoshi translated the data module we found on their ship, and we were able to reconstruct what happened right before they crashed."
they already told us what happened.
"according to this, they weren't attacked. there was an accident on board."
what kind of an accident?
"there are some gaps in the data, but it looks like some kind of catastrophic malfunction. there was a massive depressurization when the ship went down."
maybe that data module was damaged during the crash.
it's not just the data module.
when their story didn't check out the captain asked me to run some detailed scans of the ship. according to the oxidation rate in the hull plating that ship's been sitting down there a lot longer than three years.
"it went down nearly twenty two years ago, trip."
that doesn't make any sense.
check the scans yourself.
why wouldn't liana have told me?
the data also shows that they launched a number of escape pods just before the crash.
malcolm found one. it was still in orbit. we're bringing it on board.
this is obviously someone's final resting place. what do you expect to accomplish by opening it?
i'm not quite sure.
i don't believe you'll be needing my services.
"it's shilat, captain. i saw him on their ship an hour ago. alive."
"vanilla, huh?"
there are different kinds?
"oh, hundreds. i like rocky road."
that sounds terrible. why do they call it that?
i never really thought about it. i guess because it's got nuts in it. it's also got marshmallows but i don't think that's got anything to do with the name.
marshmallows?
"they're little, er. they're made of sugar, mostly. you know, i'm not sure what they are. anyway, did you enjoy the tour?"
very much. i think sickbay was my favourite. doctor phlox let me feed his bat. he also asked me to lunch. had i known you were going to be gone so long.
i'm sorry. something important came up.
what's wrong?
"liana, how long have you been on this planet?"
captain kuulan told you.
i want you to tell me.
why?
because our scans show your ship crashed twenty two years ago.
"well, your scans must be wrong."
that's what i told captain archer. i said there wasn't any reason for you to lie to us. is there?  we found one of your escape pods.
i think i should go now.
liana.
take me back.
there was a body in it. been dead for a long time. it was shilat. can you explain that to me?
i can't.
tell me what's going on.
"i'm sorry, but i can't. please take me home."
do you need some help?
not at all.
i thought you were repairing the optronic relays.
i've done as much as i can do for now. i need to return to enterprise to analyse the data. if you'll excuse me.
do you need some help?
i need to contact my ship.
because of what you found?
i don't understand.
you were looking where you shouldn't have.
find t'pol. i'm going to go talk to the captain.
"i think it would be better if we stay together, sir."
you don't have to do this. you're not in any danger here.
that'd be easier to believe if you weren't hiding things from us.
can't you just fix our systems and go?
"is that what you really want? how old were you when your ship crashed. five, six? do you even remember what your home looks like?"
this is my home.
liana.
i didn't tell them anything.
"no, she didn't, but if you want any more help from us we're going to need some answers."
we don't owe you answers.
take their weapons.
"please, just let them leave. that's what you wanted in the first place."
when the repairs are completed.
make him stop. he'll listen to you.
go back to your ship.
not without my officers.
this isn't a negotiation.
liana.
get to work.
where's t'pol?
don't worry about her.
i'm going to need her help.
you can do it on your own.
i'm not doing a thing until i see her.
do as i say or you'll never see her.
what's so important about this thing? you'd really kill us to keep it running?
you wouldn't understand.
i don't care what your big secret is. it doesn't matter if you've been here three years or thirty. but you've got to think about liana. we can help you take her home.
just fix those relays.
you got a lot to learn about making friends.
i've made all the friends i need.
i'm sick of hearing that he's doing this for me. i don't believe it anymore.
i wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for your father.
he still should have told them the truth.
you know he can't do that.
he can do whatever he wants. he's not like you.
you shouldn't have gone to their ship.
you think this is my fault?
i saw the way you looked at their engineer. are you sure you didn't say anything?
"no, i didn't."
they'll be gone soon and everything will be fine again.
we'll set the shuttle down in the foothills south of their ship.
won't they pick us up on sensors?
their dampening field should leave them as blind as we are.
"unfortunately, that rules out using the transporter as well."
we'll go in through their escape pod ports. that should put us near engineering and their computer room.
"and with a bit of luck, near t'pol and commander tucker."
that's a pretty neat trick. here you are watching me with a gun in your hand while at the same time your corpse is up on the enterprise. what do you do for an encore?
would you wait outside?
i'm not supposed to leave him.
it's all right.
they do what i ask them to.
then why don't you ask them to let me go?
i wish i could.
maybe you could tell me how i'm being guarded by a dead man.
"do you think it's possible to tell a lie so many times that you begin to believe it's the truth? you can. i never really understood that until you came. remember when you said you thought we were ghosts? in a way, you were right."
"work your way down the port side. comm. us if you find t'pol, and be careful."
"aye, sir."
that's why your father needs to keep this running.
yes.
you can stop this.
you all right?
yeah. where did he come from?
good question.
you have to get them off the ship.
"liana, please. if you don't, my friends could die. please."
what happened to your crew?
"they're gone, captain. isn't it obvious?"
your real crew.
"oh. they didn't seem real to you? i created them. wasn't easy. took time. you could touch them. they could make you laugh, surprise you."
they were holograms.
"they were our friends, our family for over twenty years."
"they're the only people i've ever known, besides my father, until you've came."
"but the ones you based them on, the crew of this ship, where are they?"
"i buried them out in the hills, the ones i could find after the crash. i killed them, so i buried them."
that isn't true.
"you don't remember. you were a child. we were on our way home, just like kuulan told you, but we weren't attacked. there was an ion storm. it overloaded our plasma conduits. i was the chief engineer. it was my responsibility to start repairs. but it was worse than i thought. leaking plasma burned through the hull. we were losing atmosphere so captain kuulan set a course for this planet."
sounds like you did everything you could to save the ship.
"they're all dead. apparently, i didn't do enough."
they died because of me.
"no. it was my decision. she was in our quarters on the lowest deck. i knew she'd never survive a crash landing down there, so i went to get her."
any father would have done the same thing.
"i left my station. the plasma leak grew, there was an explosion. half the crew died instantly including my wife. a few made it to the escape pods, but."
"i can't imagine what making that decision must have been like, but it was a long time ago. you need to consider your daughter now."
"why do you think i did this? to retreat into some fantasy? pretend it never happened? for two years i tried to repair our ship, and i watched my daughter grow up alone. so i decided to bring them back. her mother first, then captain kuulan and the others. i did everything i could to make it like it was, for her."
she deserves more.
i've given her everything she needs.
and when you're gone?
"trip, please."
"are you going to let her bury you out in the hills, and live the rest of her life with these people you created? what if the relays burn out again? then she'll really be alone."
she's my daughter. it's not your concern.
what if she gets hurt? what do you do then? programme a holographic doctor?
we've survived here successfully.
maybe you have. ask liana how she feels. ask her if just surviving is enough.
"you all right? we'll finish working on your holographic systems, if that's what you want. but you should be sure that's all the help you need from us. it may be a long time before anyone comes by here again."
come in.  welcome aboard.
"thank you, captain. you have a beautiful ship."
thanks. we're pretty proud of her.
may i sit?
of course.
"i haven't been in space for a long time. it feels strange. good, just a bit strange."
can i get you something? some tea?
"i'm fine. no, i'm not. your engineer is a very plain-spoken man."
that's one way of putting it.
"i've never kept secrets from my daughter. she knows there's more to see beyond our little oasis. but she's never talked about leaving. not once. now your engineer thinks we should just pack up and go. twenty two years, captain. i've lived here for twenty two years, and that ship down there may seem like nothing more than spare parts to you, but to me it's home. i don't want to leave. i am happy here. comfortable. but mister tucker wants me to believe that i'm being selfish. he says that now that i have the opportunity to leave, i should. that liana deserves more. maybe it's time i stopped being so afraid of change. will you help me take my daughter home?"
we'll stay as long as it takes to get your ship flying.
"thank you, captain, but all we need are these components. i've got my own crew to do the work some of them are pretty fair engineers. i saw to that."
how's it going?
good. we're about to start realigning the antimatter injectors.
that was fast.
what's that?
"it's a protein resequencer. i figured you must be tired of eating the same food all the time. i programmed it for making ice-cream. only five flavours, but they're good ones."
rocky road?
you didn't think i'd send you off without rocky road.
thank you.
"are you sure you don't want us to stay for a while, lend a hand?"
you've got a lot more places to go.
so do you.
maybe i'll see you out there.
i'd like that.
captain? sir?
how many?
i saw at least thirty. this place is pretty big. there could be more.
any idea who attacked the shuttle?
i didn't exactly have time to get a good look.
the energy readings we got from the other side of that moon could have come from a helix.
there's a wall about five metres high. it's looks like it surrounds this entire building. i see something that might be a guard tower but i can't be sure.
any people?
"no, sir."
you up for another walk?
you're the new arrivals.
why are we here?
why are any of us here?
follow me.
"thank you, major. please, sit down."
i can understand why you're upset. no doubt you've had a difficult afternoon.
to say the least.
"i meant to speak to you earlier, but i had some urgent business to attend to. i apologise. we don't see many starship captains here.  jonathan archer."
that's right.
you must be travis mayweather.
and you are?
i am colonel grat.
i take it you're the man in charge.
"i took the liberty to examine the database in your shuttlecraft, so i know that you're from a planet called earth and that you serve on a vessel called enterprise. what i don't know is what you were doing within our military zone."
military zone?
you entered orbit of our second moon. you must have detected it.
we picked up some unusual energy readings but we had no idea where they were coming from. we were simply curious.
"your curiosity almost got you killed. fortunately, our patrol ship didn't vaporise your shuttlecraft."
you might think about putting up a 'no trespassing' sign.
i'll pass that along.
where are we now?
this is a detention complex. it's several light years from where we found you.
does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into a place like this?
we're at war with a species that can mimic the appearance of almost any humanoid. we had to make certain that you weren't infiltrators.
"if you're worried we're suliban, trust me, we're not."
i know. we've already tested your dna. you're familiar with the cabal?
unfortunately.
then you must know about their genetic enhancements and how dangerous they can be.
firsthand.
i hope you didn't suffer too many casualties.
"we've been lucky so far. we're eager to get back to enterprise. if you'll take us to our shuttlepod, we'll be on our way."
i'm afraid i don't have the authority to release you. we have very strict regulations. you'll have to appear before a magistrate on tandar prime. but the hearing should be brief. i'll explain that this was just an innocent misunderstanding.
when's this hearing?
a transport will be here in three days.
three days?
"i wish i could offer you more comfortable accommodations. unfortunately, this detention complex is overcrowded at the moment. i would advise you to keep to yourselves. if the suliban give you any trouble, simply tell one of the guards."
"i'd like to contact my ship, let them know we're all right."
"i can't permit that, captain."
regulations?
but i will call them personally and explain the situation.
escort these gentlemen back to their quarters. make sure they get a proper meal. i'm sorry we couldn't have met under better circumstances.
so am i.
they call this a proper meal? i should save it for commander tucker. it'd make a good valve sealant.
why don't you get some sleep. i'll take the first watch.
this thing doesn't hold much.
i'll be right back.
how about waiting your turn?
i can't believe you'd do this to a child.
do what?
she's a little young to be a member of the cabal.
you don't know what you're talking about.
i know that you're given genetic tricks as payment. what are they giving her?
"i don't know who you are, but you're wrong about us."
is that so?
we're not genetically enhanced and we're not members of the cabal.
"if that's true, then what are you doing here?"
didn't colonel grat tell you? we're dangerous. all suliban are dangerous.
it's past curfew.
we were just on our way back.
"sorry, danik. it's the second time this week."
"klev, please."
it's only for one night.
it's my fault. i'm the one who kept them here.
get back to your cell.
where are you taking him?
"isolation. unless you want to join him, do as i say."
will you make sure she gets back?  i'll see you in the morning.  don't worry.
i'd like to speak with them.
"i'm sorry, but regulations forbid that. there's nothing to be concerned about. they've been placed in comfortable quarters and they're perfectly safe."
"if it's all the same to you, i'd rather hear that from the captain."
i'm afraid that's not possible.
may we attend the hearing?
of course.
will they be given legal representation?
they're also free to choose their own counsel. when you arrive at tandar prime you'll be contacted by the central magistrate's office.
we'll need the coordinates.
i'm sending them now.
"thank you, colonel."
good luck to you.
hoshi?
i can't trace the signal. he must have scrambled the carrier wave.
keep at it.
"what are you suggesting we do, mount a rescue?"
the thought crossed my mind.
it would be a mistake to provoke the tandarans any further.
"so, we just sit on our hands."
the hearing's in three days.
"and what if they're found guilty, sentenced to thirty years in prison?"
"that's unlikely. if you want to explore alien cultures you'll need to learn to respect their laws. if captain archer were here, i'm sure he'd agree. if you'd like, i'll contact the vulcan high command. they might be willing to send an arbitrator."
a vulcan lawyer? they'd be better off getting the electric chair.
electric chair?
never mind.
set a course for tandar prime.
hello again.  i hope isolation wasn't too rough.
"it gets very cold in there at night. sometimes i wish i was genetically enhanced. if you've come to apologize, don't. it was just a misunderstanding."
"actually, i was hoping to find out what's going on around here."
maybe you should talk to one of the tandarans.
"i spoke to colonel grat, but i get the feeling he's not telling me the whole story. archer. my name is jonathan archer."
more?
"i've had plenty, thank you. it was very good."
you look like tandarans.
why don't you go and find your friends? and don't forget curfew.
i won't.
"we're not criminals, captain, and we're not soldiers. the only thing we're guilty of is being suliban."
"they must have tested your dna, figured out that you haven't been genetically altered."
"as far as they're concerned, that doesn't mean anything. you believed i was a member of the cabal, didn't you? didn't you?"
"yes, i did."
"all that seems to matter is the way we look. 'be careful of their wicked smiles, their shining yellow eyes. at night, they'll squeeze right through your door and everybody dies.' the tandaran children used to tease my daughter with that nursery rhyme. at least here, she doesn't have to hear it anymore."
this is an internment camp.
detention complex twenty six. i've heard it's one of their nicer ones.
why did this happen?
"the cabal began their attacks eight years ago. it wasn't long before the tandarans started to question the loyalty of all suliban living in their territory. we were rounded up, relocated as they like to say. they told us it was only temporary. it was for our own safety. 'once the cabal has been destroyed, you will be free to go back to your homes.' we're still waiting. there are eighty nine of us here. thousands more in other camps. everyone of us used to be citizens on worlds in the tandar sector. did you know that i was born in the same town as one of the guards? major klev. i was friends with his brother when we were growing up."
what about the government on the suliban homeworld? don't they have something to say about this?
"i'm sure they would if they still existed. our homeworld became uninhabitable three hundred years ago. most suliban are nomadic, but some of us have assimilated into other cultures. my grandfather made the unfortunate decision to settle on tandar prime."
what are they doing here?
it's all right. i asked them.
this came today.  what species are you?
we're human.
never heard of them.
"sajen, you're being rude."
bad news?
"it's my wife. we were separated during the relocation. she's in one of the other camps. her transfer was rejected again. she tried to appeal their decision, but as usual, they wouldn't listen."
i'm sorry.
midday inspection. try to look your best.
thank you for lunch.
thank you for listening.
why did you bring them here?
maybe i was tired of talking to you.
they could be working with grat.
hey!
colonel grat wants to see you.
just him.
"i understand you were out after curfew last night, arguing with a suliban."
it was just a misunderstanding.
"you should have my advice, captain."
"i know, i know. it's a big problem with me. i'm just too damn curious. whenever i meet new people i can't resist trying to get to know them. i'm certainly getting to know a lot about the suliban around here."
"i admire your spirit of exploration, but in this case it could get you into trouble. keep to yourself."
i'll do my best. unless you have any more advice?
"no, but i do have a question. have you ever been to oklahoma? i guess you could say i'm a curious man myself. after you mentioned that you were familiar with the cabal i decided to speak with our intelligence agency. they've uncovered some interesting facts. apparently two suliban soldiers crash-landed near a town called broken bow, oklahoma. they were chasing a klingon, of all things. i was wondering if you could provide some insight into what they were doing there."
i wouldn't know. you'd have to talk to my superiors.
"oh, i think you know a great deal. enterprise took the klingon back to his homeworld. isn't that right? rigel ten. you made a detour there. from what i'm told, you contacted a woman named sarin. you remember her? well, i'll remind you. she was the head of a suliban resistance cell. she was killed by the cabal in a firefight at the trade complex. several of our people saw you there, captain. i believe you were injured, a shot in the leg. do i have to ask your superiors about that as well?"
what exactly do you want?
"information. what do you know about the cabal? what genetic enhancements you've seen, helix deployments. who's giving them their orders?"
you've got plenty of suliban here. why not ask them?
we both know they wouldn't be very helpful.
then why are they in prison?
that's a discussion for another time.
"there are families here, children. one man hasn't seen his wife in years."
tell me what you know.
they don't deserve this kind of treatment.
they're here for their own protection.
"oh, really?"
"the last thing we wanted to do was build these detention centres, but we had no choice. when the cabal began their activities there was a great deal of fear among the tandarans. there were instances of violence. fourteen innocent suliban were killed in one day alone. we had to find a way to keep them out of danger."
then why not just let them find another place to live?
"they wouldn't get very far. it's ironic, but once they're out of tandaran territory the cabal will hunt them down and turn them all into soldiers. they're better off here."
i've met a few suliban who disagree.
one of the cabal leaders is a man named silik. he infiltrated your vessel approximately three months ago posing as a borothan pilgrim. what did he want? did he speak of the temporal cold war? answer me!
this conversation is taking longer than i expected. i'd hate to see you miss that transport tomorrow morning. the next one won't arrive for another sixty days.
i'm afraid the hearing's been postponed.
why?
the magistrate assigned to their case is in the middle of a very complex proceeding and it's taking more time than he expected.
how much longer are they going to have to wait?
hopefully not more than a few days. if you stay on course for tandar prime i'll arrange for an ambassador to show you our capital city when you arrive.
we're not interested in a tour. we just want our people back.
i'm doing everything i can. try to be patient. you'll hear from me soon.
i've isolated their carrier frequency. do you see it?
i'm tracing it now. bearing one seven eight mark twelve.
how far?
five point two light years.
"all i'm saying is we go take a look for ourselves, make sure they're okay."
proceed.
most of the people we meet have been pretty eager to get to know us but we've had our share of unfortunate encounters. i guess you could say this is one of them.
"i've lived with tandarans all my life. they're decent people, for the most part."
what about you? what did you do before you ended up here?
"i was director of research at an engineering institute. it's in the querella province. you should see it, assuming your hearing goes well."
i've got a feeling we could be here for awhile.
"why not tell grat what you know, get yourself out of here."
"i don't like being strong-armed, and i don't like what he's doing to you and the others. has anyone every tried to get out of here?"
you mean escape? a couple of years ago three men pried open one of the security grates. they tried to get to the docking bay.
docking bay?
yes. it's about a hundred metres away. it's where they keep suliban ships they've impounded.
what happened?
"oh, they managed to get inside but before they could reach a vessel all three of them were killed. colonel grat made a ridiculous claim that they were armed."
they might have succeeded with a little help from the outside. it won't be long before enterprise comes looking for mayweather and me.
"i appreciate the offer, captain, but i doubt many people here would be willing to take the risk."
have you asked them? how many ships are in that docking bay?
writing a letter?
it's a journal.
could be valuable someday. people will want to know what happened here.
i doubt anyone will ever read this.
then why are you writing it?
"why do you care? i see how you look at us. suliban terrify you. you wouldn't be surprised if i slithered up this wall or turned my face inside out. cabal, suliban, it's all the same to you."
that's not true.
what took you so long?
are you all right?
more or less.
we're picking up
suliban bio-signs.
it's not what you think. are you sure this is a secure frequency?
"i'm triaxilating the signal, sir. if we were in the middle of starfleet headquarters no one would pick it up."
good. where are you?
in orbit. it won't be long before we're detected.
"i'm getting a transporter lock on you now, captain."
just say the word and we'll bring you both home.
"hang on, trip. we're not ready to leave just yet."
"those suliban you detected are prisoners too, but they're no more guilty than we are."
i want to help them get out of here.
captain?
"have you ever heard of manzanar, sub-commander?"
i'm not familiar with that planet.
it's not a planet. it was an internment camp
on earth during the second world war. japanese-american citizens were imprisoned there even though they didn't do anything wrong. the same thing's happening here.
i thought you decided not to interfere with other cultures.
"in this case, i'm making an exception."
understood?
"yes, captain."
i've met a suliban who knows this camp inside and out. we've been working on a plan but we're going to need your help.
we'll need a few of your people. anyone who's had experience with particle weapons.
"we won't make it ten metres outside the complex before we're shot, like the others."
"and even if we did get to the ships and managed to lift off, there are patrol vessels in the area."
enterprise can handle them.
"and once we've made this miraculous escape, where do you expect us to go?"
"all we have to do is get out of tandaran territory. after that, we can set a course for the niburon colonies. i know some people there. they might be willing to help us."
it's too dangerous.
would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison?
you're placing a lot of trust in people you've only known for three days. for all we know they've been planted here to stage this revolt so grat would finally have a reason to kill all of us.
we're not working for the tandarans.
"think of your daughter. are you willing to risk her life, too?"
"we're getting out of here, sajen."
i'm not going to help you plan our suicide.
i hope the others were more enthusiastic.
this is the wall that i was telling you about. it's only forty metres from the docking bay.
"have you had a chance to reconsider? i'm willing to compromise, captain. just tell me what you know about silik."
"well, he's about this tall, a little on the scrawny side, bad teeth."
"if you're unwilling to discuss the suliban, maybe you can help me with something else. we detected some unusual energy readings last night. at first we thought it was random interference, but after examining the readings more closely we discovered they were coming from your quarters."
you should check your sensors. they're obviously malfunctioning.
i'm told they're working perfectly.
"sorry, captain."
we found this in ensign mayweather's pocket but he wouldn't say how it got there.  i was hoping you could tell me.  take him to isolation.
if i come in low from the east i should be able to evade their proximity sensors.
this appears to be a pulse cannon.
it'll be my first target.
bridge to sickbay.
phlox here.
what's your status?
"finishing as we speak, though i'm not completely happy with the nose."
it's almost time.
understood.
it's captain archer.
"put him through. go ahead, captain."
you seem to be off-course. i thought you were headed for tandar prime. what brings you here?
where's captain archer?
if you're thinking about trying to circumvent our legal system i advise against it.
you come any closer to our planet and my patrol ships will open fire.
what happened to you?
what do you care.
danik's been looking for your captain. have you seen him?
"you might try isolation. still think we're working with the tandarans? you know, we could have left this place a long time ago if we hadn't decided to help you."
i never asked for your help.
"why? because we're not suliban? because we look a little too much like tandarans? i'll admit, when i first came here it wasn't easy to see past my preconceptions about the suliban, but i did. why can't you?"
we're being hailed. it's him.
check your sensors and you'll see two patrol ships headed toward you.
we didn't come here to fight. we came to talk with you.
they'll have a weapons lock on your vessel in less than one minute.
"do you eat meat, colonel?"
what?
"our chef is preparing a meal in your honour, and i was curious whether you're vegetarian. i was hoping you'd join me for dinner. it would give us an opportunity to get acquainted."
you have forty five seconds to leave orbit.
"i can't believe you're really going to destroy our vessel over a trivial incident like this. i can tell you're an enlightened man. all i'm asking for is a chance to show you that we're enlightened as well. we're transmitting a copy of earth's historical database along with the starfleet charter, and a record of all human contacts with alien species. if you have any doubts about our intentions this material should lay them to rest. send him the vulcan database as well. i think you'll find that my people have a great deal in common with you, too."
you're jamming our frequencies. break off your transmission now.
what about dinner? should i set a
i'm not going to warn you again. end your transmission and leave orbit.
mister tucker.
it's done.
those patrol ships are closing fast.
get us out of here.
yes?
i understand you're looking for a way out of here.
who are you?
"don't you recognise me, travis?"
malcolm?
"in the flesh. oh, you look worse than i do. what happened?"
long story. how'd you get down here?
transporter. i think i'm finally getting used to it.
are you sure you weren't detected?
"no, thanks to hoshi. she kept the sensors occupied."
"congratulations, ensign. your case is about to be dismissed."
the isolation block is here. he's in one of these cells.
i'll find him.
the charges?
they're in place. are you up for this?
nightly inspection.
i thought you said it wasn't for another fifteen minutes.
i'd better get back. see you in orbit.
good luck.
reed to enterprise.
go ahead.
the guards are ahead of schedule.
what's your status?
we're two hundred thousand kilometres away.
we're going to need you to speed things up a little.
we'll do our best.
here they come.
polarise the hull plating. stand by weapons.
aft torpedoes. fire.
two direct hits. they're veering off.
take us down.
did they follow us?
they took heavy damage. they're both attempting to land.
"you're clear to launch, commander."
acknowledged.
go ahead.
he's approaching the compound. two minutes.
tell him
get out there.
if this happens again you'll all be spending time in isolation.
"major, do you have a second? i don't mean to cause any trouble, but i was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food. no offence, but the meals here are pretty awful."
eat what you're given.
"i'll try, but i'm not sure i can hold down another bowl of that what do you call it? it tastes like sawdust. is that what they make you eat? because if it is, i'd think about going on a hunger strike. i don't know how you."
enough!
"go, go."
reed to tucker. the wall's down.
i see it. stand by.
hurry. go with the others.
"hurry! hurry! go, go! hurry."
father!
"i'll be there soon, narra. go. go!"
"it's good to see you, malcolm."
how'd you know it was me?
"you have no idea what you've done. you haven't freed these people, you've condemned them."
my father's back at the common area. he needs help. please.
i'll go.
"no, wait."
come on.
you had no right to interfere.
this isn't about my rights. it's about theirs.
they have no rights. they lost them the moment the cabal began attacking us. do you know how many people the cabal have murdered? how many ships they destroyed? colonies? you just gave them eighty nine new soldiers!
what makes you think they'll join the cabal?
these people have nothing left. they're desperate. they'll never be able to resist what the cabal has to offer.
i haven't been here very long but i seem to know these people a hell of a lot better than you do.
archer to enterprise.
"go ahead, captain."
we're on our way.
where are those patrol ships?
they won't pose a threat.
and the suliban?
their vessels are breaking orbit.
good work.
we'll see you in a few minutes.
tell the doctor to meet us in sickbay. my skin is really starting to itch.
i'll let him know.
"captain, think they'll make it?"
do i think they'll get out of tandaran space safely? yes. do i think they'll be all right?
did you get that?
tostka. insult. some kind of an insult.
he's insulting us or we insulted them?
i'm not sure.
tostka!
ask what we did wrong.
kjass. skjask las?
hwajat ajhakjahs!
well?
you eat like you mate?
you sure that thing's working?
sasooratt!
i think they want to leave.
that much is obvious.
"whatever we've done to offend you, i apologize."
jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii.
sasooratt!
"well, this is one for the books. briefest first contact."
does anybody hear that?
"what, the static?"
frequency distortions mixed in with the static.
you've got better ears than we do.
it's coming from the comm. system.
have you run a diagnostic?
twice. i guess today is just not my day.
how's the translation coming along?
"slowly. hwajat, their word for eat."
what about it?
"with the emphasis on the first syllable, hwa-jat, it means to mate."
i can see how that might cause some confusion over dinner.
context is critical in every language but kreetassan has the most subtle variations i've ever seen. the same word can have a dozen different meanings.
"we rely on you to recognise the difference, ensign."
you think it was my fault?
i didn't say that.
you implied it.
i simply noted that linguistic matters fall within your responsibility. for all we know it was mister tucker's table manners that offended them.
but you think if i picked up the language faster they might have not stormed off the ship.
there's no need to react emotionally. try to learn from failure. it could help your next first contact be more successful.
thanks.
"commander, i'm picking up some kind of interference from the comm. system. a high-frequency distortion."
is it a problem?
mostly just irritating.
i'll track it down first thing in the morning.
thanks.
is he in there?
yes.
how's his mood?
now might not be the best time.
i'll take my chances.
it better be important.
prime rib tonight with real horseradish.
thanks. i'll have the steward send some up. thought we'd set a course for this brown dwarf system. looks interesting.
"i can't wait. in the meantime, why don't we shoot a little nine ball? you can break."
maybe later.
"i was going to save this for a rainy day, but"
stanford versus texas.
the finals?
fresh out of the subspace mailbag. you've been threatening to teach me the finer points of the game.
unless you're too busy with your brown dwarves.
what if they just don't like being touched? remember how uncomfortable they looked when the captain tried to shake their hands?
"they looked that way the entire time. besides, they didn't really lose their temper until they arrived here in the mess hall."
are you staying for the movie tonight?
what's playing?
"wages of fear. classic french film. no, you'll like it. things blow up."
"oh, sounds fun. hoshi?"
"no, thanks. i'm turning in early."
we might need a translator. those subtitles go by pretty fast.
i've had enough language problems for one day.
we're going to have to sit in the back.
one minute.
i hate missing the beginning.
it's on the computer. you can watch it whenever you want.
it's not the same. you don't want to go back and see the first part after you know how it ends.
the power just went out on d deck. cargo bay two. the lighting grid's down.
it's probably just a blown relay. leave it for the night shift.
if it's just a blown relay it'll take you ten minutes to fix. here.
the comm.'s out too.
two and a half hours?
two hours and twenty four minutes.
seems awfully long for a movie about four men in a truck.
you'll be on the edge of your seat.
you promised me explosions.
don't worry.
this is all wrong.  excuse me. reed to bridge.
"go ahead, lieutenant."
"we're trying to watch a movie down here but instead, we're being treated to a view of you. so unless you're planning on giving us a little song and dance, maybe you could see what's gone wrong."
"come on, come on. goal for stanford!"
how deep's the pool?
deep enough so that no one can touch the bottom.
i didn't know it was such a rough game.
think of it as one part basketball one part swimming and one part wrestling.
and i thought it was just a bunch of guys screwing around in a pool.
"engineering.  michael, is that you? hello?"
nice goal!
"did you see the way number twelve set him up? wait, he's called the point man, right?"
"very good. i told you, best sport in the world."
"well, i'll still take a great off-tackle run out of the backfield, but i can see how you can get hooked on this."
thanks for thinking of it.
my pleasure. now keep watching while texas trounces your sorry california butts.
"you haven't watched the end of this, have you?"
of course not.
hello?
what the hell was that?
"oh, number eight on texas just fouled one of my boys. he's going to be ejected for twenty seconds."
is that fair? it gives you guys an advantage.
"well, that's the point. i don't suppose it'd be practical to put a pool on the ship."
i wouldn't want to be taking a swim if the gravity plating went offline.
no. no.
kelly to the captain.
go ahead.
"sir, i'm in cargo bay two and"
there's some kind of lifeform in here.
lifeform?
"it's got rostov, sir. he's still conscious, but he can't"
crewman?
weapons to stun.
captain.
sir?
careful.
the light.
she's alive.
captain? leave.
crewman?
leave.
captain!
get out of here! go!
this thing appears to be growing. there's no telling if it'll get out of the cargo bay. i recommend we evacuate the entire deck.
how did it get onboard?
"the last time we opened the airlock, we were docked with the kreetassans."
you think they left us a little souvenir?
our encounter didn't go well but i doubt we gave them reason to attack us. we're not even certain that the organism's hostile.
you didn't see that thing go after the captain! it seemed hostile enough to me.
"the kreetassans might know something about this thing. i can start scanning for their ship, try to pick up their warp trail."
we'll need to communicate with them better than last time.
i'll do my best.
t'pol to doctor phlox. report.
i'm preparing to examine the specimen. would you care to observe?
yes. stand by.
"you'll note that even though it's been severed from its body, it survives independently"
not unlike the common earthworm or the neethian cradlefish.
"do you think that's wise, doctor?"
"possibly not, but i'm going to need a tissue sample if i hope to learn more about its physiology."
that'll be quite enough. this is no earthworm.
doctor?
look at the synaptic activity. this organism possesses a very sophisticated nervous system. it could be capable of higher mental functions.
"if it's intelligent maybe we can communicate with it. the frequency distortions, they look a lot like the phonetic patterns in certain andorian dialects."
"with all due respect, hoshi, we're not talking about nouns and verbs here. it could take you days to learn a language like that, even if it is one."
what other choice do we have? give me a chance.
"i'm sorry, ensign, there isn't enough time."
sub-commander.
"we need to neutralise it, quickly. you said phase pistols had no effect?"
none that i could tell.
then i suggest you find a method that does.
"if i may, the organism is highly photo-sensitive. a sustained burst of em radiation might be enough to stun the creature."
can you assemble some em emitters?
it'll take a few minutes.
why doesn't it just kill us?
take it easy.
i'm sure t'pol and malcolm are doing everything they can to get us out of here. can either of you see crewman kelly?
"yes, sir."
how's she look?
she's still breathing.
zabel's still unconscious.
captain?
yeah.
i imagine in a situation like this they'd cancel the movie.
i imagine so.
i really wanted to see it. yves montand driving explosives through the mountains.
i'll make sure they reschedule it for next week.
"thank you, sir."
it's working.
"bridge, something's wrong."
shut off the emitters.
doctor?
shut them off.
off.
what happened?
"their nervous systems appear to be linked to the organism's. they're sharing autonomic functions, neural impulses. if we continue firing we could end up killing our own people."
"mister reed, withdraw your team."
understood.
the rate of symbiosis is increasing. if we don't find a way to extract them soon their systems will be too integrated with the creature. i won't be able to separate them.
you wanted a chance to communicate. i suggest you begin.
how much time do they have?
"a few hours at most. their metabolic rates are dropping. temperature, respiration."
there must be some way to cut them out of there.
"i'm not sure if you appreciate how alien this creature is. it's not attacking our crewmen, it's trying to integrate them into itself."
the end result's the same.
at some point in the very near future there won't be six lifeforms in that cargo bay. there'll only be one.
"if that thing continues to grow, we're going to have to find a way to contain it."
do you have a suggestion?
starfleet's been working on creating a stable em barrier for the last five years.
a force field.
right. they just haven't found a way to control the particle density. all the specs are in the database. i've been trying to jerry-rig a prototype of my own.
and?
i've got it stable enough to absorb a phase pistol blast sixty percent of the time. i think i can improve on that.
i suggest you work quickly.
i think i found them.
where?
point five two light years from here.
lay in a course.
i already have. i've been sending out hails but we're still out of comm. range.
let me know as soon as they respond.
any progress?
"believe me, you'd be the first to know. i'm sorry. it's frustrating. i'm not having a lot of luck."
"the situation requires expertise, not luck."
maybe i don't have the expertise.
"if you don't, no one else aboard enterprise does."
i'm doing my best.
"it was your suggestion that we attempt to communicate with it. if you don't think that's possible, we'll have to find another solution."
"i've made a little progress, but our translation matrix isn't designed for this. look at it. it's more like a calculus equation than a language."
mathematics is sometimes considered a form of language.
what i'm trying to say is that i could use help from someone with a background in higher mathematics.
perhaps i can assist you.
the texas goalie can't block to his right because he keeps his hands too deep.
how do you know that?
"captain, i know it too, and i don't understand anything about water polo."
it's this lifeform. it's linking us together somehow.
we got to get out!
calm down.
this thing's gotten inside our heads!
"trip, do you know what i'm thinking about?"
now's not the time to be thinking about the regionals.
trip.
"senior year, north american regionals against princeton. we, i mean, you were down by two goals under a minute left."
and what was i thinking? what was i thinking.
you thought you could win every game. you always thought you could win. no matter how far behind you were.
"and we did. we went on the finals that year. as soon as you give up, the game's lost."
how's our little friend?
fast asleep. it appears to have entered a dormant state. probably a reaction to the shock of being severed from the larger organism.
but it's alive?
very much so.
"good. now, if you don't mind, i'd like to run a few tests of my own."
what kind of tests?
i need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate.
may i ask why?
"i'm trying to create a force field to isolate the cargo bay, but if it's going to work, i have to calculate how much of a jolt it will take to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people it's taken."
"if you intend to pummel this appendage with em radiation until it cries for mercy, i'm afraid i can't permit that."
why not?
this is more than just a severed limb. it exhibits all the signs of an intelligent being.
"intelligent being or not, its big brother is in the cargo bay strangling the captain and four other crewmen. if we don't do something to contain it now it could pose a threat to everyone on board."
there are less invasive ways to gather the information you need.
such as?
microcellular analysis.
how long would that take?
less than an hour.
in less than an hour that thing could spread across half a deck.
"i'm willing to help you, mister reed, but not if it means torturing this organism. correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't our mission to try to better understand unique forms of life?"
not if they're trying to kill the captain.
we don't know anything about this creature's intentions.
"i admire your interspecies ethics, but until hoshi tells me she's found a way to communicate with it, i have to assume its intentions are hostile. now, if you don't mind."
"if you want information to help you construct your force field, you'll acquire it under my supervision."
"i'm sure i don't have to remind you, doctor, i am the ranking officer here."
"not in my sickbay, unless the captain says otherwise."
the captain is in no condition to offer an opinion.
precisely.
"fine. your rules, but we'd better get to it."
what if we used a bilateral algorithm?
i already tried.
did you compensate for frequency drift?
i wouldn't be much of a comm. officer if i didn't.
"allowing your emotions to control you won't help solve this problem, ensign."
neither will questioning everything i do.
you asked for my help.
"i didn't ask for you to keep count of every time i make a mistake, or to second-guess all of my decisions."
as first officer it's my duty to supervise you.
"this goes beyond duty, sub-commander. you've been looking over my shoulder ever since you came on board. double-checking my log entries, my translations."
it's my job.
"is that all we're talking about? you don't think i belong on enterprise, do you."
"on the contrary. it would be a great loss to starfleet if you were not a part of this crew. if you feel i've been unfair to you, i apologise, but i hold you to a high standard, ensign, because i know you're capable of achieving it. shall we continue?"
"yes. why don't we take another look at the sub-harmonics. i was thinking we could run it through the decryption matrix, see if we can find a pattern. all i see is numbers, codes."
any code can be broken.
you hailed us?
you speak english.
we studied your database. it wasn't difficult.
okay. we have a problem.
yes?
there'an alien organism on our ship.
yes?
it came aboard around the same time we saw you. we were hoping you might know something about it.
describe this organism.
"well, it's big, but it didn't start out that way. it's like a large mass of tendrils."
tendrils?
"like a giant web, but it moves and grows."
we have seen this.
where?
on its home world. perhaps it attached itself to our ship. it wasn't our fault.
can you tell us where this planet is?
apologise.
excuse me?
we will send you the coordinates but first you must apologise to us for your offence.
that's the thing. we don't know what we did to offend you.
"on your ship, you put food in your mouths."
you mean eat.
yes. eat.
i don't understand.
it is like mating. it is very offensive to us.
we were just eating. how do you eat?
"we eat the same way, but not in the presence of others."
"i see. okay. please believe me, we had no idea that would be offensive to you. it was simply a misunderstanding. on behalf of the entire crew, i sincerely apologise."
your apology is accepted.
"thank you. now, could i have those coordinates?"
captain.
yeah.
i feel you've drifted away over there.
you aren't feeling much better than i do. rostov?
he's out. when zephram cochrane talked about new life and new civilisation do you think this is what he meant?
"here, here it is. i found a third set of repetitions. try it. just a few more and the ut can start building a syntax."
phlox to t'pol.
go ahead.
i know you're under a great deal of pressure
but crewman kelly's metabolic rate has dropped to a critical level. whatever you're planning to do
you'd better do it soon.
understood.
"ready, sir."
the particle density's still fluctuating. i think the problem's in the lower left quadrant.
"got it, sir."
try again.
better.
t'pol to lieutenant reed.
go ahead.
"we've made some progress on the translation, but we're going to need to get into the cargo bay to test it. is the forcefield ready?"
i'm making the final calibrations now.
you'll have to do it quickly. doctor phlox says our people don't have much time.
understood.
captain?
emitter b's off by three point two microns.
"the forcefield's working, but i can't guarantee how long it will hold. have you done it?"
we're about to find out.
it just sounds like a constant tone.
"i'm going to create distortions in the tone. hopefully, the organism will understand what i'm trying to do."
"come on, just a little more. i think i've got enough to try something simple."
ask what it wants.
it's talking to us.
what's it saying? ensign.
hold on. it's giving us coordinates.
its home world?
the kreetassans already gave them to us.
these look more like the latitude and longitude. i think it's trying to give us an exact location of the planet.
tell it we're taking it back.
commander tucker's heart rate is increasing.
is that good or bad?
good. crewman kelly's biosigns are stabilising as well.
lower the force field. lieutenant.
"medical team, report to cargo bay two."
acknowledged.
here.
look at all of them.
"not them, it. this is all one organism."
"the part that got on board, why did it take our people?"
"hard to say. when it got separated from itself, perhaps it needed a physical connection with any lifeform it could find."
excuse me?
i asked if you've
we heard you. what makes you think we're suffering from a lack of sexual activity?
starfleet forbids officers from fraternising with subordinates. unless you've been violating regulations
those regulations don't apply to you. have you been suffering?
"on vulcan, we mate only once every seven years."
that's a hell of a dry spell.
why are you suddenly so curious about this?
it's my understanding that your mating ritual is effective in easing tension.
that hasn't always been my experience.
and you think that we need our tensions eased?
efficiency's down three percent.
we've all gone about ten months without a break. i think it's normal for people to get a little sloppy.
perhaps it's time the crew takes shore leave.
"well, i like the sound of that."
i took the liberty of locating a suitable planet approximately nine days from our present location. it's called risa.
what's your idea of suitable?
"it's tropical, with an abundance of pristine beaches. you'll find more information in the vulcan database."
is it populated?
"yes, by a humanoid culture receptive to easing tension."
look at this. they've got sea rays the size of shuttlepods.
i didn't know you were a diver.
"i've never done it, but if there was ever a time to learn. 'your guides are genetically enhanced to breathe underwater.' and they're all female."
mermaids.
i read that at any time there can be thousands of visitors there speaking hundreds of different languages.
are you going to spend your vacation doing the same thing you've been doing onboard for the last ten months?
how i relax is my business.
"how about you, lieutenant?"
"well, i'm certainly up for meeting some new people."
why don't you come with me?
"i appreciate the offer, but i was hoping for something more than a linguistic seminar."
"if you're wearing that to impress the women on risa, you may as well stay on board."
"rule number one, you've got to be seen to get noticed. and i plan on getting noticed."
don't say she didn't warn you.
figured out your itinerary yet?
i think i'm going to pass.
"captain, you need this as much as i do."
nobody needs this as much as you do. the ship will be nice and quiet. i've got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up. it'll be a good chance to get some work done.
we're going to a planet with over two hundred registered nuvian masseuses and you're going to sit in your cabin with a bunch of star charts?
mister tucker has a point.
you think i need a massage?
the safety of this ship depends on its captain being at his most efficient.
i suppose i could read those surveys on a nice beach.
incoming transmission from starfleet command.
transfer it to my ready room.
her name's v'lar. she's the vulcan ambassador to a planet called mazar.
"if you don't mind my asking, admiral, why is this our problem?"
"apparently, it's imperative that she be taken off that planet as soon as possible. the nearest vulcan ship is at least a week away."
do they expect us to take her all the way back to vulcan?
you'll rendezvous with the vulcan ship sh'raan in three days. they'll take her the rest of the way.
any idea what the emergency is?
"well, this may come as a shock to you, jon, but the vulcans aren't talking."
imagine that.
thank you for volunteering your quarters.
i'm happy to do it. i'm looking forward to meeting her.
"i imagine she'll spend most of the journey alone, engaged in meditation, but if it seems appropriate i'll ask if she'll meet with you."
"thanks. well, if there's anything else i can do."
if you wouldn't mind taking that.
ambassador v'lar is accustomed to a spartan environment.
"hoshi, thanks for giving up your cabin."
"i just hope it's spartan enough, sir."
everything set?
i believe so. i've prepared this to familiarize the crew with the necessary protocols.
we should assign a steward to attend to her needs.
don't address the ambassador unless spoken to first. don't offer to shake hands. refrain from laughing in her presence.
those guidelines are largely precautionary. i doubt the crew will have much opportunity to interact with her.
you seem to be pulling out all the stops.
i'm simply following the protocols used in dealing with an ambassador of v'lar's distinction.
"well, she'll be here soon enough. let me know if you need any help."
"thank you, captain."
"entering orbit, sir."
we're being hailed. it's the mazarite high council.
someone's in a hurry.
captain archer?
i'm jonathan archer.
are you prepared to receive ambassador v'lar?
"that's why we're here. if you'll transmit your landing coordinates to us, we'll send down a shuttlepod. i'm looking forward to the visit."
i regret there won't be time for that. the ambassador is already on her way to your ship.
"a small craft's approaching, sir."
i assume the vulcans have informed you of the urgency of this matter.
they said it was important we pick up the ambassador as quickly as possible. they didn't say why.
v'lar has been expelled for abuse of her position and criminal misconduct.
captain archer?
ambassador. on behalf of my crew i'd like to welcome you aboard enterprise.
thank you.
may i take that?
"that's very thoughtful, captain."
"this is commander charles tucker, my chief engineer."
pleased to meet you.
"the pleasure is mine, commander."
"and this is my science officer, sub-commander t'pol."
t'nar pahk sarat y'rani.
"t'nar jaral. but please, i've been anticipating the opportunity to practice my english."
"i hope you like your quarters, ambassador. t'pol tried very hard to anticipate your needs."
"fortunately my needs are few, captain. i am curious, though. who previously occupied the cabin?"
the odour. the human scent is difficult to mask.
"actually, i was hoping to meet the crew member in order to thank her for allowing me to disrupt her routine. i prefer not to inconvenience anyone if possible. that philosophy has served me well in the diplomatic service."
t'pol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accords between vulcan and andoria.
the andorians required a somewhat firmer hand at the negotiating table. but i was younger then. that was before we even made contact with earth.
that was over ninety years ago. how long have you been a diplomat?
"commander tucker, i understood that on your world it is considered bad manners to ask a lady her age."
"well, i wasn't, er, i, er, didn't mean to imply that you were, er"
"forgive me, commander. my attempt at humour. suffice it to say that with t'pol and myself here, you're almost certainly dining with the two oldest people on this ship."
"i hope, ambassador, that you regard the charges against you with less levity."
of course i do.
how do you intend to defend yourself?
there is no defence.
are you saying you're guilty?
t'pol.
"it's all right, captain. a person in my position carries the trust of all vulcans. the fact that the mazarites believe that trust has been compromised justifies t'pol's concern. i'm afraid my age is betraying me, captain. would you mind if i retired?"
of course not.
"i've never been to earth, but i find the humans i have encountered quite unpredictable. i'd be interested in hearing about your experiences there."
"another time, perhaps."
i understand.
this is your cabin. i'll say good night.
t'pol. i sense your anger.
you presume that my time with humans has left me susceptible to their emotions.
they're our emotions as well. we simply hide them better.
"if you're sensing anything from me, it isn't anger."
no. disappointment.
"good night, ambassador."
t'pol.
captain.
is there a problem i should be aware of?
i assume you're talking about ambassador v'lar.
you were a bit abrupt with her.
"if you believe i was rude, i'll convey my apologies."
i don't pretend to understand vulcans. i never have. but i wouldn't be a very good captain if i didn't know when something was bothering my science officer.
it's uncommon for a vulcan to commit a crime.
"uncommon, but not unheard of."
unheard of for a person in ambassador v'lar's position.
we don't know what she's done.
"it doesn't matter. if she were innocent, she would have insisted on staying to defend herself."
you seem to know a lot about her.
"i've met the ambassador before, though she clearly doesn't recall. it was many years ago on vulcan during my early schooling. she had just negotiated the treaty of ka'tann and i travelled a great distance to see her."
was it worth the trip?
"the ambassador inspired me to choose a direction in my own life. a path that led me to the science council, and eventually here."
i've had a few heroes in my life. it's never easy when one of them lets you down.
vulcans don't have heroes.
"no, i'm sure they don't."
"captain, can you come to the bridge?"
on my way.
"an unidentified vessel, sir, fifty thousand kilometres and closing."
they're hailing us.
let's find out who they are.  what can we do for you?
"my apologies, captain. there's been a change of plans regarding ambassador v'lar."
we weren't told.
we've been having some problems with our long-range communications.
what's the change of plans?
"the magistrate feels that we let the ambassador go too quickly. she's needed for additional questioning. we don't want to cause you any more inconvenience. if you'll drop out of warp, we can dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our ship."
your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her. now he wants her back?
i'm just a transport captain. i never try to make sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking.
i'll have to contact my superiors.
there's really no need.
i'm just a starship captain. you don't think they'd trust me to make these kinds of decisions on my own?
we'll wait for you to confirm whatever you have to.
get me starfleet command.
i can't get through. that ship's jamming all our comm. frequencies.
just a transport captain.
they're charging weapons.
polarise the hull plating.
what the hell is he doing? hail him.
he's not answering.
port hull plating's offline.
"they're closing, fast."
aft torpedoes. return fire.
no effect. they're using some kind of energy shielding.
"direct hit to engineering, subsection 12. we've taken damage."
would the phase cannons be more effective?
"undoubtedly, but we can't fire them at warp."
"what do you mean, we can't fire them at warp?"
"particle discharge, sir. it would destabilize our warp field and most likely blow out both our nacelles. i've been working on the problem, but i haven't quite"
drop to impulse. deploy the aft cannon.
i've got a lock.
fire.
their shields are failing.
see what you can do about their engines.
"they're dead in the water, sir."
not dead enough.
"resume course, warp four."
"aye, sir."
"any idea what that was all about?  well, i think we know someone who might."
we were asked to pick you up and deliver you to a vulcan ship. no one said anything about getting shot at.
you have no idea who they were?
obviously they weren't sent by the council on mazar.
then who sent them?
i have no answers for you.
"ambassador, we're here at the request of the vulcan high command. it would be illogical for you to withhold information from us."
there are diplomatic matters at stake here which do not concern you. to tell you any more would only put your ship and your crew at greater risk.
how much greater could it get? a few more volleys from that ship would have ruptured our hull.
"i'm sorry, captain."
"so am i. you're leaving me no choice, ambassador. archer to mayweather."
go ahead.
"change of plans, travis. lay in a course back to mazar."
sir?
you heard me.
"aye, sir."
you're under strict orders to transport me to the sh'raan.
"it's more than two days to the rendezvous point, and there could be other hostile ships tracking us. unless you can convince me why it's worth risking all our lives."
"the vulcans are raising holy hell about this, jon."
you could always order me to take her to the rendezvous point.
"you're out there, i'm not. it's your call. i just want you to know there'll be repercussions."
they certainly considered the repercussions. they knew someone was after her. why risk one of your own ships when you can risk one of ours?
jon.
"they're doing it to us again, admiral. keeping us in the dark."
have you talked to the ambassador?
i've tried.
maybe she brought this on herself. you did say that she admitted the charges against her were true.
i don't even know what the charges against her are.
"well, i'll talk to soval, see what i can find out."
"you really enjoy this, don't you."
replacing power couplings? hardly.
"no, i mean having people shoot at us."
"if you must know, i much prefer the shooting back part."
i thought this mission was about peaceful exploration.
"i need something to do on this ship, commander."
fair enough. i'm just hoping we don't keep you quite so busy. i read those nuvian masseuses have twelve fingers on each hand.
then i'd say starfleet needs to make its presence known on risa.
i hope i'm not interrupting.
not at all.
we were just talking about my quarters.
i was wondering why they were so sparsely decorated.
"if you need anything, it can be brought to you."
"i don't want to be waited on. and since i doubt i'll be travelling to earth any time soon, i decided to spend a little time with my hosts. thank you for the use of your quarters. you'll have them back soon enough."
pash tah.
pash tah.
sub-commander.
have you tried iced tea?
i don't care for it.
"captain archer certainly does. it's flavoured with passion fruit. an appropriate ingredient for him, don't you think?"
it was the captain that i wanted to speak to you about.
he's a most intriguing man.
he deserves to be told the truth.
"will you join me? please. we'll be back at mazar in a few hours. i'd prefer not to waste that time alone. this must be awkward for you, having a foot in two worlds. loyal to your captain, yet still a vulcan."
you can make things easier for him. the high command has requested his assistance. it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask why.
you believe captain archer can be trusted?
yes.
even though he clearly doesn't trust us?
he's resentful.
why?
he believes we held back their development of warp technology.
"we've kept many things from them, all for good reason."
but situations like this only reinforce their resentment. if we expect to continue our relations with humanity we have to earn their trust.
i would not have succeeded at my career for ninety four years without earning people's trust.
i meant no insult.
"of course not. you were simply speaking your mind, as you always have. it was at vulcana regar, wasn't it? during the second ka'tann conference, you approached me during a recess."
you remember.
you were not easy to forget. your questions about my negotiating tactics were quite presumptuous coming from one so young.
i apologise if i acted inappropriately.
"not at all. in fact, your bluntness made me reconsider some of my positions, much as it has now. t'pol, i have something to tell you."
come in.
something wrong?
i took the liberty of speaking with ambassador v'lar.
go on.
any luck?
the ambassador and i spent the last two hours talking. she's even more remarkable than her reputation suggests.
"i don't doubt that, but it doesn't affect my decision."
i believe it should. she's not guilty of the crime she's been accused of.
she told you that?
the charges were fabricated to get her off mazar and divert attention from her actual mission.
which is?
"she can't reveal that, but she's convinced me that it's critical we help her accomplish it."
"i'm sorry t'pol, but i'm going to need more than that."
she also told me that if we return her to mazar she'll be killed.
by who?
she wouldn't tell me.
but you believed her?
yes.
why?
i can't accept that she'd sacrifice a lifetime of accomplishments with an act of criminal misconduct.
it happens all the time.
not to her. we must take her to the sh'raan.
you're asking me to put the lives of everyone on board in jeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours.
"captain, since i've served aboard enterprise i've never asked you for anything. i'm asking for this now. don't return the ambassador to mazar. please.  thank you."
"you've been to risa, haven't you?"
yes.
"well, what's it like?"
a minshara class planet with three moons. its gravity is approximately equal to earth's sea level.
how's the ocean?
i wouldn't know.
any good restaurants?
i'm told there are. it's all in the database.
did you do anything there?
i meditated in an isolation chamber filled with warm alluvial mud.
i imagine that's quite good for the skin.  three ships coming up fast.
"polarise the hull plating. captain, report to the bridge."
"our mazarite friends, sir, and they've brought company."
why didn't we see them coming?
our aft sensors are still out of alignment.
they're targeting our engines.
"we could drop to impulse, use the phase cannons."
and go three against one?  you're familiar with the mazarites. what's their top speed?
comparable to starfleet. i don't believe they've exceeded warp five.
"then let's give them a run for their money. travis, increase speed to warp four point eight."
"aye, sir. warp four point eight."
they're matching our speed and accelerating. warp four point nine.
they're closing to twenty thousand kilometres. fifteen.
archer to engineering.
i was wondering when you were going to call. we're really stoking the boilers down here.
keep shovelling. we're going to four point nine.
"just in case anyone's keeping track, i believe that'll be a starfleet record."
let's celebrate later.
travis.
warp four point nine.
"they're holding at four point nine, sir."
how far to the rendezvous point?
"at this speed, a little over two hours, but i don't think we can hold it that long."
can we get a message through to the vulcans?
the mazarites are still jamming us.
keep trying. that vulcan ship better not be late.
"captain, what's our situation?"
we're being chased by three mazarite ships.
will we reach the sh'raan before they can do any more damage?
i'm not sure.
"in that case, i need to speak with you."
i have to consider the possibility that this mission will fail.
you still haven't told me what this mission is.
"i've been under orders to tell you only what you need to know, but that wasn't the only reason i kept things from you. i didn't trust you. as your mister tucker pointed out, i have been around a long time. i remember when news of your people first reached vulcan. i was fascinated by humanity but worried as well."
you hadn't even met us.
you had just emerged from a global war. the idea that you deemed yourselves ready to join the interstellar community seemed premature.
and a century of good behaviour hasn't changed your mind?
"the mazarites pursuing us are criminals. they are members of an organisation that's infiltrated all levels of government, making themselves wealthy and powerful at the expense of many innocent victims. their methods include eliminating anyone who stands in their way."
and that would include you.
many mazarites want their government purged of this corruption. they asked the vulcan consulate to help them expose these criminals.
and that job fell to you?
"i have been gathering evidence against them. in three months, i will be called to testify. it was decided that until then i would be safer on vulcan."
why couldn't you tell us?
the investigation was considered too sensitive.
and the story of you being recalled in disgrace?
"it was hoped that if my reputation were sullied they would not consider me a credible witness, and they might not come after me."
"obviously, it didn't work."
the corruption ran deeper than i thought.
i appreciate you telling me the truth.
"i can no longer put you and your crew in danger, captain. please drop out of warp. i plan to surrender myself to them."
it hasn't gotten to that yet.
it's the most logical course of action.
"if you've learned anything about humans, you'd know we don't always take the most logical course of action."
"captain, report to the bridge."
they're hailing us.
what's our status?
"holding at warp four point nine, but commander tucker doesn't believe we can sustain it for more than another ten minutes."
"i don't believe they can either, sir. they're releasing drive plasma to keep their warp coils from overloading."
open a channel.
captain. ambassador.
what do you want?
just giving you a friendly warning. are you aware that your engines are overheating?
so are yours.
we have no quarrel with you. give us the vulcan and you'll be free to go.
i have a better idea. why don't you slow down before your engines explode?
why would you risk the lives of your crew for this criminal?
"i've been ordered to deliver her safely to the vulcans, and that's exactly what i plan to do."
they're increasing speed. warp four point nine five.
"they're re-entering weapons range, sir."
archer to engineering.
please tell me you're ready to slow down.
"sorry trip, but we need a little more speed."
i don't know how much more i can give you.
it's called a warp five engine.
on paper.
"we don't have any choice, trip."
"aye, sir."
ambassador.  warp five.
"four point nine three, nine five."
don't take your eyes off that antimatter stream.
"yes, sir."
four point nine seven.
they're matching our speed.
four point nine nine. warp five.
they're still gaining on us.
how far to the vulcan ship?
their jamming signal is disrupting our sensors as well.
then use their last known position and do the math. take a guess.
"if we could maintain our present speed, approximately fifty three minutes."
the mazarites will be in firing range long before then.
what if we could get a message through? tell them to get here as fast as they can.
the sh'raan is capable of warp seven. if we could maintain warp five we'd reach them in twelve minutes.
"hoshi, any way you can get a message through the interference?"
"i don't see how, sir."
there's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use. it's in a lower subspace band. i doubt the mazarites are aware of it.
it's been a few years since i did this.
"if we do get a message through to the vulcans, we don't want the mazarites to see them coming."
"we could try deflecting their jamming signal, sir. use it to blind their sensors as well."
see what you can do.
"aye, sir."
hoshi?
"we may have gotten a message through to them, sir, but i'm not sure."
wouldn't they respond?
tucker to the bridge!
go ahead.
the port injectors just blew!
"we've got to slow down, captain!"
"i got it, i got it."
hoshi?
"the comm. just went down, sir."
they're right on top of us.
how long?
eight minutes.
that's a direct hit to our starboard nacelle.
we're dropping to impulse.
they're hailing us.
how long now?
"if they received our message, another ten minutes."
i thought it was down to eight.
that was before we dropped out of warp.
we can't hold off those ships for that long.
"you've done your best, captain, and i thank you for it, but it's time for me to turn myself over to them."
we just need to buy ten more minutes.
captain.
i want you to go to sickbay.
sickbay?
"i'll explain later. if there was ever a time to start trusting us, this would be it."
put him through.
give us the vulcan.
"you know, i honestly didn't think you'd be able to catch us. just out of curiosity, how fast do your ships go?"
put her on a shuttle and bring her to our lead vessel.
"that could be a problem. our shuttlebay was damaged, thanks to you. i doubt we could launch a shuttlepod until it's repaired. what, what would you have topped out at? warp five point five? warp six? i can't imagine that you can do much more than that. it seemed like your engines were starting to run pretty hot."
prepare to be boarded.
"malcolm, i'm counting on you. t'pol."
okay.
where is she?
your last attack blew out systems across half the ship. power's down in engineering. a plasma conduit exploded on e deck.
i didn't ask for a damage report. where is she?
i was getting to that. her quarters are on e deck. she was no more than ten metres away when the conduit blew.
"her injuries are extensive. plasma burns, neurological trauma."
i want to see her.
this is doctor phlox.
the vulcan?
she's undergoing dermal regeneration.
open it.
"i will not. i don't know what business you have with this woman, but when she was brought in here she became my patient. if i remove her from the imaging chamber prematurely, she'll die."
open it.  yes?
"our sensors just went down, captain."
what's causing it?
enterprise is redirecting our jamming signal.
no!
"report. answer me, what's going on?"
i imagine they have their hands full right about now.
"i believe that's the sh'raan. she's a vulcan combat cruiser. one of their most powerful, if i'm not mistaken."
"sir, the captain of the sh'raan wants to speak to you."
put it up.
"captain archer, are you in any danger?"
you could say that.
"tell the mazarites to turn their weapons over immediately or we'll destroy their ships.  we'll be standing by, captain."
thank you.
we did what we came to do. that's all that matters.
i am sorry to disappoint you. i look forward to adding this incident to my testimony at your trial.
someday i'd like to walk into a room without it seeming like a state visit.
occupational hazard?
i'll be along in a moment.
"thank you, captain. i'm sorry for the trouble i've caused you and your crew."
we're glad we could help.
"i sense a great bond between you. a bond of trust and respect, but also a bond of friendship. i think it bodes well for the future relations of our two peoples."
"goodbye, ambassador."
"live long, and prosper."
"i've got my eye on a place called suraya bay. villas built right into the cliffs. a perfect spot to enjoy a few good books. might even do a little diving when i  computer, pause. archer."
"we're picking up a distress call, captain. it's coming from a vessel approximately two light years to port."
any idea who it is?
"no, sir. should we alter course?"
go ahead. i'll be right there.  looks like your walk on the beach will have to wait.
plasma residue?
your warp injectors were full of it.
i must be more diligent about routine maintenance.
unless you enjoy being adrift in the middle of nowhere.
i'm sorry to inconvenience you something this trivial. be sure to thank mister tucker for his time.
he wanted me to thank you. it isn't every day he gets to tinker with alien engines. we also found a microfracture on your starboard hull. they're sealing it now.
"oh, your crew is very thorough."
we were glad to help.
do you answer every distress call you pick up?
if we can.
the galaxy could use more people like you.
tomorrow you'll join me in my home. bring commander tucker. i'll prepare a meal in your honour. it's the least i can do to show my gratitude.
"that's very generous, but i promised my crew a trip to risa."
"that can wait one more day, can't it?"
"if i put them off much longer, i'm going to have a mutiny on my hands."
there's going to be a geskana match. i doubt you've ever seen anything like it.
geskana?
"yes. you might want to participate, assuming you enjoy competition. i should warn you, captain, i am easily offended."
send me the coordinates. i'll break the news to my crew.
dress for warm weather.
"if it's all the same to you, captain i'll sit this one out."
it's not like you to pass up an away mission.
"well, i'm up to my ears in work. the impulse manifolds need to be purged, the gravity plating on c deck still isn't aligned."
trip.
"desert, sir? the heat, the dry air. you know how it sucks the life out of me."
what about the two weeks we spent in australia? we had a great time.
survival training in the outback? drinking recycled sweat and eating snake meat? that's your idea of a great time?
"it's not going to be like that. i get the feeling zobral's a man who likes to indulge his guests. he's promised to roll out the red carpet for us. it'll be more fun than purging impulse manifolds. well, suit yourself. i'll see if malcolm's interested. but i was hoping you'd enjoy spending some time with your captain."
promise i won't have to eat any snake meat?
it's hotter than hell out there. forty one degrees.
it's a dry heat.
welcome.
good to be here. you remember commander tucker.
"yes, of course, of course. this is the man who repaired my ship. a brilliant engineer."
it was just a couple of clogged injectors.
"oh, you are far too modest. well, i hope you're hungry. i've prepared quite a feast."
are there many deserts on your world?
"quite a few, but none as big as this one."
"from orbit, you'd think the entire planet's nothing but sand."
"oh well, we have a handful of lakes and small seas. what about earth?"
two thirds water.
extraordinary. more wine?
please.
what's that called again?
yalasat. it's made from a cactus that grows in the northern foothills. how was your roast teracaq?
"it's very good. when trip and i did our survival training, in the desert, we never ate this well."
i must have lost about three kilos during that last week. the heat always takes away my appetite.
doesn't seem to be bothering you now.
i guess i'm getting acclimated.
it must be difficult adjusting to new cultures.
"it's challenging at times, but that's why we're out here."
did you ever think of turning back?
"only once. we were attacked by a hostile species with a lot more firepower than enterprise. i set a course back to earth to upgrade our weapons, but we ended up having to do the repairs ourselves."
they haven't bothered us since.
sounds like you've had an eventful journey.
it's had its share of surprises.
"well, perhaps your visit here will be one of them.  oh, you're going to enjoy this."
looks delicious. what is it?
blood soup. i don't usually eat this well but i promised your captain an exceptional meal.
what are these little chunks?
"the essence of the male, chopped, and seasoned."
beautiful tapestries.
thank you. which do you prefer?
that one's interesting.
it's yours.
"no, no, no. i couldn't."
please. consider it a gift.
"you're far too generous. besides, i wouldn't have any place to hang it."
something smaller then.
"i know you will appreciate this. a suliban made it. a suliban i met several years ago. interesting people, don't you agree?"
thank you.
the geskana match is about to begin. i'm hoping you will honour us by participating.
now? i just ate half a teracaq.
you will be glad you did. geskana requires a great deal of strength.
think you're ready?
"i'll give it a shot, captain."
i can't promise we'll win any trophies.
this is an ideal game for men like you.
thanks.
we're being hailed.
the captain?
no. it's coming from a city on the far side of the desert.
put it through. this is enterprise.
"several hours ago, you launched a small vessel to an encampment in the cygniai expanse. would you tell me why?"
our captain and chief engineer were invited.
by whom?
a man named zobral. and you are?
chancellor trellit. why are you in contact with this man?
"his ship was damaged and we assisted him. in return, he offered his hospitality."
hospitality? i hope you're aware that most likely you'll never see your captain or engineer again.
you all right?
never better.
"open, open up. block out. here, here. here, here. get in front of him. cut him off. now."
so close.
two centimetres to the right and you'd have had it.
next time i'll set you up with a no-look pass.
all right.
archer.
"i need to speak to you, captain."
can it wait? we're a little busy at the moment.
it's urgent. are you alone?
hold on a minute.  it's my science officer. she says it's important. do you mind?
take your time.
catch your breath.
what's the problem?
i've been contacted by a government official in a city about two hundred kilometres from where you are now. he claims that you're in danger.
what kind of danger?
according to him
zobral and his men are terrorists.
they've been responsible for numerous attacks on civilian targets within the city.
"maybe i'm wrong, but they don't seem like terrorists to me."
"perhaps not, but until we're certain who they are, i suggest you return to the ship."
we're on our way.
i hope everything is all right.
the problem with being a starship captain is you're never really off duty. i'm afraid we have to cut our visit short.
"oh, i'm sorry to hear that."
hat's going on?
problem with the starboard engine. t'pol says she needs us up there right away.
can't we at least finish this quarter?
remember those impulse manifolds you said needed purging? you were right.
"well, thanks for one hell of a game."
you must have other people that can correct this problem.
i wish we did.
"as i said, captain, i am easily offended."
"we'll come back if there's time, i promise."
"you should not believe the torothans. i have just been informed that we picked up a lengthy transmission between your vessel and chancellor trellit. whatever he told your science officer it is not true. i wanted this to wait till later, but i beg you, let me explain the real reason why i asked you here. you have a reputation for being fair, a man of great integrity. when you hear what i have to say, i am certain you will want to help us."
it is called a yrott. the word means to stand apart. when we lived in the cities we were forced to wear these whenever we walked in public.
i take it those days are over.
"when the caste system was finally abolished, we were led to believe that everyone would be treated equally. i remember the celebrations. yrotts being burned in the streets. people saying that we had finally been granted our rights. the torothan clan signed the accord, but they never abided by it. they still control the government, the lands, the resources, everything. we spent ten years staging protests, appealing to the courts, until finally we realised there was only one way to get their attention. we have hundreds of camps just like this one all across the desert, and we are going to keep attacking the torothans until our voices are heard. they call us terrorists, but the truth is they have been terrorising us for centuries."
you said you brought me down here for a reason. i have a feeling it wasn't to hear a history lesson.
the torothans have ten times as many soldiers as we do. we won't last much longer without your help.
i really don't see what i can do for you.
"they said you would be humble. i scanned your vessel. you have an arsenal of powerful weapons, but more importantly, i need your wisdom. our current strategy isn't working, but i am confident that together we can find one that does. i would be honoured to fight alongside you, as would all of my men."
what the hell was that?
torothan cruisers. usually they begin their bombardment after dark. they're getting started early today.
"i don't know what you've heard about me, but i think you've been misled."
what about the suliban?
what about them?
"you liberated a detention camp, freed thousands of prisoners."
who told you that?
a suliban transport captain. he told me of an explorer who was also a great warrior. a man who helped them defeat an entire army. captain jonathan archer.
"two cruisers, sir. they've hit one of our pulse cannons."
prepare my ship. this won't last more than a few hours. we'll continue this discussion later.
"if it's all the same to you, we'd rather get back to enterprise."
"oh, your shuttle's thrusters would draw their attention. you'd become an easy target. please. i wouldn't be a very good host if i allowed you to get killed."
there's a number of ships strafing the encampment.
hail the captain.
archer.
"captain, are you all right?"
we've taken shelter. should be
that's the best i can give you. the entire region is flooded with jamming signals.
"well, we can't just leave them down there. what about the transporter?"
i can't localise their biosigns. i'll take a shuttlepod and find them myself.
in the middle of an assault?  see if you can find chancellor trellit.
archer to enterprise. enterprise. respond.  rough game.
that damn midfielder knocked me down three times during the last quarter. i must've bruised half a dozen ribs.
better have doctor phlox take a look at it when we get back.
"so, does the great warrior have any ideas about how we're getting out of here? you're not thinking about helping these people?"
"i was thinking about those suliban prisoners. if we hadn't helped them escape, we wouldn't be in this situation."
t'pol's ears must be burning. want your chief engineer's advice?
what is it?
"walk away. they lured us down here under false pretenses, and now they're asking us to help them fight a war? that's a lot different than breaking a few innocent people out of prison."
there's just one problem. zobral. i get the feeling he's not going to take no for an answer.
come on.
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather take my chances out in that desert."
i thought you hated the desert.
not tonight.
you neglected to mention that you'd be attacking the encampment.
and you assured me your people would be leaving the surface. why didn't they?
captain archer wanted to speak with zobral.
interesting. where are they now?
"i don't know. if you'd be willing to end your assault, we could launch a search party."
you expect us to stand by while you send more people to join zobral?
"if you believe we're assisting the terrorists, you're mistaken."
"of course, i forgot. they just went down for the hospitality."
let us find them and we'll leave immediately.
that's what you promised before. we'll locate your men ourselves and deal with them accordingly. that's assuming they haven't already been killed.
chancellor.
"if you attempt to launch another shuttlecraft, we'll have no choice but to consider it as an enemy vessel."
i've lost sensor contact with the surface. some kind of orbital dispersion field. i can't get any readings below a hundred kilometres.
two men out in the open. you'd think they would have spotted us by now. we're down here!
you're going to have to yell a little louder than that.
you sure we're going in the right direction?
it was east of the camp. we're heading east.
how far?
about thirty kilometres.
thirty? what if we find more of zobral's men inside?
it looked abandoned.
all i saw was sand. i don't remember any buildings.
that's because you forgot your survival training. take a good look on your way in at your surroundings.
didn't they also say something about only walking at night? can't we wait until it cools down a little?
that could be for another eight or nine hours. we need to find shelter.
"twenty minutes, captain."
trip.
ten?
to cherry-flavoured snow cones. what i wouldn't give for one right about now.
you hear that?
what?
it sounds like a ship.
i think the heat's getting to you.
"no, listen. over there. a shuttlepod?"
no. something a lot bigger.
you all right?
yeah.
"the dispersion field covers half the continent, but if i disable these three satellites, i think i can get a clear reading of the eastern desert."
that might provoke the torothans. i suggest you try to find a less intrusive way to penetrate their defenses.
"why montana? of all the places the vulcans could have landed they chose bozeman, montana."
humanity's first warp drive was developed there. it seemed a logical place to begin.
"well, how did they know it wouldn't alarm other nations? an alien species makes contact with the united states. it could have made a lot of other countries nervous."
what's your point?
"it seems to me that we're going to run into similar problems. we get invited to dinner, and before you know it we're accused of taking sides in a war."
"contacting new worlds always involves unexpected risks. the high command has very specific protocols regarding planetary conflicts. eventually, captain archer will have to create some directives of his own."
come on. come on. we got to keep moving. come on.
my shift doesn't begin for another six hours.
we're almost there.
where? where are we going?
nice little place i know. plenty of shade.
are there blankets down there? i'm freezing.
heat exhaustion. here. come here.
"here. there you go. easy, easy."
here take mine. go ahead.
"no, sir. i won't take another man's water."
you drink it. that's an order.
got to keep moving.
"take the water, or i'll knock you on your ass and pour it down your throat.easy."
thanks.
there's a vessel approaching from the surface. it's zobral.
he's hailing us.
"open your launch doors, quickly."
is the captain with you? commander tucker?
"no, no. i'll explain once i'm aboard."
where are they?
"if i'm not in your docking bay in the next thirty seconds, i'll be detected. they'll destroy my ship."
bring him in.
how many?
"there were eighty nine. there were only eighty nine suliban, not thousands."
and the army you defeated?
"i would hardly call it an army. it was more like a few dozen prison guards, and to be honest they didn't put up much of a fight."
"jonathan archer is an excellent starship captain, but he's hardly the invincible warrior described to you."
what about his legendary desert tactics?
"actually, i'm the tactical officer on this ship, and i don't have any experience at waging desert warfare. i'm afraid you've come to the wrong people for help."
all this for nothing.
what about our people?
you have far better sensors than we do. i'm sure you'll find them.
our sensors are being disrupted and the torothans have threatened to fire on us if we launch a shuttlepod.
how did you get here without them seeing you?
"there was a narrow gap in their orbital detection grid. it occurs once every forty six minutes, but it is only open for less than one minute."
i'll need all the pertinent data.
ha! you'll need more than that. the manoeuvres are extremely difficult. it took us years to learn them.
i'm a quick study.
you will be shot down before you reach the atmosphere.
with you at the helm our chances would improve.
i don't have time. my men are waiting for me.
then they'll have to wait a little longer. you're the one that got our people stranded down there.
they are not my responsibility!
"you're mistaken. the torothans believe we've joined your cause. if captain archer and commander tucker are apprehended, they'll undoubtedly be treated as members of your clan. they'll become victims of the same oppression you've been fighting all these years. you should feel as responsible for those two men as you do for your own."
easy.
"home, sweet home."
i hope you're not planning to hog that all for yourself.
water's off the menu.
"now, this is my idea of a great time."
"what'd you do, rub two sticks together?"
"i found a new use for the stun setting. it may not taste too good, but i think i boiled away anything that can hurt us."
no thanks. i'm not thirsty.
let's not get into that argument again.
worse than blood soup.
you need water.
what i need is sleep.
"you've got a fever, trip. your heart's racing, you've got all the symptoms of heatstroke. if you fall asleep, you could lapse into a coma."
a coma? that sounds nice.
"when we get back to enterprise you can sleep all you want, but right now, you got to stay with me and drink this water. if i had a needle i'd give it you intravenously, but i don't. come on, sit up. here you go. good. commander."
"aye, captain."
the warp reactor. break it down for me.
what?
what are the eight major components?
you got to be kidding me.
name them. that's an order.
"well, there's the drumsticks, thighs, wings. you got anything to eat around here?"
"not at the moment, but when we get back to enterprise i'll have chef make you a dinner you'll never forget. what would you like? anything."
not snake meat.
"no, chef doesn't do snake very well. tell me what you want."
prime rib.
"okay, what else?"
mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy. the kind he makes on wednesday nights.
"no problem. what kind of vegetables? hey, vegetables?"
broccoli.
dessert?
pecan pie.
take another pass over the eastern basin.
our sensors would have detected them.
"no, there's magnetic deposits below that basin. they could be masking their biosigns."
if we increased our altitude this would go a lot faster.
we would also risk being detected.
geography. do you know how to play?
geography?
"you know, you say amazon river, which ends in an r and then i say rhode island."
we're going to rhode island?
"no. no, it's a game. you're supposed to tell me some place that starts with a d."
"oh, d. er, draylax."
x? x.
there's always
"no, no, don't tell me. i know an x. xanadu."
that's not a real place.
it doesn't matter.
of course it matters.
"you just used an alien planet, draylax."
"easy, easy, easy, easy, easy."
"all right, whatever you say. xanadu's fine."
get your head down!
what?
get down!
we got to get out of here. come on.
i'm picking up weapons fire on the surface. ninety kilometres due south.
a torothan mortar.
would they be targeting one of your settlements?
we don't have any near there.
set a course and prepare to fire. i believe they've located the captain and commander tucker.
come on. come on.
i've got a lock.
fire.
i see them. two humans bearing one one five mark three.
i'm just slowing you down. go.
i don't remember taking orders from you.
my launch window opens in nine minutes. i should be going. i hope commander tucker is going to be all right.
"i doubt i'll ever convince him to set foot on another desert, but he'll be fine. zobral, even if i were the warrior you thought i was, that's not why we're out here."
captain. sub-commander.
"what you told him was correct. decisions to get involved in the conflicts of other worlds should be left to governments, and not starship captains."
"i know. the irony is, i have the feeling his cause is worth fighting for."
it'd be a shame to deprive any of your people.
"we appreciate your hospitality, but a minimal number of crewmembers need to stay on board."
"if you add a few days to your stay, you could give everyone a chance to enjoy themselves. the additional charge would be minimal."
"it's tempting, but we need to keep some dilithium to run our engines."
"don't be so sure. after two days and nights on risa you may never want to leave. i see your crew has chosen a wide variety of locales and activities that should keep them very entertained, but i see you won't be joining us, sub-commander."
i've visited risa before. it seemed appropriate to give someone else a chance.
"well, i'm sorry. as i'm sure you remember, we have many diversions designed for our vulcan guests."
"so, this covers everything?"
the package is all-inclusive.
"everything? you know, food, drinks, souvenirs."
"trust me, mister tucker.  no one will go away disappointed."
"if anything happens, you know where to reach me."
i don't anticipate any problems.
"well, it's the problems you don't anticipate."
"the crew is trained to handle emergencies, but i'll alert you immediately if there are any problems."
this doesn't feel right. i shouldn't be going down to some pleasure planet while half the crew has to stay onboard.
everyone drew lots. you had the same chance as the others.
all the same the crew should come first.
"captain, you need a vacation."
"i'm glad you decided to take some time off, sir."
wouldn't miss it.
"do you want to take the helm, captain?"
i'm on vacation.
thanks.
enjoy yourselves.
i'll bring you a souvenir.
everyone have big plans? travis?
"rock-climbing, sir. there's a place called galartha. the cliff face changes pitch while you climb it."
that sounds kind of dangerous.
"well, if it's easy, what's the point?"
just watch yourself. malcolm.
"well, supposedly risa's very cosmopolitan. there are species visiting from all over."
malcolm and i plan to broaden our cultural horizons.
is that all you two think about?
"well, how we choose to relax is our own business."
"you watch yourselves, too."
"i plan on doing something constructive with my time. i have been relying on the universal translator far too much. before i left earth, i learned thirty eight languages and now all i do is push a button and the computer does all the work."
isn't that what it's for?
not this time. i left my translator on enterprise.
"you only have two days, hoshi. if you want to waste your time talking to people."
"what about you, captain?"
"i've never been much for vacations, but i've got a little villa overlooking the ocean, and porthos and i are going to relax."
how long will this last?
"i usually require six days per year, but two should leave me sufficiently refreshed."
i've adjusted the dosage to wake you up in exactly forty eight hours.
and if someone should require medical attention during your hibernation?
crewman cutler is a capable medic.
i know where the bandages are.
"you can always wake me if you need to, but please, only if it's an emergency.  well, to bed."
"pleasant dreams, doctor."
"what do you think, porthos? not bad."
"come here, let's go. what are you barking at?"
what about that one?
now i know you've been cooped up on a starship for too long.
what's wrong with her?
"well, nothing, i suppose. i just wouldn't know which eyes to look into. hey, hey, hey, hey. now, she's interesting."
"i don't think she is the right pronoun, but if you think it's worth the risk."
i don't know. maybe i should have brought my scanner with me.
thank you.
that's a she.
what shall we drink to?
"to us, and to a well-earned two days and two nights."
"how'd you get up here? stop it, you two. porthos.  come in!"
"i'm sorry to bother you, but i think my dog is on your deck."
please.
there you are.
i hope she didn't hurt
porthos.
"hello, porthos. she's been cooped up for weeks. i should have known she'd run off the first chance she got."
no harm done. she probably just came over to make a friend. i'm jonathan.
keyla.
"so, is this your first time to risa?"
yes. you?
"first time. my science officer felt i needed to relax so i decided to do some reading, let porthos run on the beach."
you should always listen to your science officer.
she'd be the first to agree with you. i was about to go out for dinner. can you recommend a restaurant?
"there's this little boat that sails into the bay every evening just after sunset. you wade out, and they serve seafood right off the deck."
sounds great.
"well, i'm sorry to disturb you. thanks again."
"if you don't have other plans, maybe we could wade out to that little boat together."
you're not here with your science officer?
no.
"in that case. oh, no, i'm sorry. i can't tonight."
just a thought.
tomorrow?
i look forward to it.
"so do i. goodbye, porthos."
tikara.
tikara.
it's a beautiful night.
you've obviously never been here before.
why do you say that?
the nights are always beautiful.
slowly please. i'm just learning risan.
really? most people wouldn't bother.
when i go someplace i like to learn the language.
how long will you be here?.
just today and tomorrow.
you've never spoken risan before today?.
na. no. how am i doing?
exceptionally. you hardly have any accent.
sara.
it's been nice talking to you.
we're attending the festival of the moons tonight. you should go if you have the time.
"thank you, i'll try."
goodnight.
goodnight.
ikara.
ikara.
"i don't mean to be rude, but i overheard your conversation."
oh.
you're very adept at languages
it's my job. i'm the communications officer on a starship. shikara hoshi. my name is hoshi
ravis.
may i?  how many languages do you speak?
about forty.
have you ever heard one you couldn't learn?
not yet. klingon was hard. it took me months to master the conjugations.
do you think you could learn my language?
where are you from?
that's the name of your planet? say it slower.
you can't say it slower. it changes the meaning.
try it again.
don't feel bad. my own people can barely speak it properly.
i'm not ready to give up. will you teach me?
it could take a while. i was about to have dinner. will you join me?
that place up the street looked pretty lively.
"well, the vulcan database said no one leaves this club unhappy."
how would the vulcans know? they only mate once every seven years.
that's what they say.
do you know something i don't?
"come on, seven years? i doubt even t'pol could hold out that long."
"oh, she's very disciplined."
"malcolm, bearing one eight zero."
what?
behind you.
anything in that database that could help us get a conversation going?
if you wanted to have a cultural dialogue you should have gone with hoshi.
hello.
hello.
"i'm dee'ahn, and this is latia."
i'm trip.
i'm malcolm. would you join us for a drink?
we've been waiting for you to ask.
"well, what would you like?"
these look good.
"another round, please."
"so, where are you two from?"
our planet's called earth.
earth? never heard of it.
we're sort of new to the neighbourhood.
"well, then we'll have to make sure that your first visit to risa is memorable."
jonathan? you're up late.
just looking at the stars.
don't you get enough of that on your ship?
never.
will you show me what you're looking at?
come on up.
i wanted to thank you. the little boat with the seafood? best i've ever had.
i'm sorry you had to eat alone.
no problem. i had a nice chat with a couple from vega reticuli. it turns out it's their three hundredth wedding anniversary.
"well, they must have a lot of stories."
you can't imagine. there it is.
what am i looking for?
see the bright blue star at the top?
is that your sun?
"no, look just below. the yellow one. do you see it?"
it's so faint.
it's about ninety light years from here.
you're a long way from home.
"actually, this is the farthest any of my people have ever gone."
you're an explorer. i wouldn't be surprised if they're naming schools after you back on your world.
archer elementary. it has a nice ring to it. can you show me where you're from?
"oh, i really don't have a very good sense of direction."
"oh, i'm sure it's not that bad."
i got lost coming back from the lobby today.
"well, i can see how that could happen. i mean, it's at least a hundred metres from here."
and all the villas look the same.
you've just got to notice the subtle differences.
like the numbers on the doors.
now you're catching on. give me a couple hours i could have you navigating a starship.
why don't you start by telling me about some of the places you've been. we'll get to the starship navigation later.
"we only had a few hours of air, left so i jettisoned our engine and blew it up. turned it into a rescue flare."
it was my idea.
doesn't matter whose idea it was. it worked.
why don't you tell them about the time you saved enterprise in your underwear.
i saved the captain's life.
i thought you were the captain.
we rotate. he's captain next week.
"so, captains, have you seen the subterranean gardens?"
subterranean?
all the plants that grow there are luminescent. it's beautiful.
maybe you could show us.
through here.
this is a strange way to get to the garden.
"they're very secluded. so, how much do starship captains get paid on your world?"
excuse me?
what kind of valuables do you have?
i think there's been a misunderstanding.
there's definitely been a misunderstanding.
see what they have.
i hope this isn't their mating ritual.
quiet! nothing.
maybe they have something back in their rooms.
it's too risky. we could sell their clothes.
"listen, i bet we could make some kind of a deal."
enterprise.
"it's travis, sub-commander. could you send a shuttlepod down?"
"what's the problem, ensign?"
i had a little rock-climbing accident.
where are you?
"in the central hospital, but i really want to get back to enterprise."
"the fun part is the way the rock face changes. the problem is the handholds change, too."
why didn't you let them finish treating you on the surface?
have you ever been to an alien hospital?
"yes, in san francisco."
"well, these people have never treated a human before. i wanted my own doctor. where's phlox?"
he's not available.
"what do you mean, he's not available?"
he's sleeping.
"well, wake him up. he's got a patient."
the doctor is hibernating.
hibernating? for how long?
just a couple of days. don't worry. i can handle a broken leg.
he said he was having trouble breathing when we were in the pod.
did they give you any medication?
just a hypospray for the pain. is something wrong?
"oh, it's probably nothing. let's get you to sickbay."
morning.
"i don't know if it was those risan mai-tais or getting shot, but my head's killing me."
it was probably both. the sun's up. we've been down here all night.
great. our shore leave's half over. hey! we need some help down here! hello?
i already tried it. club's closed.
i don't plan on spending our entire trip tied up in a basement.
the vulcan database didn't mention anything about crime.
they said it was very rare.
what?
"it had some warnings, but i didn't think it'd be a problem."
wonderful.
you think this is my fault.
you were willing to follow two strange aliens into a basement.
"gorgeous aliens. don't forget, they were gorgeous."
they were male!
not at first! i don't remember twisting your arm.
"if we don't make it to the loading zone on time, they're going to start scanning for our biosigns. do you want the captain to find us like this?"
i feel terrible.
you're having a reaction to the painkiller they gave you.
what's his condition?
"if the swelling gets any worse, it could begin to constrict his airway."
"i've spoken to the hospital. they've never heard of a reaction like this, but they're not familiar with human physiology."
i really think we should wake up doctor phlox.
i'm sorry. i give up. i never thought that i'd hear a language i couldn't learn.
don't feel bad. you've only been trying for one day.
it only took you one day to pick up english.
"it is much simpler, and you are a very good primari."
teacher.
what do you call this?
"oh, we don't have anything exactly like it. the closest thing would be a strawberry."
strawberry. and this?
it tastes like a kiwi. what?
"in my language, kee'hwi is, er."
what?
i don't know the word. may i show you?
sure. why not?
kee'hwi.
kiss. that's called a kiss.
a kiss. there's a place i was planning to go today. a steam pool. they say it's very relaxing. would you like to go?
avec plaisir. that's french.
what does it mean?
good morning.
good morning. come in.
i thought we could take our dogs to the beach if you don't have other plans.
sounds great. i just ordered breakfast. would you like to join me?
certainly.
juice?
please. what are you reading?
it's a gift from my science officer. her people think humans are too controlled by their emotions.
i knew there was a reason i liked you.
"seems like you know a lot about me. where i'm from, what books i read. i don't even know your dog's name."
it's rhylo. i adopted her when she was a puppy. anything else?
everything else. what's your planet called? what do you do? do you have a family?
we've been having such a wonderful time. i really don't want to spoil it.
how could you spoil it?
"i did have a family. they were killed. my parents, my brother, my husband."
i'm sorry.
it was our own fault. we'd been warned about the suliban. we should have gotten out while we had the chance.
suliban?
you know about them?
yes.
i'm not so sure this is a good idea.
there's no need to whisper. he's in a state of deep hibernation.
"yeah, that's what i'm worried about."
did you use the correct dosage?
"do'sani! do'sani, yo-to aruda!"
phlox?
i don't care what it tastes like.
"wake up, doctor."
sub-commander. has it been forty eight hours?
no.
then why did you wake me?
there's a medical emergency.
emergency? then call the doctor.
you're the doctor.
of course. who's sick?
ensign mayweather.
who?
"ensign mayweather, our helmsman."
i know who he is. where is he?
he's in sickbay.
we're not in sickbay?
we're in your quarters.
"well then, to sickbay."
"i could use some assistance, please."
"what seems to be the trouble, captain?"
"it's travis, doctor."
he's having some kind of anaphylactic reaction.
incredible.
what?
i've been standing up for almost five minutes.
doctor.
"hand me that scanner, captain."
"ah, yes, yes. it's definitely being caused by an antigenic compound in his system. we'll need regulan blood worms."
what?
they're excellent at filtering toxins.
"er, which container are they in?"
"no, fresh ones would be better."
"set a course for regulus, maximum warp."
"doctor, i think this was a mistake. you should return to your quarters."
"i appreciate the offer, but it would be best to keep our relationship professional."
"let's go, doctor."
i am the chief medical officer on this ship and i am going to treat ensign mayweather. then i'm going back to bed.
"this was waiting for me when i checked in, compliments of the management. i don't know anything about risan vintages, but what do you say we throw caution to the wind and give it a try?"
i'll be adventurous if you will.
how's your ankle?
it's getting better.
you'd think that guide would have warned us.
"oh, the water was very shallow. i should have watched where i was stepping."
i don't know. that thing was pretty well camouflaged. to risan sea turtles.
it's a little sweet for my taste.
is something wrong?
camouflaged. we could only see them when they moved.
was there more than one?
i'm not talking about turtles. you said you knew who they were. have you seen them? did they hurt anyone that you cared about?
"we've seen them a number of times, but we've been lucky. no one was badly hurt."
how do you fight something you can't even see? i was told that they take their orders from the future.
is that right?
"all their genetic enhancements, they were taught to do that by someone from the distant future."
who told you that?
"it's no secret. they've attacked dozens of ships, settlements. but where do they come from? where do they live?"
"i wish i could tell you, but i don't know."
what are they planning to do next?
"hopefully, neither of us will ever run into them again."
"you know that isn't true. they keep enlisting more of their people into the, what do they call it? the cabal. you must know something about them, jonathan."
"i realise that they murdered your family, and i'm very sorry for that, but i'm not sure what you want me to tell you."
"most of what i have learned about them has come from rumours and hearsay, but you have seen them face to face. i want you to tell me what you know. where are their helixes? where do they live?"
"if this wine is too sweet, i think there's another bottle here. it might be different."
you're the first person i've met in over a year who's had any contact with them.
"all right. i don't know much, but i'll tell you what i can. i could use some fresh air. why don't we take a walk on the beach?"
thank you.
it's kind of chilly. you might want to go get a sweater or something.
i'll be right back.
archer to enterprise.
this is t'pol.
i'm transmitting a bioscan to you. run it through the computer. i think you'll find a match.
"you don't sound very relaxed, captain."
"quickly, please."
understood.
ready?
not quite.
"your surgeons did a nice job. all the tandarans i met had a very distinctive feature, right here."
tandarans? i don't understand.
i took a bioscan. they may be able to change your face but not your dna. did colonel grat send you?
who?
"i suppose it's possible you don't know him. he ran the detention camp i was sent to. it was filled with innocent suliban. grat asked me the same questions you've been asking, except he was a little more aggressive. on the other hand, he didn't try to win my sympathy with fictitious tragedies."
"you're wrong, jonathan. you're all wrong. i think i should leave."
"if it wasn't grat, then who was it? who sent you here? who was it?"
i'm sorry. you've been very kind to me. i'm going to check out now. i can't have you interfering.
whatever was in that bottle you broke got all over me. it stinks to high heaven.
it's not like i had a choice. we needed something to cut through those ropes.
good morning.
morning.
sleep well?
very.
any thoughts about what you'd like to do today? risa has a lot to offer.
"i could spend the entire day right here, but i'm afraid the shuttle's coming to pick me up in a few hours."
not a very long vacation.
two days and two nights. that's all we had.
i hope you don't think that i
took advantage of me? not for a minute.
there we go.
you're certain?
"you can check it yourself if you like, doctor. the analysis clearly shows he was given benzethonium chloride. you're quite allergic to it. this should do the trick."
your biosigns are stabilising. it seems to be working.
how do you feel?
"a lot better. thanks, doc."
what's that smell?
i don't smell anything.
i'm guessing you two had an interesting couple of days.
"fascinating culture, sir. what about you, hoshi? do anything constructive?"
"as a matter of fact, i learned several new conjugations."
"you look rested, sir. did you get a good night's sleep?"
went out like a light.
"next time we take shore leave, instead of just sitting around reading books you should try to get out. look for a little excitement, meet new people."
they don't have a problem with us dropping by?
on the contrary. the operations foreman said they haven't had visitors in nearly six months.
"is it really a matriarchal society? i mean, the women make all the decisions?"
"until recently, but in the last decade the paraagan males have made great strides to acquire equal rights."
"still, it would probably be best if we didn't get too flirtatious."
"probably. i read that this colony started off twenty years ago with just thirty miners. now there are over three thousand. they've got schools, landscaped communities, even some kind of museum."
you think twenty years from now there'll be earth colonies out this far? human kids growing up on new sausalito?
if my father were alive he wouldn't doubt it for a minute. we're making history with
"every light year. you know, i think i've heard you say that at least half a dozen times."
archer here.
the paraagans have given us clearance to enter orbit.
have you received their landing protocols?
they're coming in now.
we're on our way.
this should take a bit longer than usual.
it wouldn't be very polite to ignite their atmosphere. when are you supposed to close the plasma ducts?
"the protocol said fifty kilometres, but to be on the safe side i'm going to lock them off at about seventy five."
although the matriarchal elements in the culture have diminished it might be best if i were to ask
"enterprise to shuttlepod one. captain archer, please respond."
did you see that?
the shuttlepod's attitude isn't right.
i'm coming around. bring the grappler online.
hoshi.
not yet. now.
i closed both plasma ducts. i'm certain of it.
are you sure there's nothing left?
"we could see the colony in full magnification, sir. the ground was scorched for at least a hundred kilometres in every direction."
could one of the dampeners been malfunctioning?
i closed both ducts. any kind of malfunction would have triggered an alarm. two alarms. there are backups to prevent these kinds of accidents. the ducts were closed.
this is no time to be placing blame. a thorough investigation should explain what happened. how is he?
"he has a mild concussion, but he should be fine."
have you tried hailing the colony? there has to be someone down there.
"sir, i tried to explain. there's nothing left. no buildings, no trees, no people."
that's impossible. there were thirty six hundred colonists.
have you finished the diagnostics?
i've analysed six of the pod sensor logs. i have two left.
"well, get them done. you've had three hours.  what about the enterprise sensor logs? they must have recorded how much tetrazine was in the atmosphere. was the concentration greater than the paraagans specified? was it present at higher altitudes than it was supposed to be?"
"that's the weird part, sir. the tetrazine levels were less than three parts per million. that's half what the protocol specified."
what about the point of ignition?
"the flash point was directly beneath the shuttle, sir, but it seems to have originated at the starboard plasma duct."
a plasma duct you're certain was closed.
every log on the shuttle indicates that both ducts were sealed and locked.
"then you'd better start re-examining those logs, because something doesn't add up here. get me admiral forrest. this is not going to be fun."
tetrazine?
it's a by-product of their mining operation. it settles between forty five and fifty kilometres in their atmosphere. exhaust plasma is about the only thing hot enough to ignite it.
but you said your plasma ducts were closed.
"yes, sir. we're doing everything we can to determine what went wrong, but that's not going to change the fact that there are thirty six hundred corpses down there."
continue to analyse your logs. i'm going to call an emergency meeting at the command council. you realise they'll undoubtedly bring the vulcans into this. we'll have to figure out who's going to contact the paraagan homeworld.
"that should be my responsibility, sir."
"you're right, it should, but let's take this one step at a time."
how do you tell all those families that
you followed all the protocols that you were given.
"we came here to meet these people, to learn something about them, not to kill them."
"you followed the protocols. you've got a crew that's going to be looking to you to figure out how to react to all this. don't let them down. i'll get back to you soon as i can. i'm sorry, jon."
"his behaviour has been erratic. he seems to alternate between agitation, despondency and guilt. he spends most of his time alone. i've tried to remind him that this was an accident, but his responses have been illogical. he seems to be ignoring his responsibilities as captain."
"ah, to be vulcan. it's been my experience that humans have a great deal of difficulty separating emotional despair from what you call responsibility."
"nevertheless, as his physician you should monitor him closely, to be certain he remains fit for command."
"i understand how uncomfortable his behaviour must be for you, but trust me, it would be unnatural for the captain not to be affected by grief under these circumstances. it's, er, human nature. he'll be fine."
what is it?
"it's admiral forrest, sir."
thank you.
the atmospheric analysis of the probe is coming through.
"put it up here, would you?"
what is it?
the air near the surface is filled with traces of boro-carbons.
"when tetrazine is ignited by plasma exhaust, there's only one outcome you can be sure of."
traces of borocarbons.
you got it.
"i don't care whether that probe picked up traces of bread pudding. both our plasma ducts were locked down, and there were no leaks in the system. not unless they miraculously mended themselves afterwards."
t'pol. trip.
the mission's been cancelled.
cancelled?
"from what the admiral tells me, ambassador soval will use this to convince starfleet that we need another ten or twenty years before we try this again."
twenty years? starfleet won't buy that for a minute.
won't they?
"tell him he's crazy! tell him that's guilt talking, not jonathan archer!"
the vulcan ship will meet us in three days to get you and doctor phlox. please inform mister mayweather to head for these co-ordinates.
i can't believe you're letting them do this to us. you've waited all your life to command this ship.
dismissed.
"but, sir."
i said you're dismissed. both of you.
you think they've replaced you in brazil yet?
"even if they have, they'd take me back. i'm a prodigy, remember? how about you?"
"after a year on enterprise, the thought of a cargo ship is pretty unappealing."
"what if they made you captain? you're going to be the most famous boomer around, you know."
"or maybe infamous. from what commander tucker tells me, people back home think that we're doing nothing out here but getting in trouble."
then it's our job to let the people back home know what really happened. anyone who tries to bad-mouth captain archer in front of me is going to get an earful in any language they want.
lieutenant?
"over here. it's not exactly a smoking gun, but this em signature does not belong here."
where did you find it?
"on the outer hull, about twelve centimetres below the starboard plasma duct."
it might simply be boro-carbons formed by the explosion.
"i already checked. there isn't a carbon atom to be found. whatever it is, its profile doesn't match anything in our database."
come in. what was so important it couldn't wait till morning?
"if you'd prefer, i'll come back."
"no, i'm sorry. what have you got?"
lieutenant reed and his team have discovered an unidentified em signature on the ventral hull of shuttlepod one.
it could be anything.
mister reed felt you'd be interested.
"in what? does he think that starfleet command's going to take a look at this, apologise, and send us on our way? tell him it was a nice try."
is this what humans refer to as feeling sorry for themselves?
"you're out of line, sub-commander."
i apologise.
"i wish i was simply feeling sorry for myself, but actually, i'm feeling sorry for a whole lot of people. every member of starfleet, in fact. their futures depended upon my ability to succeed at this mission."
"as soon as we learned about the consequences of the explosion, i knew the vulcan high command would take advantage of the situation."
what's your point?
you have a responsibility to dispute their recommendation.
"starfleet already bought their recommendation. hook, line and sinker."
then you have a responsibility to convince them as well.
and how do you suggest i do that?
"you are very adept at listing the questionable decisions you've made, but there have been other decisions, many of them, that no one would question. i'm willing to try to convince my government of that. are you willing to try to convince yours?"
"you know, this has got to be the first time a vulcan has ever attempted to cheer up a human."
i'll see you in the morning.
"that's all right, commander. your company is appreciated, but it would be best if you left the packing to me."
i would have thought you'd be a little more upset about leaving enterprise.
"well, i did expect this posting would last a while longer, but i'm sure an equally adventurous opportunity will present itself."
i wish i had your attitude.
humans seem to be naturally optimistic. i'm surprised you don't share my outlook that something exciting always waiting around the next nebula.
that's just the point. there won't be any nebulas in starfleet's future. at least not for a decade or so.
"oh, i wouldn't be so sure of that."
"you're wrong, doc. you worked with vulcans. you know what they think of us. enterprise coming back to earth with it's tail tucked between its legs. it'll be soval's crowning achievement. they'll probably give the son of a bitch some gaudy medal and then cart him off to wherever they send bitter old vulcans to retire."
ambassador soval's service record contains an impressive list of accomplishments.
"you have to find something good in everybody, don't you. i got to tell you, that's one of your unique qualities that drives me crazy."
"i'll certainly miss your outspoken personality, mister tucker."
"i'll see you later, doc."
"come on, porthos. time for bed."
"porthos, up. what's the matter, boy? don't tell me you're"
porthos? what's going on here?  hello?
"sorry to call so late, captain, but all three inspection pods are getting their weekly overhauls tonight. they tell me they won't be ready till noon, so i figured you might want to sleep in."
"might want to sleep in. what do you say to breakfast at nine thirty, spacedock cafeteria?"
you must be reading my mind. i was just about to suggest the same thing.
"see you in the morning.  if you're trying to tell me the last ten months was a dream, i'm not buying it."
"ime,. can i help you?"
"this is captain jonathan archer, starfleet authorisation alpha six four"
"i know who you are, captain. what can i do for you?"
do you have a denobulan doctor in the interspecies medical exchange?
"yes, a doctor phlox. he's assigned to starfleet medical here in san francisco. would you like me to contact him for you?"
"no, that's all right. thanks for your help."
i didn't even know phlox existed before they brought klaang in. and that was the day after the late night call from trip.
"you're not dreaming, captain."
daniels.
"this must be very disorienting. i apologise, but i had no choice."
"commander tucker told me you were dead, that silik killed you."
"he did, in a manner of speaking. we have to talk, captain, and it's essential that none of the other factions know about it. i doubt any of them would think i'd bring you here."
"so, you're telling me you brought me back, what, ten months ago? how about jonathan archer ten months ago? where's he?"
he's you.
then who just climbed into bed aboard enterprise?
that hasn't happened yet.
that's a load of crap and you know it.
i've had this same conversation with half a dozen people. it always ends up the same way.
can't you ever give a straight answer?
it depends on the question.
"all right, try this one. why am i here? i thought you were supposed to protect the timeline, not screw with it."
"it's already been screwed with, captain. that explosion at the paraagan colony, it wasn't supposed to happen."
"of course, it wasn't. it was an accident."
that's not what i mean. history never recorded the disaster. someone violated the temporal accord. someone who doesn't want your mission to succeed.
are you telling me that enterprise didn't cause that explosion?
do you remember the temporal cold war i spoke of?
it's kind of hard to forget.
then listen to me carefully. we don't have much time.
"all senior staff report to the situation room in fifteen minutes. mister reed, i'd like you in my quarters immediately."
it was just where we detected the em signature. but i don't understand. it was completely invisible. how on earth did you know that a phase-discriminator would expose it?
"if i'm not mistaken, you'll find this thing was designed to generate a plasma stream. put a team together, trip. i'll need two quantum beacons. they'll have to be positron-based and have an output of two hundred gigawatts apiece."
"positron-based, sir?"
just get started. i'll bring you the specs in a few minutes. we're going to need our comm. frequencies on the fritz for a day or so. see to it.
"aye, sir."
"put the armoury on full alert. turn the ship around, travis. we're going back to the paraagan colony. what are you all waiting for?"
sir?
"it wasn't us, trip. we didn't do it."
take a look at the dispersal curve here and here. you'll have to isolate the sub-assembly tolerances from the emitter algorithms.
"whoa, hold on a minute. you're saying the assembly's independent of the emitters?"
exactly.
that's impossible.
not if you generate a stable flux between the positron conductors. then all you'll have to do is renormalise the tertiary wave functions.
"with all due respect, sir this is a level of quantum engineering that's beyond anything i ever learned. how the hell do you know this?"
remember crewman daniels?
"yeah. i saw him get vaporised by our friend, silik."
"well, for a cloud of vapour, he's one wealth of information. i just spent two hours with him."
he's on enterprise?
"not exactly. listen, i'll explain later. right now we've got to get back to building these beacons."
whatever you say.
the circuitry in there isn't compatible with our technology. we'll have to create an interface.
what for?
"we're going to be retrieving some suliban data discs. i have no doubt you'll be able to handle the content, but before you can do that we'll have to find a way to access the data."
and daniels claims this is suliban technology?
everything he's told me has checked out so far. i have no reason to doubt him this.
"we'll do our best, captain."
"captain. the vulcan ship we were headed for, it's no doubt detected we've altered course."
have they tried to hail us?
"i wouldn't know, sir. our comm. is on the fritz."
why did daniels leave it in his quarters?
i don't recall him having much time to pack before he left.
"no. well, if it is there and it contains what he said it does, it could be invaluable to starfleet."
"i gave daniels my word, malcolm. we download the schematics for the suliban stealth cruiser, nothing else."
pity. assuming he's right and we manage to find the cruiser what makes you think the suliban won't come after us?
"just like those old bible movies, malcolm. it wasn't written."
"so far, daniels is batting a thousand."
wait a minute. did you see that? they've got schematics on half a dozen different klingon ships.
"the stealth cruiser, lieutenant. nothing else."
there. there it is.
trip?
i feel like a chef who's just made a meal with ingredients he's never tasted.
you follow the instructions?
to the letter.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're approaching the colony.
have mister mayweather locate a binary system two point five light years away and set a course.
understood.
let's get these mounted on the grappler arms.
"head for the smaller star, then the inner moon of the second planet."
bridge to armoury.
reed here.
have you plotted all the target points?
"aye, sir."
stand by.
"i'll meet you two in the launch bay.  if this goes well, i shouldn't be long.  lower the beacons.  modify the viewscreen. bring up these coordinates. full magnification."
activate the beacons.
right where they're supposed to be.
"aren't we in range of their sensors, sir?"
"they can see us, but they have no idea we can see through their cloak. just keep on the same course, travis. malcolm?"
"the closer, the better, sir."
they're charging weapons.
"now, mister reed."
their cloaking generator's down.
"all four weapon banks, as well."
port and starboard engines disabled.
"okay, here's the tricky part."
reed to shuttlepod two.
archer here.
"she's all yours, captain. good luck."
"that last shot should have sealed off the two lower decks. if daniels is right, there shouldn't be more than twenty suliban for us to deal with."
is that all?
the stun grenade's on a three-second delay.
just ten more metres.
go.
which one?
here.
go.
"captain, they're all around us."
archer to reed.
go ahead.
we need some help here.
i see them. you'd better take cover.
go.
what's the problem?
i can't release the docking clamps.
ignite the thrusters. go to full power.
archer to mayweather.
"we see you, captain."
set a course back ward the vulcan ship. go to warp four as soon as we're aboard.
"yes, sir."
it took a while before we realized that the three discs had to work in unison. the interface seems to be holding.
hoshi?
"the stealth cruiser was definitely in orbit of the paraagan colony when the explosion took place. they were monitoring us very closely. there are sensors logs that tracked our course, our altitude, even our hull temperature. look at these."
i can't believe how close they got.
they got a lot closer than you think.
those cloaking devices sure come in handy.
they were docked with the shuttlepod for nearly two minutes.
just long enough to attach this and cloak it. good work. keep at it. get me admiral forrest.
sounds like pretty solid evidence. where the hell did you get it?
it's all on three data discs we took from a cloaked suliban cruiser.
"but how did you know about that cruiser? and if it was cloaked, how could you find it?"
i've got friends in high places.
"this is going to be a very interesting debriefing. get to the vulcan ship as quickly as you can. i'll let them know what you've got. i can't tell you how pleased i am, jonathan. after all you've done, i would have hated to see this end."
"thank you for believing in us, admiral. archer out."
they boarded a cloaked vessel and they knew exactly where to find the discs.
they weren't acting alone.
my ships are fast. we can overtake them and destroy enterprise.
have your ships bring me archer. allow enterprise to continue.
but we need to recover the discs.
archer. you know what happened the last time you failed me.
"it was ten months ago. he brought me back ten months, but i knew everything i know now. how is that possible?"
"as i've told you, the vulcan science directorate has concluded that time travel is impossible."
"well, good for the vulcan science directorate. maybe they can tell me how i woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that suliban ship was, or how i suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to see through its cloak. and while they're at it, they might as well tell me how i knew where to find those discs."
"all valid questions, but to conclude that the only answer is that you acquired this information from a dead crewman who transported you back through time is illogical."
why don't you give me another explanation?
i can't.
"because there isn't one. i got a call from trip, something about inspection pods. it was the exact same call i got the day before they found klaang. word for word."
perhaps you were dreaming.
"listen. i never thought this was possible, either, but i travelled through time and i need you to believe me."
why?
"because it's hard enough trying to fathom all this without having my science officer, a colleague who i trust and rely on, the person who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself, accusing me of being an hallucinating madman."
i don't remember accusing you of anything.
bridge to archer.
yes?
"we're getting some strange readings, sir. it might not be a bad idea for you to come out here."
i've taken the liberty of asking commander tucker to join us.
what's the problem?
we're having trouble balancing the warp field.
looks okay to me.
"it's odd. it'll be stable one moment, and then, for no reason, it'll go slightly out of alignment."
what are you guys doing to my engines?
the auto-stabilisers aren't functioning properly.
the computer ran its last diagnostic on them less than ten minutes ago. they look fine.
"well, they're not. we've had to realign the field a dozen times over the last hour."
"load torpedoes, and stand by all weapons. deploy the beacons, travis. modify the viewscreen and aim the beacons aft."
swing them down slowly.
it looks like we're in a swarm of cloaked bees.
charge the phase cannons.
we're being hailed.
put it through.
"i wouldn't advise using your weapons, jonathan. perhaps if we decloak, you'll understand why."
malcolm?
"they're all armed with high-yield particle weapons, sir."
how many could you take out?
"before they open fire? not enough, sir."
one of my ships is approaching your starboard docking port. i'd like you to board it immediately.
what do you want with me?
you have five minutes. if you don't comply i have permission to destroy enterprise.
how do i know you won't destroy enterprise either way?
"you have my word, captain. and you also have four and a half minutes left."
"i'm placing you in command. i advise you to maintain your present course and speed. i don't know what's going to happen, but try to keep an open mind. especially when it comes to things the vulcan science directorate says are impossible."
i'll try.
"captain, this is crazy. how do you know what they're going to do?"
"t'pol's in command now, trip. do whatever you n to help her. that goes for all of you.  keep an eye on porthos for me, would you? remember, no cheese."
"your captain's playing a very dangerous game, sub-commander."
game?
he has thirty seconds left. did he think i wasn't serious?
the turbolift's on e deck. it's empty.
where is he?
i'm not reading his biosigns. he must be on the suliban ship.
captain archer is no longer aboard enterprise. perhaps you should check with the vessel you sent for him.
i thought he was smarter than this. he could have saved all your lives. what a waste.
the docked ship is moving away.
it's targeting our warp core. they're all targeting the warp core.
"ten minutes ago, that vista was more beautiful than anything you could imagine."
where am i?
i had breakfast in that room less than half an hour ago. then i was instructed to bring you here. they told me that the timeline wouldn't be safe if you boarded that suliban ship. someone was very mistaken.
where is here?
"you're in the thirty first century, captain, or what's left of it."
"you said the suliban wouldn't follow us, that we'd make it safely to the vulcan ship."
as far as i was told that was exactly what was supposed to occur.
so you're telling me this just happened? it doesn't look like it just happened.
no. it looks like it happened a long time ago.
"if bringing me here caused this, then send me back. i'll take my chances with silik."
"you don't understand. all our equipment, the time portals, have been destroyed. everything's been destroyed. there's no way to send you back."
he's not on board. you must have sensors that can confirm that.
you've lied to me before. if you don't tell me where he is i'll have no alternative but to
"come see for yourself, or send your soldiers. you'll realise i'm telling the truth."
drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded.
"security teams to docking ports one, two, and three."
this is sub-commander t'pol. all security teams remain where you are.
are you crazy? how do we know how many suliban are coming aboard? they could try to take over the ship.
"there are thirty armed vessels surrounding us. unless i'm mistaken their weapons are still targeting our warp core. mister reed? so, unless you have a better suggestion?"
"if this place was destroyed as long ago as it seems to have been, then what are you doing here? you and your watchdog buddies don't exactly fit in with all this."
you're thinking of time travel like we're in some h.g. wells novel. we're not. it's far more complicated. there's no way for you to understand.
"try me. listen, i realise your little utopia is gone, and i sympathise, but if you're telling me the truth, if you've brought me eight hundred years into the future, into this future, i think i deserve some answers."
"i don't have any answers. and you're right, i shouldn't be here. which means you shouldn't be here either, but you are. we are. we brought you here to protect the time line. we did quite a job."
what's wrong?
it's gone.
what's gone?
the monument. it was right here on the same street as the library. it was obviously never built.
why is that a problem? who did it commemorate?
not who.
then what?
"an organisation. the federation. it doesn't exist for you, not yet."
but it will? fine. keep your missing monument to yourself. where's this library you were talking about?
"it should be right down there, if it was ever built, and even it was, it will be of no help. all the data's stored electronically."
books made with paper. there aren't supposed to be books here.
"well, there are. so, i suggest we use some of them to figure out what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me here this morning."
they haven't been duplicated.
is he correct?
don't you believe your scanners?
is he correct?
we didn't have time to make a copy.
leave her alone!
"lower your weapon.  if we find captain archer aboard this vessel, you'll all be punished for lying to me."
"he's not here, unless he's dead, but we did find this."
where?
"in that lift. it's an hour old, maybe two."
"when i saw him last, your captain spoke of a temporal cold war. what was he talking about?"
"captain archer believed crewman daniels was from the future, but if i recall, you killed him."
what else?
nothing else.
there's a temporal signature in your turbolift. what do you know of that?
"the last time we saw captain archer, he was entering that turbolift."
"perhaps you haven't been lying to me.  you, shut down all comm. systems and computer terminals with the exception of engineering and the bridge. confine all of them to their quarters. if anyone resists"
understood.
"under the circumstances, it would be best to do what he says, commander."
they're three days overdue.
"i told you, ambassador. archer said he was returning with proof that they weren't responsible for the tragedy on paraagan two."
you also told me starfleet had ordered him to deliver sub-commander t'pol and his medical officer to the vulcan ship d'kyr. they're three days overdue.
the d'kyr has long range sensors. have they detected enterprise?
captain archer's negligence caused the death of three thousand colonists. your superiors instructed them to return to earth. their mission is over. they haven't followed those instructions.
you didn't answer the commander's question. has your ship detected enterprise?
the d'kyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels. they're no longer within sensor range.
what kind of vessels?
they were at too great a distance to identify. enterprise has ignored our hails and defied starfleet's orders. i have no choice but to send the d'kyr in pursuit.
jonathan archer doesn't report to you.
"no, he doesn't, but sub-commander t'pol does, and since she would never comply with his present actions i have to conclude that she's being held against her will."
"i know you don't think much of archer, ambassador, but he is not in the habit of kidnapping vulcans."
"fine. you send your ship. whatever archer's up to, i'm sure he's got a good reason. he knows what he's doing."
does he really?
have you cycled through the sub-temporal harmonics?
he's never failed to respond before.
perhaps he's angry that we didn't return with archer.
archer wasn't on enterprise. why isn't he responding? i need instructions.
he said to destroy enterprise if we couldn't bring him archer. we should tow them out of the nebula and do it now.
"that temporal signature, it changes everything. if archer was pulled through time, we need new instructions. where is he?"
"if he's angry with you, you'll be punished again. we should destroy enterprise."
"have the surgeons prepare, then bring me the vulcan."
i haven't found a single reference to this federation you talked about.
i doubt you will.
because that monument wasn't there?
because you weren't there.
so i disappear one day and all history changes?
"i've looked through the twenty first and twenty second centuries. everything looks right up until the warp five programme. after that, nothing looks right."
there were a lot of people involved in the warp five programme.
we didn't bring a lot of people here this morning. we just brought you.
the romulan star empire. what's that?
maybe you shouldn't be reading that.
i don't get it. what could i have done that could have been so important?
"it wasn't just you, it was events you helped set in motion."
"this timeline, the one you say no longer exists. what can you tell me about it if my mission had continued?"
it would have led to others.
"and?  okay, what about this federation? was earth part of it? was i part of it?"
"silik wanted you, not the data disks. the people he answered to were more interested in capturing jonathan archer than in blaming enterprise for the destruction of the colony. they obviously knew what role you were going to play in the months or years to come. by taking you away from the twenty second century i caused exactly what i was trying to prevent."
you've lost me.
the only chance i have of restoring my century is by getting you back to yours.
"sounds like you've got a chicken-or-the-egg problem. you said your time portals are gone. all your technology. there isn't even electricity here. you going to find a bicycle, turn it into a time machine?"
maybe we don't need a time machine. do you have your communicator?
and my scanner.
"may i? the people the suliban were working for came from about three hundred years ago. they couldn't travel through time, but they did develop a way to send back images of themselves, to communicate through time."
you can't do that with those.
"no, it's a little bit more complicated, but not much. we learned how to do it in high school, but we're going to need a few things that might not be too easy to find."
what are we waiting for?
where is archer?
i don't know.
who are you working with from the future?
the vulcan science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible.
does captain archer agree with that opinion?
it's not an opinion.
does archer agree with that determination?
captain archer believes crewman daniels comes from the future.
but daniels is dead.
captain archer claims he saw daniels two days ago.
your captain is gone. did daniels take him into the past or the future?
the vulcan science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible.
"i can't be sure, but i think that's copper."
well done. i need you to unwrap it and pound it into small strips no more than a millimetre thick.
hello? please repeat. i can't understand. i still can't understand you. try modulating the sub-carrier wave.
"malcolm, can you hear me?"
barely. you're going to need to boost the signal.
any better?
yeah.
i thought the comm. was offline.
it is. i'm routing the signal through the eps grid. i can talk to any doorbell on b deck.
are you all right?
"same as you, i guess. locked in tight."
and the others?
"i can't get in contact with t'pol for some reason,"
and hoshi and travis are on c deck.
any thoughts about how we're going to get rid of these suliban?
one step at a time. the first thing i need to do is figure out how to tap into the door comms
on c-deck. i'll get back to you. sit tight.
i wasn't planning on going anywhere.
any luck?
"i still have the spatial coordinates of enterprise, but without a quantum discriminator it's going to be very tricky to contact the ship on the same day you left."
i thought you built these things in high school.
where quantum discriminators were on every desk.
why is the same day so important? what would be wrong with making contact a week before i left or even a month before?
i made the biggest mistake in the history of time travel this morning. i don't intend to make it any worse.
"this is captain archer. can you hear me? t'pol, this is captain archer. can you hear me?"
i don't think it's working.
i don't know where he is.
"you don't know where who is? sub-commander, this is captain archer. i'm having trouble understanding you."
captain archer's gone. a temporal reading in the turbolift. i don't know where he is.
daniels brought me to the future. that's what the temporal reading was all about. are you all right?
science vulcan directorate has determined that time travel is not fair.
"whatever you say. just tell me, are you all right?"
we're all confined to our quarters.
where are you?
"i told you, in my quarters."
"no, i mean enterprise. where's enterprise?"
there's a helix out my window.
"t'pol, listen to me. i need your help. you're going to have to find a way to get to daniels' quarters. do you understand me?"
you're on the ceiling. why aren't you on a monitor?
there's no technology where i am.
i thought you said you were in the future.
"t'pol, do you remember when i asked you to keep an open mind?"
yes.
"there's a lot more at stake here than bringing me back, or the mission. i need you to listen to me very carefully. i need you to trust me."
it won't work. we can only access the decoupling pins from outside our quarters.
"so if we can't pick the locks, what about the shafts that house the eps conduits?"
they're adjacent to the air ducts.
they were pretty much blocked off when the ship was completed.
it would be too tight a squeeze.
what's your definition of too tight?
"well, you or i couldn't get through them."
"maybe a child, or"
or hoshi?
"it's possible, but it would be difficult."
"what do you say, hoshi?"
you willing to give it a try?
isn't there some other way that i can help out? something that needs translating? you know how claustrophobic i am.
"there's no one else that can get through those crawlspaces, unless we could reach crewman naiman."
she's pretty small.
"there's no time. if this is going to work, we need to begin now. ensign sato."
how far would i have to go to get to the doctor's quarters?
"forty metres, maybe forty five."
then how far to lieutenant reed's?
"it's not that far, hoshi."
you can do it. we need you to do it.
hoshi?
good guess.
how are you holding up?
great. if you don't mind i'd just like to get this over with.
good luck.
whatever you're about to say i don't want to hear it. just get me a shirt.
"third dimension, timeline. timeline, first, second,"
what are you doing?
"first, third dimension."
"stand up, vulcan. up!"
no! no! no!
no! stop!
you certainly took your time. he had this pressed against my head.
had to be sure they were preoccupied. you positive you're willing to do this? it could get pretty ugly.
i'm positive.
you've got thirty minutes.
good luck.
if they regain consciousness don't hesitate to use these.
don't worry.
let's go.
did you think we wouldn't be watching daniels' quarters?
i guess i wasn't thinking.
"i guess you weren't, but you should be thinking now. thinking about what will happen to you if you don't answer my questions. are you thinking about that lieutenant reed? good. now tell me what this is. what does it do?"
i don't know.
what does it do?
i don't know. please!
yes?
i was told to destroy it. i don't know what it does.
who told you to destroy it?
"captain archer, before he left. he didn't want you to find it."
and why would that be?
he thought you would use it to contact someone. i don't know who. i swear it!
have the lieutenant returned to his quarters.
ready.
"engineering, how did this happen? engineering!"
what is it?
the antimatter stream has been compromised.
shut down the warp reactor.
our engineers aren't responding. i've sent soldiers.
keep me informed.
yes?
these humans are greater fools than i thought.
they'd rather commit mass suicide than submit to us.
did you correct the problem?
it's too late. the reactor's going to breach.
we can't endanger the helix. evacuate your soldiers and have enterprise towed out of the nebula.
there's very little time. will you alert the tractor teams?
you do it. i'm busy.
is that you? can you hear me?
"report, ensign."
the antimatter stream's back to normal.
you may have overdone your pyrotechnic display. the scorching on the starboard nacelle is extensive.
i'll try to remember that next time we have to fake a reactor breach.
"cell ships, thirty of them, thirty five, approaching at high warp."
"maintain your course and speed, ensign."
"i've tried to reach you. i tried for two days. i did what you told me, but archer wasn't on enterprise. there was some kind of temporal signature. i need instructions. i don't know how to operate this device. i need your help.  i hear you, but i don't understand. repeat what you said. please, repeat what you said."
"i said, you're an ugly bastard."
"you try shape-shifting on me, or pulling one of your chameleon routines and i promise you, silik, i'll blow your head off. has enterprise left the nebula?"
can you see? i've brought you archer! he's here! archer's here! there's no need to punish me.
"where's my ship, silik?"
they've left. they're gone.
how many cell ships did you send after them? silik!
"i don't know. twenty, thirty."
"you're going to call them off, and then you're going to give me those data discs back. now get up."
my soldiers won't let you leave.
shut up.
get going.
"hoshi, any sign of the vulcan ship?"
not yet.
hull plating on the port-aft quarter's down.
alter course ten degrees starboard.
they're closing.
the lead ships are overtaking us.
port hull plating's down. ventral plating as well.
why'd they stop firing?
why waste ammunition? they have us surrounded.
are long-range sensors still operational?
no vulcan ship.
sub-commander?
i see them.
"son of a bitch, he did it."
one cell ship approaching aft.
stand down weapons. open a channel. enterprise to suliban vessel.
"go ahead, enterprise."
"good to hear your voice, captain."
"good to hear yours, too. i feel like i've been away for a thousand years."
is everyone all right?
"lieutenant reed suffered some minor injuries, but he's recovering in sickbay. captain, i'm curious. why didn't the other cell ships try to stop you?"
i know it's not standard starfleet procedure
but i took a hostage.
"by the time he wakes up, we'll be long gone."
request permission to dock.
permission granted.
"while your explanation of how you obtained these disks is somewhat implausible, it's obvious that enterprise was not responsible for the destruction of the colony."
"it may see somewhat implausible to you, but"
"please allow me to finish, captain. in less than a single earth year you've engaged in armed conflicts with over a dozen species. you've escalated the conflict between my people and the andorians which included the destruction of one of our most sacred monasteries. you helped eighty nine suliban escape from detention. you may claim to be on a mission of exploration. i, however, consider you reckless and irresponsible."
"a danger to the quadrant. regardless of the evidence presented here, i plan to advise the vulcan high command not to change its recommendation to starfleet. enterprise should be recalled."
"you guys have wanted to scrub this mission from day one. we proved to you that we didn't kill those thirty six hundred people, but you don't want to hear it. you're pathetic!"
"that's enough, commander."
"no one's more pleased than i am that enterprise wasn't responsible for the tragedy, but ambassador soval's argument may be valid. starfleet command has a difficult decision to make here."
"when i was in my early twenties on a trip to east africa i saw a gazelle giving birth. it was truly amazing. within minutes the baby was standing up, standing up on its own. a few more minutes and it was walking and before i knew it, it was running alongside its mother, moving away with the herd. humans aren't like that, ambassador. we may come from the same planet as those gazelles but we're pretty much helpless when we're born. it takes us months before we're able to crawl. almost a full year before we can walk. our deep space mission isn't much different. we're going to stumble, make mistakes, i'm sure more than a few, before we find our footing. but we're going to learn from those mistakes. that's what being human is all about. i'm sorry you can't see that."
"your analogy is very colourful, captain, but i question whether it addresses the consequences of your actions."
"the concept of learning from one's mistakes shouldn't be difficult for a vulcan of your wisdom to understand, ambassador. our ancestors"
"discovered how to suppress their volatile emotions only after centuries of savage conflict. you spoke of the destruction of the monastery. what about the vulcan listening post that captain archer found there? i would hope that our people have learned from those events that using a sacred sanctuary to spy on others was a dishonourable practice, to say the least. i don't wish to contradict captain archer, but learning from one's mistakes is hardly exclusive to humans. their mission should be allowed to continue."
"the command council will review the evidence and listen to what's been said here today. i'm sure they'll hear from the vulcans as well. i'll let you know as soon as there's a decision. good luck, jonathan. all of you."
come in.
"i can't be certain, but crewman fuller might have seen me coming in here."
she tends to be discreet. what can i do for you?
"i think you put it over the top. forrest said none of the others could believe it when you went to bat for us, not to mention that little listening-post lecture you gave to soval."
you spoke to the admiral?
he woke me up in the middle of the night. can you believe that?
i assume with good news.
i think you put it over the top.
i still don't believe in time travel.
the hell you don't.
say when.
when.
i didn't know you drank wine.
under the circumstances i'll allow myself a small indulgence.
make mine a large indulgence.
to our science officer. it's been one year to the day since you officially joined our crew.
here's to many more.
i appreciate the sentiment but i'm simply carrying out my assignment.
that's no small accomplishment considering the previous record for a vulcan serving on a human ship was two weeks.
ten days.
i've been filling out your annual crew evaluation. just a formality.
i understand. the high command has requested my evaluation of you. just a formality.
there's something in your record i've been meaning to ask you about. while you were stationed in sausalito you took a five-day leave.
yes?
"you went to an old mining town in pennsylvania, carbon creek? seems like an odd place to take a vacation."
vulcans don't take vacations.
"then, if i may ask, why'd you go there?"
is this part of my evaluation?
just curious.
it was a personal matter.
"you had a personal matter in carbon creek, pennsylvania?"
"trip, if she doesn't want to tell us."
seems a little unfair. we tell her plenty of stories.
you'd like me to tell you a story?
if it's a good one.
i went to carbon creek because i wanted to visit the site of first contact between humans and vulcans.
then you were about three thousand kilometres off. that took place in montana.
"actually, it didn't."
"every school kid knows that zephram cochrane met the vulcans in bozeman, montana, on april 5th, 2063. i've been there. there's a statue."
"in fact, the vulcans visited earth long before then. my second foremother was one of them."
your who?
my mother's mother's mother. would you like to hear the story?
i can't compensate.
the re-fusion pressure is still dropping.
"if our orbit decays any further, we'll be detected."
"they'd gone to earth to investigate the launch of its first artificial satellite, called sputnik."
during their third week of gathering information about humanity their impulse manifold began to malfunction. they had no choice but to attempt an emergency landing.
try to find an isolated area. send a distress call to the high command.
one hundred kilometres.
deploy the stabilisers.
our landing vector is too steep.
are you hurt?
i don't think so. captain.
what are your orders?
why did the vulcans keep this a secret?
the incident is well-documented at the science directorate and the space council.
on vulcan?
of course.
"hang on. t'mir was your great-grandmother? i'd be the last person to question your math, but aren't you missing a few generations? sputnik was two hundred years ago."
don't forget how long vulcans live.
right. just how old are you?
it's got to be in her record.
"trip, that's classified information. please, go on."
their subspace transceiver was damaged in the crash. they had no way of knowing if their distress signal had even been transmitted.
they'd used up their emergency rations within a week. after five days without food their situation was growing desperate.
two lifeforms.
fascinating.
one of those creatures could sustain us for some time.
are you suggesting we eat it?
it's logical to take extreme measures to survive.
even resorting to savagery?
that may not be necessary. our scans showed a settlement approximately six kilometres away.
"if we're exposed, we could contaminate their culture."
"and when they find our bodies after we starve, will that contaminate their culture?"
better to leave them with a mystery than with three living aliens.
we should at least investigate the possibilities.
it's too dangerous.
i'm willing to take the risk.
mestral.  remain here.
how do you suggest we proceed?
we'll need to disguise ourselves.
"we're here to find food, nothing else. we'll keep contact with the humans to an absolute minimum. if we must interact with them i will speak."
what is it?
i believe you have that garment on backwards.
prisoners?
they don't appear to be restrained. more likely labourers.
it's hard to believe these people were capable of launching an artificial satellite.
"and he gets the sigh, and here's the pitch. dixon hits a scorcher down the right field line. the first baseman takes a stab at it, but no! ellis is charging hard from right field. he scoops it up and fires. it's going to be close. there's a collision at the plate, but wilcox hangs on to the ball and thompson is out!"
"some type of combat, no doubt."
i believe it may be an entertainment.
a communal gathering place.
do they have food?
it appears so. remember.
i won't speak.
another?
"no, i'll settle up."
all right.
i'm next.
currency.
yes. the paper appears to have value.
"thanks, billy.  what can i get you?"
do you have anything that doesn't require currency?
you mean free?
what brings you to carbon creek?
we had an accident with our vehicle outside your town.
are you okay?
we're fine.
you folks married?
no. we're business associates.
there's a gas station up the road. i'd be happy to give you a lift.
"no, thank you."
suit yourself.
anybody up for a game? quarter a ball?
i'll play.
"you better ask your mother, jackie."
"come on, mom, we could use the money."
go on upstairs and do your homework. i'll bring you up some dinner.
i'm up for a game.
what are you doing? i told you not to speak to anyone.
i can defeat him.
you don't even know the rules.
it's simple.
i thought you didn't have any money.
he doesn't.
"well, sorry, pal. there's nothing in it for me."
it's time for us to go.
"wait a minute. we might be able to work something out. if you win, i'll pay up. if i win, your business associate has a drink with me."
we accept your terms.
we do not.
the game is based on simple geometry. it wouldn't challenge a vulcan child.
no.
we need their currency.
what if you lose? i'll have to socialise with him.
would you rather die of starvation?
tough break.
the number eight ball in that pocket.
cryogenics.
l do you suppose they've experimented with protein replicators?
why didn't you ask the merchant? you seemed willing to engage everyone else in conversation.
i think that wine's gone to your head.
what are you implying?
"two vulcans stroll into a bar, hustle a few games of pool and walk out with an armload of tv dinners. it sounds like an old episode of the twilight zone."
if you're not interested in hearing the rest
"hold on, hold on. we didn't say we weren't interested."
they realised they couldn't rely on gambling
so they took whatever employment they could find while they waited for the rescue vessel to arrive.
"but as the weeks passed, it seemed less likely that their distress call had been received, and it became more difficult for them to avoid the humans."
the test of a nuclear device is designed for tactical use in place of artillery. zero hour was just after five.
nothing like an atomic test to make your day.
doesn't it concern you?
the bomb? it scares the hell out of me.
i'd hate to see humanity destroy itself.
that makes two of us.
want to shoot some eight ball?
jack.
i've got a geometry midterm next week. it's good practice.
"nice try, but there's better ways to prepare for a math test."
are you interested in mathematics?
"it's what i want to study at college. mechanical engineering, if i get to go."
you will. he got a scholarship.
only a partial one.
"it's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it. everybody's been pitching in to help pay for his expenses. books, room and board."
you can shoot one rack and that's it.
your break.
this is the third time this week i've had to fix mrs. garrett's sink.
perhaps she enjoys your company.
it might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling me moe.
why does he do that?
there is a comic actor known as a stooge with that name. the boy believes we have similar hair.
there is a resemblance.
this is intolerable. i'm a warp field engineer.
then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver.
"i told you, it's impossible."
"if we remain here, we'll die. this world's on the brink of self-annihilation."
i don't believe that.
because your fascination with this species is blinding you. you sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device.
i'm doing research. perhaps if you spent more time observing human behaviour you might not have such a pessimistic view of them.
open your eyes. they revel in violence. they devote what little technology they have to devising ways of killing each other.
so did we centuries ago. they just haven't realised their potential yet.
what potential?
they have great empathy and compassion. look how we've been made to feel welcome.
only because they believe we're human. if they discovered the truth do you think they'd be so compassionate? where are you going?
to the ship.
why?
this antenna is inadequate. i believe i can use a waveform discriminator to enhance it.
it'll be safer to go after dark. you can't risk being followed.
i need to go now. i love lucy is on tonight.
"hi, you're right on time."
it was different than seeing it on television. more invigorating.
"well, there's another game next week if you'd like to go. or we could do something else. take in a movie?"
that would be enjoyable.
can i ask you a question?
yes.
"what are you hiding under that cap? a pointed head? you're not from mars, are you?"
"oh, i didn't mean to make fun of you."
i'm not offended. may i ask you a question?
please.
what happened to your mate?
you mean my husband?
yes.
"he left a long time ago. jack used to get letters from him every now and then. the last we heard, he'd moved to phoenix. i was hoping he would help with jack's college but i guess we're on our own. i can understand why he wouldn't want to have anything to do with me but. i'm sorry, i'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. it's not always easy."
i know.
"well, i'm due back at the pine tree. will i see you later?"
"please, i was simply surprised. it was very pleasant."
pleasant?
wasn't that an appropriate response?
"well, it's been a while since i kissed a man, but still, i was hoping it'd be a little bit more than pleasant."
i did say very pleasant.
we've got company.
i should go. thank you again.
waveform discriminator?
i went to a baseball game in doylestown.
more research?
maggie invited me. i didn't think it would be a problem.
then why did you lie about it?
because i knew you wouldn't understand.
you were engaging in intimate activity.
i didn't initiate it.
you're to have no further contact with that woman.
you can't make that decision.
i'm still in command.
command of what? our mission is over. it's time to accept the fact that we may never leave this world.
i was just going to play some pool. i didn't mean to bother you. what are you doing?
i was about to meditate.
"really? are you just trying to clear your mind, or reach a higher spiritual plane? i spend a lot of time at the library."
studying meditation techniques?
"different things. mostly about places i'd like to visit, like tibet. the buddhist monks there meditate every day. and in india, they're got these mystics called fakirs. supposedly they can almost stop their hearts just by using willpower."
you'd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish. what else do you study at this library?
"astronomy, literature. sometimes i'll just pick a book off the shelf and start reading. what about you, what do you like to read?"
i have an interest in astronomy as well.
"oh really? did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun is just right you can see sputnik with the naked eye. maybe tomorrow i could show you."
i've seen it already.
"oh. it's amazing, don't you think? well, i'll let you get back to your meditating. it was nice talking to you."
and you.
mestral!
hello.
"hey, i got tickets to the ball game this weekend. it's a double-header. tim's going, gavin, jack, maggie."
i'm afraid i can't.
what's wrong with you lately? maggie says you haven't even
"are you all right, billy?"
yeah.
why do you need us here?
"i'm looking for a particle weapon. the armoury case, help me find it."
why?
there's been an accident in the mine. at least twenty men are trapped. it could take the humans days to free them.
we can't interfere.
they'll die. you'd let them suffocate. even if we could prevent it.
what if they see the weapon?
we'll be certain they don't.
"at best, these humans only live to be sixty or seventy. is it worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years?"
we can't contaminate their culture.
this has nothing to do with contamination. it has to do with compassion.
compassion is an emotion.
"they're my friends, and i'm going to help them. don't try to stop me."
yes.
"proceed twenty two metres, then turn right at the junction."
understood.
"in eight metres, you'll find a narrow opening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft."
i think we're getting more guys down there.
is the ride free up there?
yeah.
"there's a stratum of quartz on the wall, opposite the opening."
i see it.
set your dispersal radius to seven degrees.
two more metres.
how far?
approximately thirty metres.
"here, over here."
"after rescuing the twelve miners, mestral became something of a hero that day."
didn't people wonder how he got them out?
"i'm sure they did, but no one ever discovered the truth. three months passed"
"and just as they had resigned themselves to the fact that, in all likelihood, they would never leave earth."
t'mir.
this is captain tellus of vulcan survey vessel d'vahl. i'm responding to your distress signal.
we thought it wasn't transmitted.
your signal was picked up by a tellarite freighter. it took them some time to forward it to the high command. we're approaching the system now. meet us at the crash site in three days.
understood.
i hear you're leaving.
that's correct.
where to?
home. up north.
i'm going to miss you. you're about the most interesting people i've met in this town.
i'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people at college.
i'm not going.
what? why not?
"we couldn't come up with the rest of the money. the deadline for the tuition's friday, so"
what will you do?
"keep saving, i guess. find a job. mom doesn't want me anywhere near the mine but that's where the work is around here."
can you try again next year for the scholarship?
"i'll reapply, but there's no guarantee."
i'm sure they will offer it to you again.
"and if not, there's always the library. still a lot of books i haven't read. good luck up north. carbon creek's not exactly a vacation spot, but i hope you'll come visit us."
perhaps.
"he took those college boards, got the highest score of anybody in the county. it's not fair."
"so, you're the lady with the invention that's going to change the world."
morning.
jack! jack!
didn't you terminate your employment?
"yes, but i promised mrs. garrett i'd repair this suction device."
it's unfortunate that you'll be leaving these people without experiencing one thing they have to offer.
"such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation?"
there's much more to them. you just refuse to see it.
i've seen enough.
i haven't. i plan to stay here.
if this is your attempt at humour
they're on the verge of countless social and technological advancements. i have the unique opportunity to study an emerging species.
"that's what you've done, much closer than we anticipated. your duty is to return to vulcan and report your findings."
there's still more to learn about these people.
all of them or just one?
"this has nothing to do with maggie. she has helped me appreciate their culture, but i don't intend to remain in carbon creek."
where would you go?
"to one of their larger cities at first. after that, i'm not certain. there's so much to see."
the high command will never allow it. tell him it's not possible. t'mir?
perhaps i can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship.
"in another twenty years, running more statistical scans from high orbit? that's not enough."
where is your captain?
he was killed in the crash.
there were four vulcans aboard your vessel.
mestral died in the crash as well. we cremated their remains.
do you realise you've just rewritten our history books?
"a footnote, at best."
footnote? this is like finding out neil armstrong wasn't the first man to walk on the moon.
perhaps he wasn't.
how long did this mestral stay on earth?
"the rest of his life, presumably."
"and that would be what, another hundred, hundred and fifty years?"
possibly longer.
"an alien is left on earth in the 1950s, lives through, what, thirty presidents? travels the world, and no one notices him? and what happened when he finally kicked the bucket? did the undertaker just shrug and ignore his ears?"
you asked me to tell you a story.
and it was a good one. but did it really happen?
"as i said, you asked me to tell you a story."
"damn, captain, she put one over on us."
you did go to carbon creek.
"if you check my record, you'll note that i also visited yellowstone park and the carlsbad caverns. i'm a scientist. that includes geology. thank you for the meal."
my pleasure. you've certainly kept us entertained.
good night.
come in.
good morning.
captain.
sleep well?
well enough.
"i wasn't sure what you wanted for breakfast, so i took the liberty of having chef prepare his famous eggs benedict."
"that'll be fine, sir."
you plan to eat standing up?
"this isn't a visit to the principal's office, malcolm. at ease."
"thank you, sir. i just wasn't sure whether you called me here to discuss something."
no. no business. i just wanted to have a long overdue meal with my armoury officer.
i heard that england made it to the finals in the world cup.
i beg your pardon?
the world cup? soccer?
"oh. i'm afraid i don't much follow football, sir."
any sports you do follow?
"no, not particularly."
thanks.
"you're welcome, sir."
"i've been working on the duty roster, sir. we only have two crewmen assigned to the armoury fulltime. if we added a third, ensign tanner would be free to begin those upgrades to those torpedo launchers i told you about."
didn't your mother ever tell you not to bring your homework to the table?
sir?
this looks fine.  archer.
"i'm sorry to interrupt, captain, but we've detected an uncharted system along our present course. one of the planets is minshara-class."
take us out of warp. i'm on my way. looks like we'll have to reschedule.
"whenever it's convenient. after you, sir."
anybody home?
it's uninhabited.
what about geographical features? anything interesting?
there's a chain of volcanoes that spans an entire hemisphere.
"well, i don't know about anyone else, but i could use some fresh air. put us in a standard orbit."
"aye, sir."
"find a volcano with a gentle slope. preferably one that's not erupting. prep a shuttlepod, travis. we'll take shifts down to"
report!
"it was a thermo-kinetic explosion on the outer hull, port forward quarter. breeches on c deck, d deck."
bridge to sickbay. we need medical assistance.
acknowledged.
emergency bulkheads?
"they're in place, but eight subsections have decompressed."
was anybody in them?
"i can't tell, sir. not yet."
find out what happened. malcolm!
"i'd give you an answer if i could, sir. the sensor logs aren't showing anything. all systems were functioning normally."
archer to engineering.
"captain, what's going on?"
i was hoping you could tell me.
"we've got plasma fires, an overload in the eps grid but whatever caused that explosion,"
i don't have a clue. weapons fire? an asteroid?
nothing on our sensors. how are your people?
"a few bumps and bruises, but we're all right."
keep me posted. archer out.
any casualty reports?
"figures are coming in, sir. seventeen so far, including hoshi. no fatalities."
get this man into the imaging chamber.
what's happening? are we under attack?
i don't know.
doctor!
"captain, something just struck the ship. starboard side upper aft quadrant."
can you get a visual?
there. just behind the secondary plasma vent. you see it?
some kind of cloaked ship?
it's too small.
i'm not reading any biosigns.
"it's armed with tricobalt explosives. i think it's a mine. and judging by the firepower, something similar damaged our ship."
can you tell if it's active?
no reason to believe it's not.
"captain, it's lodged near impulse reactor two. an explosion anywhere near there could disable enterprise."
what if we polarised the adjacent hull plating?
"we don't know how it's triggered. somebody has to go out there and defuse it, and it should be me. i have the ordnance training."
i've never heard of a minefield with just two mines. are the quantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm?
i believe so.
"lower them into position, then modify the viewscreen. activate the beacon."
they were designed to penetrate suliban cloaking devices. i'll try shifting the phase variance.
lieutenant reed to bridge. i've opened the outer hatch. wish me luck.
"i'm detecting something in the gamma spectrum, phase variant point zero zero seven five."
its surface is pockmarked. probably micrometeorite impacts. it seems to have been in orbit for some time. the spikes are magnetic. two of them have locked onto the hull.
stand by. i'm going to run an internal scan.
"there are proximity sensors, but they appear to be offline."
it looks like the mine doesn't think it's hit anything. i believe i've found an access panel. i'm going to try and remove it and get a look inside.
how bad is it?
i can't really tell until we can get into the decompressed sections but i imagine it's pretty ugly. i've got one piece of good news. i did a head count. we didn't lose anyone.
"trip, i'm not sure malcolm's going to be able to defuse this thing. couldn't we just detach that section of hull plating? let it drift away?"
we'd have to reroute some eps conduits. there's about three hundred bolt couplings. it could be done.
how long?
"three or four hours. but i wouldn't recommend it, sir. we'd be exposing a good piece of the impulse manifold."
get a team started. i'll consider it our last resort.
i'm removing the panel.
the arming mechanism's extending.
captain.
"we see it, malcolm."
ever see a ship like that?
no. it's reflecting our scans.
why didn't the beacons let us see through its cloak?
perhaps the mines use a more primitive cloaking system.
"sir, they're hailing us."
the translator's not locking on.
archer to sickbay.
"yes, captain."
is hoshi in any shape to return to the bridge? it's urgent.
i'm afraid not. she suffered a rather severe concussion.
understood.
tell him i'm on my way.
"you'd be of little help in your present condition, ensign."
any luck?
not yet.
they're charging weapons.
they missed our starboard nacelle by less than twenty metres.
not a very subtle warning shot.
can you get us out of here?
"the orbits of those mines are pretty erratic, sir. it's going to be tricky."
we'll give you whatever help we can. bridge to lieutenant reed.
go ahead.
"our friends seem to be anxious for us to leave. we're going to break orbit, nice and slowly."
"understood. if you plan to go to warp, sir, you'll let me know?"
i'll try to remember.
maneuvering thrusters only.
"aye, sir."
activate the beacon.
our friends just vanished.
that doesn't mean they're not still close.
lieutenant reed to bridge.
go ahead.
"i've identified four separate detonation circuits. if i can isolate them in the proper sequence, i should be able to deactivate the mine. it'll take some doing, but to be honest, captain, it's only a theory."
how good a theory?
"the closest thing i'm familiar with that this device resembles is a triton-class spatial torpedo. i've disarmed at least half a dozen of those. i believe i can do it, sir."
"i've got trip working on a backup plan, but i'd prefer not to use it. right now, you're our best bet. be careful, malcolm."
i see it.
bridge.
go ahead.
another one of those spikes i told you about.
what about it?
it just magnetised itself to the hull.
is there a problem?
"on its way it went through my leg, sir."
"i'm on my way, lieutenant.  the bridge is yours."
"captain, i should be the one to go out there. i'm the engineer."
"that's why i need you here, trip."
"ensign, lie still. your injuries don't appear to be serious. present circumstances, however, should not keep up from continuing our denobulan lessons. what about anatomy? let's begin with the thyroid gland."
the thyroid gland?
in denobulan.
very good. how about the hypothalamus?
excellent. now the xiphoid process. that's a difficult one.
"no. no, that could be misinterpreted as big toe. the proper term would be . all right, let's try something simpler. pericardia."
you'll have to wait in line for my osmotic eel to cauterise your wound. he's getting quite a workout today.
doctor.
ensign.
they need a translator. i should be at my post.
"i realise you're anxious to help but you wouldn't make it to the turbolift. if you'd like, i could have them bring the comm. logs here."
"thank you, doctor."
thought you might need a hand.
"actually, i'd prefer a leg."
"let's see what we can do with the one you got.  could have been worse. it missed the bone, and it looks like the pressure from the spike is keeping the wound from bleeding too much. you'll be in sickbay in no time. these should cut right through it."
"actually, sir, i wouldn't do that. my scans show detonation circuits inside the spikes. i would consider letting you amputate, but if chef got hold of it he'd be serving roast reed for sunday dinner. just give me something for the pain and i'll do my best to reach the access panel."
not without doing more damage to that leg.
"what's more important, my leg or your ship?"
i intend to save both.
i don't see how.
that backup plan i was telling you about? i asked trip to prepare to detach this section of hull plating. seemed like a good idea at the time.
it's still a good idea.
not with you attached to it.
i hope that's an anaesthetic.
phlox's own recipe.
"please, sir, may i have some more?"
i don't want you too sedated. i'm going to need your help. someone's got to defuse this thing. you're going to talk me through it.
"with all due respect, captain, disarming mines is extremely delicate business. i'm trained for it. you're not."
i'm a quick study.
it's too dangerous.
"in case you haven't noticed, lieutenant we're sitting about five metres from an impulse reactor. i'm not leaving until we take this weapon offline."
sir.
"the way i see it, you don't have much choice. you're sort of stuck here. so would you let me get started?"
i hope you've got a steady hand.
they're ordering us to leave their system immediately or they'll destroy us.
"charming. could you figure out a way to compose a message back, explaining we're going as fast as we can?"
i can try.
and their next message?
they say they've annexed this planet in the name of something called the romalin star empire.
romulan. it's pronounced romulan.
romulans? i read about them when i was with daniels.
what'd you find out?
not much. just the name. he wouldn't let me see anything else. t'pol?
"they're rumoured to be an aggressive, territorial species but the vulcan high command has never made direct contact with them. ensign sato's translation says that"
they're demanding that we withdraw from this system immediately.
that's going to be a little tough to do at the moment. is there any way you can explain our situation?
she believes she'll have a reply prepared within the hour.
"how's it going out there, captain?"
we've taken two of the detonation circuits offline. three more to go. keep me posted.
the next one's going to be tricky. do you see the y-shaped components surrounding the circuit?
there's six of them.
"right. those are timing relays. you'll have to rotate each one counterclockwise seventy degrees, but it has to be done in the proper order. i'll guide you through it. start with the relay to your upper right. raise it one centimetre and then turn it seventy degrees counterclockwise. good. now pull it out slowly. be careful not to touch the housing. well done. now complete that set on the diagonal."
"so, where were we?"
sir?
"this morning, at breakfast, before we were interrupted. you said you didn't follow any particular sport."
"well, i'm afraid i haven't started following one since breakfast, sir. now, go to the relay top centre, but watch that one. i believe it may be damaged. it'll need some extra torque to deactivate it."
how about hobbies? any hobbies?
"no, not really, sir."
i could've sworn i've seen you reading a book or two in the mess hall.
"sir, do you really think that this is the appropriate time for a chat?"
it helps me focus. it calms my nerves.
"well, it isn't calming mine."
"sorry. it made you a little nervous this morning, too, didn't it? why is that?"
"if you must know, i was honoured to be asked to sit at your table. i just wasn't entirely comfortable having a casual meal with my captain. i was trained not to fraternise with superior officers."
never too late to learn.
"frankly, sir, from my point of view that kind of socialising has no place on a starship."
"i had a co once felt the same way. they're your crew, not your friends. i thought about that a lot when i took this command, but then i realised this is not your typical mission. we could be out here for years. all we have to depend on is each other."
there are two left. top left first.
"i appreciate your suggestions, malcolm. anything else?"
"well, since you asked. bridge protocols have become somewhat lax. too many people offering opinions. we're here to carry out your orders, sir. you're the captain."
what's the point of having a senior staff if they just sit around with their mouths shut? i'm glad they have opinions. i rely on them. keep going.
"and in the area of security i sometimes think you could show a little more caution, sir."
i'm aware of your concerns in that area.
not to say that it hasn't been a privilege to have served with you.
ah ha.
sir?
"you're talking in the past tense, lieutenant."
"now, reinsert all six relays, but in the reverse order. you're doing fine, sir."
thanks.
"you've earned yourself a break, travis. ensign hutchison can cover the helm for a while."
"thank you, sir, but i'd prefer to stay at my post."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're clear of the minefield.
maintain course and speed.
understood.
this last detonation circuit has an added attraction. i'm seeing something that looks like a back-up arming mechanism. we'll have to fool the circuit into thinking it's still online.
how do we do that?
there's a hyperspanner in the equipment case. take out its power cell and strip off the casing.
you must have realised this wasn't going to be your typical armory posting. that my command style lacked a certain spit and polish.
"it was obvious, if you don't mind me saying so."
strange.
"what's strange, sir?"
"i understand you came from a long line of royal navy men. your father, your grandfather. why pick starfleet? why not continue the family tradition?"
god knows i tried.
what happened?
i'll need a circuit probe.
"so, what happened?"
i was raised on the water. i knew how to handle a boat before i could ride a bicycle. studied all the great naval battles. i don't know. i suppose i thought i'd just grow out of it.
grow out of what?
aquaphobia.
you're afraid of the water?
"more precisely, afraid of drowning."
so instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuum of space?
"i had a great-uncle who suffered from the same problem, but he faced his fears. joined the navy, had a distinguished career. all you have to do is attach it to the cylinder on your upper right. it's working. start with the topmost component. use the caliper to lift it a few millimetres and then turn it clockwise three hundred and sixty degrees, and then gently reinsert it. he was something of a hero to me, my great-uncle."
the one with aquaphobia?
indeed. he signed up with the submarine service.
talk about facing your deepest fears.
"he was a brave man. wasn't long before he'd worked his way up through the ranks. made chief engineer on the hms clement. do you know the story of the clement, sir?"
i don't think i do.
"good. now, the other five components. repeat the same process on each one, counterclockwise."
you were telling me about the clement.
"they were on a routine patrol when they had an accident. now, there's a beautiful irony for you. they hit a mine left over from some world war. there they were, trapped underneath an ice shelf, several compartments flooding, including engineering. can you imagine? my great-uncle, the man afraid of drowning? the ship was sinking, losing power. according to his lieutenant, my great-uncle sealed himself in the engine room and kept the reactor online long enough for his crew to make it to the escape pods. he went down with his ship. he did what he had to do to save his crewmates."
"i appreciate what you're trying to tell me, malcolm, but i was hoping you'd be able to save your heroics for another time."
"i just want you to know, sir, that i am prepared."
got you.
"if we're not able to defuse this mine, the safety of the crew"
"i said i heard you, lieutenant."
"i'm afraid we have another problem, sir."
what? what is it?
i need to use the bathroom.
i won't tell a soul.
"in my ev suit, sir?"
sir.
we're being hailed.
you've ignored our warnings.
we were unable to translate your language until a short time ago. we're trying to defuse a weapon lodged on our hull.
i'm well aware of your situation. our scans show you're prepared to detach the hull segment surrounding the mine. complete the procedure and leave this system immediately.
we've got a man trapped out there. don't your scans show you that?
one crewman. you have eighty two others safely aboard. jettison the hull segment and leave. we will not tolerate espionage.
"t'pol, report."
they're demanding that we jettison the section of hull plating and leave.
"they scanned us, captain. they know we're ready to detach it."
i'm defusing the last detonation circuit. stand by.
it's rearming! reset that last component! quickly!
lieutenant?
"when you deactivated that final circuit, it triggered a sub detonator."
how can we get to it?
"we can't. it's too deep inside. we'd have to dismantle the entire mine. captain? those heroics we spoke about. i think it may be time. you've done all you can, sir. for what it's worth, you'd make a fine armoury officer."
show me that sub-detonator.
"i'd prefer a burial at sea, if i'm not completely vaporised."
"i thought you were afraid of the water. your scanner, lieutenant."
"i told you, sir. there's nothing we can do."
we'll dismantle this thing piece by piece if we have to.
that'll take days.
my schedule's open.
"and these romulans? they don't seem like the patient types. the longer we stay in this system, the more likely they're going to attack. as much as i appreciate all your efforts, you have to detach the hull plating. it's the only option."
i'm not about to leave one of my crew behind.
you're putting enterprise at risk.
we're wasting time. help me figure out a way to get you off of here. that's an order.
what the hell are you doing?
great.
"if i were the kind of captain you think i should be, i'd bust your ass back to crewman."
"begging your pardon, sir, but if you were that kind of captain we wouldn't be having this conversation. you'd have cut me loose by now."
"i'm not going to do that, malcolm. when we triggered that sub-detonator, why didn't the mine explode right away?"
how many seconds went by before i rearmed it?
sir?
how many seconds?
"i don't remember. ten, maybe twelve."
it felt more like twenty.
"ten, twenty, what's the difference?"
"if it had exploded, how big would the yield have been?"
"judging by the damage the first mine caused, i'd guess about a quarter of a kiloton. what are you getting at, sir?"
how close is your team to finishing?
they're down to the last few couplings. what's going on out there?
we're going to detach the plating.
"i'm sure you did everything you could, captain."
i'm going with him. can a shuttle pod hatch withstand a quarter-kiloton blast?
depends how close it was.
"twenty metres, maybe twenty five."
they're reinforced with duratanium alloy. they can take a hell of a beating. what have you got in mind?
i need two shuttlepod hatches. have them brought up here on the double.
sir?
on the double.
"captain, i assume there's no point in my questioning your plan."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're ready.
see you soon.
"hang on, fellas."
six hundred metres.
another hundred ought to do it.
sub-commander.
hail them.
no response.
they're charging weapons.
polarise the hull plating.
"i'll do what i can, but keep in mind we're missing some of it."
it's rearming.
"that's it, let's go."
"now, malcolm!"
"enterprise to captain archer. captain, respond."
maybe their transmitters were knocked out in the blast. travis?
i see them. bearing two one three mark four. closing in.
open the doors to launch bay two.
the romulans are locking weapons.
bridge to doctor phlox.
go ahead.
meet us outside launch bay two.
they're targeting our engines.
a hundred metres more. fifty. i've got them. sealing launch bay doors.
"go to warp, ensign."
are you all right?
"all things considered. if i may say so, sir, your style of command does have its advantages."
"so, how long was it?"
i counted ten seconds.
ten? it was more like twenty.
"respectfully, sir, it was ten."
"i'm not going to argue with you, malcolm. it was twenty. that's an order."
it's incredible we're still in one piece.
if that mine had hit another metre to the left. we can't polarise the port bow plating until those breaches are sealed.
what's your guess.
"assuming we can find some tritanium alloy? three or four months. and with this kind of damage the best i can give you is warp two, maybe two point one."
"in other words, we're a decade away from jupiter station. what about the transceiver array?"
the subspace antenna's damaged. all we've got is short-range.
we've answered enough calls for help over the past year. it's time someone returned the favour.
you serious?
archer to ensign sato.
"go ahead, sir."
i want you to get started on a general distress call. assistance required. minor repairs. don't go into too much detail.
"understood, sir."
archer out.
you're killing me!
"push, lieutenant. two more seconds. and rest."
it can't be ethical to cause a patient this much pain.
"it's unethical to harm a patient. i can inflict as much pain as i like. a positive attitude is vital to the healing process. the more you complain, the longer your recovery is likely to take."
when will i be able to return to duty?
"another week, possibly two."
two weeks?
"attitude, lieutenant. the wound might heal faster if you'd allow me to apply a few more regulan blood worms."
you're not putting any more of those things inside my leg. you still haven't found the last one.
"he'll come out on his own, eventually."
did you hear that? i don't believe it. trip told me he fixed that squeak.  go ahead.
"captain, we're receiving response to the distress call."
it's a tellarite freighter.
put them through. this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. thank you for responding.
how may we be of assistance?
"we need help in repairing some hull damage. if you can rendezvous with us, we'd be happy to discuss"
schedule won't permit it. the signal is
"i'm sorry, sir. they're barely within range."
can you repeat?
transmitting coordinates. repair station at
sounded like he said repair station?
we have received a set of co-ordinates.
what do you know about these tellarites?
"they're not the most agreeable species, but they're usually trustworthy. the co-ordinates are three and a half days away at warp two."
i think it's worth a look.
"aye, sir."
this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. we need to make some repairs. i was told you might be willing to help us. we'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer. please respond.
nothing.
biosigns?
none that i can detect.
maybe it's abandoned.
"we might be able to board it, salvage some of the materials we need."
it doesn't seem that enterprise could fit inside those docking berths. what's it look like inside?
i'm detecting a liquid helium atmosphere. the temperature's two hundred and seventy degrees below zero.  a bio-molecular probe.
sir.
it's reconfiguring to fit the saucer section.
the liquid helium's being replaced by a warmer oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
still no response to our hails.
it appears an invitation's been extended.
they need to work a little on their hospitality.
i don't see that we have a lot of options.
take us in.
"they've isolated every hull breach, every damaged system. i'll be damned. we scratched the hull right here, a year ago. i bumped it with the inspection pod, remember?"
i thought i told you to have that repainted.
i was getting around to it.
everything's in english. the ship wasn't the only thing they probed. i think that's malcolm. that's where his left leg was injured.
this facility may have the technology to repair mister reed as well.
the analysis of your vessel is complete. select a method of compensation to begin the repair process.
who am i speaking with?
your inquiry was not recognised.
is there someone here i can speak with?
your inquiry was not recognised.
i don't think there's anyone back there.
perhaps the station's automated.
are you saying you can repair all our systems?
select a method of compensation to begin the repair process.
"we can give them either three warp coils, five deuterium injectors or two hundred litres of warp plasma."
i wouldn't recommend giving up any hardware we can't replace.
plasma?
i think we can spare it.
"if we agree to these terms, how long will the repairs take?"
"time to completion, thirty four point two earth hours."
"i'm telling you, the boys at jupiter station would take three months."
it's a fair exchange.
select a method of compensation to begin the repair process.
compensation will be due when the repairs are completed. your vessel will then disengage immediately. all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction.
look at this.
it's our repair schedule.
transmit it to hoshi and have her inform the crew.
enterprise to captain archer.
go ahead.
some kind of mechanical arms are being attached to the outer hull.
"it's all right, travis. stand by."
the recreation facility is now available to all personnel. enjoy your visit.
if this their idea of a recreation facility you might want to ask for our plasma back.
a matter energy converter.
it could be a transporter. an awfully small one.
"i believe it's a molecular synthesiser of some kind. similar to a protein resequencer, but far more advanced. water, cold."
i saw a similar device on a tarkalean vessel. it was capable of replicating almost any inanimate object.
if we had one of these in engineering we could make all the spare parts we need. i wonder what else is on the menu. one pan-fried catfish.
smells like the real thing.
well?
not bad.
i doubt there's a catfish within a hundred and thirty light years.
it's genome is stored in enterprise's computer as is the recipe. the station evidently scanned our database.
it would have been nice to have been asked. i can only imagine what else this thing knows about us.
"captain, you've got to try this."
"thanks, but i'll stick with whatever chef's serving. i'll be on the bridge."
are you sure this thing knows what it's doing?
that's the third time you've asked.
you didn't answer me the first two times.
it's remarkable. your cells are regenerating at an exponential rate. do you see how it's using a cytokinetic enzyme to stimulate the cell division?
lovely.
i could certainly use a device like this. perhaps the captain could negotiate a trade of some sort.
the tissue is completely healed. even the scar is gone. try standing up. any pain?
none.
come in.
repairs are currently underway on c deck. work on launch bay one is scheduled to begin at twenty two hundred hours.
they even fixed the squeak in the floor. i was starting to wonder if we had a gremlin under the deck plating.
a mythical creature. british pilots used to blame them for problems they couldn't explain.
perhaps i should scan for one.
that won't be necessary. is trip happy with how the repairs are going?
he says they're exceeding starfleet specifications.
that's good to hear. anything else?
if i may make an observation?
go ahead.
you seemed troubled.
"guess i need to do a better job at repressing my emotions. these repairs are one hell of a bargain at only two hundred litres of warp plasma, don't you think?"
not every culture is based on the acquisition of wealth. the station's builders could simply have been interested in helping others.
what happened to them? they could have at least left a message. thanks for stopping by.
perhaps they prefer anonymity.
"don't you find that a little suspicious? i know you don't put a lot of faith in your feelings, but i've learned to trust mine. something doesn't smell right."
"honestly, i started to feel a little sorry for the doctor. there wasn't anything for him to do but stand there and watch this thing work."
i know how he must have felt. i saw an entire transtator assembly replaced in fifteen minutes. it would have taken my crew a week. with this kind of technology starfleet could build ships that maintain themselves. they wouldn't need chief engineers. or tactical officers.
a starship without a tactical officer? i can't say i see the point.
you'd think a computer that can do all this would have to be pretty big. our computer's the most advanced in the fleet and it's three decks high.
i suppose you're right.
so where is it?
i don't follow.
i ran a scan of the station a few hours ago. these are the docking berths. we're here. this is the diagnostic room.
"well, that compartment's the only place it could be, but it's barely half the size of this one."
a machine capable of billions of calculations every nanosecond and it can fit inside the proverbial bread box. i'd love to get a look at that.
you could always ask.
i tried. your inquiry was not recognised.
"well, i guess that's that."
not necessarily. this cooling duct runs all the way to the center of the station. i saw an access port in one of the corridors.
this computer might not take kindly to people snooping around.
i haven't seen any no trespassing signs. we're explorers. where's your spirit of adventure?
i left it in a romulan minefield.
almost. got it.
if the captain learns about this we'll both be scrubbing plasma conduits for a month.
mayweather.
"travis, it's the captain. would you mind coming down to launch bay one?"
"i thought that section was off-limits, sir."
"not anymore. i could use a hand, ensign."
"aye, sir."
are you sure this is the right direction?
"evening, sub-commander."
captain? hello? hello?
do you know how stupid that little stunt was? you could just as easily been transported out into space. you're senior officers. you're supposed to be setting an example for the rest of the crew.
"it was my idea, sir."
i think lieutenant reed is old enough to make his own decisions.  you've made it clear to me that you think discipline aboard enterprise has gotten a little too lax. i'm beginning to agree with you. you're both restricted to quarters until further notice. dismissed.
"yes, sir."
"aye, sir."
hold on. did you notice anything interesting when you were in there?
depends on what you mean by interesting.
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
you're needed in launch bay one immediately.
what happened?
"he's dead, captain."
the subcutaneous burns are consistent with an isolytic shock but i can't be certain until i perform a full postmortem. i'll keep you apprised.
it looks like he was trying to tap into the eps grid when this relay overloaded.
why the hell would he come down here during his off hours and start tampering with the power systems?
i don't get it. travis would have checked with me before doing any maintenance.
did you notify the crew that this section was off-limits?
yes.
"well, apparently somebody didn't get the message. what time did he go off duty?"
eighteen hundred hours.
malcolm and i saw him on the station about a half an hour later. he was having dinner with hoshi.
talk to her. see if he said anything to her about this. and go over the comm. logs. i want to know if he talked to anyone else.
it might be a good idea to check his quarters as well.
post a security detail outside every section that's under repair.
"aye, sir."
a member of my crew is dead. we don't know what happened.
your inquiry was not recognised.
my helmsman was killed in launch bay one. we think it happened while that section was off-limits.
all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction.
we're aware of that. you must have some kind of record of what happened.
all personnel are required to vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction.
i need to talk to a person. someone who can access your database and tell me what happened.
your inquiry was not recognised.
who built this station? what species?
your inquiry was not recognised.
what species?
any damage to these facilities will be charged to your vessel.
"computer, begin recording. subject's name, ensign travis mayweather. human male. weight, seventy two kilograms. age, twenty six earth years. far too young to be on this table. cellular decay suggests that death occurred at approximately twenty three thirty hours. preliminary cause of death, ventricular fibrillation induced by an isolytic shock. the vascular system appears to have functioned as a conduit for the discharge. the musculature shows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway. there are subcutaneous burns over approximately twelve percent of the body.  the right phalanges and metacarpus exhibit signs of multiple thermal fractures. computer, pause. ensign? this is not an ideal time."
i wanted to say goodbye.
you may find this disturbing.
i've seen a body before. fifteen of them on that alien ship.
it's different when it's someone you know personally.
"i was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes. travis called me down to decon a few weeks ago. he said that he brought some kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard. he said it might be sentient, that the captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it."
i don't recall that.
there was no lifeform. it was only strawberry gelatine. i told him i was going to get him back. i'm sorry.
it might comfort you to know he felt very little pain. an isolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous. that's odd.
what?
"they're dead. all of them. excuse me, ensign."
anything?
no. it doesn't look like travis used the comm. system last night. crewman hayes says she passed him on his way to the launch bay but they didn't speak. she said he seemed to be in quite a hurry.
what's this?
it's a letter to his sister. it was on the monitor when i came in. i'm afraid there isn't much here. he mentions something about cancelling breakfast with him.
that was last week. i had to postpone it. have we been able to locate his parents?
"sub-commander t'pol's working on it, but it could take some time. cargo ships aren't always easy to track down."
archer.
"it's doctor phlox, captain. i need to see you right away."
did you find something?
"as a matter of fact, i did. this is not ensign mayweather."
what?
"it's a nearly perfect replica. i've never seen a lifeform duplicated in such extraordinary detail, from its epidermis down to its cellular proteins. this is remarkable work."
"if it's so perfect, how do you know it's not him?"
you recall what happened to crewman fisher last month after our visit to tessik prime?
he came down with rigelian fever.
i inoculated the entire crew to prevent an outbreak. would you mind rolling up your sleeve?
"the vaccine contained millions of genetically altered microbes. most of them are still in your bloodstream. they typically survive for, oh, at least several weeks."
every one of the alien microbes in this body is dead.
couldn't they have been killed by the isolytic shock?
"these microbes thrive on isolytic energy. if anything, they would have multiplied. i believe that someone, or something, has abducted ensign mayweather and left this facsimile in his place."
apparently bulkheads aren't the only thing this station can replicate.
"it's ironic, in a way. the station can duplicate a dead human body in all its exquisite detail, yet a living, simple, one-celled organism is beyond its capability."
i've located ensign mayweather's parents.
you'd better hold off. their son may still be alive. you and trip managed to get pretty far inside the station. how close do you think you got to the computer core?
we were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors.
think you could find a way to get past them?
i believe so.
our repairs will be complete in nineteen minutes. the station's expecting us to depart.
bridge to engineering.
tucker here.
"trip,"
have you prepared our payment?
"the canisters are almost ready, sir."
don't be in such a hurry.
"two hundred litres of warp plasma, as promised."
please place your compensation on the transport platform.
"hold on. hold on. there's a couple of problems we need to discuss first. now, i'm not real happy with the quality of some of your work. are you listening to me?"
please place your compensation on the transport platform.
i've looked at the bolt couplings you used to attach the new hull plating. i'm afraid they're not up to starfleet specs. and the subspace amplifier you repaired? we're picking up distortion on all the high-band frequencies.
please place your compensation on the transport platform.
we're not paying until we sort this out.
what guarantee do i have that these duranium pins won't fly out the instant we jump to warp?
your inquiry was not recognised.
"on my world, we have an expression. the customer's always right. maybe you should make that part of your programme. i want to know how someone files a grievance around here."
"it's there, about five metres ahead."
sounds like you've got more important things to deal with.
incursion detected in primary data core. vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised.
i'm detecting one human biosign.
are they alive?
their vital organs appear to be functioning. they've suffered severe neurological damage.
incursion detected in primary data core. vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised.
"their synaptic pathways have been reconfigured, integrated into the computer core."
incursion detected in primary data core. vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised.
captain.
incursion detected in primary data core. vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised.
three of the station's arms have just clamped on to the hull.
polarise the hull plating.
there's no effect.
stand by weapons.
they're going offline.
the station's tapped in to the ship's umbilical ports. it's overriding our command functions.
try to lock out the main computer.
i can't. our access codes have been scrambled.
sir?
"it's okay, travis. we're taking you home."
right here.
archer to the bridge.
the comm.'s down.
travis?
on his way to sickbay. what's our status?
it's been better. the station's got us by the thrusters.
impulse engines?
offline.
we're losing main power.
life support's failing.
"malcolm, i think it's time we deliver our payment."
"it did some heavy damage, sir. power levels are dropping, but the plasma hasn't ignited the o2 conduits yet."
"it needs to reach three thousand degrees, malcolm. be patient."
"yes, sir."
i'm reading secondary explosions throughout the station.
command functions are coming back online.
engines?
impulse and thrusters.
one of those arms is still locked onto the hull.
"if we don't disengage soon, we'll be incinerated."
full thrusters.
it's no good. and if i fired up the impulse engines we'd probably tear off half the saucer section.
can you launch a torpedo?
"at this range, sir, i wouldn't recommend it."
"i agree, but i don't think we have much choice."
"one more, lieutenant!"
get us out of here.
you look pretty good for a dead guy. how're you feeling?
"much better, sir. thank you. the doctor told me what happened. i'm not sure i understand."
we're still trying to figure that out for ourselves.
i may be able to shed some light on the subject.
"it seems to be some kind of interface designed to convert neural impulses into binary code. essentially, the station was using your brain to enhance its processing power."
why would it do that?
the cerebral cortex is the most sophisticated computer known to exist.
what about all those other people?
"according to t'pol's scans most of them had been there for years. the damage to their brains was irreversible. fortunately, you were removed before any permanent injury occurred."
when can i have my helmsman back?
"i'd like to observe him for another twenty four hours, if you don't mind."
"captain's mess, friday morning, oh eight hundred. don't be late."
"sounds good, sir."
"starfleet didn't send us out here to humiliate ourselves. how long were we in orbit, grovelling? six days?"
"five, sir, and it wasn't exactly grovelling."
"apologising, asking forgiveness, just because we ate lunch in front of them on our own ship months ago. i call that grovelling."
they were offended.
the kreetassans manufacture plasma injectors. we need one.
so we spend six days grovelling.
five days.
"and when they finally agree to talk to us, we go down. and what do they do? they keep us waiting for twelve hours and then send us packing. no explanation, no plasma injector. just leave, go back to your ship."
we obviously offended them again.
"maybe my hair's parted on the wrong side. i'm exhausted, and i've had it with these people."
go ahead.
"the three of you are clear to go, but i'm afraid i'll need to keep porthos for a while."
what's the problem?
he picked up a pathogen of some kind on the surface. neither decon agent has been effective.
what are you going to do?
i'm not sure yet. i'll let you know as soon as i run some tests.
"feel better, porthos."
doc'll have you good as new before you know it. i might even break the no-cheese rule tonight.
"sorry, fella. you got to stay."
"we're playing with fire, captain. it's just a matter of time before this injector gives up the ghost."
you've got four more. the ship can run on four.
"yeah, but it can't run on three. you know what happens at warp speed when you've only got three plasma injectors online."
what are the odds of us losing another one before we find a replacement?
"i'm not comfortable with four, captain. we need five. what the hell happened down there, anyway?"
t'pol thinks we insulted them again.
how? you didn't eat cabbage before you left.
"i was a perfect gentleman. we're going to have to go somewhere else to find you your injector, trip. these people are impossible."
"their components are metallurgically sound, dependable. we could look for six months and not find anything half as compatible. you're a trained diplomat. take the high road. there's got to be some way you can kiss and make up."
"i'll have t'pol see if she can find out what we did, but i'm not promising anything."
i went to decon. i thought you were there with porthos. is every
it's all right to pet him. you'll have to use the isolation gloves.
did you run your tests?
"his auto-immune system is collapsing. i've isolated the pathogen, broken down its protein sequence. i can't explain it, captain. it shouldn't be affecting him like this, but it is."
so what are you doing?
running more tests. i'm sure i'll come up with something.
how sure? could this be life-threatening?
it's too early to tell.
didn't we send his genome to the kreetassans along with ours?
i transmitted them myself before you left enterprise.
so shouldn't they have noticed there's a pathogen in their atmosphere that his immune system can't handle?
"they should have, assuming they took the time to check."
"i'm told i've offended these people twice. once for eating in front of them, the second time, i don't even know what for. but if their carelessness has hurt porthos or, god forbid, ends up killing him, they're going to find out what being offended is all about."
"porthos has no intention of giving up, and neither do i."
"you hear that, boy?"
we're all pulling for you.
did you reach them?
yes.
and?
i think we should discuss this in your ready room.
well?
do you recall the stand of trees outside the hall of diplomacy?
what are you talking about?
"they're alvera trees, over three hundred years old."
that's fascinating. did you apologise for whatever we did wrong? are we going to get our plasma injector?
"the kreetassans consider the alvera trees cultural treasures. apparently, porthos urinated on one of them."
and that's what they're insulted about?
it is understandable.
"well, maybe if they'd bothered to read the genetic profile we sent they'd have told us to leave the dog on the ship, and then he wouldn't have had an opportunity to pee on one of their precious trees."
i conveyed your sincerest apologies to the chancellery. they're discussing possible acts of contrition.
where the hell do you get off conveying my sincerest apologies? they're the ones who should be sorry.
i don't need to remind you that commander tucker is relying on us.
there are some things more important than plasma injectors.
are you referring to your pride?
"i'll tell you one thing, sub-commander. if anything happens to porthos, i'll be the one watering their alvera trees."
if you were a married man i'd be wondering if your wife had thrown you out.
"i just thought it might cheer porthos up if i slept here tonight. that is, if it's all right with you."
i don't think your dog is in any condition to know whether you're here or not.
"well then, maybe it'll cheer me up."
be my guest. take your pick.
how's porthos doing?
"my sub-mammalian database contains no pertinent files on bugles, but there's sufficient information on similar chordata."
beagles.
yes.
"let me ask you a question, doc, just out of curiosity. are there any dogs on your homeworld?"
"the denobulan lemur is highly sought-after. it's not exactly a dog, but you could say it's doglike. it has a tail, fur. most have one head."
did your medical training include any
"captain, please. you needn't be concerned. i hold six degrees in interspecies veterinary medicine."
"i thought you were just, you know, a people doctor."
"as a matter of fact i've also earned degrees in dentistry, hematology, botanical pharmacology."
"i'm impressed. so, how's he doing?"
i believe i've eliminated the pathogen. the question is whether the treatment i've devised will stabilise his auto-immune system before
before what?
"in a few hours, i'll have a more detailed prognosis."
"before what, doctor?"
"there are many harmless strains of bacteria that can become lethal when the immune system is compromised, but it is too early to be thinking about that. now, we should both try to get a few hours of rest. if there are any changes in his vital signs the alarms are quite loud. good night."
"i would have brought you some cheese, but doctor phlox wouldn't have let me give you any."
"doctor, are you all right?"
"i'm sorry, captain. did i wake you? just trimming my toenails. they grow quite rapidly. have to keep them groomed at least once a week."
just wanted to be sure you're okay.
thanks for your concern. good night.
"i'm sorry, captain. did i wake you again?"
what the hell's going on?
feeding time.
don't be greedy.
how long was i asleep?
nearly an hour.
does this go on every night?
only when i'm here. they're very demanding when they know i'm in sickbay.
great. porthos?
i'll still need at least a couple of hours.
is he comfortable?
he's fast asleep.
i'm glad to see someone is. i'll check back in a couple of hours.
how's your dog?
nice of you to ask. we'll know in a couple of hours.
have you heard from your friends on the surface?
not yet.
i guess they haven't finished compiling their list of punishments.
they're not interested in punishing you. they only want an appropriate apology.
i'm sorry.
for what?
just practicing.
"you shouldn't have brought your dog on a diplomatic mission, especially considering we had previously offended the kreetassans."
they knew we were bringing him. we even sent his genetic specs.
they could have asked us to leave him behind. they didn't. porthos has the right to a little fresh air.
you're once again ignoring the consequences of your actions.
what's that supposed to mean?
you obviously place more importance on the quality of the air your pet breathes than on the quality of the plasma that drives your ship.
what the hell does one have to do with the other? isn't it logical i could care about my ship and my dog?
i'm not questioning your pluralities. i'm questioning your priorities.
i really thought you were beginning to understand something about human feelings.
not when it pertains to primitive quadrupeds who haven't developed the ability to speak or to use a toilet.
what's the matter?
i obviously can't keep up with you.  t'pol.
we've just received a transmission from the kreetassans.
it's their reconciliation demands. the captain's not going to believe this.
"you'd be surprised, hoshi."
"captain, i didn't."
"it's all right, ensign."
we're on our way.
"well, this isn't so bad. i was sure there'd be something in here about standing on one foot with my eyes shut, reciting the night before christmas. i'm going back to sickbay to see if i can get an hour's sleep before the doctor's results come through. let me know if this fits with your definition of an appropriate apology."
do we have a chainsaw on board?
what's happening?
he's gone into anaphylactic shock. his body's rejecting the treatment i selected.
you said we'd know in a few hours if this would work.
exactly. it's not working.
is he going to die?
"fill this with five cc's of tetrasol. it's the blue fluid, second on the right. five cc's."
five cc's.
i don't think so.
what?
you asked me if he was going to die.
are you trying a different treatment? let me guess. we'll know in.
"a couple of hours, yes. how are things progressing with the kreetassans?"
"they've got a perfectly good plasma injector sitting on a shelf somewhere. but will they share it with us? not until i make a fool of myself by going through some series of ritual apologies. the fact that porthos is on death's doorstep doesn't seem to bother any of them. they're the ones who should be apologising, not me. t'pol thinks i care more about my dog than my ship. isn't that delightful."
why does t'pol's opinion concern you?
"she's my science officer, my second-in-command. she should know more than anyone aboard how dedicated i am to this mission. to every member of my crew."
you didn't answer my question.
porthos has one paw in beagle heaven because these jerks didn't bother to look at his genetic profile. am i supposed to ignore that?
"i would think you'd be more interested in commander tucker's opinion. you've known him for many years, if i'm not mistaken."
"it would be nice to have all five plasma injectors working but it's not essential. we can do fine with four, and the fifth one just started to act up. we might get another ten light years out of it."
have you considered that your anger may encompass more than just porthos and the kreetassans?
what?
how long has it been since you were intimate with a woman?
what!
how long has it been.
"i heard you! i suppose you're going to tell me you have a degree in psychiatry, too."
absolutely.
no way. not a chance. porthos is the only patient you're treating right now. you got that? let me know if there's any change.
archer to commander tucker. captain archer
to commander tucker.
"something wrong, captain?"
"sorry to wake you, trip, but i need to see you in sickbay."
give me a minute.
captain wants to see me.
he's in there.
sir?
come on in.
"what happened, sir? you look terrible."
i'm fine. it's porthos who's not doing so well.
"i'm sorry to hear it, sir. is there something i could do?"
how long has it been since you've been intimate with a woman?
excuse me?
"forget it. i'm sorry i woke you up, trip. i just need some more information on that faulty injector. if we take it offline, try to repair it, what kind of stress will that put on the other four?"
"it's a matter of time. the longer we have to rely on four injectors, the greater the stress. problem is, i have no idea how long it would take to repair the one that's malfunctioning."
and if the stress gets too high?
probably be down to three.
and?
"well, with three injectors, we'd be lucky to reach warp speed."
go get some sleep.
"i had a grade school teacher who was certain i stole a pencil off her desk. i think it was a pencil. she wasn't going to let me go on the field trip to pensacola unless i apologised. my mother told me i should tell her i was sorry, but i said i didn't steal the damn pencil. you know what she told me? it's okay to apologise when you shouldn't have to, just as long as you don't mean it."
why haven't you adjusted your time to our capital city?
i apologise. we weren't aware that it was required.
it isn't a requirement. it is simply a courtesy. something your species doesn't seem to understand.
i'll explain it to the captain immediately.
"you might also explain to your captain that it's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission. if he has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us, he'd be wise to pay us the courtesy of responding."
i understand. i'll
i'll let him know.
keep your head down! no matter what i do to secure her cage she always finds a way to get out.
i thought you said your bat was supposed to be terrified of that thing.
"it should have been. pyrithian moon hawks eat these bats. i know i got the silhouette right, and i mastered the call years ago."
"that stuff isn't poisonous, is it?"
"no, i'll be fine."
what now?
we need to find her before we can catch her. she'll stay up high. have you thought any more about why t'pol's opinion is so important to you?
"it's two thirty in the morning and i'm hunting an escaped bat. that's all i'm thinking about right now, doctor. that and porthos."
"sexual tension, captain. there's no doubt in my mind."
by the air duct. do you see it?
that's just the filter bracket. for the past few months i've noticed increasing friction between you and the sub-commander. you must understand that i'm trained to observe these things.
"with all do respect to your training, you're wrong. t'pol and i have been getting along just fine, so let it alone."
when one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour. such as inordinate anger toward comparisons made between their ship and their beagle.
"listen, doc, there's no sexual attraction."
she's coming back down! watch out!
don't let her in the corridor!
"hey, are you all right? what are they trying to do to you?"
"the kreetassans called, sir."
what for?
they're anxious to get your response to their last transmission.
it's the middle of the night.
they also suggested that we should synchronise our time to their capital city.
did they?
"it's not a requirement, sir, just a courtesy."
"thank you, ensign."
how's porthos?
i'll let you know in a couple of hours.
everything okay?
nothing new. i'll stay with him.
thanks.
unless you'd like to continue our discussion regarding sub-commander t'pol.
"we are gathered here today to bid a final farewell to a faithful and kind colleague. a friend who would never hesitate to offer his paw in exchange for a simple smile or a slice of cheese. like his namesake, this quadruped believed we should stand together. 'all for one and one for all'."
when one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour.
go ahead.
"hoshi, you and the dog are clear to go, but i'm afraid i'll need to keep the other two for a while."
what's the problem?
you both picked up a pathogen on the surface. we'll have to try another decon agent.
feel better.
"tell me, captain, have you thought any more about why t'pol's opinion is so important to you? how long has it been since you were intimate with a woman?"
i dreamt porthos died.
let's hope your dream wasn't prophetic.
any indication on how your second treatment's doing?
it doesn't appear to be doing very well.
"an old girlfriend's mother had this beagle i was crazy about. even after her daughter and i broke up, we stayed in touch. when the dog got pregnant, i was the first one she called. four males in the litter. the four musketeers. i've had porthos since he was six weeks old. i grew up with dogs. can't remember not having one. you have any pets when you were a kid?"
my people don't keep pets.
i thought you said something about the denobulan lemur being highly sought after.
"oh, very much so. their kidneys are considered a great delicacy."
i thought you might be hungry.
how very kind.
was there something on their list about apologising on a full stomach?
you read the kreetassan's document?
"sorry. sorry, i'm a little on edge. i haven't slept very much but i'm doing the breast i, the best i can."
"i understand. ensign sato and i have broken down the reconciliation demands into specific categories, if you're interested in reviewing them."
my only concern right now is porthos.
i'm sorry to have interrupted.
"no. no, it, it's okay. when you get back to the bridge, why don't you send me your lips. lisp. list."
two pillarian slips within thirty seconds. interesting.
what are you doing?
"my treatment was effective, at least partially. his immune system is stabilising but his pituitary gland was severely damaged. it's all but disintegrated. bring me the small grey cage on the second shelf. the one with the blue top."
what's in here?
a calrissian chameleon. fill this for me.
i'll need to alter its dna to avoid rejection but its pituitary gland should be compatible with your dog's.
you're going to perform a transplant from a lizard?
"unless you have a better suggestion. it's a shame, actually. the chameleon secretes a rare toxin that's very useful in treating respiratory infections. she's the last one i have."
what's the tank for?
i'll need to super-hydrate the canine in order to minimize the shock to his pulmonary system.
you're going to drown my dog?
"only for an hour, captain. there should be no problem resuscitating him once the surgery's complete."
how many times have you done this before?
never.
has anyone done this before?
not to my knowledge.
"you know, this isn't some guinea pig you're working on here. this is porthos, my beagle, my pal. from what you're telling me the closest thing your people have to pets are furry little things that go well with onions."
"perhaps you're right, captain. perhaps i'm insensitive to the bond between you and your subservient quadruped. i'll leave the procedure up to you. but whatever your decision, make it quickly."
just for the sake of argument let's say that some of my anger toward t'pol had a component of sexual tension to it. i'm not saying it does but just for the sake of argument.
yes?
"what do you mean, yes? you're the psychiatrist. what am i supposed to do about it? am i supposed i to ignore it? am i supposed to say something to her?"
neither.
neither?
"if you were ignoring it, you obviously wouldn't be seeking my opinion especially under these circumstances. as for discussing it with the sub-commander that's entirely up to you, but i can't imagine an outcome that would do anything but make matters worse. pass me the auto-suture, please. the yellow one."
when will we know if the transplant's working?
one step at a time. first we need to resuscitate him.
"so i can't ignore it, and i can't talk about it. what do you suggest i do?"
"be aware of it, captain. simply be aware of it. you'd be surprised what a difference that'll make. lower the fluidic temperature twelve degrees."
"if porthos pulls through, will he need a special diet or treatments having a chameleon's pituitary gland?"
you may have trouble finding him. he'll have the ability to blend into his background when frightened.
you're kidding.
"yes, i am."
does your expertise on sexual tension come from professional training or firsthand experience?
i do have three wives.
and they each have
"two husbands, besides myself."
sounds very complicated.
very. why else be polygamous?
"so, these three wives."
"each have three husbands. a total of seven hundred and twenty relationships, forty two of which have romantic possibilities."
you told me you had five children. how many are there in this whole extended family?
"thirty one, at last count."
you must miss them. you've been away for over two years.
"i'm ready for the synaptic inductor, the small blue one. my children all left the nest years ago, captain."
i would have never guessed. you don't look that old.
"i'll take that as a compliment. my two daughters, i'm proud to say, followed in my footsteps. one's a surgeon, the other's a biochemist."
how about the other three?
"my eldest son's an artist. a potter, actually. he lives in the same town as his mother. creates beautiful things."
and the other two?
my two younger sons and i never saw eye-to-eye. i'm afraid we haven't spoken in quite some time.
i'm sorry. i shouldn't have.
"perfectly all right. you asked me if i missed them. the answer is yes, every one of them. the children, the wives, even the other husbands. but we denobulans live a long time, captain, and right now there is nowhere i'd rather be than serving with the interspecies medical exchange aboard this wonderful vessel of yours."
"listen, doc, however this turns out i want to apologise for accusing you of being insensitive before."
"as i recall, you accused my entire species of being insensitive. then i apologise to you and all your fellow denobulans."
"well, i can't speak for the others, but, on behalf of myself, i accept. and to think t'pol told me you were incapable of apologising."
i didn't think your shift began until oh nine hundred.
i took the liberty of temporarily synchronising our clocks to the kreetassan's capital city.
"just a courtesy?  ensign, will you join me?"
have a seat. you've read the list?
"yes, sir. sub-commander t'pol and i broke it down and"
"she told me. the last part, just before the end, that little expression that gets repeated. do you know what i'm talking about?"
it's a couplet from one of their oldest political documents.
their pronunciation guide doesn't make any sense. i'm going to need some help.
come in. sub-commander.
mister tucker reports that the new plasma injector is operating well within starfleet parameters.
did he tell you they gave us two spares out of the kindness of their hearts?
evidently the finesse you exhibited outside the hall of diplomacy was appreciated.
since i've been getting so much practice giving apologies i thought i might give you one.
that's not necessary.
"yeah, it is. i've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't gotten much sleep. my dog"
there's no need to apologise.
"whatever friction there's been between us, i'd like to try to minimise it."
friction is to be expected whenever people work in close quarters for extended periods of time.
i guess that's always been true. especially when the people are of the opposite sex.
"then it's good that you're my superior officer. that we're not in a position to allow ourselves to become attracted to one another, hypothetically. if we were, the friction that you speak of could be much more problematic."
"no apologies, captain."
i promise.
i hear things went very well on the surface.
"i doubt i would have even gone down, there if it hadn't been for you, doc. i owe you one."
"you'll be pleased to know that while you were gone, things went very well up here, too."
the transplant?
not the slightest sign of rejection.
can i see him?
by all means.
hey.
"it's been one hell of a night, hasn't it? how soon can he leave?"
now's as good a time as any.
but he's
unconscious? nonsense. he's just asleep.
porthos.
"come on, boy. yeah. we're going home. sickbay's all yours."
"you're welcome back anytime, captain."
what are you doing in my chair?
i didn't touch anything. i just like to look inside the ships that come here.
you should have asked.
you might have said no.
"well, what do you think?"
"well, it's a little small and your thruster controls are hard to reach."
maybe you need longer arms.
how fast can it go?
"she's designed for one quarter impulse, but, i've been able to squeeze a little more out of her."
you're a pilot?
engineer. commander trip tucker.
q'ell.
nice to meet you.
could you teach me how to fly it? i can drive the crawler that we use to move our drill rigs.
"tell you what. i'll be heading back up to the ship later. you can come along, if it's all right with your folks. i'll give you a tour."
really?
two power cells. we need six.
we can't spare that many. maybe three.
do you have any idea how much labour it takes to refine a litre of deuterium?
"actually, no. i'd enjoy seeing how your facility works."
"we have three months of good weather, captain. three months to pump all the deuterium we can before the winter. we don't have time to give tours. five power cells for two hundred litres. i can't do any better."
our medical stores are running low.
four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare.
all right. but only if you can repair our pumps.
commander tucker and his team will do the best they can.
"i expect you to leave orbit in two days. if the pumps are working, you'll leave with the deuterium. if not, you'll leave without it. are we agreed?"
agreed.
"it's yours, if you'd like it."
i wouldn't know what to feed it.
her needs are modest. a nutrient broth every three or four days. less often when she's working.
working?
she'll ingest a little blood while she's healing an injured artery.
"thank you, but i'll just take some vascular adhesive."
"try this, instead."
an auto-suture.
i'm surprised you don't have one.
this is a very expensive piece of equipment. i can't.
"nonsense. please. cardio-stimulator, neural shock kit. i had no idea processing deuterium was such a dangerous business."
it can be.
i've only heard of hexatriol being used to treat serious plasma burns.
deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when it's ignited.
i hope you won't need it. is there something wrong?
no. i'd better get back.
of course.
thank you again.
"you've been to other colonies that trade deuterium, haven't you?"
several.
are they all this rustic?
not usually.
their equipment's falling apart. half these structures look like they're about to collapse. phlox tells me they don't even have basic medical supplies. deuterium is a highly valuable commodity. you'd think these people would be better off.
"we're here to trade with them, not judge their living conditions."
then why do they need us to finish fixing their pumps in two days? what's the hurry?
"lieutenant, a ship just dropped out of warp. six hundred thousand kilometres and closing."
i see her.
it's probably more deuterium customers.
"i'm reading twelve biosigns, all klingon."
you'll want to keep an eye on those phase inverters. they tend to depolarise.
pump six.
korok's ship is entering orbit.
i thought we had three more days.
secure the pumps. get everyone inside.
some kind of trouble?
help me close these induction valves.
what's going on? who's korok?
they must realise that you trade with other ships.
they believe that we have an exclusive arrangement.
"if they think anyone's been here before them, they get very angry."
"please, don't get involved. we'll talk to them."
archer to enterprise.
"go ahead, captain."
have the klingons detected enterprise yet?
"no indication, sir."
"travis, adjust your orbit."
keep enterprise out of sight.
"aye, sir."
my old friend.
we weren't expecting you so soon. we've had trouble with two of our pumps.
my crew's hungry. let's have food and drink. then we'll discuss business.
your deuterium. we don't have all of it. we did our best but we need more time.
can you make out what they're saying?
tessic is explaining that their yield isn't what they'd hoped.
good ears.
without those pumps we couldn't operate at full capacity.
i sense what you're about to say is not going to make me happy.
"we can give you eighty thousand litres. if you'll give us one more week, we'll have the rest."
"you've had enough time. we'll take all of it, now."
"we don't have it. i told you, two pumps were down."
they all appear to be working.
we were just able to repair them.
you're lying!
leave him alone. you'll get your deuterium.
"wait, please."
"i can get deuterium anywhere. i come here because i like you, when you show me hospitality and respect."
"you take everything we own, and you want us to respect you."
i'll give you four days. have it all ready.  hijol!
let's get him inside.
so this is your exclusive arrangement?
it's not your concern.
how long have these bullies been pushing you around?
five seasons. they take all the first yield deuterium we can extract.
hold still.
"after they leave, we manage to pull a few thousand litres out of the deep strata, but it takes weeks and it's so full of impurities we can barely refine it."
it still brings in a decent price. we make enough to get through the winter.
barely.
have you tried contacting your homeworld?
it's too far away.
you must have weapons. some way to defend yourselves. how many of them are there?
usually seven.
seven? you've got them outnumbered nine or ten to one.
"you've never seen a klingon in battle, have you? we tried to stand up to them once, three seasons ago. five of us died fighting them. then they killed three more to prove their point."
one of them was his father.
maybe there's something we can do.
"just take your two hundred litres and go. if you're here when they come back, they'll kill you."
mister reed.
"the klingon ship's gone to warp, sir. i'm sending a shuttlepod down."
we'll be at the landing site.
"i'll catch up with you later, captain. sorry i never got to give you that tour."
i once saw a kellenite ship with cannons and torpedoes.
most big ships carry weapons.
like enterprise.
"yeah, like enterprise."
you could have fought the klingons. beaten them.
maybe.
why didn't you try?
it's not that simple.
come in.
the deuterium's been stowed. two hundred litres. should i instruct ensign mayweather to break orbit?
so that's it? we just take our deuterium and leave? they work their asses off to provide for their families and then the klingons just stroll in and rob them blind. does that seem right to you? malcolm tells me that klingon ship isn't much more than a freighter. i'd lay odds they're no match for enterprise.
and if they withdraw? what will keep them from coming back after we've gone?
"we could try to contact the klingon high council. we saved klaang from the suliban, we pulled one of their battle cruisers out of a gas giant. i say they owe us a favour."
i doubt these marauders answer to the high council.
i already know where vulcans stand on interfering with other cultures but this isn't a culture. seventy six settlers are being preyed upon. if this were an earth colony i'd be grateful if someone showed up to give me a hand.
"captain, this may surprise you, but i agree. however, short of killing the klingons any action we take will only make the situation worse."
i just hate the idea of turning our backs.
need a hand?
control arm is jammed. i could use some help with the release valve.
okay.
turn it to the left.
this one?
thought you'd be off charting your next start system by now.
sometimes i have a bad habit of overstaying my welcome.
you obviously didn't come down here in the middle of the night to help me with this crawler.
seems to me this crawler's the least of your problems.
we've been through this before. it's not your concern. give it another turn.
"you said they've been coming here for what, five seasons? how much longer do you plan on letting this go on? another five?"
that's good. leave it there. reconnect this coolant line. intake's above your head.
i had a talk with my tactical officer. we're confident you have the ability to defend yourselves.
we already tried. there are eight people buried not far from here who can attest to that.
it would be different this time. we would help you prepare.
"i don't want your help. i'm responsible for my people, not you. they put their trust in me. they depend on me. i'm supposed to protect them! look at me i can barely keep this crawler running. you say you and your tactical officer want to help us. even if you do once you're gone, we'll be alone again waiting for them to come back."
"there's a saying on my world. give a man a fish and he eats for a day. teach him to fish, and he eats for a lifetime."
i was hoping for a bit more to work with.
they do a decent job keeping the shib'a lizards from chewing on the power couplings.
with a few modifications these should be effective against more than lizards.
you must have a well stocked armoury onboard enterprise.
but this battle won't be won with firepower. deception and surprise can be just as potent as brute force.
klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics are crude. they're slow to adapt to changing circumstances.
this all sounds very ambitious. what exactly are you expecting us to do?
you're going to lure them into a trap.
what kind of trap?
"a very hot one. the deuterium in those wellheads, how much pressure is it under? three, four thousand millibars?"
five.
should create some interesting fireworks.
you'll never get the klingons near that deuterium field. they know it isn't safe.
"they may be crude, but they're not fools."
that's where deception and surprise come in. did you bring the map i asked you for?
it's right here.
"the structures in the colony, they're mostly modular, right?"
they're all modular. most deuterium fields are depleted within three or four years at most. it forces us to be itinerant.
so you're saying you could relocate these buildings in a relatively short time.
it depends where you're suggesting we relocate them.
"about fifty metres to the south, right here."
what good would that do? the terrain there is no different than where the town is now.
"that's what we're counting on. if we can move the structures and the rigs, everything should look pretty much like it did yesterday."
everything except the well-heads.
"they'll have to be capped off, and camouflaged."
we can do that.
"the gullies on this hillside, are they deep enough to hide in?"
if you keep your head down.
we'll shuttle small groups to enterprise for whatever training we have time for. preferably people who have experience with weapons.
we've got three days. we should get to work.
what are we waiting for?
"one more metre. okay, shut her down."
you ready?
and begin.
shib'a lizards don't move that fast.
"do you mind, lieutenant?"
i can see your finger tensing on the trigger before you fire. it's throwing off your aim. i used to make the same mistake. keep your eye on the target and don't squeeze the trigger until you have a clear shot.
try again.
i think the table was a little bit to the left.
thanks. how are things going with the pumps?
it'll be tomorrow before they're all in place. we started capping off the heads.
let me know.
i got it. if you need more people.
i rigged two ignition sequences. the perimeter and the centre are on separate circuits.
i thought taking the town apart was tough. but putting it back together.
"this plan is a long shot, isn't it?"
do you think it's a mistake?
i didn't say that.
"i've never liked bullies, trip. not on earth and not out here."
"klingons carry disrupters but they prefer to use bladed weapons in combat. the two most common being the bat'leth, a curved, bilateral sword and the mek'leth, a two-pronged dagger. the bat'leth can decapitate its victim with one stroke while the mek'leth is typically used to slash the throat or disembowel. i cannot teach you to defend yourselves against these weapons. the vulcan martial art, suus mahna, takes years to master. however, i can teach you a simple evasive technique. ensign mayweather."
"since i don't have a bat'leth, this will have to suffice."
try to strike me. you won't hurt me.
it's not you that i'm worried about.
that was called the navorkot. it isn't difficult to learn. who would like to try first?
thanks.
lieutenant reed said i'd have to hide in the canyons when the klingons come back.
he doesn't want you to get hurt.
but i want to help. i can shoot a shib'a lizard from forty metres.
malcolm's got this rule. you've got to be taller than the gun to use it.
i don't want to hide.
"shooting at a lizard is a whole lot different than shooting at a person, and lizards don't shoot back. when those klingons show up i want you to do exactly what lieutenant reed says. understood?"
"yes, sir."
"we had a little trouble moving one of the pumps, but it's in place now. we're ready."
"i just hope everyone survives this. your people, as well as mine."
"we left earth just over a year ago to explore, to meet people like you. we'd only been out of spacedock for three days when we found ourselves in a full-fledged firefight with some pretty nasty characters called the suliban. i got shot in the leg. just before i passed out i remembered thinking this isn't what i signed up for. i should be mapping star clusters or making first contact with friendly species. but when those suliban started firing at my crew i knew i didn't have any choice but to fight back. i'm not ashamed to admit i was nervous. i'm nervous now. but i know we can do this.  archer."
"the klingon ship just dropped out of warp, captain."
acknowledged.
listen.
what?
the pumps. they're silent.  where's your hospitality? this is no way to treat your friends. show yourselves!
this will cost you more than deuterium!
p'taq!
hey!
come on.
there.
"what are you doing? you'll kill us all. those wellheads, they're under great pressure. if you ignite them you'll incinerate the entire town."
they're making fools of us.
they're hiding in the dirt like targ. they'll learn to show us respect. we'll kill another four. perhaps the boy as well.
captain.
they're too far south.
we've got to get them to move fifty metres to our left.
"everybody, this way."
a little farther. this is good.
a few more metres.
this shouldn't be here.
now.
"they're all yours, tessic."
korok!
i wouldn't do that. there's two more wellheads by your feet. leave here now or we'll ignite them.
p'taq. you'll live to regret this.
"if you're thinking about coming back, i wouldn't advise it. we'll be ready. we're not afraid of you anymore."
we can find deuterium anywhere. yours isn't fit for a garbage scow.
unless you're planning to join starfleet i'm afraid you'll have to give up that chair.
i wish you didn't have to leave.
"yeah, that's one of the tough things about my job. saying goodbye to people like you and your friends. oh, almost forgot."
schematics for enterprise. you said you like to look at starships. this one'll knock your socks off.
thanks. do you think you'll come back?
who knows? our engines need a lot of deuterium.
there must be over a thousand litres here.
two thousand.
our deal was for two hundred.
"our deal was for power cells, medical supplies and repair work. you provided us with much more than that."
"besides, we seem to have a surplus at the moment."
give your crew our thanks.
have a good season.
sub-commander?
yes?
did i wake you?
it's all right. is something wrong?
we've located menos.
where?
less than three days from your present location.
are you certain it's him?
yes.
come in.
good morning.
captain.
toast?
"no, thank you."
what can i do for you?
"admiral forrest will be calling you this afternoon, sir."
"oh, will he? and how would you know that?"
i was contacted by the vulcan high command last night. they've requested my services regarding a matter of security.
and they've already asked admiral forrest?
he should be contacting you this afternoon.
matter of security?
"the admiral will inform you that enterprise will be asked to alter course to the pernaia system, where i will need a shuttlepod and a pilot for three to five days."
you didn't answer my question. what kind of matter of security?
a vulcan ship will rendezvous with the shuttlepod when my mission is completed.
they're sending you to get somebody. somebody you'll be handing over to the vulcans. why you?
admiral forrest will be contacting you this afternoon.
thanks for being so enlightening. dismissed.
did you find the co-ordinates?
"pernaia prime. yes, sir."
"set a course. when we arrive, you'll be piloting the shuttlepod."
where exactly will we be going?
"somewhere in the pernaia system, no doubt. as far as the exact location, admiral forrest doesn't even know that. it seems the sub-commander's on a highly classified mission."
is this pernaia prime inhabited?
the vulcan database says it has a methane-based atmosphere.
"so, she's going to another planet in the system. are we supposed to play some kind of guessing game?"
"no, we're supposed to wait at pernaia prime for t'pol and travis to finish their mission."
and do what in the meantime?
i could use a few days to recalibrate the torpedo launchers.
i could polish all the handles and rails in engineering.
i guess i could purge the impulse reactors.
it's only for a few days. we've got plenty to keep ourselves busy. is there anything specific you and travis are going to need?
"cold-weather gear, restraints and phase pistols."
come in.
"if the vulcan high command doesn't approve of the water polo match i'm watching, i'd be happy to find another."
"your orders to bring me to pernaia came from starfleet, not the high command."
what can i do for you?
i have a personal matter i'd like to discuss.
before i joined the science directorate i was assigned to the ministry of security. i was trained in reconnaissance and retrieval.
"move over, porthos. let the lady sit down. sounds like this is going to be good. come on, sit down."
how long ago are we talking about?
i completed my training seventeen years ago.
go ahead.
are you familiar with a planet called agaron?
"they're close allies with the vulcans, right?"
"not always. agaron was a very corrupt world. when their leaders were first trying to forge an alliance with vulcan they asked for our assistance. that was nearly thirty years ago. hundreds of our agents were surgically altered and sent to infiltrate the most criminal factions of agaron society. eventually, they were instrumental in the overthrow of those factions."
you're not going to tell me you're one of those agents.
"i'm not that old, captain. after the alliance was formalised, the vulcan agents were recalled. they all returned voluntarily, all but nineteen."
i guess even vulcans can fall prey to temptation.
the ministry of security sent a team of newly-trained operatives to retrieve them. i was only able to apprehend five of the six fugitives assigned to me.
so tomorrow you get to pick up number six. why couldn't someone else do it? why you?
the ministry considers it a matter of honour.
"how very vulcan. so, why have you decided to tell me all this?"
i'd like you to come with me.
what?
the man i'm being sent to apprehend is extremely dangerous. it would be wise for me to have assistance.
you said there's a vulcan ship coming. i'm sure they can provide all the assistance you'll need.
"i'd prefer it if you'd come with me, captain."
why?
"i need to be with someone i can trust. if you don't wish to help me, i understand. good night."
what's his name? the man we're going to apprehend.
menos.
see you in the morning.
if you agreed to go with her you must know something about what she's up to.
"we'll be back in three to five days, trip. if that vulcan ship comes snooping around, the last thing you want to tell them is that i'm with t'pol."
why's that? why would you being with her be a problem to them?
"three to five days, trip."
"come on, captain. last night, you were just as frustrated as i was about having to sit on your hands while she goes off and does whatever it is she's going off to do."
"this isn't just a case of curiosity. what if you get hurt, kidnapped? you put me in charge of this ship and you won't tell me where you're going? how am i supposed to be a good temporary captain if i don't know where my people are? tell me that."
"she's got some unfinished business, trip. i'm not sure why, but she needs me to go along. we'll be okay."
there are a lot of definitions of unfinished business. could you be a little more specific?
"you're in charge, commander.  have you given travis the coordinates?"
yes.
have fun.
"before he was sent to agaron, the dorsal lobes of his ears were surgically altered. the ridge on his forehead was added sometime afterward."
why didn't he want to come home?
"he was assigned to infiltrate a cell of smugglers. he learned their craft. he became very proficient at it, amassed a large fortune."
smuggling what?
"synthetic biotoxins used to manufacture transgenic weapons. i spent three months trying to find him. he used his wealth wisely. whenever i'd get close, i'd find he'd left a day or two before."
you never found him?
"only once, on risa. they thought they were invulnerable."
they?
"he. he thought he was invulnerable there, that no one would think to look for him on such a peaceful place."
what happened?
"i got very close. twenty metres, maybe ten."
t'pol?
i never found him again. no one did. not until now.
he's here.
where?
within thirty metres.
"if he sees t'pol, he may try to get to his ship."
he saw me.
which way?
i'm not certain.
i couldn't agree more.
don't move.
you have no jurisdiction here.
follow me.
"come in. gentlemen, come in. glad you could join me."
water polo?
very exciting sport. you should learn more about it.
"please, sit down. i had chef prepare a special lunch. bangers and mash for you, and, denobulan sausage for the doctor."
very nice.
are you sure the captain wouldn't have a problem with you using his dining room?
"acting captain, captain's mess. i don't see a problem. thank you, crewman."
enjoy.
"thank you. oh, i detected a lymphatic virus on board this morning. most likely it sneaked in with one of the deuterium canisters. we should probably inoculate the crew."
why didn't the bio-scanners detect it?
"well, it's a very reliable device, but it's not perfect. the inoculation does have some side effects."
what kind of side effects?
"headache, nausea, diarrhoea. but they would subside in a day or two. do i have your permission?"
i'd hate to be responsible for giving the crew the runs. maybe you should wait till the captain gets back.
i'm afraid the virus will have spread by then. i really need an answer today.
"why don't i get back to you later, doc?"
not too much later.
"while we're on the subject of approvals, i promised captain archer that i'd recalibrate the torpedo launchers. i'll need to divert computer access from main engineering."
that would mean we'd have to power down the warp core.
it'll only be for a day. we're not exactly going anywhere.
we're also not at war. i'm just not comfortable taking the engines offline right now.
"is that the chief engineer talking, or the acting captain?"
let me get back to you.  tucker.
"we were just hailed by the vulcan ship nyran, sir. it's approaching the system at high warp. they're asking to speak with captain archer."
tell them the captain's indisposed at the moment. he'll get back to them in a little while.
"yes, sir."
the captain said not to tell the vulcans he went with t'pol. he was very emphatic about that.
it's going to be difficult to convince them he's indisposed for the next four days.
go ahead.
captain tavek says he has a message from admiral forrest. he seems very anxious to speak with captain archer. what shall i tell him?
i'll get back to you.
"your warrant is valid, but you won't be able to take him. not for at least four hours. we've begun thermalising the landing deck."
we just need to get him to our ship.
there's a half centimetre of xylathoric acid on that deck. i wouldn't recommend it. not if you value those pretty feet of yours.
do you have somewhere we can put him until we leave?
does this look like a prison to you?
any one of these people could be working with him.
the ministry of security very clear about that. he works alone.
i haven't always.
"you're human. and you as well. they wanted to rehabilitate me, bring me home, flatten my forehead and re-point my ears. they wanted to teach me to forget the life they had taught me so carefully how to live. they assumed i had become corrupt. and that left to my own devices i would remain corrupt. three years in a vulcan clinic. rehabilitation. can you blame me for running? i'm not a thief. i'm not a smuggler. i never was. i worked with smugglers. i worked very close with them for a long time. it's what i had been trained to do. do you know how i've survived the last twenty years? how i've fed my family? i haul spent warp injector casings. not a very popular occupation, but a necessary one. a doctor on andoria says that my hemolytic cell count is over three thousand. you don't find too many old men hauling spent injector casings. in my left front pocket, if you don't mind."
i wouldn't. it may be a weapon.
it's a hologram of my family. they won't hurt you.
the injector casings are going to take me away from them soon enough. i don't want to die in a vulcan prison.
the information that i was given says that you buy high grade biotoxins and sell them to anyone who will meet your price.
"if all of the ministry's reports about me were true i could easily shape-shift and slip out of these restraints, or sprout wings and fly to my ship."
why should she believe a fugitive and not her own government?
"because her government sent one hundred nine agents to agaron thirty years ago, and they want all one hundred nine accounted for, right or wrong, dead or alive."
"if you're innocent, i'm sure you'll be given a chance to defend yourself."
"bur i'm guilty. i'm guilty of not returning when i was told to. i'm innocent of selling biotoxins but i'm guilty of being a fugitive. but i don't deserve to go to prison, and i don't deserve to be shot."
we're here to take you to vulcan. no one's going to shoot you.
what about her?
you're a liar.
t'pol!
what are you doing? t'pol?
he's not telling the truth.
where the hell are you going? t'pol!
he says he has a ship full of injector casings.
but the platform's covered with acid!
jossen!
you're sure?
"there's no record of them ever having spoken, but i can't be certain."
has he ever been to earth?
"if he has, the vulcan database doesn't mention it."
i hope they haven't put starfleet yearbook photos into that database. let's get this over with.
captain archer?
yes. is there a problem?
you seem very young for a starfleet captain.
healthy living. you have a message from admiral forrest?
"i'm not certain what this means, but the admiral asked me to inform you that cal beat stanford, seven to three."
i'll be sure to tell him.
tell who?
i'm afraid it's confidential. thank you for relaying the message. archer out.
that wasn't too smart. you could have been hurt. what did you find?
spent injector casings.
you'll have to go through decon when we get back.
i want to speak to menos alone. would you allow me to do that?
"come on, travis. let's see if we can find something to eat."
who is jossen?
"you didn't find what you were looking for, did you?"
who is jossen?
if this is your idea of humour.
tell me who he is.
"jossen was no different than me. he didn't want to be rehabilitated, either."
where did i meet him?
"meet him? on risa. jossen and i were on risa in the tropical zone. we were innocent of the crimes the ministry had accused us of but we were running, all the same. why do you want me to tell you things you already know?"
you're telling me lies.
no. the truth.
"i followed you to risa, no one else. i bribed the tellarite transport captain who brought you there. he told me exactly where to find you. i wasn't looking for anyone else."
then why are you asking me about jossen? he never hurt anyone. he didn't deserve to be hunted down like an animal.
i killed him.
"yes, and he didn't deserve to be killed. he was an innocent man, just like i am."
you really don't remember. how is that possible? why did you kill him? he never would have hurt you.
stop talking.
"you're a vulcan. you're trained to repress the emotion of killing, not the memory of the act."
"i said, stop talking!"
"look what it's done to you, taking an innocent life. bringing me back to vulcan will be no different. you'll be destroying another life. how will that affect you? will you conveniently forget what you're about to do to me?"
where's menos?
get back over there.
"aye, sir."
what happened?
there were seven.
seven what?
"i was sent to bring back seven fugitives, not six."
i don't understand.
"menos had a partner, or a friend. i'm not sure. his name was jossen. i followed them both to risa, not just menos. the day i told you i saw menos and lost him, i saw jossen as well. they tried to escape. jossen fell to the ground. he began to reach for his weapon."
but you fired first?
"i had forgotten all of it, until today."
how?
have you heard of the fullara?
no.
it's an obsolete vulcan ritual where the memory of an event is repressed along with the emotions associated with it.
and you had this.
fullara.
this fullara ritual performed?
"when i returned to vulcan, i was unsettled. i resigned my position with the ministry and sought guidance at the sanctuary of p'jem. for months, one of the elders worked with me to control the guilt, to restrain the despair of having taken a life, but the feelings remained."
why would you feel guilty if this jossen was about to fire at you?
i suppose i was never certain what his intentions were. the elder had no choice but to perform the ritual. when i left the sanctuary i didn't remember anything about jossen or the fullara.
when did it start coming back?
when the first call came in about this new mission. maybe that's why i wanted you with me. what if jossen wasn't a smuggler? what if he was innocent? then it wouldn't have mattered whether he intended to use that weapon or not.
that doesn't make any sense. what's menos been telling you?
"menos's ship was filled with injector casings, nothing else. he has a family. our scans should be able to confirm if he's dying of radiation poisoning."
what's he been telling you?
he kicked over the table!
and you claim you're a peaceful man.
"ironic, isn't it? burning to death on a frozen moon? but i'd rather die here than be brought back and punished for crimes i never committed."
t'pol!
refasten them.
where's menos?
travis! come on.
"where's his ship? your mission is to return him to vulcan, not determine whether he's guilty or innocent. where's his ship?"
he's not aboard.
let's be sure.
we'll all need to go through decon now.
he's not here.
"was that the only way in? go back to the cockpit, travis."
"aye, sir."
get life support fired up if you can. it's pretty cold.
he should've gotten here before us. this ship shouldn't be here.
why risk using his own vessel? he'd know we'd follow him.
so he could've left with any one of those other ships.
any one of them.
you seem okay with that.
"when we return to enterprise i'll inform the vulcan ship that menos escaped. if the high command wishes, they can question as many of the vessels that left here as they can find."
you're giving up a lot easier than i would've guessed.
he's obviously gone.
"we don't know that. he got to you, didn't he? you're beginning to doubt yourself. he figured if he could get you to question what you did seventeen years ago, you'd begin to question what you're doing right now."
i may have killed an innocent man seventeen years ago.
did jossen reach for his weapon or not?
i don't know.
"is that what you remember, or what menos wants you to remember?"
what's the difference?
there's a big difference. he's playing on your guilt. don't you see that?
that's impossible. i went to p'jem. they performed the ritual.
don't give me that! your emotional immune system started to collapse again the minute you remembered what happened that day on risa.
captain.
"what is it, travis?"
"there's something funny up here, sir. think you could take a look?"
what's up?
"after i got the board running, i brought life support up to level three. as soon as i got more light in here, i noticed some condensation on this sub-panel."
there's a hell of a lot of energy flowing through those circuits. any idea what they are?
our scanner showed everything powered down.
"well, obviously something's powered up. there's one way to find out what it is."
"i'm a very patient man, t'pol."
"i was simply waiting for you to leave, but your captain's curiosity has put an end to that. would you please lower your weapon?"
there's some kind of energy field running.
"i don't want to harm t'pol, captain, but i will."
those are violent words for a peaceful man.
"at the moment, i'm a man who needs to survive. there's a locker right next to you. i want you to both put your weapons down and then walk into it. you won't be hurt."
what about her?
t'pol is my guarantee that the two of you will walk quickly and quietly into the locker. please.
the locking code is one six six one. there's a very specific tone when it's entered properly.
you okay?
yes.
we don't do quickly and quietly very well but we are good at arithmetic. it seems there are three of us and only one of you.
stop! please!
"i don't trust this guy, travis. find something to tie him up with."
"aye, sir."
what are you doing?
get up!
stop!
"you're not going to shoot me, t'pol. you're not going to kill another innocent man. this is none of your concern, captain. you know nothing about what happened on risa."
captain?
why did you want me here?
because i trust you.
"then trust me. you were sent to apprehend him, not to judge him."
he's not going to get out of that too quickly.
i think i know why he was so nervous about us firing at him while he was over here. look at this.
biotoxins. if one of our weapons had struck this.
i guess he was hauling more than injector casings after all.
i guess he was.
"what's your status, trip?"
"everything's ready to go, captain. welcome back."
thanks. we'll be going to warp three.
you got it.
now that your secret mission is over you think you can give your chief engineer a little hint about what you were up to?
"did i say warp three? i meant warp four, commander."
"not even a hint? warp four. aye, captain."
come in.
sub-commander. am i about to get another call from admiral forrest?
"no, sir."
"sorry. dealing with these memories it's not going to be easy for you, is it?"
"no, it's not."
if you feel you need a leave of absence.
that won't be necessary. i was much younger then.
you've also spent a lot of time around humans lately.
you do have a way of putting questionable actions behind you.
"when you don't have the ability to repress emotions, you learn to deal with them and move on. was there something else?"
if you ever need someone you can trust.
i won't forget.
i need to spend more time in the gym.
if i knew there were going to be so many hills i would have picked a different city to explore.
"it was worth every step, sir. the architecture alone."
i could have spent all day in that temple.
"with your permission, captain, i'd like to write        the report to starfleet. it was my first visit to a pre-warp culture. seems only fitting."
i don't suppose it has anything to do with the tactical situation down there.
am i that obvious?
i can't think of a better man for the job.
welcome home.
any unexpected guests?
"not a single parasite, spore or virus. i take it your expedition was productive?"
very.
you're done here.
"you know, as interesting as that was, it's always good to get home."
"the speaker at the political rally, what was his name? chancellor kultrey?"
kultarey.
you could write a book about him alone. his speech reminded me of winston churchill before the second world war.
something wrong? malcolm?
my communicator.
what about it?
it's gone.
it's not in decon. any luck?
none yet.
what about the launch bay crew? could they have found it while they were securing the pod?
i've already spoken to them.
i did everything but tear up the floor plating.
when was the last time you remember having it?
i contacted t'pol to let her know we'd entered the city.
after that. did you have any reason to take it out of your pocket?
no.
are you sure?
i'd remember. either i dropped it or someone picked my pocket.
we covered a lot of ground. it could be anywhere.
"i think i can narrow down the search, captain. an inverse carrier wave should amplify its        power signature. with any luck, i'll be able to isolate it."
i'm getting something. i've got it down to two square kilometres.
can you do a little better?
i'll try.
didn't you say something about a war brewing down there?
"we saw a lot of propaganda, but from what we could tell nobody started fighting yet."
it's crucial we retrieve the technology. we can't risk contaminating a pre-warp culture.
"i've isolated the signal to within three city blocks. that's the best i can do, sir."
"this l-shaped structure. isn't that the fountain? the one with the statues. the tavern was        directly across the street, here. the communicator could have slipped out of my pocket when we sat down."
it's a good place to start.  you've got the bridge. tell doctor phlox we're going to need        his cosmetic services again.
"you could use another set of eyes down there, captain."
"i appreciate the offer, trip, but the fewer set of eyes, the better."
i'm a regular bloodhound.
next time.
we'll be in range of their surveillance towers in less than two minutes.
the hull plating's already been polarised.
your feet ready for another hike?
"it's not a problem, sir. captain. my carelessness was inexcusable. i'm prepared        for whatever reprimand you feel is appropriate."
"how about thirty years in the brig, or maybe a good flogging?"
"sir,"
"it was an accident, malcolm. it could have happened to any of us."
"three military aircraft, seventy two kilometres off starboard. i suggest you increase our descent vector.        that should keep us well below their visual threshold."
this was the table?
positive.
try your scanner.
welcome back. what would you like?
can you give us a few minutes?
of course. where's your friend? the young woman.
you have a good memory.
she was difficult to forget.
i'll pass along the compliment.
do you live here?
"no, just visiting."
we received a shipment of allakas malt this afternoon.
sounds good.
i've got it.
where?
"it's in a room, off that corridor."
were you in there?
no.
there are two people inside.
better wait till they come out.
does this belong to you? what is it?
i don't know.
what kind of weapon is this?  where's general gosis?
on the eastern perimeter.
send a level four communiqué and tell him i think we've found a pair of enemy spies.       take them to the complex and put your men on alert. you won't be seeing your friends in the alliance for a long time.
"i'm telling you, something's gone wrong. we should hail them."
"if they're in a public place, the communicator would draw attention."
we'll have to take that risk. t'pol to captain archer.
the comm. line's open.
"captain, please respond. close the channel."
did you get a fix on the signal?
somewhere in this district.
that's more than thirty kilometres from the tavern. where's the shuttlepod?
it hasn't moved.
they couldn't have travelled that far on foot. not that fast.
maybe they took a train or a car.
"if there was a change of plan, they would've told us."
try to isolate their biosigns. i want to know exactly where they are.
there are nearly a hundred thousand people in that part of the city.
we'd have more luck if we moved into a lower orbit.
any closer and we'd be detected. do your best.
still bothering you?
"i didn't have time to visit the doctor. i wonder if the guard would bring us some epsom salts,       if i asked politely."
i wouldn't count on it.
we came down to retrieve my communicator. now we've lost two of them. not to mention my phase-pistol and a pair       of scanners.
i just hope they don't find the shuttlepod.
"if they really think we are spying for this alliance, perhaps we should consider telling them the truth."
i'm not sure anyone would believe us.
it couldn't hurt to try.
visitors from another world? there's no way to know how they'd react. the less we say the better.
understood.
follow me.
"which of you is the captain? something unexpected happened when i was examining this transmitter.       it began to make a sound, so i opened it. someone calling herself t'pol seemed very concerned about       her captain's well-being. which one of you was she trying to contact?"
i'm the captain.
the alliance must be growing desperate if they're recruiting military officers as spies.
we're not part of the military.
"i suppose you're the captain of a pleasure boat. this transceiver, what's its frequency, its range?"
i don't know.
"this appears to be a computing instrument. tell me, how does it work?"
"my superiors expect answers. as an officer, i'm sure you can appreciate that.       i have no desire to harm you, but i need you to cooperate."
i'm sorry. i can't help you.
"i trust you enjoyed the rally this morning. that's why you're here, isn't it?       it's curious, the two of you visiting the city the same day as chancellor kultarey.       did you come here to observe his security arrangement? or perhaps assassinate him?       we're aware of your ancestral claims against our city. it must make a tempting target."
"we're visitors, not spies."
"this t'pol who tried to contact you, where is she?"
you've been surgically altered.
general. his blood. it's red.
take them to temec. have him perform a full examination.
"they're here, inside this compound."
"guard towers, gun emplacements, it's not a hotel."
"we could take shuttlepod two, set it down here. they're being held less than thirty metres away.       we'd be back in orbit before anyone knew they were gone."
"if you were captured, you'd be giving the inhabitants more technology.       it would undoubtedly affect the evolution of their society."
"what if they didn't see us coming? we've still got that suliban cell-ship, the one we used to rescue       klaang from the helix. i've been working on it in my free time. i'm pretty close to figuring out how it works.       if i can bring the cloak on line, we can get past their defences, grab our people, and no one will see a thing."
work quickly.
i could use a hand.
"aye, sir."
i suggest we monitor the communiqués coming from the compound. they may tell us what's happening       to the captain and mister reed.
right away.
i don't get it. the power converter's engaged. juice is definitely flowing through these relays.       so why can we still see the ship?
maybe this panel isn't the cloaking device.
i've identified every other component. it's got to be it. run the power-up sequence again.
this would be a lot easier if there was a button marked cloak.
"hold on a minute, travis."
are you all right?
just got the wind knocked out of me a bit.
maybe a little more than that.
is there any pain?
it tingles a little.
can you move your fingers?
how's that?
you tell me.
they feel all right. what's your scanner say?
"very little, i'm afraid. quantum physics is hardly my specialty, but i'd guess that you       received an intense dose of whatever particle radiation that ship uses to conceal itself."
are you saying i'm permanently cloaked?
"it's difficult to determine, but i suspect your appendage will eventually re-materialise on its own."
eventually?
come back in an hour. i'll check on your progress.
what am i supposed to do in the meantime? i can't work like this.
i'd also recommend a fresh uniform.
thanks.
shall we try this?
it's some kind of coherent energy pulse. i thought this technology was only theoretical.
our alliance friends seem to have turned theory into reality.
may i?
there appears to be another setting.
if the alliance has equipped its troops with these weapons. make sure the devices are kept       under guard at all times. use men you can trust.
what did you find?
see for yourself.
how is this possible?
there's only one explanation. our prisoners belong to another species.
"doctor temec tells me your deformities are not the work of a surgeon. he found no obvious incisions or scar tissue.       you're even more abnormal on the inside. a redundant renal organ and you're missing four thoracic vertebrae.       temec can't even begin to explain this mass. as for your red blood, the doctor tells me your haemoglobin       is based on iron, a toxic element. he conducted the test four times to be certain.       he has a theory about where you came from. i found it difficult to believe until i saw this.       one of our surveillance aircraft took this image early this morning.       the pilot said the object was traveling at very high speed. can you explain?"
none of the other planets in our system are capable of supporting life. where do you come from?
our scientists tell me it's unlikely that a craft of this size could have travelled from another star system.       they suspect a larger ship must be somewhere nearby. perhaps orbiting our planet.
tell me your orders! have you made contact with the alliance?
answer me.
"our intelligence reports underestimate you, general. alien creatures, you're even more delusional than we thought.       this isn't a spaceship. it's suborbital. a highly experimental aircraft. we've been observing your territory for months."
how did you evade our surveillance towers?
it's made from a composite alloy. invisible to any of your tracking systems.
and your biological anomalies?
we've been genetically enhanced.
what kind of enhancements?
"our immune systems are resistant to chemical and biological weapons, and our internal organs have been       modified to increase cellular regeneration by thirty percent. that way, our wounds can heal more quickly."
create the perfect soldier.
how many of you are there?
"we're prototypes, the only ones."
"and your devices, are they prototypes as well?"
all of them.
take them back.
do you believe them?
it's a plausible explanation.
the alliance could have thousands of soldiers with these mutations.
we need to verify what they've told us.
"i ran every imaginable test. if i were to extract the organs, i could study them in more detail."
you'll be in charge of the execution. i'll inform the prisoners.
"sub-commander, another communiqué. it's from a general gosis to the chancellor. he said they've       captured two enemy spies. they're going to hang them."
reconnect the diffraction relays and we'll give it another shot.
any change?
still missing in action.
having a cloaked hand could have its advantages. be useful in a poker match.
i could probably become a world-class magician.
"it might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. in case you want to steal some popcorn."
let's try it again.
go ahead.
is it working?
"not exactly. shut her down. the cloaking generator's running at a hundred and ten percent,       and it's still not enough. let's route more power from the warp relays. maybe that will do the trick."
how soon can you launch?
we're still reconfiguring the power matrix but i'm pretty confident
you don't have time. they're going to be executed in less than two hours.
"we'll get it working on our way down if we have to. look, invisible or not,       this cell ship can take more of beating than our shuttlepod."
you're about to find out. prepare it for launch.
an upset stomach? do you really think he'd fall for that?
"well, it may be an old trick where we come from, but maybe they haven't heard of it here."
"even if we got out of the compound, we'd never make it to the shuttle. not looking like this.       genetic enhancements. very creative, malcolm."
thanks. improvisation isn't my strong suit.
you made us sound like the suliban.
"what do you suppose enterprise will do, after we're."
"if i know t'pol, she won't want to leave any contamination behind. it may take some time,       but she'll find a way to get everything back. including our remains."
it's ironic. giving our lives to protect people who want to kill us.
"it's a big planet, malcolm. i'm sure they're not all like that."
"i'm not afraid, sir."
what if we did tell them the truth?
"you said it yourself, captain. they'd never believe us."
"if we show them to the shuttlepod, bring the general up to enterprise, give him the grand tour,       top it off with dinner in the captain's mess. we'd probably all have a good laugh over how he       almost sent us to the gallows. i've gotten plenty of lectures on cultural contamination, but       t'pol never mentioned anything about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it."
"if we did tell them who we are, maybe it would do them a world of good. look what the vulcans did for earth."
"that was different. these people haven't even split the atom yet. the vulcans waited until we were ready.       until we had the ability to travel to other stars. we're doing the right thing, malcolm.       i'm sorry you won't get a chance to write that report."
"it could still happen, sir. i'm expecting a rescue party to come barging through that door any moment."
we'll be in range of those surveillance towers in less than two minutes.
they'll never see us coming.
on your feet.
what was that?
there's a power drain in the cloaking generator.
are the warp relays offline?
primary and backups.
the weapon nodes are active. i thought we diverted power from the secondary systems.
we did.
they may have been programmed to reactivate when we launched.
three military aircraft off our port side. they're on an intercept course.
"travis, can't you hold this thing steady?"
it'd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us.
commander.
stand by.
"he's my tactical officer. he can tell you everything you want to know about the alliance's troop deployments,       their weapons."
captain.
you don't need to kill him.
your ride's here.
"sir, the phase pistol, our equipment."
don't leave without me.
let's go.
"the shuttlepod's right where you left it, sir. we'll be there in two minutes."
captain?
"sir, looking for this?"
come in.
i scanned the region ahead. there's a blue giant cluster three light years from our current position.
any planets?
none that are inhabited.
sounds like a nice change of pace. have travis set a course.
"yes, sir. was there something else?"
you took a risk coming down in that cell ship. its cloaking device could have failed.
a calculated risk.
"i'm glad you did it. what's important is that we got everything back, the communicator, the phase pistol,       the shuttlepod. we could have done a lot of damage to those people if we'd left any of it behind."
we did do damage to those people.
we've changed their perception of the alliance.
"they now believe their enemy is capable of creating genetically-enhanced soldiers, not to mention particle weapons."
"and thanks to that suliban ship, they also think the alliance has developed invisible aircraft."
you don't have to leave technology behind to contaminate a culture.  you were willing       to sacrifice your life to protect them. i would not have expected that.
you are making excellent progress.
yeah? what about this?
that's nothing.
maybe nothing to you.
give it time. give it time.
"thanks, doc."
i'm continuing my analysis of the condition that's stricken the crew. without doctor phlox's assistance i'm not hopeful about reversing its effects. i'm documenting my findings so that starfleet will at least have a record of what happened. the symptoms began not long after we set a course for the trinary system. that was nearly two days ago.
you're sure it's a black hole?
a class four.
"according to the vulcan star charts, your people have surveyed more than two thousand of these things."
"that's correct, but none of them were part of a trinary star system."
how close can we get?
"the gravitational shear between the stars is extreme. we'd have to drop to impulse, but we should be able to approach to within five million kilometres."
close enough to get some nice pictures.
how long would it take to reach the system at impulse?
two days.
set a course.
"trip. if you've got some free time, i'd love it if you take a look at my chair."
sir?
the captain's chair.
wh-what about it?
: you may have noticed that i don't sit in it very much.
is there a problem?
it's uncomfortable. when i lean back i feel like i'm about to slide out of it. i have to sort of perch on the edge.
i always assumed it was the best seat in the house.
take a look at it for me?
i was going to purge the impulse manifolds.
"the chair first, if you don't mind."
"aye, aye, sir."
come in.
good morning.
morning.
am i interrupting?
"no, no. just thinking about something."
today's duty roster.
thanks.
lieutenant reed has a new security protocol he'd like to discuss with you.
i'll drop by the armoury. anything else?
chef didn't report for duty this morning. he's ill.
is it serious?
"doctor phlox said it's a simple virus. he should be fine after a few days' rest. ensign sato has offered to take charge of the mess hall. apparently, she spends some of her free time in the galley and is eager for an opportunity to cook for the crew."
if it's all right with chef. let me ask you a question. i received a manuscript from earth. a biography of my father. i've been asked to write the preface. would you mind reading it when i'm done?
i'd be happy to.
if i can ever get it finished. i've been putting it off for weeks.
the next two days should provide you with ample opportunity.
it's not that i haven't had the time. they only asked for a page. how am i supposed to sum up my father's life in a page? it would've been easier if they'd asked me to write the book.
"perhaps by focusing on one incident, a single event that exemplifies your relationship with your father, you'll be able to condense your thoughts."
a logical approach. maybe you'd like to write it for me?
i'm hardly qualified.
chef was planning to make fried chicken tonight with scalloped potatoes and some of the minaran spinach we picked up on risa.
the orange spinach?
he's convinced there's a way to make it edible.
why don't we let him tackle that when he gets back? i have something else in mind.
it's one of my grandmother's specialties. the recipe's been passed down for generations.
i'll need a translation before i can programme the protein resequencer.
"oh no. you can resequence all the chicken and potatoes you want, but i am making this from scratch."
ensign. is there something i can do for you?
i've got a little headache. nothing serious.
why don't you let me have a look?
i was hoping you could just give me something. i'm right in the middle of upgrading the navigation sensors.
"it would be irresponsible to dispense medication without examining you first. please. any other symptoms? dizziness, blurred vision?"
no.
how long have you had it?
"a couple of days, on and off."
"well, i've been meaning to have you drop by sickbay in any case, to see if you've had any problems since i removed the neural implants you received at the repair station."
you think it could have something to do with that?
"oh, i never rule out anything. then again, it could be as innocuous as muscular tension. on the other hand, terrellian plague starts out with a simple headache, then all manner of nasty things begin to happen."
commander. commander.
"push it forward. that's good, hold it there."
commander.
perhaps you could finish that later.
"this may not be as glamorous as a black hole, but the captain gave me an order."
he also requested detailed sensor readings of this trinary system.
i thought vulcans had all this mental focus and discipline.
we also have sensitive hearing.
i'll be in my quarters.
we'll let you know when we're done.
keep those target discriminators aligned. we don't want a torpedo mistaking one of our own nacelles for an enemy vessel.
"you asked to see me, malcolm?"
"i would have come to you, captain."
it's no problem. what's on your mind?
"i've been reviewing our encounters with hostile species. the crew's response has been admirable but i feel we can do better, sir."
and you have a proposal?
"i've been thinking about a ship wide emergency alert. something a bit more comprehensive than battle stations. we're taking far too long to react to potential threats. with a single order from you, or an impact to the hull, the plating could be polarised, weapons brought online, critical systems secured."
"i appreciate your concern, malcolm, but this isn't a warship."
"that's obvious, sir. during our last run-in with the suliban we were unprepared for their boarding parties. when the mazarites attacked they disabled our aft sensors with their first shot. the list goes on."
"i can see that. run this by the senior officers, get some feedback, and we'll talk again."
"yes, sir."
"and malcolm, don't call it battle stations. think of something less aggressive."
how is it?
condition red?
huh?
what about condition red for the new security protocol?
why don't you just call it security protocol?
"well, that's not very dynamic."
do you think a cup holder's too much?
i beg your pardon?
for the captain's chair. he just wanted the seat adjusted but i figured as long as i'm working on it.
"just what the captain needs in a crisis, a place to rest his beverage."
i'm also upgrading the status displays. he'll be able to access tactical data from the armrest.
"if you really want to improve tactical readiness, why don't you help me with this protocol?"
"i'm a little busy right now, malcolm."
it's a chair.
it's the captain's chair. it's just as important as your reed alert.
reed alert. that's not bad.
enjoying your lunch?
yeah. thanks. it was terrific.
it's called oden. every japanese family has their own way of preparing it.
"well, it seems to be a big hit. congratulations."
"thank you. lieutenant, you barely touched yours."
it was lovely.
i'll get you a fresh bowl.
that's not necessary.
it's no problem.
please. not hungry.
are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?
well it was a bit salty.
salty?
it tastes fine.
"well, it just must be me, then. everybody else seems to be enjoying it."
how much longer is this going to take?
that depends.
on what?
"hold still, ensign."
i have to get back to the bridge.
i'm afraid you won't be returning to duty today.
"the captain needs those upgrades, doctor."
when it comes to medical matters my authority overrides the captain's. i'm keeping you overnight for observation.
but your scans didn't show anything.
"that's what concerns me. whatever's afflicting you may be laying dormant. i'm going to run a full biomolecular scan to see if we can find where it's hiding. now, lie back and don't move."
"when i was about eight years old, my father took me on a tour of the warp five facility outside of bozeman, montana. he introduced me to the people he worked with. scientists with names like tasaki and cochrane. at the time, i didn't realise the significance of those names or the significance of my father's work.  computer, pause. i'll feed you in a minute. computer, resume recording. in a way, creating a stable warp field mirrored the, the flux of emotions my father felt when he embarked on. computer, pause. delete the last paragraph. hell, delete the whole thing.  quiet."
come in.
here's your sensor interface. what's the emergency?
this trinary system is emitting some unusual radiation. i'm trying to identify it.
you dragged me up here so you could identify radiation?
correct.
you said it was urgent.
i said it was important.
"i get it. you're paying me back. making me jump through hoops because i was making too much noise. well, you'll be happy to know i moved the captain's chair down to engineering. so it's nice and quiet on the bridge now."
i prefer to work here. i'll need your assistance with this.
"weren't you listening to me? i don't have time to cater to your whims. you want to get your name immortalized in the vulcan database, get someone else to help you do it."
"are you feeling all right, commander?"
"i know you don't think this chair is important, but you're wrong. what's the most critical component on this ship? the main computer? the warp reactor? uh-uh, it's the crew. and the most important member of the crew is the captain. he makes life and death decisions every day and the last thing he needs to be thinking in a critical situation is, 'gee, i wish this chair wasn't such a pain in the ass.'"
doctor?
shush.
when are you going to
wait!
i have just enough time to shower and get changed.
"i haven't discharged you, ensign."
i haven't slept all night and i'm supposed to go on duty in fifteen minutes.
i need to perform a cerebral micro-section.
a what?
lie down.
no more tests. i have to get to the bridge.
i'm giving you an order.
"if i don't finish those upgrades, i could get a reprimand. it'll be in my permanent record."
you have far more to worry about than a blemish on your record. do you see there? your cortical scan shows elevated levels of serotonin and several other neurotransmitters.
what does that mean?
i'll let you know once i've completed the micro-section.
can't it wait until after my shift?
absolutely not.
"if the captain doesn't think i can handle my duties, i'll be scrubbing plasma conduits on d deck for the next five years. i could be court-martialed."
"and what if you're carrying a protocystian spore, and you infect the rest of the crew? how will that reflect on you? or what if you suddenly suffer a seizure at the helm because you've contracted andronesian encephalitis? now there is something wrong with you, ensign, and i intend to find out what it is."
"not today. not during my shift. unless you're ready to tie me to a biobed, i'm going back to my helm."
at least let me give you an analgesic for the headache.
that's all i wanted in the first place.
"if it gets any worse, or you suffer any other symptoms, return here immediately."
what did you
"i've been working on the new security protocol. obviously, the reactor must be secured immediately during a tactical alert."
tactical alert?
"i considered your suggestion, reed alert, but it seemed a bit narcissistic."
"hand me that hyperspanner, would you?"
"i've also been working on a new alert signal. tell me what you think.  or this one?  well, which do you prefer?"
for what?
a tactical alert.
they both sound like a bag full of cats.
"well, they were designed to get your attention."
i'll look this over and get back to you.
i also need your help on an emergency shutdown procedure for the eps grid.
i said i'll get back to you.
fine. let's hope we don't suffer a catastrophic reactor breach in the meantime.
"malcolm. one of your boys borrowed my laser micrometer. if you're heading to the armoury, could you get it back for me?"
"ensign, if we don't serve something soon we're going to have a riot on our hands."
"is this too salty? something's not right. hand me the kreetassan spice. i'll add it to the stock. oh, i'm out of carrots."
there are twenty five people
carrots!
"with all due respect, you've been cooking the same meal over and over again."
i believe i'm in charge of the galley.
i understand
you're relieved.
ma'am.
get out!
"lieutenant, i need your"
clearance code.
i beg your pardon?
what is your clearance code? the armoury is a restricted area.
even to the first officer?
how do i know you are the first officer? we've encountered species that can alter their appearance. they could masquerade as any one of us. i've issued codes to all senior officers to reveal if the ship's been infiltrated by impostors.
part of your new security protocol?
it was sent to your console as a voice-encrypted command packet.
"i haven't been to the bridge for several hours. as i was saying, i need assistance establishing a sensor interface in my quarters. i've asked commander tucker, but he became agitated. it was uncharacteristic, even for him. have you noticed anything abnormal about his behaviour?"
why do you want to access the sensor array from your quarters?
i was asked to run detailed scans of the trinary star system.
i wasn't informed.
"it isn't a tactical issue. lieutenant, why are you armed?"
"from now on, security personnel are to wear side arms in all restricted areas."
have you cleared this with the captain?
it's in my proposal.
has he approved your proposal?
"i've been trying to get him to pay closer attention to security since we left spacedock, but he's more interested in fraternising with the crew. inviting them to breakfast, and to watch water polo. i intend to implement some long-overdue changes, and if the captain won't approve them then i'll go directly to starfleet command. was there anything else?"
no.
"it wasn't long before i realized the odd behaviour wasn't limited to commander tucker. in fact, everyone i encountered was acting strangely, growing consumed with matters that seemed trivial at best. i also discovered that although i appeared to be immune, the captain was not."
what happened to my chair?
did you know that this chair is the exact same model used on neptune class survey ships?
is that why you called me down here?
"enterprise is the first warp five vessel in human history, the pride of the fleet, and you're sitting in a chair they've been using on warp two ships for over a decade. you deserve better, so i'm starting from scratch. i'm going to build you a throne. stand right there. i need to get a few parametric scans to get your exact dimensions. this baby is going to fit like a glove."
isn't that used for aligning phase coils?
you won't feel a thing.
"as long as i'm down here, maybe i can get your opinion."
don't move.
"how does one measure a man's legacy? is it defined by the works he's created, the technological advances that will forever alter the course of human history?"
turn around.
"if so, then no man since zephram cochrane, himself has made a more lasting contribution to the future of humankind than my father, doctor henry archer."
all done.
what do you think?
sounds good.
let me read you the rest.
i really need to get to work on this.
it's just a few more pages.
how many more?
nineteen.
nineteen? are you writing the preface or the book?
i've got a lot to say.
no kidding.
what's that supposed to mean?
"if i may, sir, it's a little longwinded."
you're lucky you're a decent engineer because you obviously don't know anything about writing.
i'm not the only one.
"i have eighty three people to feed, not just senior officers."
all i requested was a bowl of plomeek broth.
"i don't have time for special orders. anyway, you'll like this better."
where's lunch?
"it'll be ready in one minute, sir."
i don't have a minute.
"if you're so hungry, fix yourself a sandwich."
captain? may i speak with you?
that is a very complex recipe. i will not serve it till it's just right. my family's reputation is at stake.
"this is a tactical alert. all hands report to your stations. i repeat, this is a tactical alert."
report!
the crew's response was unacceptable. thirty eight percent of them failed to report to their stations. critical systems haven't been secured. i haven't even heard from engineering.
shut off that damn noise. shut it off. i don't recall authorising a tactical drill.
"it wouldn't be much of a drill if everybody knew about it, sir. one minute and fifteen seconds."
what?
it took you one minute and fifteen seconds to reach your post. i'd expect more of our commanding officer given that the crew just might follow his example.
captain.
one minute and forty nine seconds.
"you might want to see this, sir."
"interactive status displays, secondary helm control. it's even got inertial micro-dampers. the ship could be shaking apart and you'd hardly feel a thing."
you ignored a tactical alert for this?
i want to run some colours by you for the headrest.
this is all a big joke to you.
give it a rest.
"this isn't a bloody pleasure cruise. without proper discipline on this ship, this mission is doomed."
why don't you go play soldier somewhere else?
if this were a military situation you'd be taken out and shot.
"hey, hey, hey, hey."
"i don't care what colour the headrest is, or whether it can serve me iced tea. i just want a place to sit when i'm on duty."
"and if i hear that alarm one more time i may have you taken out and shot.  unless there's a real emergency, like a reactor breach, i don't want to be disturbed."
go away.
do i have to start locking my door?
you said to interrupt you if there was an emergency. i believe there is.
is that right?
"the crew's behaviour has become erratic. even by human standards, they've grown distracted. everyone i've encountered appears to be preoccupied with trivial matters. ensign sato's recipe, for example. your preface. we should declare a medical emergency and have doctor phlox examine the crew. i suggest he begin with you."
i'm busy.
captain.
dismissed.
your crew is in danger.
i gave you an order.
captain.
"i suggest you follow it, or i'll have you confined to your quarters, until, until a vulcan ship can come and get you."
"you're just in time, sub-commander. there's a surgical gown in the compartment by the microscope. this is a rare opportunity to explore the human brain."
was he injured?
"a headache. at first, i thought it was a simple vascular dilation but then i discovered a chemical imbalance in his prefrontal cortex. i'm going to begin by extracting the first twelve millimetres of his parietal lobe. a sub-cellular analysis of the tissue should shed some light on the mystery."
"doctor, you may want to delay the procedure. we have a larger problem. the entire crew is ill."
they'll have to wait.
"you've been affected, as well."
please remove your hand.
i won't ask you again.  i'll let you know when i've completed the surgery.
the crew's bio-signs were growing erratic. i began to doubt any of them would survive more than a few hours.
"ironically, dr. phlox's obsession with ensign mayweather's headache has provided some useful data. his cerebral scans have helped me determine that the radiation coming from the trinary system is causing  computer, pause."
"computer, resume log. my radiometric analysis is complete. as i suspected, reversing course won't take us out of danger quickly enough. the radiation appears to extend outward at least half a light year in every direction except one. if i can chart a course between the stars we could escape the radiation before the crew succumbs. but i won't be able to pilot the ship alone."
captain? captain archer! you're needed on the bridge.
i told you not to disturb me.
we have very little time.
what are you doing?
your crew may be dying.
what?
do you remember that trinary star system?
the one with the black hole?
it's emitting a dangerous form of radiation. it's affecting your prefrontal cortex.
i believe that's why you and the crew have been exhibiting obsessive behaviour. some of the crew's biosigns are already unstable. if you're exposed to the radiation much longer you won't survive.
do you understand what i'm telling you?
turn it off.
do you understand?
"yes. radiation. tell phlox, if the the crew's sick. tell phlox."
he's been affected as well.
but not you?
vulcan physiology seems to be immune.
bring us about. turn the ship around.
it's not that simple. if we go back the way we came we'll spend two more days in the radiation field. i've charted a course that'll have us clear of the radiation in less than seventeen minutes.
lousy coffee.
but we'll have to pass within two million kilometres of the black hole. there's considerable debris and gravitational shear. someone needs to pilot enterprise while i determine the course corrections.
travis.
he's been sedated.
i'm in no condition to fly a starship.
we have no other choice.
more gravitational shear. we're too far to port.
but you said bearing two point four.
twelve point four.
my mistake. twelve point four.
how much longer is this going to take?
six minutes.
i'm good for that.
another shear front. we need to rotate our longitudinal axis by twelve degrees and bring our flight vector to zero one four mark two seven.
"hold on, hold on. zero what?"
zero one four mark.
mark two-seven.
just minor debris. the hull plating is holding. our lateral vector is drifting. captain!
hang on a second. i feel like i'm in flight school again.
you're doing well. new heading. zero zero six mark four.
captain!
i see it.
we need phase cannons.
they'd take too long to charge.
all weapons are online. it must be part of the new security protocol.
fire!
could you shut that off?
how much longer?
less than ten seconds. five more seconds.
any more surprises?
nothing on sensors.
did we get some nice pictures of the black hole?
how are you feeling?
"a little tired, but the headache's gone. what'd you do?"
"very little, fortunately. you're free to go."
captain.
how's the crew?
"oh, i'm continuing to monitor vital signs. but i've detected no lingering effects from the radiation. mostly just rattled nerves, a few bruises and sprains from when some of them lost consciousness. i appreciate your intervening before i got any further with mister mayweather's procedure."
i wasn't certain it would work on a denobulan.
"it worked quite effectively, i can assure you."
what procedure on mister mayweather?
the radiation affected my nervous system rather severely.
i'll be with you in a moment. i'll provide you with a full report when i've finished treating the crew.
"you wanted to see me, captain?"
i did. when t'pol and i were navigating the debris field your tactical alert went off.
"i heard, sir. i've already deactivated the new protocols."
you shouldn't have. they brought the weapons online right when we needed them. if you have no objection i'd like to make it standard procedure.
"no objection, sir."
you still need to work on that alarm.
i'll get right on it.
it doesn't look any different to me.
give it a try.
it feels better. what'd you do?
cross your legs.
what did you do? it seems totally different.
"i lowered it, by one centimetre."
that's all?
"didn't have time to install the new status displays or the inertial micro-dampers, but if you give me a couple of days."
"i think this'll be fine, commander. thanks."
how about i just attach the cup holder?
this'll be fine.
how does this sound?
these are at least three hundred years older than the ones in the last chamber.
you sure you can't read any of this?
no. how about you?
"well, i think this says tall guys are popular."
you're a budding linguist. let's get a shot of that one.
i wonder what happened to them.
it is kind of weird. not a single biosign on the entire planet.  tucker.
"you about finished down there, trip?"
"you can't believe these ruins, sir. we've been through two dozen chambers. no telling"
how many more there are.
i'm afraid you're not going to find out today. that storm we told you about hasn't changed course.
you and hoshi are going to need to get back to enterprise.
"we'll just finish up with mister tall and popular. we should back to the shuttlepod in five, six minutes."
don't take any longer than that. archer out.
captain? we have another storm.
another one?
the discharges are more intense.
it's a good deal bigger.
and stronger. it's pushing the first storm through these mountains at twice the speed it was moving a few minutes ago.
"they're diamagnetic storms, captain, saturated with polaric energy."
this is the shuttle?
less than ten kilometres from the first storm.
"you may not be able to see yet, but it'll be coming through the mountain pass to the north."
"we can see it just fine, captain."
the storms are throwing up too much interference into the atmosphere. the shuttle's out of the question.
"captain, these ruins have very thick walls. i'm sure we'll be safe inside."
"i'm afraid we're not talking about thunderclouds, hoshi. a polaric burst that could short-circuit a shuttlepod could do a lot worse to your nervous system."
"but sir, these buildings are"
over four thousand years old. i'm sure they've survived hundreds of these storms.
i've sent malcolm down to the transporter. we're going to need to bring you up
one at a time.
couldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? polarise the hull plating.
that would most likely attract the polaric discharge.
"you have to do this, hoshi."
there's no choice. i'll need you clear of the structure
one at a time.
"understood, captain. ladies first."
have you ever done this?
"no, but the captain has, and malcolm did it twice. they said there's nothing to it."
your molecules get pulled apart.
then they get put back together again.
do you know how many molecules you're made up of?
lots.
"all right, how many?"
a few trillion.
"that's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. what if some other pieces get put in the wrong place? you know, i bet a lot of them look real similar."
starfleet said it's safe. that's good enough for me.
"okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to enterprise in one piece i'll be right behind you."
fair enough. tucker to enterprise.
"i read you, commander."
ready to go.
commander?
safe and sound.
"i'm on my way, sir."
ensign sato ready for transport.
welcome to the club.
how do those molecules feel? all in the right place?
i'll let you know.
come in.
"no worse for the wear, ensign?"
"i guess you could say that, sir. i'll be at my post in a few minutes. i just want to clean up and change."
i think you've had enough excitement for one afternoon. the morning'll be fine.
thank you.
"i assume you and trip will want to finish your survey tomorrow, weather permitting."
sir?
"you left a shuttlepod down there, remember? somebody's got to go back and get it."
i'm sure commander tucker can find someone else to hold the second flash unit.
"you wouldn't be using the transporter, hoshi. you'd be taking the other pod."
i don't want to get lost.
lost?
"too much excitement for one day. i could really use some rest, sir."
see you in the morning.
so he tells her it was merely a warp imbalance.
"that's a lie, malcolm."
"we all heard it, commander. there's no use pretending."
"come on, travis."
anyone sitting here?
don't you think a vulcan would see right through this one?
"but that's what you said, though."
is anyone sitting here?
"no, please."
"so, what was it like?"
"travis, let her eat her supper."
it was very unsettling. didn't you find it unsettling?
"for a minute or two, but once i counted my fingers and toes."
i don't know. i just don't feel right.
it was probably that storm. you don't forget things like that too quickly.
"not the storms, it's the transporter. i don't feel like myself since i went through it. i need to check the medical database and find out what happened to people they used when they were testing that thing."
you mean other than cyrus ramsey?
cyrus ramsey?
don't tell me you don't know about poor cyrus.
am i supposed to?
you can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story about someone seeing ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy night.
what happened to him?
next thing you'll tell us you never heard of the easter bunny.
what happened to him?
"madison, wisconsin, may, i think, 2146. he was a test subject for the first long-range transport. just one hundred metres. something went wrong with the pattern buffer. he never rematerialised."
"come on, hoshi, everybody's heard of cyrus ramsey."
i must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories.
where'd you do your survival training?
"death valley, california. middle of july, naturally. you?"
"captain and i were in the same group. alice springs, australia. never saw so many flies in my life. biting kind.  tucker."
the storms are breaking up. i don't think we'll have any trouble getting you back down in the morning.
travis was just telling me he'd like to see the ruins.
"well, i don't think hoshi will be joining you."
i'll need a pilot to bring the other pod back.
travis it is. i'll see you both in the morning. archer out.
never say i don't take you anywhere.
you don't take me anywhere.
see you later.
doctor? doctor phlox. hello?
ensign. something i can do for you?
i just looked in there. were you in there? did you hear me come in?
i was feeding my leeches. are you all right?
you didn't hear me?
"i'm right here, ensign. are you not feeling well?"
"no, i'm not feeling well. i dematerialised, and then i rematerialised and, no, i'm not feeling well."
i heard about your ordeal on the surface. those storms sounded terrifying.
"doctor, i'm not talking about the storms. i'm talking about my molecules."
come sit down. let's take a look.
"it'll take me a while to account for every molecule, but you appear to be in one piece. i don't think you're in danger of becoming the next cyrus ramsey."
don't tell me they talk about him on denobula.
"i spent nearly nine months on earth, remember?"
"i just don't feel right. ever since the transport, i've been shaky, not myself."
not a single bio-molecular anomaly.
no? how about this?
a subcutaneous pigmentation.
it's not where it used to be. it was a good centimetre lower.
"well, it looks lovely where it is now."
"it's not a joke, doctor. if that machine could move a birthmark, who knows what else it could do. i'm telling you, i don't feel right."
"i have a lot of animals to feed before bedtime. if i were you, i'd get a good night's sleep, hmm?"
hello?
"you're needed on the bridge, ensign."
what time is it?
eleven hundred hours. there's been an emergency.
"eleven hundred hours, that's impossible. my shift starts at oh eight hundred."
"now, ensign."
"i'm sorry, captain, i don't know what happened."
tucker and mayweather have been taken hostage. trip got a short message but we haven't heard anything in the last hour.
taken hostage by who?
the people down there didn't like you disturbing their ruins.
people? there wasn't a biosign on the planet.
the chambers you and mister tucker photographed contained sacred relics.
how could you possibly know that?
have you found their biosigns?
they're still in the complex. i'm trying to isolate the specific chamber.
it's mayweather's communicator.
"go ahead, travis."
ensign?
i need more.
this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. we apologise if we've trespassed. my crewmen didn't mean any harm.
"i'm sorry, sir, it's not working. i'm going to need more."
can i speak to one of my officers?
it's not going to get much better than that.
what's the problem?
maybe you should forget about the ut. just try and talk to them.
ajas sukas.
tag zra uras turana.
"if i went back to the universal translator, maybe i could"
you already tried that. talk to them.
i can't.
"lives are at stake, ensign."
"i know. i don't understand what he's saying. i'm, i'm sorry. i'm sorry."
no need to apologise. why don't you go back to your quarters and get some rest.
"captain, i realise i overslept. i don't know how it happened, but please, i don't want to go back to my quarters."
take the comm.
"aye, captain."
malcolm.
anyone sitting here? sub-commander?
ensign. would you like to join me?
thank you. i would've thought you'd be on the bridge.
why is that?
commander tucker. travis.
the hostage situation was resolved. they're back on board.
it's only been an hour since i left the bridge. what happened?
crewman baird deciphered their language. a simple bimodal syntax.
i don't understand. how?
with the universal translator.
that's impossible. i ran every linguistic algorithm.
"when the captain agreed to return the soil and rock samples, and destroy the photographs that were taken, the hostages were released."
"if we've decrypted their language, i should get back to the bridge. it sounds like the captain might want to speak with them again."
captain archer has asked that you remain off duty for the time being. crewman baird has been placed in charge of communications.
"after lunch, you should take a look at the secondary couplings. they're going to need to be aligned."
alison.
"start on c deck, then work your way down."
yes ma'am.
the stream's too unstable.
"come on, hoshi."
what?
"you can do it, ensign. it's as easy as one, two,"
can you see me?
ensign?
can you see me?
is there something in particular you'd like me to look at?
"something's wrong, doctor. something's very wrong. ever since i used that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed to be. i couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but crewman baird could. crewman baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic database. and captain archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't decide whether to bounce off me or go through me. nobody wants to talk to me. sometimes i think they don't even see that i'm there. the turbolift control won't even respond to me."
"well, i see you, ensign, and the sickbay doors responded when you came in. transporter technology is very new.  i'm sure humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, or the airplane. new forms of transport take a while to get used to. i'm not at all surprised at your reaction. you wouldn't catch me using that apparatus. but i can promise you one thing. you're in perfect health. you're neither transparent nor porous."
"you won't put this on my medical record, will you?"
as far as i'm concerned i didn't even see you come in here.
"not funny, doctor."
i would like to give you a mild sedative. it'll help you get a good night's sleep.
if it's all the same to you the last thing i need right now is to be medicated.
"as you wish, but stop by in the morning, all right?"
"first thing. thank you, doctor."
"you're upside down, ensign."
i was taught never to contradict a superior officer. the captain told me what happened. did they treat you all right?
didn't even tie us up. as soon as the captain promised to give them their stuff back they walked us to the shuttlepods and away we went.
i'm sorry i wasn't more helpful trying to translate. i don't know what happened.
"well, we're safe and sound. that's all that matters. have you tried this thing?"
"i get motion sickness, remember? have you felt okay since we were transported yesterday?"
"considering that i've been back down to the surface, kidnapped and released, i've probably had better days. why, are you not feeling well?"
"i didn't think i was, but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms are psychological."
what kind of symptoms?
"i just haven't been myself. everything's a little off ,even the laws of physics."
"well, in that case, you're right. you shouldn't get on this thing. the laws of physics don't apply in here, either. sorry. just trying to cheer you up."
it's okay. phlox promises me i'll be fine.
it's going to be a while before any of us gets used to being taken apart and put back together again. it seems perfectly natural to be anxious about it.
i hope it's just a question of being anxious.
what else could it be?
i saw my reflection become transparent. i saw water pass right through my hand. i'm not convinced that the transporter put me back the way it was supposed to.
"all the king's horses and all the king's men. i can see why you might imagine the universe unraveling. if you're afraid you haven't been put back together right, why assume anything else makes sense? if i were you, i'd ask the doc for a sedative. nothing like crawling into bed."
you men are all alike.
wait and see. a night's sleep will do you a world of good.
thank god you're here. i've been stuck in here for hours. the door control is
"she was here last night, right over there."
commander.
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
have the security details reported back?
no sign of her yet.
we've covered the forward section of c deck. she's not here.
"yes, she is."
"have you tried the biosensors again, captain?"
still nothing.
i'll go take a look at them.
"i'm going to maintain our present orbit until hoshi turns up. t'pol, meet me in sickbay right away."
"yes, sir."
"she came to sickbay after the incident with the storm, then a second time early last night."
she wasn't feeling well?
she said she felt shaky. you're aware that was the first time she'd ever transported?
quite aware.
i believed that was the source of her anxiety. she was convinced her molecules hadn't been reassembled properly. i should've taken her more seriously. these are the biomolecular scans i took during each of her two visits.
they seemed perfectly normal at the time. when i heard she was missing something made me take a closer look. you see these protein filaments? now look at this.
"i'm going to need some help here, phlox."
look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded. these scans were taken less than twenty four hours apart. it's virtually impossible.
what's impossible?
ensign sato wasn't imagining it. her molecules are coming apart.
it's the secondary phase coils.
what about them?
they're not aligning. they're not perfectly synchronised. must've happened right after it came up from the surface.
if they're not perfectly synchronised?
"the resequencing would start to dissipate. within hours, she'll lose molecular cohesion."
"she didn't want to go first. i told her i wouldn't leave her alone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second. she wanted to be sure it was working, that it was safe. i'm the one who should be missing. i told her to go first. she should've listened to me."
it wasn't your fault.
take the transporter offline and figure out what went wrong. starfleet promised me this sort of thing wouldn't happen.
"aye, sir."
"captain, if there was a loss of molecular cohesion i'm afraid we shouldn't be looking for hoshi, per se."
what should we be looking for?
subcellular residue. there wouldn't be anything left by now except for subcellular residue.
"you're wrong, doctor. i'm still in one piece. you just can't see me."
have the doctor help you recalibrate the sensors. then start scanning for this residue. archer to mayweather.
"go ahead, sir."
prepare to break orbit and resume previous course.
": aye, captain."
"i'll be in, my ready room."
there's no way to be certain this is her.
is it hoshi's dna or isn't it?
it's difficult to tell. the amino acids have broken down.
don't waste your time. it's not me.
the internal scan said access shaft b7. she's got to be here somewhere.
if you spent a little more time trying to figure out what happened to
what's the problem?
the stream's too unstable.
lieutenant?
"you can do it, ensign. it's as easy as one, two"
"here, doc, over here. what do you think?"
try isolating the dipeptides. now run a comparison with her genetic profile.
why would she have come down here?
"i doubt we'll ever know, commander. captain archer will want hoshi's parents to have this."
"they're both alive, aren't they?"
"yeah, both alive. you go ahead, doc. i'm going to stick around for a minute."
i understand.
hoshi.
you can see me?
"i should've made you go first. what could i have been thinking leaving you down there? i was the ranking officer, and i had no business leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms. why didn't you listen to me? i told you we'd be safe. and now look what you've done."
"captain, i need you to listen to me. there are aliens on board from the surface. they're planting bombs on d deck. you've got to hear me. the ship is in danger."
go ahead.
"we've located her father, sir. the mother isn't home."
what time is it there?
oh nine hundred.
put him through.
"good morning, sir."
captain archer. is everything all right?
"no sir, everything is not all right. we've had an accident with our transporting device."
transporting device? what is that?
you don't have time for this.
a matter stream converter. it was approved for transporting bio-matter before we left earth.
i'll find something that'll get your attention.
we've used it a number of times to
"bio-matter? what are you referring to, produce or people?"
i'm just trying to explain to you that star fleet told us it was safe.
"so, hoshi is safe."
"no, sir. there was an accident. she began to, her molecules began to destabilise."
"her molecules? what are you talking about, captain?"
"this isn't easy, sir. i fought to get hoshi to come on this mission. i'm responsible for her being out here. she's, become a member of our family."
"family? we're her family, not you. why are you calling me? to say that she has become a member of your family? i'm sorry, captain. you are not making any sense."
"we lost hoshi today, mister sato. i wish i didn't have to tell you that."
you are saying hoshi is dead?
we're all going to be dead if i don't get him to notice this.
"maybe, you could call us back later. this afternoon?"
"how about morse code? you know morse code, don't you?"
i must have time to speak to hoshi's mother.
"come on, listen."
this afternoon.
can you hear it?
i'm so sorry.
so am i.
come on.
"that's right. it's not supposed to be making that noise, is it? listen, you can hear it. sos. sos. it's a call for help. i need you to hear it."
archer to t'pol.
"yes, captain?"
could you come in here for a minute?
right away.
"that's right, show it to her. one of you will figure it out."
look at this. i've never heard it make that noise before.
the plasma circuit's being interrupted. i'll ask commander tucker to take a look at it.
"listen to the pattern. three dots, three dashes, three dots. sos."
dots?
dots and dashes. morse code. its been used on earth for centuries. it's a distress call.
"let's see how good your memory is. h, o,"
it's changed.
"s, h,"
it still sounds like morse code.
i. come on.
this plasma circuit is self-contained. no one outside of this room could be using it to send a message.
"i'm not outside this room, i'm right here."
it's been a very difficult day. perhaps you should try to get some rest.
you're right. i'll have trip look at it tomorrow.
tomorrow's too late. they're going to blow up the ship. captain!
"no, wait!"
what's the problem?
what?
the stream's too unstable.
"come on, hoshi, come on."
"you can do it, ensign.  it's as easy as one, two"
three.
"nice work, malcolm. see, i told you. piece of cake."
where are they? we've got to stop them.
who?
you heard me? you can hear me? do you see me?
"everything's fine, hoshi."
it's not fine. they put a bomb on the warp reactor.
who?
the aliens from the surface.
there's no one on the surface. it's uninhabited.
what are you talking about? they kidnapped you and travis. we've got to stop them.
"hoshi, the transporter was affected by the storms. i had some trouble reintegrating your matter stream."
trouble?
"you were sort of, trapped in the pattern buffer. but only for a few seconds."
"eight point three seconds, to be precise."
are you saying that i was just on the surface?
you insisted on going second.
do you have a mirror?
what?
forget it. and i was sure i was going to be the next cyrus ramsey.
cyrus who?
so you're saying all of that happened in eight seconds?
"actually, it probably happened in the last one or two seconds as your matter stream was coalescing. she seems fine."
malcolm is recommending some new transport protocols to star fleet. he's suggesting we start compressing the transport beam.
"well, i hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a long time."
but you said you stepped on to the aliens' transporter by choice.
i was trying to save enterprise.
sounds like you overcame your fear.
"it's all in my head, remember?"
"does it matter? you were afraid of getting lost, afraid of disappearing, but you still climbed on to that platform, real or not."
"if it's all the same to you, sir, i'd like to stick to shuttlepods for the time being."
come on. let's go to the bridge.
"captain, if you don't mind."
archer to commander tucker.
go ahead.
"i know you're off duty, but we've got visitors."
i can see that.
are you up for a little repair work?
sir?
meet me at docking port two.
on my way.
anything serious?
they said they were having trouble with one of their life support systems.
who's they?
retellian cargo pilots. the seal is secure.
welcome aboard.
"gracious of you to help us, captain. we were beginning to think our distress call would never be answered."
"this is sub-commander t'pol and my chief engineer, commander tucker."
our salvation.
the captain said something about life support.
we were hired to return a young woman to her home world. a few days ago her stasis pod began to malfunction.
stasis? is she injured?
"no, no. she's a passenger, but our ship is designed to haul cargo, not people and it's a very long journey. putting her in suspended animation was our only choice."
"we have another five months ahead of us. if she wakes up there won't be enough food, air to breathe. if we're forced to abort the mission we won't get paid."
commander tucker is resourceful. i'm sure he'll be able to assist you.
mind if i have a look?
please.
you've been very accommodating. if it's not too much trouble i'd like to make another request. it's been a long time since we've enjoyed the luxury of a bath.
"i understand. t'pol will show you to guest quarters. when you're done, i'll have my chef prepare you a meal."
this regulates power flow to the biopod.
looks very creative.
these relays are from an old ardanan shuttle. they weren't designed to carry this much current.
i've got some eps conduits that might do the trick.
"this would be a lot easier if i could read your language. if you don't mind, i'd like to ask our communications officer to give me a hand."
by all means.
is there a problem?
"no. no, no problem. i'm going to need some tools from enterprise. with a little luck, sleeping beauty here will never know there was a problem."
come in.
i hope i didn't deplete your water supply.
i'm sure we'll manage. please.  t'pol tells me your vessel can't do much better than warp two.
warp two point two.
"i've been making some calculations. if i'm not mistaken, at warp four point five enterprise can have you at your destination in less than four days."
"that's a generous offer, but i've already inconvenienced you far too much."
it's no inconvenience. we're out here to meet new people. you're heading toward an inhabited world we've never seen. first contacts tend to go more smoothly when a familiar face is making the introductions.
i'm sure you'll do fine on your own.
you could dock in our launch bay. you wouldn't have to worry about that stasis pod. we have plenty of room for you and your passenger.
"it's not that simple, captain. this has all been carefully prearranged. her family's not expecting her for another five months. they're not even on her home world at the moment. but i will accept your offer of a meal, if it's not too late."
commander? hello?
is that the translation?
give or take an adverb.
thanks.
at least you don't have to work alone.
"hell of a way to travel, isn't it?"
who is she? any idea?
i asked plinn but he doesn't seem to know too much about her. he said something about studying medicine in a research colony.
a doctor?
i suppose so. she must have a real passion for it if she's willing to go through all this. shame we'll never get to meet her.
"it's not polite to stare, commander."
what's that supposed to mean?
let me know if you have any problems with that translation.
i wasn't staring.
hoshi?
are you all right?
problem?
the stasis pod.
what about it?
"it's malfunctioning. if you'll excuse me, captain."
i'll show you to the docking port.
i know the way.
what are you doing?
help me open this thing!
we can't bring her out of stasis.
she's suffocating!
the release is jammed. don't bother.
"i'm sorry about this, but the o2 recycler went offline."
dulsha tot!
you're going to be all right.
kosh vos!
yes?
there's a minor problem. i'm going to need your assistance.
what kind of problem?
the malfunction is more complicated than i expected.
i'll be there in a moment. i don't mean to be rude.
"not at all. archer to commander tucker. trip, can you hear me?  archer to lieutenant reed."
mister plinn?
that's right.
lieutenant reed. the captain asked me to escort you back to your ship.
that won't be necessary.
i'm afraid i'm under orders.
have i done something wrong?
it's just a precaution.
i never realised leaving the captain's table would cause so much concern.
he's trying to break loose.
secure the docking clamps.
report.
"he hasn't gotten far at warp two, sir."
hail him.
no response.
phase cannons. target his engines.
direct hit to the port nacelle. he's dropping out of warp.
bring us into grappling range. hail him again.
captain.
t'pol?
dilithium hydroxls. ionised pyrosulfates.
he's moving off.
stay with him.
i thought you took out one of his nacelles?
so did i.
our warp drive won't engage.
"that cloud he released, it got into the plasma vents. they'll have to be purged."
he's moving out of sensor range. i've lost him.
tuvat at.
what the hell did you do that for?
tuvat at.
hold on. hold on. i'm not working with them.
luvasta eeva. destas.
"calm down. i'm not going to hurt you. i'm, i'm from a starship called enterprise. enterprise. now put that thing down and i'll untie you. your hands, i'll free your hands. let me help you."
has trava dukla.
what the hell's going on?
is it repaired?
what?
the stasis pod.
where's captain archer?
your ship is a long way from here.
slovasa toraya.
repair the pod so we can put her back in stasis.
it's going to take a few hours.
work quickly.
am sotey.
you're welcome?
tule bas?
"have you seen a little device? it's about this big, has a keypad on it. it's my universal translator. it'll help us understand each other."
has nos?
that's it. it's just so we can talk.
i need you to say something. you got to keep talking.
"votni vay, atayun ponas."
a little more.
akasa jorat. foraya nuratay. fegasa ana a'hanjura.
can you understand me?
serotta jho.
where's hoshi when you need her?
who is hoshi?
that's better. would you mind telling me what's going on here?
how long have i been in stasis?
you'd have to ask them.
"commander tucker to enterprise. enterprise, do you hear me?"
you are an officer?
chief engineer. feels like we've gone to warp.
explain yourself. what do you know about my abductors?
we thought they were cargo pilots. they claimed you were their passenger.
"i am their prisoner. i was returning from a diplomatic mission when they attacked my transport, murdered my guards. you don't know who i am, do you?"
should i?
my family is known on hundreds of worlds.
"well, i'm afraid earth isn't one of them. so i take it you're not a doctor."
i am first monarch of the sovereign dynasty of krios prime.
oh. charles tucker the third. please to meet you. so what do these guys want?
ransom. no doubt they'll demand a high price for my safe return.
"listen, my captain'll be looking for me. all we have to do is get off this ship and let him know where we are."
and how do you propose we do that?
i saw a shuttlebay earlier. there were a couple of escape pods.
you're not going anywhere.
i beg your pardon?
"we'll remain here until they contact the sovereign guard. once the ransom has been paid, we'll be released."
"well, if it's all the same to you i'd rather take my chances in open space."
"it's too dangerous. if you leave, it would provoke them."
if i remember right this access tube leads to a junction near the shuttlebay.
you are not to leave this chamber.
"with all due respect, i'm not one of your subjects."
he's your partner. you must have some idea where he's going.
"obviously, i'm his victim as well. why else would he leave me here?"
where were you taking your passenger?
goff had the coordinates.
you don't even know what system you were heading for?
"it wasn't my responsibility. he was piloting the ship, not me. i spent most of my time looking after the cargo. believe me, captain i'm as eager to find my partner as you are."
"if that's true, then we could work together to track him down."
i don't see how.
"we've got pretty good long range sensors, but your ship could be anywhere within a half dozen light years. it'd be a lot easier if we knew your warp frequency."
"well, i'm afraid i can't help you with that. i know very little about warp engines."
take him back to docking port two. put him in the airlock and post a security detail.
i'm telling you the truth!
"we'll keep the outer hatch unlocked. if you decide to leave, you know the way out."
could you hand me that circuit probe? the one with the green handle?
you must be one hell of a diplomat.
is your entire species so ill-mannered?
"no, just me."
"you know, if you were thinking rationally you'd be repairing that stasis pod. he did threaten to kill you."
"that's precisely why i'm getting out of here. i really doubt they're going to keep me around once i fix their problem. you know, i realise someone in your position isn't used to taking advice from a guy like me, but i strongly suggest you come along."
he'd never harm me. i'm too valuable to them.
i've been involved in a few hostage situations. they rarely turn out the way you expect.
"you're correct, mister tucker. i don't take advice from people like you."
"you know, that stasis pod won't fix itself. chances are you're going to spend the next five months tied up in this grimy little cargo hold. not exactly my idea of a royal voyage."
i'll be fine.
when i get back to enterprise i'll make sure we get a message to your homeworld. krios?
krios prime.
take care.
once you launch an escape pod what makes you think they won't destroy it?
i'm going to reroute their internal sensors. i'll be a million kilometres away before they know i'm gone. i'm much better company.
how much farther?
just a few more metres.
are you sure this is the right direction?
"keep your voice down. what am i supposed to call you, anyway? first monarch? your highness?"
kaitaama.
what is that? some kind of a title?
it's my name.
what are you doing?
these lead to internal sensors.
we don't have all day.
this is meant for one person.
we'll have to make do. unless you know how to fly one of these things.
what was that?
we're crossing the subspace threshold.
that wasn't so bad.
what do you propose we do next?
"to be honest, i hadn't really thought about it."
i assumed you had a plan.
i was only joking. they do have a sense of humour where you come from?
among the commoners. only joking.
it's only a matter of time before they realise we're gone. no doubt they'll come about and look for us. we need a place to hide.
where?
"if i'm translating this right, there's a system about ninety million kilometres from here. we should be able to reach it in a day or so."
what makes you think any of those planets are habitable?
"only one way to find out. permission to set a course, your sovereignty?"
proceed.
"look, this would be a whole lot easier if you'd stop moving around."
you're touching me.
i'm afraid i don't have much choice.
it's inappropriate to touch the first monarch.
you're welcome to step outside until i'm done. excuse me.
"there we go. landing thrusters, no, wait, they're stabilisers."
you have no idea how to control this vehicle.
i'm working on it.
"even if we do find a breathable atmosphere and you manage to land without killing us, what will we do about food? water? there could be hostile lifeforms on the surface. how will we protect ourselves?"
"look, i've got less than twenty four hours to figure out how to scan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language i don't understand, and i'm not going to get it done with you interrupting me every five seconds. so i'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet until i'm finished. now, lift your butt."
my what?
"your behind, your rear end. i haven't checked that panel yet."
quickly.
"you know, you were a lot more pleasant in stasis."
"i think i found the landing thrusters. i understand how difficult this must be for someone of your upbringing, but we could be stuck out here for awhile. we should find a way to get along. i'm willing to give it a try if you are."
my hand. you're sitting on my hand. i'll try.
"the prisoner, sir, as ordered."
thank you.
"will there be anything else, captain?"
"not right now, lieutenant. dismissed."
have a seat.
why have i been brought here?
sit down.
i already told you everything i know.
we're not here to talk about your partner. we're here to talk about you.
what about me?
"you're facing some very serious charges, mister plinn. where we come from criminals are held accountable for their actions. if they're found guilty, they're punished. this is where your tribunal is going to take place."
tribunal?
i am not subject to your laws.
that's not for me to decide.
"starfleet asked the vulcan high command to assign a judicial administrator to enterprise. someone who wouldn't be swayed by human emotion. someone objective, logical. from what i understand, sub-commander t'pol has already reviewed the evidence. this tribunal is nothing more than a formality. i thought you should be prepared. her punishments can be severe."
how severe?
"if you're late for your shift you might receive a beating. but for more grievous offenses, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming an officer. we started out with eighty three crewmen on board. we're down to seventy six."
but i haven't done anything wrong.
"accessory to kidnapping, resisting arrest, obstruction of an investigation, causing damage to a starfleet vessel."
what damage?
when your partner fled he released a cloud of dilithium hydroxls that clogged our plasma vents.
i had nothing to do with that.
"as i said, i'm not the one you have to convince."
sub-commander.
has the accused been informed of the charges?
"yes, ma'am."
how much do you weigh?
what?
your weight.
seventy two kilograms.
height?
one point eight metres. why are you asking these questions?
does your culture observe any postmortem rituals?
this is not fair. i demand to speak with someone from my government.
he's got a point. we've never tried an alien before. maybe we should contact the high command.
they've granted me complete autonomy in these matters. if i had to consult my superiors every time i made a ruling it would defeat my purpose here. we'll convene at eighteen hundred hours.
as you wish.
you can't allow this.
there's nothing i can do.
but you're the captain.
"she owes me a few favours. i can't promise anything but i, i'd be willing to ask for leniency. of course, i'd want something in return. we still haven't found a way to locate your vessel. if you could remember that warp frequency."
are there any provisions? i'm hungry.
you might check that storage compartment above your head.
you do it.
i'm busy.
"if you find any water up there, i could use some."
thanks.
allow me.
i'm not contagious.
is it edible?
depends how hungry you are.
it reminds me of my first car.
car?
"a four-wheeled vehicle. wasn't much bigger than this. all we're missing is the ocean breeze coming off the gulf. i used to drive out to a place called chatkin point, park along the shoreline and stare at the moon with my girlfriend. don't worry. i won't make a pass at you."
the sovereign guard would cut off one of your hands.
you must be a fun date.
the first monarch doesn't socialise with the opposite sex.
you've never been on a date?
"four years ago, before i was selected to ascend to first monarch, i was courted by young men from many noble families. now i spend my personal time in the company of my father's advisors."
sounds kind of lonely.
you haven't finished your work.
it's all water.
there's a chain of islands near the equator.
will we be able to breathe?
"oxygen, nitrogen, a trace of methane. nothing we can't handle."
do you detect any lifeforms?
if i could figure out how to use the bio-sensors.
are you certain we have the correct planet?
it's the only one with an atmosphere.
you may begin our descent.
let's hope i get this right.  we're entering the thermosphere. the port stabiliser's down.
can you repair it?
"no, but the starboard one should keep us on course."
mister tucker!
so far so good. eight thousand metres. i think they're metres. seven thousand. i'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing. five thousand metres. you might want to grab hold of something.
two thousand metres. one thousand. hold on.
you all right?
what is that?
damned if i know.
this heat is unbearable.
it's nothing compared to a summer in the everglades. at least there aren't any mosquitoes.
where are we going?
over there. looks like a good place to set up camp.
your vessel will never find us here.
don't underestimate captain archer.
you're bleeding.
it's just a scratch.
remove your uniform.
i'll take care of it later.
we have no idea what microbes live in this environment. it could become infected.
i said later.
"you're my only hope of surviving here, mister tucker. i don't intend to let you die."
this one.
hold still. the provisions won't last for more than a day.
"it sounds like there's plenty of wildlife. i grew up in a place kind of like this. i don't think we're going to starve. and i can use the thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire, boil some water. thanks."
you're welcome.
that's the best you could do?
there's very little dry wood.
keep looking.  what are you waiting for?
i'm not your servant. you're the one who was raised in a primitive environment. you find the wood.
what's that supposed to mean?
you're obviously better suited to physical labour.
"in case you haven't noticed, we're not in a palace. you said it yourself. you won't survive without my help, so it seems to me that i'm the one in charge. the king of the swamp. now get your ass out there and don't come back without an armful of dry wood."
i should have you imprisoned for speaking to me that way.
you should give me a medal. you'd be dead if it weren't for me.
i'm beginning to think that would be preferable.
i doubt the commoners back home would complain.
how dare you!
you're the one who took a swing at me.
you insulted the first monarch!
"i'm just a petty commoner, remember? raised on a primitive,"
what's wrong?
"a homing beacon. unless i'm way off, someone just locked on to it."
your vessel?
no way to tell.
leave him.
let's find his weapon.
there's someone else here.
trip?
this a bad time?
"so, when do you ascend?"
two hundred and forty six days.
"it's a long shot, but maybe enterprise will get the chance to visit krios prime before then. of course, from what you've told me i doubt your family would let me see you."
"i doubt they would, but once i've been made first monarch i'll have the authority to change the rules."
what kind of changes?
come visit me. perhaps you'll find out.
there's a gorge on the southern continent five times deeper than the grand canyon.
what have you got in mind?
how about a little river rafting? t'pol says it only gets dark four days a month because of the binary suns. we'll have plenty of daylight left after we're done working every night.
it's going to take at least a week to complete the survey. should be enough time to sneak in some r and r.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we've got an alien vessel approaching. they're hailing us.
put them through to shuttlepod one.
"yes, sir."
"new planet, new aliens. banner day."
we're very relieved to see you. i'm rellus tagrim. this is my crew.
captain archer of the starship enterprise. something we can do for you?
"considering the circumstances, we would like permission to come aboard as soon as possible."
what circumstances?
the neutronic wavefront. it's almost here.
nothing on sensors.
"you should detect the storm in a few minutes. it's travelling at high warp. once we're aboard, i suggest you go to warp seven immediately."
our top speed is warp five.
the wavefront spans more than half a dozen light years. a vulcan starship encountered a class five over a century ago. the vessel was nearly destroyed.
how long until it hits?
approximately four hours.
if we reinforce structural integrity we should be able to weather it without too much trouble.
"enterprise may survive. the crew is another matter. the storm is saturated with radiolytic isotopes. if the crew is exposed, they'll be dead within three minutes. sickbay is the most heavily shielded section. it's possible that some of the crew could survive there."
"we can't fit eighty three people into sickbay, and i'm not about to draw lots."
"what about the catwalk? you know, the maintenance shaft running the length of each nacelle."
"they are heavily shielded. some kind of osmium alloy, if i remember."
you're proposing we take refuge in a crawlspace?
"it'll be a tight squeeze, but there's no reason we can't fit eighty three people in there, and whatever supplies we need."
doctor?
do you know the absorption depth of this alloy?
at least twenty thousand particles per micron.
it should be adequate.
there's just one other problem. it gets kind of toasty in there when the warp coils are online. about three hundred degrees. we'd have to shut down the main reactor.
"i don't see that we have any choice. we'll use the catwalk, and set up a command station in one of the compartments."
"aye, captain."
maybe we should open a window.
"you think it's stuffy now, wait till we get eighty three people in here."
"and don't forget porthos, and all the doctor's animals."
you ever been through a storm as bad as this?
ran into a class three once. had to take shelter in the ship's core. we were down there for six weeks.
six weeks?
any idea about a latrine?
"oh, i never thought about that. there are some storage lockers in the aft compartment. we ought to be able to convert a couple of them."
"this'll be our bridge. we're going to have to jury-rig these panels, tap them into command functions."
not much room for a captain's chair.
that storm must've been pretty scary.
"we only got worried when the generators went down. we lost the grav-plating, life support. i'll never forget that look in my father's eyes. he knew we were in trouble."
sorry to keep you in there so long. please.
we understand.
my science officer tells me you're from the takret system. that's a long way from here.
our work often takes us far from home.
we're stellar cartographers.
really? once we get out of the storm maybe you can help us update our star charts.
we'd be pleased.
this way.
you're behind schedule. do you need help?
i understand you've allotted fifteen cubic metres for medical supplies?
that's correct.
that means there's only enough room for two-thirds of these cages.
perhaps some of your creatures could share.
"they'll eat each other. they're vital to my work and the health of this crew. i'm not accustomed to making emotional appeals. please, don't ask me to choose between them."
all right. twenty cubic metres.
my edosian slugs thank you.
i'm afraid these aren't first class accommodations.
"they'll be fine, commander. we're grateful for your hospitality."
"we're going to have a lot of time to get to know each other. if you need anything, i'll be right over here."
i don't know the first thing about stellar cartography.
guri.
what if they begin to ask questions?
come in.  i didn't expect it to be beautiful. too bad we don't have time to run some scans.
we'll be inside the phenomenon for nearly eight days. we can run all the scans we want. lieutenant reed has completed his modifications.
i'm a little nervous about shutting down the power grid.
a single neutronic surge could overload the grid and damage critical systems.
"i did a little research in the vulcan database. that class five storm a century ago involved the starship t'plana. apparently, they couldn't outrun the wavefront. it was lost with all hands. i thought you said it was nearly destroyed."
i must have remembered incorrectly.
bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
ready for the handoff?
give me a second.
"standing by, captain."
we're in the driver's seat.
see you in a few minutes. archer out. let's close up shop.
done a head count?
"entire crew's accounted for, including one quadruped. would you like to try out the captain's chair?"
maybe later. where's the comm.?
"all hands, this is the captain. this catwalk is going to be our home for a while. a week, maybe more. you may not be comfortable, but you'll be alive. we have the best crew in the fleet and the sturdiest ship. i promise you, we'll get through this."
time?
"one minute, five seconds."
polarise the hull plating.
thirty seconds.
travis?
spatial turbulence.
twenty seconds. fifteen. ten.
"all hands, brace for impact."
aft stabilisers aren't engaging.
try them again.
grav-shear's dropping.
"that should be the worst of it, sir, at least for now."
"you wouldn't know who was the first vulcan ambassador to earth. six letters, ends with an r?"
"solkar, i think."
"thanks, captain."
don't mention it.
how're you holding up?
"pretty well, sir. a few days in this place should cure anyone of claustrophobia."
your quarters will probably feel like a ballroom after this.
you're the captain. can't you order the storm to calm down a little?
i'll see what i can do.
"someone has already asked for it, so why isn't he doing anything about it?"
how should i know?
another day in this place.
we're running out of food.
how're they doing?
"your guess is as good as mine. one of them came out a few hours ago. told us we were making too much noise. now, i've been real friendly. even asked them to join the game. doesn't seem like they want anything to do with us."
let's give them a little time to adjust.
"you know, i bet by now we'd have set up camp on the rim of that canyon, had a fire going."
there'll be other canyons.
"palantii, are you passing through or is there something i can help you with?"
"actually, there is something."
yes?
i assume i can depend on doctor-patient confidentiality.
this wouldn't have anything to do with gastrointestinal distress?
is it that obvious?
not at all. there's a notation in your medical file. something about an unfortunate incident during zero g training.
"the ev simulator at lunaport, or as starfleet trainees call it, the vomitorium."
nothing to be embarrassed about. i've treated a number of crewmen this afternoon for motion sickness.
that should last for about twelve hours.
"thank you, doctor."
"feeling all right, malcolm?"
never better.
any problems with the crew?
"oh, a few bumps and bruises from the turbulence. nothing too serious."
i could see about moving some of this to the aft section.
nonsense. i have plenty of room. i find the close quarters rather comforting. reminds me of home.
i didn't realise space was at a premium on denobula.
twelve billion people sharing one continent.
let me know if you change your mind.
travis?
we've got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousand kilometres ahead. i should be able to steer clear of them.
wake me if there's a problem.
"aye, captain."
"when we're past those eddies, try and get some rest yourself. ensign tanner can relieve you."
"thank you, sir. good night."
good night.
go on. go to sleep.
does this bother you?
only slightly.
am i disturbing you?
only slightly.
"you know, there's a bright side to all of this."
really.
"it's bringing the crew closer together. if you forget about the storm outside, this is almost like going on a camping trip."
perhaps we can sing a few songs later.
haven't you ever gone camping?
in a manner of speaking. i once participated in the kahswan ritual. i was taken to the desert and left to survive for ten days.
"sounds fun. you haven't left the command area much today. you might want to wander around, get to know the crew."
i'm familiar with every one of them.
there's a lot more to these people than just their names. it'd be good for you to fraternise a little.
is that an order?
does it have to be?
i'm not skilled at fraternising.
here's a chance to learn.
"i'll see your strawberry shortcake, and i'll raise you one pineapple cobbler."
broccoli?
i'm out of desserts.
call.
"oh, what i wouldn't give for a shower right about now. when this hand's over maybe you could look into building one."
would you like a sauna while i'm at it?
you knew we'd be stuck in here for over a week. you might've given it a little thought to making it tolerable.
"i only had four hours, malcolm. you're lucky we've got a toilet."
"well, i obviously overestimated your people's abilities when it comes to indoor plumbing."
you want to take a shower? build one yourself.
"thanks, chef."
"thanks, chef."
"pot roast? oh, come on. that's the third time in three days."
anyone know what they're showing tonight?
the day the earth stood still.
we're having movie night in here?
"captain's orders. i set up a monitor in compartment five. the screen's a little small, but"
who's picking these movies? shouldn't we all get a vote?
i think something's burning.
are you aware you're sitting on top of a plasma manifold? you got to turn that thing off!
"i apologise, commander. we should've spoken with you first."
that might've been a good idea.
we've had trouble digesting your food.
archer to tucker.
go ahead.
i need you in the command area right away.
i'll be right there.
i'll talk to chef. maybe he can heat that up for you.
we may have a problem in engineering.
the antimatter injectors have come online.
that can't be right. probably just a glitch. think you've got room for one more sleeping bag in here?
not happy with your bunk mates?
"i caught them throwing a barbecue next to a plasma manifold. now, i understand we're explorers. we're supposed to keep an open mind about different cultures, but these guys are driving me crazy. they only need to sleep once a week, so they've kept us up the last two nights with their strange rituals. chanting, walking in circles. they've practically taken over the compartment."
don't forget they're the ones who warned us about the storm. we owe them. be patient.
i'm trying. looks like the matter injectors and the antimatter injectors are online.
two sensor glitches?
a power surge could've triggered both circuits.
do you have any idea what the odds are of that happening?
can you shut them down?
not from here. someone's going to have to go to engineering.
"remember, the suit will protect you for only twenty two minutes."
it'd be best not to take the scenic route.
we've searched every deck. there's no sign of the fugitives.
what about the crew?
it appears they have deserted the ship.
these humans. they've travelled over a hundred light years from their homeworld.
"captain's starlog, february 9, 2152. the vulcans have allowed the mazarites to leave. ambassador v'lar says there's a"
archer and his crew must've taken refuge in a nearby system. they may intend to return. what's the status of the warp engines?
i'm having difficulty with the dilithium matrix.
make it a priority.
2152. we've responded to a distress call from a vessel in the
they're immune to radiolytic isotopes. the storm was never any threat to them.
"funny, you didn't mention that."
we were in danger. our ship is less durable than yours. we would've been destroyed by the storm.
who are they? what are they doing here?
"captain, i assure you. we don't know these men."
they just happened to find enterprise in the middle of a class five neutronic storm? where three members of their own species just happened to be taking refuge?
we're more than twenty light years from your homeworld. it's an unlikely coincidence.
i get the feeling they must be looking for you. answer me!
i told you we shouldn't have come here.
guri.
they're officers of the takret militia. they've been pursuing us for weeks. we thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship.
they must've detected our vessel in your launch bay.
what do they want with you?
"we used to be members of the militia, in the lower ranks, but after a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt. they seize alien vessels without provocation. they murder the crews, take anything of value."
they're little more than criminals.
we tried to resign our commissions but they wouldn't allow it.
you're deserters.
"we had no choice. we would've told you the truth, but we weren't sure that you would help us."
"if they find us, we'll be executed."
"captain, i apologise for the difficult position that we've put you in, but i know these men. even if they found us, i doubt they'd simply leave. they've captured vessels far less impressive than yours."
"they're trying to re-initialise the warp reactor, sir. it seems to me they've already decided to help themselves to enterprise."
"they obviously don't realise we're in the catwalk. if they learn we're here, it would undoubtedly endanger the crew."
what're you suggesting? we just sit on our hands until they fire up the engines?
you're assuming these three are telling the truth. they've already lied to us.
we're not lying. these men are dangerous.
palanti to captain.
yes.
the dilithium matrix is active.
we're ready to initialise the warp reactor.
stand by.
do we have helm control?
the navigation relay's still not responding. i think they've been re-routed.
how much longer?
i'm not certain.
bring the warp engines online and report to the bridge.
acknowledged.
"we may outnumber them, but we only have three ev suits."
i could take a security team and bring back more.
i doubt you'd get very far. the launch bay's crawling with them.
"even if we could get the suits, we only have twenty two minutes in the radiation. hard to believe we could re-take the ship in that"
how long do we have?
it'll take a while for the warp coils to charge.
how long?
"twenty minutes, tops."
"remember, junction forty two alpha."
understood.
"third panel, starboard side. and be careful. there's a lot of current running through those circuits. i really ought to be the one doing this, captain. the doc said i was only out there for thirteen minutes."
"forget it, trip. you've already been exposed."
i've isolated your comm. frequencies. they won't hear a thing.
tell travis to wait for my signal.
any progress?
not yet. we could lose our ship by staying here. we should take what we can and leave.
keep working. i want helm control.
i'll see you back at the catwalk. don't be late.
"aye, captain."
t'pol?
we're in position.
"all right. first, you're going to have to disrupt the antimatter stream."
do you see the blue conduit to the left of the power transfer module?
go ahead.
start by locking down the flow regulators.
stand by.
we're being hailed.
another ship?
no. it's coming from within this vessel.
answer it.
you're in my chair.
captain archer. i didn't realise you were still aboard. where's the rest of your crew?
"they're dead, killed by the storm."
i'm sorry.
"thanks for your condolences. now, why don't you get the hell off my ship."
i'm afraid i can't do that. we detected a vessel in your launch bay that belongs to three fugitives.
"i've been watching you, i know you're trying to take enterprise. i'm not going to let you."
"you're in no position to do anything about it. i'm in command of this bridge. your vessel has been impounded under the authority of the takret militia. when we return, you'll be charged with criminal conspiracy."
"i don't recognise your authority. i answer to starfleet command, and i'm under orders to use any means necessary to keep my ship from falling into enemy hands."
i have soldiers searching every deck. it's only a matter of time before they find you.
you're leaving me no choice. i'll destroy enterprise.
"earth's first warp five starship? your father's engine? i've been reading about you, captain, and i doubt very much if you'll do anything to damage this vessel."
you would be surprised.
can you trace his signal?
he's somewhere on the fifth deck.
you have men there. alert them.
go ahead.
"it's time to change course, travis. head straight for that plasma eddy."
"it'll take a minute, sir."
try and keep us in one piece. i'm on my way back. archer out.
we've altered course.
where's he taking us?
what's the problem shutting down the reactor?
we're having trouble with the dilithium sequencers. it's taking longer than we expected.
i don't mean to rush you
but it's getting pretty warm in here.
he's steering us toward a plasma eddy.
how long?
less than eight minutes.
get me helm control!
it'll take me much longer than that. we should evacuate.
no!
you heard what he said. he's willing to destroy his own ship.
"the temperature just went up another six degrees. sub-commander, how's it coming?"
we're disabling
the final sequencer.
the warp reactor has shut down.
spatial disturbance. we're four minutes from the eddy.
unless you've found a way to turn this ship around i strongly suggest we abort the mission.
three minutes.
"soldiers, report to the docking hatch immediately. i repeat, report to the docking hatch!"
report.
we're too close to the eddy. we've got to veer off.
maintain your course.
another one like that'll split us in two.
they could still be on board.
we've got no choice.
maintain your course. that's an order.  go ahead.
"travis, i hope you're not still heading for that eddy. our friends are gone."
ensign.
did that guy shoot one of his own men?
it's hard to tell them apart in those ridiculous hats.
the dead man was secretly working for sheriff boggs.
how do you know that?
isn't it obvious?
"all hands, this is the captain. thanks to some fine piloting by travis mayweather, we're going to be moving out of the storm a little earlier than expected. we should be clear in a few minutes."
"glad you could join us, sub-commander. we have movie night every tuesday, if you're interested."
i apologise for the trouble we've caused.
where're you headed next?
the gyrannan system. we should be safe there.
good luck.
that's everyone.
"chief engineers log, supplemental. this turned out to be the perfect spot to test the autopilot upgrades. the gas giant has dozens of moons. it's like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle. watch out, travis. these modifications are working so well, pretty soon we won't need pilots anymore."
archer to shuttlepod one.
captain?
"looks like you're about to have some company, trip. sensors are picking up a small"
"say again, captain. i'm picking up a lot of interference."
this is commander charles tucker.
"tucker to enterprise. mayday. i'm losing power. mayday! if you can hear me, i'm making an emergency landing, thrusters only. i take it back, travis. i could use a flesh and blood pilot right about now."
"enterprise to shuttlepod one. commander tucker, do you read me?"
malcolm?
i detected weapons fire and then both ships just disappeared.
last known position?
"approximately fifty thousand kilometres, bearing zero zero three mark two seven, i think. i can't be more specific. it's the damned interference."
many of these moons have atmospheres that contain selenium isotopes. that's most likely what's affecting our sensors.
trip's a good pilot. if he was near one of those moons he most likely set down on it. how many are there?
sixty two.
then we'd better start looking. travis.
"yes, sir."
"we'll scan every moon, even if we have to do it with binoculars. keep hailing him."
"chief engineer's log, supplemental. for the record, i was attacked by a small craft. i don't know what i did to provoke him. something in this moon's atmosphere neutralised my engines. i was forced to make an emergency landing. looks like i took some damage on impact. main power's still offline. i don't think i'll be flying out of here. first things first. i'll try and get the transceiver working, contact the enterprise."
damn it.
son of a bitch stole my transceiver.
who are they?
an arkonian military vessel.
you've dealt with them?
"no, but i'm aware of their reputation. if we're in their territory, we should proceed with extreme caution."
they're hailing us.
you are on an unauthorised course. leave immediately.
and you are?
captain khata'n zshaar. i have orders to destroy any vessel that violates our territory.
i'm captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. we weren't aware that this system was claimed by anyone.
why is there a vulcan on your bridge?
sub-commander t-pol is my science officer.
turn your ship around.
a member of my crew is missing. we believe he exchanged weapons fire with a small vessel. was it one of yours?
we sent a patrol ship to intercept your shuttle. we have also lost contact.
then maybe we can look for them together. once we've recovered our crewman we'll be more than happy to leave.
"if your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship, your crewman is already dead."
"either way, we're not going anywhere until we know what happened. now it seems to me we have a similar problem. two missing people and sixty two moons. it'll go a lot faster if we use both our ships to co-ordinate the search. the sooner we get started, the sooner we'll be out of your territory."
"it's him. i recognise his shuttlecraft. he seems about as bad off as i am. whatever knocked out my engines probably did the same to his. if i'd brought a universal translator along, i'd be able to explain to this guy that i'm just trying to get out of here like he is. one piece of good news. it's starting to warm up a little. dawn is coming."
i'm coming out now. please don't fire. i want to talk. i'm unarmed.
"we need to talk. you have something that belongs to me. i want it back. if you understand anything that i'm saying to you, i want you to listen very, very closely. mary had a little lamb. its fleece was white as snow."
"and everywhere that mary went, the lamb was sure to go."
"now, maybe we can introduce ourselves."
"nice to meet you, too. now, i don't want to hurt you. i just want my transceiver back."
i'm no good until i've had my coffee.
you wouldn't have a universal translator on you?
i don't understand a word you're saying!
"i can't make it work. it's broken. you know, broken. i was trying to make repairs when you stole it."
what?
kushka roatta.
you want me to fix your transceiver.
is that a yes or a no?
kushka.
"kushka to you, too."
you kill me and i can't fix anything. you're going to have to untie me. i need my hands.
"i try anything, i'm a dead man. i get the message."
any progress?
we've searched five of the moons. no sign of commander tucker or the arkonian ship.
and the arkonians?
it appears they've made no progress either. they're continuing to search the moons they agreed to.
this is their territory. they could have called for more ships to help search.
i'm afraid they don't trust us. primarily because i'm a vulcan.
what's the bad blood?
"we made first contact nearly a hundred years ago, not long after the arkonians developed warp drive. but from the beginning, our relations were difficult. your people accepted vulcan guidance, opened diplomatic and cultural exchanges. the arkonians were suspicious and deceitful. eventually, the high command withdrew its contingent."
"well, maybe we'll have better luck with them."
it doesn't appear promising.
they agreed to work with us.
for now. i'd advise you to remain cautious. arkonians are unpredictable. they're prone to hostility.
i'll keep that in mind. let me know when we reach the next moon.
damn it.
damn.
"well, looks like we've made some headway in our first contact between humans and whatever you are. unfortunately, your first word is something you wouldn't want to use in polite company."
damn it.
no. i'm trip.  trip.
trip.  zho'kaan.
"zho'kaan. great. now that we've been properly introduced, how about some water, zho'kaan? it's getting kind of hot. thirsty. you know. drink. water."
trip.
thanks.
what the hell is that?
sorry. i have water in my shuttle. water. something i can drink.
there's a medkit in my shuttlepod.
what the hell are you doing? are you crazy?
that was quite a trick.
drat. drat komacha.
"all right, all right. i can't fix this thing. it's a lost cause. maybe if you vomit on it, it'll fix itself. come over here. i want you to see this. here. come here. it's like talking to porthos. see this? i tried bypassing the induction coil, but it didn't work. see? in here."
"i can't fix this. i need to get back to my ship. my ship. now, pick 'em up. pick them up!"
"same to you. now, let's get going."
what have you got?
see for yourself.
i'll need a little help here.
it's a thermo-kinetic analysis of e moons. each of them undergoes extreme temperature variations during their orbits.
go on.
"at night, it can drop to five or even ten degrees below zero."
doesn't sound so bad.
"during the day, the temperature can rise to as high as one hundred and seventy degrees."
we'd better hope that trip landed on the night side.
and that we find him before the sun rises.
don't give me that look. you started this.
you want some food? food.
nohkto.
nohkto. i couldn't agree more.
"you want food from your ship? v'dhoze, that means food?"
v'dhoze.
"v'dhoze, ship."
ship.
"yeah. sorry, but breakfast is going to have to wait. i've figured out a way to get us out of here. i got a pretty good look at your comm. configuration back there. i think i can cannibalise the power supply from your transceiver and use it to get mine working. maybe get a message off."
got it. almost there. i think this is going to work.
nohkto.
"no, not nohkto. good."
good.
"that's right. we're getting out of here. once we get back to enterprise and we can finally understand each other, the first words out of your mouth had better be thank you."
you think that's funny?
"you going to laugh now? tucker to enterprise. enterprise, do you read me? come on, hoshi. tucker to enterprise. this terrain, it's all volcanic. igneous rock is heavy in diamagnetic minerals. it's interfering with the transmission. i think i know what we need to do. the transceiver, the tsunsana. it's bad down here. nohkto. but if we take it to higher ground we could avoid some of the interference. i'm going to need help. you and me, together."
"see? i'm not going to hurt you, and you are not going to hurt me. we'll work together."
"before we start, we'll get some food from your ship. your v'dhoze."
easy.
is that the best you can do?
"we can fight some more if you want, or we can try to get the hell out of here. what's it going to be?"
come on.
"captain, i'm picking up a transmission."
trip?
i can't tell yet. i'm trying to get a lock.
respond. mayday. enterprise. anybody. please respond.
we never received a call.
it was transmitted on a starfleet frequency.
you told me these moons are dangerous. so why haven't you rescued your pilot?
"that's why i asked you here. the message was in a starfleet frequency, but we think the carrier wave was generated by your technology. we weren't able to respond. if we can't isolate the wave we won't be able to rescue either of them. my science officer believes she can recalibrate your scanners to isolate our frequencies. then you can pinpoint their location."
"if i allowed a vulcan access to an arkonian ship, i'd be executed."
then send your science officer over here. t'pol can show him what to do. it seems my engineer and your pilot have found a way to work together.
"chief engineer's log, supplemental. it's been two hours since we started signaling the enterprise. no response yet. the sun's not even up yet and it's already hotter than hell. my sparring partner doesn't look too good. i can't be sure, but i don't think his species can sweat. for the record, i have learned one thing about him. his name's zho'kaan. anything you want to say to the folks back home?"
nohkto.
"that means bad. you'd be proud of me, hoshi. i've picked up about a dozen words in his language. a couple of them are real tongue-twisters."
hey. zho'kaan.  i though i lost you there.
tsunsana. enterprise krnat?
no. no enterprise.
damn it.
"don't worry. i'll get phlox to cook up a new batch for you once we're aboard enterprise. he's great with that kind of thing. stay with me, zho'kaan. gan tak. don't die on me now, understand? all right."
enterprise.
"see? i told you. hoshi, is that you?"
do you read me?
"we read you, trip."
"you're just in time, captain. it's starting to get a little hot down here."
we're getting a lock on your position now.
don't send a shuttlepod.
there's something in this atmosphere that'll affect the engines.
"it's selenium isotopes, but we don't think it will interfere with the transporter."
"i'm not alone, captain."
we know. the arkonians helped us find you. how are you and their pilot getting along?
"uh, just like old friends. i'm a little worried, though. he's gotten very dehydrated."
"stand by, trip.  prepare the transporter."
"i wouldn't do that, captain."
what's the problem?
"i've been analysing the arkonians' physiology. their endocrine system is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations. if that pilot is suffering from dehydration, it's no doubt causing an acute cellular breakdown."
meaning?
transporting him will most likely be fatal.
archer to commander tucker.
"i'm still here, captain."
"trip, we can bring you aboard but we can't transport the arkonian. doctor phlox says it will kill him. we'll try to find a way to get him back to his ship."
"but in the meantime, i'm getting you out of there."
"no way, captain. i'm not leaving him here."
"the surface temperature is rising quickly, commander. i estimate it will reach one hundred thirty degrees within the next hour."
let's get you home.
then we'll worry about your friend.
"i'm sorry, sir, but i can't do that."
maybe there's another way.
"we know our pods can't make it, but i got a good look at the circuitry inside the arkonian shuttle. one of theirs could be modified."
how?
if they take a look at their intake manifolds
i think they could realign them to filter out the isotopes.
"we'll talk to them, but i won't let you stay down there much longer."
understood.
archer out.
"tucker to enterprise. enterprise, respond. some of these relays have fused. must be the heat. hey. gan tak."
"i don't suppose the captain'll trust me to go out on my own for a while. i wouldn't be surprised if he knocked me down to steward. your orange juice, sir. jam or marmalade, sir? but i tell you i wouldn't trade my time on enterprise. not for anything. i've seen things i could never imagine back home. i saw the great plume of agosoria and i saw the ringed moons of matalas prime. and i stood on an asteroid crater twice as high as everest, and went diving in the ice caves of etheenia. rode in a suliban cell ship. spent the night, i spent the night with a princess. oh, and i even got pregnant once. now there's a story. i'm sure you have stories, too. that's why we chose this life, right? see things we've never seen before. hell of a ride, though. hell of a ride."
zho'kaan. v'dhoze.
come in.
i just got a report from my doctor. your pilot's responding well. he'll be ready to go home in a few hours.
and your crewman?
"he's tired and a bit sunburned, but he's doing fine."
"if i discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without provocation, he'll be disciplined."
it was a misunderstanding. i hope we can avoid them in the future.
"i expect you to leave this system immediately, as agreed."
i guess we won't be adding the arkonians to our list of friends.
the encounter was less volatile than i expected. you managed to establish better relations in a single day than the vulcans have in a century.
let's hope it stays that way.
how's he doing?
why don't you ask him yourself? the universal translator is online.
"they told me another ten minutes of sunshine, and we'd have been cooked."
tarattaash.
i thought you said the ut was working.
i believe you promised me some tarattaash.
you mean the brown stuff you were drinking? won't take a minute. anything else while i'm at it? our chef is making something called chicken marsala tonight.
tarat
tarattaash. got you.
trip. when i fired at your vessel. i'm grateful i didn't destroy it.
that makes two of us.
your neurolytic enzymes are considerably higher than last month.
the treatment's no longer effective?
i told you it was just a matter of time before we'd need supplemental medications. this conference is a perfect opportunity. some of your finest physicians will be there. it's essential that i speak with them.
it's too great a risk. i'd be taken off enterprise.
i think i can question them without revealing that you're infected.
it's too great a risk.
"i'm afraid we have no choice. without further treatment, you could very possibly die."
"how long's it been, doc?"
"oh, i haven't seen feezal for nearly four years."
what's the point of having three wives if you never get to see them?
denobulans are renowned for their patience.
"welcome, my beloved!"
my beloved.
"captain archer, i'd like you to meet my second wife, feezal."
it's a pleasure to have you aboard.
thank you.
"and this is our chief engineer, commander tucker."
ma'am.
i look forward to helping you install the microscope.
we can hold that off till later. i'm sure the two of you are eager to spend some time together.
"nonsense, captain. we've been apart for four years. another hour, another day. as i said, we're very patient."
"well in that case, why don't we have some lunch while the microscope's being unloaded?"
i'd be honoured.
"won't you be joining us, commander?"
"i'd love to, but i think i should make sure your equipment gets up to sickbay in one piece."
then i'll see you after lunch?
you bet.
"it seems odd, doesn't it, that a denobulan physician would be interested in a vulcan disease."
one of my colleagues on denobula has been studying pa'nar syndrome for some time. its pathology is quite similar to thymic sclerosis.
thymic sclerosis?
"it's a nonfatal illness which we've had very little success treating. i promised him, my colleague back home, that i'd inquire about any recent advances in its treatment."
"we're hesitant to discuss pa'nar syndrome, doctor. this illness is unique to a subculture, a small percentage of our population. their behaviour is neither tolerated nor sanctioned."
"my friend is well aware of that. unfortunately, thymic sclerosis is found in all strata of denobulan society. developing a cure is of paramount importance."
do you have any literature on this disease?
"as i told you, i'm currently serving on a starfleet vessel. humans are not susceptible to it. i could contact my colleague but it would take at least five days before we'd receive a response."
i'm afraid we'll have returned to vulcan by then.
anything you could provide me with would be instrumental in helping the denobulan people.
"we'll have to discuss your request, doctor. when we've reached a decision, we'll contact you aboard your ship."
thank you for your time.
"if the reflectometer is supposed to amplify the neutron stream, shouldn't it be installed before the emitters?"
"it's collimating the neutrons, not amplifying them. if you read the instructions, you'll find it's all very clear."
"oh, i've tried to read the instructions, and they are anything but clear. i don't want to brag, but i can take apart and put back together just about any piece of equipment i've ever met. it's one of the reasons captain archer picked me for this mission, because i'm really good at following instructions. but these are in"
denobulan. i understand. that's why i'm here. so let's go through it slowly. do you see the threads on the aperture ring?
here.
exactly. take the smaller condenser lens and screw it on. now remodulate the emitter frequency. that'll initiate the neutron stream.
which one?
you're going to have to help me with this one.
it's very simple. insert the thick end into this opening. it'll automatically programme the frequency. you can pull it out now. the stream should be initiated.
"i think i'm getting the hang of it. maybe if you explain the next few steps, i could try and get through some of this on my own."
"by all means. you're a very confident young man, aren't you?"
i try to be.
you're going to need to come a little closer to see this.
have you spoken to phlox since he got back?
i wasn't aware he was gone.
you must've not seen him yesterday morning. he was champing at the bit to get down to that conference. brought back a wish list of medical instruments.
it is the first i.m.e. conference he's attended in over a year.
he said there was a vulcan contingent. you might want to go down for a visit. you may know one of them.
there are over one million physicians on vulcan.
i would think you'd enjoy spending time with members of your own species.  archer.
"a vulcan transport has requested permission to dock, sir. they've already left the surface."
speak of the devil. looks like you won't have to go anywhere. i'll meet them at docking port two.
"they've asked that the doctor join you, and sub-commander t'pol."
"let him know, okay?"
"right away, sir."
you have any idea what this is about?
i haven't spoken to anyone on the surface.
you can bet they're not coming up for coffee and doughnuts.
"can i get you something? thanks to sub-commander t'pol, our chef has learned to make some pretty decent plomeek soup."
"we appreciate your hospitality, captain, but we've come to speak to your doctor, with your permission."
"absolutely. if you need anything, just let me know."
we would appreciate it if t'pol would remain.
sub-commander.
"we've discussed your request. unfortunately, we are still hesitant to share data regarding pa'nar syndrome."
sub-commander t'pol is not aware of my request. i'm curious why you asked her to stay.
"you're requesting information about a vulcan disease, and you didn't discuss it with your vulcan science officer?"
"that's correct. as far as i know, her expertise does not include medicine."
"are you familiar with pa'nar syndrome, sub-commander?"
of course.
would you mind describing it?
you are physicians. why would you need me to define an illness?
"please, indulge us."
it's an incurable degradation of the synaptic pathways. it also affects the endocrine and immune systems.
an impressive definition. could you tell us how the disease is transmitted?
through a telepathic practice.
and what practice would that be?
"mind-melds. they cause a disruption of neuroelectric impulses in the mid-brain, which can lead to the early stages of the syndrome."
"do you condone these acts, sub-commander? these mind-melds?"
i'd appreciate it if you'd tell me why you asked me here.
as would i. your questions to t'pol seem inappropriate.
doctor phlox has asked for data regarding the treatment of pa'nar syndrome. did you have anything to do with that request?
i believe i was very clear about that.
"yes, your colleague on denobula. forgive us doctor, but since there's a vulcan serving on your ship, a fact that you neglected to mention to us, we had to consider other possible motives for you inquiry."
what motive are you suggesting?
are you familiar with any of these names?
they're vulcan. i'm not familiar with any of them.
"they're melders. vulcans with the ability to transfer thoughts and memories to each other. do you know any melders, sub-commander?"
"not well, but i've met a number of them."
then i'll ask you again. do you condone their behaviour?
i don't understand what your questions have to do with the doctor's request.
"we find their behaviour unacceptable, and since pa'nar syndrome is transmitted by these people, its cure is not a priority."
are you saying there is no additional research?
none that we'd care to disseminate. i'm sorry.
you travelled up from the surface to tell doctor phlox you wouldn't help him?
if you'll please show us to the airlock.
is it definitive?
unmistakably. she's suffering from the syndrome.
now watch. a simple strand of protein molecules can be enlarged and enhanced to where we can clearly see a single nucleotide.
amazing. look at that. are those?
carbon atoms. now you try it.
first i reinitialise the neutron stream.
precisely. very good. now align the quantum filters.
this is a bitch.
excuse me?
"oh, not you. the microscope."
has vesna forgiven groznik yet?
absolutely not. groznik has only apologised twice. i doubt he'll be forgiven for another two years.
"well, at least he has his other wives."
"not wives, wife. kessil moved to teerza prime to be with her third husband."
did i do this right? why is there no image?
you forgot to enter the frequency parameters.
"which one was her third husband? oh, was that klaban?"
"bogga. klaban was forlisa's husband. her first, i think."
there you go. why isn't it sharp?
you forgot to stabilise the aperture. that's just a reflection of the imaging filament. that's all right.
we'll reinitialise the neutron stream and start again.
"forlisa. forlisa. oh, my, my."
i thought about asking forlisa to be my second wife. turned out she already had three husbands.
archer to doctor phlox.
"yes, captain."
could you report to my ready room?
"certainly. i'll be back as soon as i can, my beloved. commander."
come in.
"yes, captain."
i wanted to see both of you. it's been a while since i was embarrassed by a vulcan dignitary.
sir?
i just spoke to doctor oratt. it seems you requested some medical data regarding a vulcan illness for a colleague on denobula.
"yes, sir."
and both of you said that t'pol had nothing to do with that request. are you both going to lie to me like you lied to them?
"i have no intention of lying to you, captain."
and when were you going to tell me that you've contracted a serious illness?
sir?
"they handed you something. a padd, i think. does that ring a bell? you left a fingerprint. it was enough for them to run tests. why did you lie to them?"
it's none of their concern.
it sure as hell is if they can help you.  how long have you known about this?
nearly a year.
and you never thought that maybe you should come to me and let me know that one of my officers has a potentially fatal disease?
i believe your culture embraces the concept of doctor-patient confidentiality.
the disease is not contagious. if we had told you there's nothing you could have done.
you still haven't explained to me why you lied to the vulcans. and why would you think they would be more apt to help you if you said it was for a denobulan colleague?
pa'nar syndrome is an illness that carries a stigma on vulcan.
"if the high command was to learn that i was infected, i would most likely lose my commission."
for having a disease?
it's not about the disease. it's about the people who are capable of transmitting it.
go on.
"there are certain vulcans, a small minority, who are born with the ability to perform a very intimate form of telepathy."
intimate?
a melding of minds.
that ship of vulcans who were experimenting with emotions.
they are part of the telepathic minority. one of the reasons why they left vulcan was to escape prejudice. their behaviour is considered unnatural. they're seen as a threat.
you belong to that minority?
no.
then?
"only members of the minority can initiate a mind-meld, but any vulcan can be the recipient."
why would you take that risk?
it wasn't by choice. one of the men on that ship.
you were attacked. i remember. i'm sure the high command will understand.
i have no intention of telling them.
why not?
i have my reasons.
how serious is it?
"i've kept it in check, but the symptoms have progressed. that's why i requested the most current research."
"well, your request was accompanied by a lie, and whatever your reasons might have been, you're no longer welcome at the conference. the vulcans have seen to that."
i understand.
"my number one priority here is the health of my first officer. if these doctors have data that can help her, i plan to get it."
"i'm sorry, did we keep you waiting?"
"actually, you did."
"what can we do for you, captain?"
sub-commander t'pol and my doctor have explained the situation to me.
it's unfortunate that t'pol is ill.
doctor phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect her privacy. he doesn't make a habit of lying.
i certainly hope not.
"i'm having a little difficulty understanding why you won't share your research, especially now that you know it could help t'pol's condition. i can't believe you're withholding it to punish doctor phlox."
our decision has nothing to do with that.
then what does it have to do with?
"pa'nar syndrome is a disease that's unique to an undesirable segment of our population. thankfully, there are very few of them."
and because you find them undesirable they're not entitled to medical care?
we don't condone the intimate acts that these people engage in. they defy everything our society stands for.
intimate acts? you're talking about mind-melds.
"we take great pride in our ability to contain emotions. sharing them is offensive. now if you'll excuse me, we have a great deal of work to do before the conference ends."
if you're not going to help her the least you could do is show a little discretion. the high command doesn't need to know about this.
it's not for us to decide what the high command needs to know.
you have her genetic profile. you must realise she's not a member of this minority.
"nonetheless, there's only one way to contract pa'nar syndrome. good day."
yes.
there's a message for you coming from the surface.
transfer it here.
right away.
come in.
"i was just about to call you. sit down. i'm sorry. i didn't have much luck down there. they seemed pretty pig-headed when it comes to pa'nar syndrome, and i got the distinct feeling they're not going to keep this to themselves."
i just received a message from doctor yuris.
which one was he?
the youngest. he asked me to meet him in a northern section of the city. i believe he wants to help.
help? that seems like the last thing these doctors want to do.
he asked me to come alone.
"you know, it never dawned on me that it was contagious."
i beg your pardon?
"you said it wasn't contagious, that there was nothing i could have done."
that's correct.
that doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me.
there's a landing port about a kilometre south of the meeting place. you worry about your crew.
you're damn straight i do. every last one of them. you find that strange? i guess all vulcans find worrying strange.
i didn't want you to worry about me.
sub-commander. this may be of use to you.
what is it?
the research your doctor asked for.
you've taken a great risk by bringing this to me.
one that i'm more than willing to take.
why?
there's more intolerance today than there was a thousand years ago. it has to stop.
why jeopardise your career to help someone you despise?
"if i despised you, i'd be despising myself. i'm part of the minority."
you know i'm not a member of the minority.
"as far as my colleagues are concerned, you might as well be. anyone who chooses to perform a mind-meld is worthy of contempt."
what if i didn't choose?
you were coerced. you should tell them. they'll be far more sympathetic.
are you infected?
"no. only a small percentage are. if they ask my opinion, i won't be able to condone what you did. i hope you understand."
you can't jeopardise your position.
i have to return. tell them what happened. tell them before they contact the high command.
thank you for this.
it doesn't make any sense.
why not?
"we're orbiting an alien world, and most of the crew are free to go down and visit. why would anyone want to stay on board and watch a movie?"
are you kidding? they're showing the black cat. boris karloff and bela lugosi.
it sounds like you're the one picking the movies.
me?
"who else would choose an obscure horror film? why not something a little more, i don't know, romantic? i'm going down to the surface."
what's the rush? you haven't even finished your dinner.
there's a shuttle leaving at eighteen hundred hours.
you've got plenty of time.
try the cobbler. chef outdid himself.
"okay, but i have to leave in a few minutes."
may i join you?
please. i'm hoshi sato. i've been meaning to introduce myself.
feezal phlox. you're the language wizard. my husband speaks very fondly of you.
doctor phlox has been teaching me denobulan.
i'm impressed.
i'm still having trouble with the transitive verbs.
"i'm getting a little paranoid here. you're not talking about me, are you?"
"matter of fact, we were."
ensign sato barely has an accent. she was telling me how attractive she thinks you are.
"she's pulling your leg, sir. i was only talking about grammar."
"it's okay, hoshi."
i've got to go. it was very nice to meet you.
"i wasn't exactly pulling your leg, was i?"
"no, not exactly. look, i'm very flattered, but aren't you a married woman?"
"i'm a woman. that's all that matters, isn't it?"
"i'm afraid i've got to go, too. captain asked me to write a synopsis of tonight's movie."
save me a seat.
"you probably wouldn't like it. it's very scary, and you've got to. you've got to be human to appreciate horror films. i'll see you in the morning."
she's at it again.
"i don't know about you, but i find her quite attractive."
"come on, malcolm, this is serious. what if phlox finds out?"
you haven't done anything to make her think that you
of course not. maybe i should tell the doc.
tell him what? that his wife is trying to seduce you? not a good idea.
i've got to spend the next two days with her working on the microscope. i really think i should speak to phlox.
it might be a lot easier to avoid her advances than to get phlox angry. i once saw him lose his temper when one of his creatures bit him. it wasn't a pretty sight.
"this is far from a cure, but it should slow down the progression of the disease. it's surprising. i assumed your science directorate would've made more progress than this."
"as we've seen, they're not very motivated to develop a cure."
"with this research, i should be able to get closer than they have."
how useful is it?
very. it will allow me to improve my course of treatment long before her symptoms get worse.
have you figured out why doctor yuris gave it to you?
"no, i haven't. you spoke with them."
a few minutes ago. they've decided to recall you.
do they have the authority to do that?
doctor oratt does. he's a ranking member of the council of physicians. they plan on taking you back to vulcan when the conference is over.
have they notified the high command?
"not till you reach vulcan. you've got to tell them, t'pol. tell them what happened. they won't do a thing to you once they know it wasn't voluntary, that he did it against your will."
i won't do that.
why the hell not?
i have pa'nar syndrome. it doesn't make a difference how i contracted it.
it makes a lot of difference. you're not a member of this minority. he forced himself on you. you said it yourself.
"he's right, t'pol. you should tell them."
"he is not right. if i use that as a defence as a way to keep from being taken off enterprise, i'd be condoning their prejudice, and in the process, indicting every member of the minority. i won't do that."
where's oratt?
doctor oratt isn't available. perhaps i can help you?
perhaps you can't.
you're going to have to leave.
i need to talk to you!
i told him you were busy.
"what can i do for you, captain?"
you have no right to take my science officer.
you're mistaken. i have every right.
you can't dismiss someone just because you don't agree with the way they conduct their personal lives.
i am not dismissing t'pol. i'm simply returning her to vulcan. the high command will decide whether she is fit for duty.
"fit? you're saying a single mind-meld is enough to destroy her career? or is it that she contracted the disease? that's why you're so hesitant to find a cure, isn't it? why bother to help people you don't approve of?"
"i'm sorry you don't understand the complexities of our culture, captain. please have the sub-commander ready to depart in thirty six hours."
"not so fast. you know what this is, doctor? my communications officer got it from the vulcan database. it's the protocols of the council of physicians. it says that anyone accused of ethical misconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officer in the province or territory where the accusation was first made. if i'm not mistaken, that would be you."
the accusation against t'pol stands. it's not open for debate.
"where i come from, everything's open for debate. and if i read these protocols correctly, so is the accusation you made against my science officer."
you're wasting your time.
it's mine to waste.
very well. but i will not delay our departure. the hearing will take place tomorrow afternoon.
tomorrow afternoon. fine.
it's the dekendi's favourite sport.
"just because they asked you to participate, doesn't mean you had to."
they said it was an honour. it looked easy enough.
"you're lucky this creature didn't strike a bit lower. if i may ask, what is the purpose of this sport?"
"they've got these fargans. they're kind of like cows with humps, and they love melons. i think they're melons. so, four guys get into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons back and forth. they use sticks with metal baskets at the end. do you play monkey-in-the-middle on denobula?"
i don't believe so.
"anyway, after a while, the fargans start figuring out what's going on, and"
"you got a minute, doc?"
"are you not feeling well, commander?"
"no, i'm fine. i just, er, i need to talk to you for a minute."
by all means. what's on your mind?
"actually, i was kind of hoping to talk to you alone."
i think we're about done here. it would be best if you avoided fargans for a few days.
"thanks, doc. commander."
"see you, travis. malcolm said this was a bad idea, but i, i think it's the right thing to do."
what's that?
"feezal, i mean, mrs. phlox, is a lovely woman, and she's very smart. she knows more about quantum optics than anyone i've ever met."
she is remarkable.
"remarkable, yeah, she sure is."
was there something else?
"yeah, there is. you got to understand, i've been a perfect gentleman. absolutely nothing's happened. she's trying to. she's, she's, er, making advances, if you know what i mean?"
sexual advances?
i'm afraid so.
has she offered to give you a rose petal bath?
"no, no, no. nothing like that."
"oh, any man would be a fool to ignore the romantic overtures of a healthy denobulan woman. don't you find her attractive?"
"sure. i mean, no, she's your wife."
what does that have to do with it?
she's your wife?
"oh, nonsense. nonsense. you're too concerned with human morality. i thought you wanted to learn about new cultures. isn't that why you joined starfleet?"
"why, of course it is. but i was brought up believing you don't play around with another man's wife. i don't think i'm ever going to change my mind about that."
as you wish. your loss.
come in.
lieutenant reed told me you went to the surface.
i spoke to doctor oratt. i didn't tell you because i didn't want you to try and talk me out of it.
i assume you were unsuccessful.
"not exactly. before i left, i got the medical protocols from hoshi. it seems they owe you a hearing."
they'll never agree.
they already did.
i have no interest in challenging their decision.
"if you're not going to defend yourself, the least you can do is speak for this minority you're so eager to protect. you said you didn't want to condone the attitude of these doctors. your silence would do just that."
you need to understand. i won't tell them how i got the disease.
"i'll go along with that. i promise. but you've got to understand, i'm not going to give you up without a fight."
the fact that she has pa'nar syndrome is not the reason she's being recalled.
no. it has to do with how she got infected. a mind meld over a year ago.
when it took place is not pertinent.
"so what you're saying is that if a vulcan, even an officer in the science directorate, engages in this exchange of thoughts and memories, they're condemned for it?"
"as you've been told, captain, mind melds are practiced by a subculture. vulcans who have elected to conduct themselves in an unacceptable manner."
they haven't elected to do anything. they're born with this ability.
exactly. they're genetic aberrations who prey on people like you. people foolish enough to experiment with abhorrent behaviour.
"you humans are too volatile, too irrational, too narrow-minded. that's what i heard for years, from every vulcan i met. but we don't hold a candle to you when it comes to narrow-minded. we got rid of bigotry nearly a century ago. we're not afraid of diversity. we don't persecute it, we embrace it. if you call yourselves enlightened, you have to accept people who are different than you are."
this is pointless. our culture is governed by rules. we're not about to ignore them.
there are no rules telling you to oppress minorities.
you'd rather let them spread their infections. that's exactly why you're being recalled.
"no, i'm being recalled because you're afraid of anything that doesn't conform to your idea of acceptable behaviour."
"unfortunately, you don't know what you're talking about. the decision's been made. we should end this inquiry."
she knows exactly what she's talking about.
are you questioning our judgement?
there is nothing abhorrent about the way we lead our lives.
we?
there is no simple definition of intimacy. those of us capable of mind-melds are no different than you are.
"you realise that you are jeopardising your reputation, your career?"
we share our thoughts differently. we shouldn't be punished for that.
the high command will determine whether you should be punished. both of you.
she's not guilty of anything. she was violated.
you gave me your word.
the mind-meld was performed against her will.
can you verify this?
why? so you can perpetuate your double standard? condemn the infected when they meld by choice and sympathise with them when they don't?
"what do you know of this, captain?"
seems my science officer doesn't want to discuss it. that's good enough for me.
she told me herself. she made me promise to stay silent. i'm sorry. i had to tell them the truth. you should do the same.
i have nothing to say to them.
feezal tells me it can be quite temperamental.
i think i've got it figured out. just let me know when it starts acting up. have you got the activation sequence down?
my beloved. i certainly hope it's not another four years until i see you again.
"so do i. but remember, your other wives are anxious to see you too."
commander tucker assures me he'll keep your beautiful microscope in perfect running order.
"as his doctor, i hope you'll keep commander tucker in perfect running order. perhaps that'll motivate me to visit more often."
it's a shame you two didn't get to know each other better.
"well, i've got to get back to my warp engine. the plasma's running a little hot."
i know how it feels.
pleasure meeting you.
humans.
come in.
doctor yuris has been suspended.
that was to be expected.
"they offered him a hearing, but he refused. oratt said he'll lose his standing with the medical exchange when they get back to vulcan."
also to be expected.
one good thing did come out of this. they believed him when he said you were forced. you're not going to be recalled.
"with your permission, i'll be contacting the high command. i don't intend to let yuris be dismissed without a fight."
"permission granted. i know you must be very disappointed that he broke his promise to you, but on a selfish note, i'm glad he did. i didn't want to lose you."
maybe this incident will encourage others to speak out.
let's hope so.
report.
"the imperial guard will die at their posts, but"
i know my men are willing to die. i want to hear their chances of surviving.
"we're holding our positions for now, but the enemy has deployed new units here and here."
they're looking for a weakness.
they may have found it. we've taken more casualties.
i've received a communiqu�. the vulcans want to discuss terms for a cease fire.
have you ever known a vulcan who wouldn't lie to get what he wanted?
there is another option. someone i've dealt with. a pinkskin. he's proven to be quite even-handed in dealing with vulcans. his name is archer.
you're sure he wants me?
ambassador soval said your presence is crucial to resolving the crisis.
what's this planet called again?
the vulcan name is paan mokar. the andorians call it weytahn. it's on the frontier between their systems. both sides claim it belongs to them. they've nearly gone to war over it twice in the past century.
how do they expect me to help settle a conflict they haven't been able to resolve in a hundred years?
"soval says you'll be fully briefed when you arrive. jonathan, this is the first time the vulcans have asked for our help. you're the closest thing we have to an ambassador out there. you know how important this could be."
we'll get there as fast as we can.
i don't like pushing the engines this hard. the injectors are running at a hundred and ten percent.
they're rated for one hundred and twenty.
and my underwear is flame-retardant. that doesn't mean i'm going to light myself on fire to prove it.
"i think we'll make it in one piece, trip. i've been reading about paan mokar in the vulcan database. it doesn't say a lot. class d, not much bigger than earth's moon, claimed by the vulcans in 2097."
class d? that's uninhabitable. why are you fighting over it?
"when the andorians first arrived a century ago, they began to terraform the planet. once an atmosphere was developed, they established a settlement."
"if it was unclaimed at the time, why would there be a problem?"
its sole value is its strategic location near vulcan space.
they were setting up a military base?
it was the only logical conclusion.
was there any evidence?
how much evidence would you need if the klingons decided to set up a colony on pluto?
that's not the same thing.
"the andorians refused to let the high command inspect the colony. so, they annexed paan mokar to protect their territory."
what happened to the andorian colonists?
they were removed.
by force.
they left the high command little choice. a surveillance satellite was put into orbit to monitor the agreement. the planet's been deserted for nearly a century.
until now.
"unbelievable. i damn near burn up the warp reactor getting here, and they make us wait."
"welcome aboard, ambassador."
"thank you, captain. this is sub-commander muroc."
"t'pol has been filling me in on the situation here, but i still have a lot of questions."
"if you don't mind, captain, i have a question of my own. why would an officer of the andorian imperial guard personally request your involvement?"
i don't understand. i was told you asked for me.
i'm involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations. i don't consider your presence here an asset.
"if that's how you feel, we'll gladly continue with our mission."
"six days ago, an andorian regimental commander named shran landed a force on paan mokar and occupied the settlement."
shran.
"naturally, we attempted to enforce the treaty of 2097."
naturally.
"we've regained control of half the colony, but two dozen vulcans have been wounded and three have been taken hostage."
"shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return, but only if you act as mediator. for some reason, he finds you trustworthy."
you're asking for my help?
"yes, captain, i'm asking for your help."
i'll see what i can do.
"forgive my candor, but that's hardly reassuring. the last time you dealt with the andorians, a vulcan intelligence site was compromised and a priceless monastery destroyed. sub-commander muroc will accompany you to represent our interests."
"obviously, i'm here at the request of the andorians. shran believes he can trust me. i don't intend to prove him wrong by going down there with a vulcan officer in tow. if you insist i bring a vulcan along, i'll take the one i know i can trust."
"you wanted to see me, doc?"
"yes. this planet is home to a rather pernicious mutagenic pathogen, and i'll need to bombard your immune system with analeptic radiation to protect you while you're on the surface."
bombard.
"it's quite painless, i assure you."
what about t'pol?
vulcan physiology isn't affected by the pathogen. shall we?
"this should only take a moment. if i may ask, how did your first meeting with the vulcans go?"
warm and friendly as ever.
"ironic. they weren't overly enthusiastic about you taking command of enterprise in the first place, and now your presence is crucial to their interests."
"it's crucial to ours, too. maybe we're not out here to just scan comets and meet new species. maybe we're out here to prove that humanity is ready to join a much larger community. i intend to do that, whether the vulcans like it or not."
all finished.
"captain, i served as a medic in the denobulan infantry. if i learned anything from that experience, it's that battlefields are unpredictable places, even under a flag of truce. be careful."
"we've lost the navigational sensors, and the comm."
it's the andorian jamming signal. i'm entering the landing coordinates they gave us.
let's hope they're accurate.
did you have a chance to read the territorial compromise?
i glanced at it.
the compromise is at the heart of this dispute. it's worth your attention.
it's twelve hundred pages long.
did you glance at any of the other materials i sent to your quarters? v'lar's treatise on negotiating tactics is the definitive text on the subject.
"i got all of it. v'lar's treatise, the revised intersystem agreement, the high command briefing on the border incursions of 2112. i was up till two a.m."
glancing.
are you trying to tell me something? that maybe i'm not prepared for this?
ambassador soval clearly believes you'll fail. i was hoping some advance preparation would help you prove him wrong.
"thanks, but i doubt i'm going to impress shran by quoting vulcan treaties."
i assume you have a strategy?
the first thing is to convince shran that he can trust me.
and then?
we're just going to have to play it by ear.
are you sure these are the coordinates?
yes.
"don't move, vulcan."
captain.
we're not armed.
i'm captain jonathan archer. i'm here to see commander shran.
"he's expecting you, without a vulcan escort."
i wasn't told to come alone. this is my science officer. she helped expose the vulcan listening post at p'jem. i thought shran might enjoy seeing her again.
"i imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sitting around a big table, toasting with champagne, signing things with lots of pens."
the pinkskin sense of humour. my apologies for the security precautions.
we can never be too vigilant when it comes to vulcans.
they say the same thing about you.
"i'm sure they do. we're aggressive, illogical."
prove them wrong.
"that's why you're here, captain. to help us do just that. i've dealt with the vulcans twice before, where you were involved. both times you handled the situation without prejudice."
"i hope i can help again, but the first thing i need is to see the hostages."
hostages? criminals take hostages. kidnappers looking for a ransom take hostages. i assume you're referring to the enemy soldiers we captured.
the vulcans want to know they're all right.
they haven't been harmed.
are you all right?
"when they attacked us, two of my men were badly wounded."
they're lucky we didn't kill them.
you provoked this situation when you violated the territorial compromise.
"only a vulcan could call a hundred years of oppression a compromise. you annexed a planet that belongs to us, herded our people into refugee camps."
after you set up a military outpost here.
"as you can see, captain, even after a hundred years, this situation still evokes anger on both sides. we will release our prisoners on the following conditions. immediate withdrawal of all vulcan military forces, the so-called compromise is to be rescinded, and the vulcans must concede irrevocable sovereignty of weytahn to andoria."
you don't expect them to agree to all that.
i told you. he's a puppet of the vulcans.
"for the record, the vulcan high command doesn't like me very much, and, frankly, the feeling is mutual. if all you need is someone to deliver your list of demands, find somebody else. i've got other things to do."
"the vulcans always say they're ready to talk, but it amounts to nothing. treaty negotiations that drag on for years. i want to speak to soval. somebody who can deal with the situation without having to check with his superiors."
i'll see what i can do.
here. on my terms.
that might be a little difficult.
this is pointless.
"but not impossible. the thing is, he's going to want something in return."
haven't they already taken enough?
"i'm talking about a gesture, something to show you're serious. i came down here to see about the hostages. why don't you let them go?"
and give away our only advantage?
no.
"release two of them, then. keep the other one until after you've met with soval."
"one, as a show of our good faith."
you're being awfully quiet.
is there something you'd like to discuss?
you don't seem too happy with the way i handled things down there.
"as shran said, this is a provocative issue. however, i think you did well."
thank you.
but my opinion often differs from the high command's.
unacceptable.
you got one of your men back.
"and in exchange, you'll deliver me into their hands? i'm sure the andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills."
"they want to talk to you, not kidnap you."
"if i agree to a meeting, it's simply legitimises their position."
"and if you don't, these negotiations end before they begin."
"that may happen sooner than you realise. while you were on the surface, we detected three andorian vessels approaching. they'll be here in less than five hours."
they probably intend to re-supply their troops on the surface. we won't allow that.
engaging an andorian vessel could be construed as an act of war.
that will be their decision.
both sides are responsible for what happens here.
you don't understand the complexities of this situation.
"with all due respect, ambassador, why did you agree to let me go down there if you won't listen to my advice?"
"i didn't request your help, captain, and i don't feel obliged to accept it."
you claim the andorians are inflexible. at least they're willing to sit down and talk. the ball's in your court now.
it's a human expression. it means the next move is yours.
this isn't wise. the colony hasn't been secured.
didn't you hear the captain? the ball is in our court.
"i don't like this. with all the interference, you won't be able to contact the ship if something goes wrong."
they're expecting us. we'll be fine.
those andorian ships'll be here in four hours.
i plan on being back long before then.
t'pol said that territorial compromise they were talking about took eight years to work out.
i'll try to speed things up this time.
"bring them here as soon as they land, and treat the vulcan with respect."
"yes, sir."
if i may speak.
"you don't have to. i know what you're going to say. we discovered this planet. we made it livable. it belongs to us. don't worry, it'll be ours again."
"how? by talking? we've been trying that for a hundred years, and it's gotten us nowhere. they stall and lie and make promises they never intend to keep. we came here to fight. why back down now?"
i'm willing to give archer another chance.
you put too much faith in these pinkskins. we don't know anything about them except that they're friends of the vulcans.
not always. i've seen that for myself.
"if we attack now, we can have the vulcans on the defensive before our ships arrive."
your recommendation is noted.
our troops are ready. there's no reason to wait.
"enough. i value your opinion, tarah, but that does not allow you to question my commands. dismissed."
they'll send some soldiers to meet us. i'm afraid they'll want to blindfold you. it's just a security precaution.
"thank you for the reassurance. now if you don't mind, i'll need a few moments of silence to prepare myself."
of course.
t'pol?
weapons fire. i can't pinpoint the source.
archer to enterprise.
we're still within their jamming range.
i suggest we cancel the negotiations and return to your ship.
for once we're in full agreement.
direct hit to our starboard engine. main power is offline.
"now you see who you're dealing with, captain?"
"if you don't mind, ambassador."
we're losing altitude. two hundred metres.
i'm going to bring us in on thrusters.
one hundred metres. fifty. we need to reduce our speed.
the ground is going to do that for us. brace yourselves.
any idea where we are?
"the southeast quadrant, near the old spaceport. i told you i negotiated the last accord. i also served here."
you were with the occupation force?
"as an intelligence officer, a long time ago. our current deployment has a base of operations that way, about two and a half kilometres."
"i appreciate your help, ambassador but we're looking for the andorians."
circumstances have altered our plans.
i gave my word to shran. i intend to keep it.
shran just tried to kill us.
we don't know that.
i suppose you think our troops are responsible for this?
sensors and communications are offline. there's weapons fire flying all over the place. we don't know what happened.
are you that naive? shran is using you.
this is a man who couldn't sleep because he thought he owed me something. i don't believe he asked me to come a dozen light years just so i could lead you into a trap. and right now it seems like the best thing to do is to get a cease-fire in place. the andorians won't agree to that until they talk to you in person. i managed to keep us on course most of the way in. we can't be more than a kilometre from shran's landing coordinates.
how would you know? we can't pick up anything through the interference.
our scanners are more sophisticated than yours. we detected weapons fire coming from the surface. then your shuttle appeared to make an emergency landing somewhere in the colony.
where?
"we haven't been able to pinpoint their landing site, but our units on the ground are already searching. the high command instructed me to take steps to recover ambassador soval."
and our officers?
of course.
we want to be involved in any rescue operation.
we have more experience in these matters.
i know. i once saw one of your commando units blast the hell out of a rebel compound during a rescue mission.
we won't allow this provocation to continue.
you don't even know where they are. do you really think it's a good idea to go down there guns blazing?
"our response will be appropriate. i'll keep you informed, commander."
any luck?
"i'm trying, sir, but if the vulcans can't find them."
see what you can do.
"yes, sir."
how far away are those andorian ships?
three hours at their present speed.
that shuttle was to be left alone. i gave specific orders.
and they were followed.
"then who fired those shots? the vulcans, i suppose, trying to kill their own ambassador?"
"is that so unlikely? some of my men saw weapons fire coming from their positions. it's vulcan subterfuge, i'm sure of it. what better way for them to justify an invasion than to blame us for killing their envoy?"
"they are devious, but i doubt even they would go that far."
"you act as if they have some moral code. they have no conscience, only their precious logic. they'll do anything to drive us off this planet. we should never have agreed to negotiate."
you're not happy with the way i've handled this situation?
"of course i am, sir."
"the sector two report, sir."
"put our positions on alert. i want soval and the pinkskin brought to me alive. if they're looking for an excuse to attack, we won't give it to them."
i'll see to it myself.
perhaps you were farther off course than you thought.
you've been here before. i don't suppose you'd care to help?
it's been almost a hundred years.
i thought vulcans had exceptional memories.
"this is the old residential quarter. according to our latest intelligence, the andorians control the settlement west of here."
"if we keep moving this way, we should be  down!"
"not quite the warm welcome you expected, captain?"
they're not shooting at us.
the vulcan units must be advancing their positions.
we should try to make contact with them.
i don't recommend sticking your neck out right now.
"what do you recommend? wandering through these ruins until we find an andorian soldier, and trust he's been informed not to shoot us on sight?"
i'll take a look. stay here.
captain.
"that's an order. no offence, but my ears are less likely to draw fire than yours."
what is their fixation with our ears?
i believe they're envious.
"do you realise you've picked up a slight human accent? you were one of the most promising members of my staff, t'pol. if you'd stayed in san francisco, you'd be the assistant counsel by now. you might even have a diplomatic posting of your own."
i am aware of that.
then why have you remained on enterprise?
we believed they needed our help when they first developed warp drive. that hasn't changed.
"captain archer's record is evidence of that, but there are others who can assist them."
i find the work gratifying.
gratification is an emotional indulgence. you disagreed with our recommendation that archer's mission be cancelled after the tragedy at paraaga two. why?
i was onboard enterprise at the time. i felt my opinion would be welcomed.
"you believed you knew better than the high command? that sounds a great deal like another emotion, arrogance. perhaps it's time for you to consider another assignment."
just because captain archer has earned my respect doesn't mean i have been contaminated by his emotions.
did you make contact?
no. they're pulling back. let's keep moving.
empty.
they're probably trying to reach the vulcans.
no. the pinkskin will want to keep his part of the bargain. they'll be looking for shran.
commander.
you have something?
i can't be sure. you see this em differential here?
that's the captain?
it's definitely a biosign. i'm ninety percent sure it's human.
at least we know he's alive. where is he?
i need another hour.
what's the status on those andorian ships?
they just dropped out of warp. they'll be here in thirteen minutes.
"i think the vulcans see them, too. they're breaking orbit. probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre."
put the ship on tactical alert.
get down! go.
over there.
those are andorian weapons.
hold your fire!
how is he?
it isn't life-threatening but he needs medical attention.
we've brought the vulcan ambassador to meet with commander shran!
it looks like two of them. one on top of that structure
and the other on the ground.
if i can work my way around i might be able to come up from behind them.
what do you expect me to do with this?
make sure they don't see me.
i haven't fired a weapon in fifty years.
"you don't have to hit anything, just keep them occupied. really occupied or i'm not going to get very far."
hey.
range.
fifty thousand kilometres. they're still heading right for the vulcan ships.
the vulcans are charging weapons. the andorians as well.
"travis, lay in a new course. i want you to put us right between them."
"aye, sir."
"if you don't mind me asking, what do you have in mind?"
drop your weapon. i've never fired one of these before.
i'm not sure if it's set on stun.
"t'pol, cease fire!"
it doesn't have a stun setting.
"you fired on my shuttle. you're trying to kill soval, undermine everything that shran is trying to do here. why? do you want a war with the vulcans?"
all we want is a chance to fight for what's ours before cowards like shran negotiate it away.
you can take that up with him. let's go.
we're being hailed by the vulcans and the andorians.
put 'em both on.
this is commander tucker.
captain telev of the imperial guard.
"commander, i strongly recommend you withdraw to a safe distance."
i agree. we wouldn't want your vessel to be damaged by debris from the vulcan ships.
we will not allow the andorians to land additional troops on paan mokar.
it's called weytahn and our personnel there have been attacked. we'll provide whatever support they need.
any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be fired upon.
"that includes yours, sub-commander."
"we appreciate your support, commander tucker."
don't. i'll open fire on any ship that makes an aggressive move. phase-cannons?
locked and ready.
this is not a starfleet matter.
"as long as my captain is stuck in the middle of your war zone, it is."
"the andorians have made it impossible for us to recover captain archer. by now, he's most likely a casualty."
"don't count him out so fast. we've managed to isolate his bio-signature. now, why don't you both give him and ambassador soval a chance to do their jobs before we start a war up here?"
"he was ready to kill me. you saw for yourself. apparently, these pinkskins aren't as honourable as you thought."
are you all right? i suppose i shot the ambassador to make my story more convincing.
"why would my lieutenant, a loyal member of the imperial guard, lie to me?"
"commander, it seems you're willing to resolve this situation through peaceful means. do all your officers feel the same?"
have you considered there might be andorians who would want a war with vulcan?
how long have i served with you? followed your orders when it could have meant my life?
she's not the only one who risked their life. i said i'd bring soval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here. i came because you asked me. because you thought i could be trusted. check soval's wound. check our shuttle. you'll find andorian weapons signatures.
is this true? answer me!
what did you expect me to do?
follow my orders!
"orders to do nothing while you betray us? it's not too late to redeem yourself, to make a stand."
i intend to. take her.
there are others who feel this way. you'll see.
see to the ambassador's wounds. we have a lot to discuss.
the vulcan ships are breaking formation. they're heading for the planet.
"the andorians are following, sir."
arm the forward phase-cannons. see if you can target their weapons.
we're being hailed from the surface. it's the captain.
"hold off, malcolm. put him through. captain."
"nice to hear your voice, trip."
what's going on down there? are you okay?
"t'pol and i are fine. we're at the andorian command post. ambassador soval's been injured, but shran's medics are treating him."
did you say shran's medics?
he's just being a good host. the andorians are allowing the vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people.
glad you let us know.
did you run into any problems up there?
nothing we couldn't handle. i'll fill you in later.
we had a pretty rough landing. we'll need a ride back to the ship.
i'll send travis down in shuttlepod two.
acknowledged. archer out.
"put us back into orbit, travis, and cancel the tactical alert."
the imperial council will not be satisfied until vulcan recognises our claim to weytahn.
i believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution that neither side is happy with.
"in that case, these talks have been extremely successful."
i consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success.
join me in a drink to celebrate our mutual dissatisfaction.
vulcans don't drink. but this occasion merits an exception.
to the ceasefire. it wouldn't have been possible without the help of our human friends.
and to the successful continuation of these talks on andoria.
i trust there'll be more accomplished than just talk.
"with your permission, i'll escort ambassador soval to the airlock."
of course.
"captain, your presence here has not been overly meddlesome."
"i think he likes you, pinkskin."
i wouldn't go that far.
biosigns?
"none that i can detect, but its hull seems to be scattering our sensors."
any idea what happened?
i'm not reading any weapons signatures. possibly some sort of accident.
bring it into launch bay two.
there's no windows. i'm not sure whether this end's the bow or the stern.
captain. this might be a hatch.
"if it is, it's been fused shut. with your permission, sir?"
he's human.
"this was a human male. a microcellular scan should tell us his age at the time of death. apparently, you're not the first humans out this far."
"whoever this is, he's rewritten our history books. can you get a dna sample?"
"the tissue damage is extensive, but i should be able to isolate a few fragments."
"if he's a member of starfleet, his genetic profile is probably in our database. run a comparison as soon as you can."
absolutely.
there aren't any ships or inhabited systems for several light years.
i wonder if this could be zephram cochrane. they say he was piloting a one-man vessel when he disappeared.
how could he have travelled this far?
there were a lot of rumours after he was lost. one of them said he was testing some kind of experimental warp ship. any markings on the hull or control panels?
we haven't found any.
"the hull seems to absorb em radiation. without all this damage, it never would have shown up on our sensors."
"some kind of stealth ship. so what do you think, travis? could this pilot have been a cargo hauler?"
we're more than thirty light years from the nearest trade route. i don't see how he could have made it out this far.
maybe he got a ride from someone.
that's got to be a world record for hitchhiking. i still can't find any plasma exhaust ports. not even a thruster quad.
there's nothing here that looks like a power source.
how did this thing make it into deep space without an engine?
could be an escape pod.
even an escape pod would need some kind of propulsion system.
any new mission you haven't told us about?
"i wish there was. it's possible the ship you found was launched from vega colony, but they're a long way behind you. the earth cargo authority may have more information."
phlox has sent a request to doctor cochrane's family. they're transmitting his genetic profile.
a hundred light years from earth. you might have solved the greatest missing person case of the century.
"if we haven't, we've discovered an even bigger mystery."
commander.
registers as some kind of bio-matter.
organic circuitry?
maybe we should get phlox to come down and take a look.
not a bad idea.
what's this?
malcolm?
i see it.
good. means i'm not hallucinating. how can a ship be bigger on the inside than the outside?
it could be a hologram.
hand me that hyperspanner.
you're not going down there?
got to get my spanner back.
we should call the bridge first. let them know
"say again, malcolm?"
this gives space exploration a whole new meaning.
i've read a few papers on spatial geometry. i never heard a theory that would explain this. the captain'll never believe us. he's going to have to see this for himself.
"what do you think, a warp reactor?"
you're the engineer.
"looks like a breach, overload of some kind."
i'm picking up an energy signature. it's very faint.
"sir, a vessel's dropped out of warp. they're on an intercept course."
it's suliban.
let's see it.
minimal weapons. i don't believe it's a combat ship.
we're being hailed.
you have something that belongs to us.
i don't believe i've had the pleasure
we have a salvage claim on the vessel in your launch bay. one of our cell ships discovered it three days ago. we were sent to retrieve it.
that ship's an earth vessel. the pilot's human.
i'm not interested in the corpse. decompress your launch bay and release the vessel.
i'm curious. what's your interest in that ship? there's not much left.
the vessel. now.
they're charging weapons.
you might want to contact your superiors. ask for a man named silik. he'll tell you i don't respond well to threats.
this could be a release pin.  let's get it to engineering.
forward plating is holding.
"bring us about, travis. power the phase-cannons. see what you can do about their weapons."
tucker to the bridge. the comm.'s down.
commander!
someone's trying to open launch bay two.
lock them out.
i can't.
archer to trip.  send a security team down there. return fire.
their weapons have been disabled.
"target their engines, and bring the grappler on line."
sir?
they wanted that ship pretty badly. i'd like to know why.
they're moving off.
stay with them.
"i've lost them, sir."
"it was heavily shielded. whatever this thing is, it must be pretty important."
what's your guess?
might be the black box.
"it could it tell us what happened, maybe even who built the vessel."
"that's assuming we can get it working. it seems to use the same organic circuitry as the rest of the ship. captain, i got to take you down into that chamber. you're not going to believe your eyes."
bigger on the inside?
sickbay to captain archer.
archer.
i need to see you immediately.
"i managed to find only a few undamaged cells, but they were enough to complete a genetic analysis."
is there a match in the starfleet database?
"no, but i did discover that our guest is no ordinary human. i found an unusual deviation in this nucleotide sequence. at first i thought i was looking at some kind of mutation, but there was something familiar about the chromosome structure, so i widened my search to include the interspecies database. this nucleotide sequence is vulcan."
how did a human end up with vulcan dna?
the likeliest explanation is that he had at least one vulcan ancestor further back than a great-grandparent.
that's not possible. we haven't known the vulcans long enough.
i also found genetic material belonging to several other species. this sequence is terrelian. there's another i can't identify. i believe this individual is the result of several generations of interspecies breeding.
"thank you, doctor. t'pol."
a database from the future?
our time-travelling friend daniels left it in his quarters.
i'm not certain daniels would approve of this.
we'll keep it to ourselves.
a vulcan cruiser. i don't recognise the configuration.
that's because it hasn't been built yet.
few vulcans have ever chosen to mate with another species.
worried about contaminating your genome with a little human dna?
there are significant biological differences between the species. it's unlikely we could reproduce. humans and vulcans.
that could be it.
the dorsal section is the wrong shape.
"if a human and a vulcan did have a child, i wonder if he'd have pointed ears. there. i think that's it. look at the commission date. that's almost nine hundred years from now. daniels talked about historians from the future. people who traveled back to study the past. that could be what this pilot was doing."
this says it's powered by a temporal displacement drive.
"if the suliban get their hands on this, they'll take it apart,  maybe learn how the engines work. that could change the course of the temporal cold war."
"assuming the vessel is from the future, why haven't they retrieved it?"
archer.
"sir, there's an alien vessel's approaching at high warp."
suliban?
"no, sir. we can't identify them."
twenty thousand kilometres and closing.
t'pol?
"the vessel's tholian. they're extremely xenophobic. the high command has had limited contact with them. captain, it's unusual for tholians to travel this far from their system."
"i'm getting unusual thermal readings. it's awfully warm inside that ship, more than two hundred degrees."
they're believe to be a non-humanoid species.
open a channel. this is captain archer of the starship
"jonathan archer, please establish communication."
is there something we can do for you?
we were sent to retrieve the vessel.
i'd like to know how you heard about that ship.
it is dangerous to you. temporal radiation.
"thanks for the warning, but we can't give it to you."
they've locked on to us with a tractor beam.
we're losing speed.
hull plating. arm the aft torpedoes.
that beam's interfering with our targeting scanners.
"release us, or i'll destroy the ship in our launch bay.  do you hear me?"
what did he say?
"i don't know, but i don't think he was paying you a compliment."
i wonder if there's anyone else who thinks they have a claim on that ship.
may i join you?
please.
i found another nucleotide sequence in the pilot's genome. it appears to be rigelian. that corpse is full of surprises.  i didn't realise how late it was until my stomach reminded me it was time to eat. you seem to be engrossed in your work as well.
the captain asked me to perform a metallurgical analysis of the vessel's hull.
anything noteworthy?
i've discovered several unusual alloys. one of them is in a semi-fluidic state.
more mysteries.
to say the least.
i understand captain archer believes that the vessel travelled here from the future.
that's his theory.
"genetic anomalies, unexplainable alloys, the evidence seems to be mounting."
perhaps.
"the vulcan science directorate. they've always been rather reluctant to embrace unorthodox ideas. after they review our findings, i have a feeling they might reconsider their opinion of time travel."
it's not an opinion. it's simple logic.
"there was a time when denobulans believed they were the only intelligent species in the galaxy. needless to say, it was quite a surprise when the b'saari made first contact. many refused to accept the truth even with the evidence standing right in front of them. it took some time, and it wasn't easy, but eventually we were forced to reevaluate our beliefs."
are you saying you believe time travel is possible?
"surprises, sub-commander. i believe in embracing surprises."
"i prefer to embrace logic. if you'll excuse me, doctor."
good night.
"all right, let's start reinitialising the power grid."
"assuming that is the power grid. it boggles the mind, if you think about it."
what does?
"that ship could be from the thirty first century. when i was young, i always wanted to build a time machine, see the future."
you're probably the kind of person that jumps to the end of a book before you read it.
don't tell me you've never wondered what it would be like. how our mission will turn out.
wondering about the future and knowing it are two different things.
"if daniels came here and offered you a chance to go to the thirty first century, you wouldn't take it?"
some things are better left a mystery.
and you call yourself an explorer.
where's the fun in exploring if you know how it all turns out? hand me that micro-caliper. suppose you could look into some future book and find out the name of the woman you're going to marry. would you want to know it?
absolutely. think of all the awkward first dates i could avoid.
"fine. so one day you meet jane doe. you go out a few times, and you pop the question. she says i do, and the two you live happily ever after."
sounds perfect.
"now, did you marry her for love, or because some book told you to?"
"if we're happily ever after, what difference does it make?"
"well, we've got power. now we've got to figure out how to tap into these organic circuits."
they're similar to the ones in the cockpit.
"we might be able to salvage some of them, build an interface."
"now if i had a chance to see the past, i'd jump at it. i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus."
he'd probably make a quick meal of you.
the stegosaurus was an herbivore.
"if i could travel back in time, i know exactly what year i'd pick. 1588."
what happened in 1588?
england defeated the spanish armada.
i'm sure some named reed had a lot to do with that.
"now if i had a chance to see the past, i'd jump at it. i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus."
he'd probably make a quick meal of you.
the stegosaurus was an herbivore.
"it seems like we were just in here. if i could travel back, i know exactly what year i'd pick."
1588.
how'd i know you were going to say that?
i think we're spending far too much time together.
"now, if i had a chance to see the past, i'd jump at it."
i always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.
he'd probably make a quick meal of you.
the stegosaurus was a herbivore.
"it was the weirdest thing. when we were standing next to the ship, it felt like we were having the same conversation over and over again."
i can't find anything wrong with either of you.
we didn't imagine what happened.
"captain, the craft is emitting some type of high-energy particles."
this may be the temporal radiation the tholians warned us about.
we've spent a fair amount of time around that ship.
the particle density's quite low. it's unlikely to have any lasting effects.
how do you explain what happened?
the radiation could have affected your perception of time.
or maybe they really were reliving the same moment. seal off launch bay two and evacuate the surrounding sections. i don't want to take any chances.  how are you coming with the black box?
"the power's online, but we still can't access the data."
let me know as soon as you find anything. dismissed.
can i speak with you?
"the radiation could spread to other sections, affect more systems."
we'll keep an eye on it. the vulcans are only a few hours away.
i'm not certain we'll survive that long. we've attracted the attention of two hostile species. it's logical to assume they're searching for us.
i'm pretty sure we can steer clear of them.
perhaps you should destroy the vessel.
"i'm not going to do that. i'm tired of these factions interfering with our century. it's time we took a more active interest in this war, gathered some intelligence ourselves."
"assuming for the moment the temporal cold war exists, i believe we shouldn't get involved."
"like it or not, we've been involved since we left spacedock. daniel's hinted that there were other factions in this conflict. maybe the tholians are working for one of them."
your curiosity is placing enterprise in unnecessary danger.
this is the first chance we've had to get some answers. i'm not going to pass it up. the vulcans can get that ship back to earth in a few weeks. starfleet'll take it from there.
captain.
i told you. i've made my decision.
"if the suliban return, they may be cloaked. i recommend we go to tactical alert."
what do you have?
"it's what we don't have. this isn't a black box. we thought it was a data storage matrix, but after we got the power running it started generating a subspace signature. i think it's a micro-transmitter, some kind of emergency beacon."
bridge to captain archer. several suliban vessels are approaching.
on my way.
acknowledged.
the ships will be within weapons range in twenty seconds.
go to maximum warp.
they're matching our speed.
how long to the rendezvous point?
less than three minutes.
contact the tal'kir. let them know we're bringing company.
no response. we're being hailed by the suliban.
i see you brought some friends with you.
drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded.
or what? you're not going to risk any more damage to that ship.
they're charging weapons.
"take a look at your long-range sensors. there's a vulcan combat cruiser a few million kilometres from here. unless you want to upset them, i suggest you turn around."
the vulcans won't risk their ship for an earth vessel.
"aft cannon, return fire."
we're losing ventral plating.
the vulcans?
six hundred thousand kilometres.
direct hit to the launch bay doors. they're trying to blast them open.
hold your course and speed.
two hundred thousand kilometres.
take us out of warp.
biosigns?
the crew's alive. the vessel is disabled.
their comm. system's down.
captain.
take us back to warp.
engines are down.
weapons?
"they're offline, too. the hull plating's depolarising."
the cell ships have dropped out of warp.
i never thought i'd be glad to see the suliban.
"trip, we could use warp engines"
right about now.
the antimatter injectors are fused. i'll need a few hours to replace them.
how about weapons?
every power relay on the ship's been scrambled.
then forget everything else. get that beacon working.
sir?
whoever built that ship might be able to send help.
"aye, captain."
"even if you're correct, it's unlikely help will arrive in time."
"how long would it take to remove one of the torpedo warheads, arm it manually?"
four minutes. less if i had some help. i recommend moving the warhead as little as possible once we remove it.
"then we'll bring the torpedo to the launch bay, work on it there.  you have the bridge."
i'm going to hold you to that four minutes.
"it was only an estimate, sir."
"they don't make this easy, do they?"
i'm going to release the couplings. you'll need to disconnect the power conduits. the blue and red ones first. turn the release counterclockwise until you feel it detach.
commander.
i need that power module.
"yes, sir."
"all right, hand me a micro-caliper."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
the suliban have lost more than half of their ships.
you don't have much time.
we're working as fast as we can.
stand by.
"sir, if you'll hold it by the locking brace."
i'm going to hold you to that four minutes.
"it was only an estimate, sir. it's happening again. we've had this conversation before."
you're right. how far do you think we got last time?
i'm not certain.
i think we may have removed the warhead.
"if time's not repeating outside the launch bay, the tholians could be close."
"we'd better hurry. the red and blue conduits, right?"
the cell-ships. they've been destroyed.
how many?
all of them. the tholians are on an intercept course.
they're hailing us.
give us the vessel.
"we're prepared to surrender it to you, but our launch bay doors took heavy damage. we're going to need more time. i have a repair team working on it, but they estimate it will take"
two of their ships are approaching the saucer section. eighty metres. forty.
they've locked on to both docking ports.
seal the hatches and send security teams.
get to the control room. i'll take it from here.
"aye, captain."
i'm going to hold you to that four minutes.
"it was only an estimate, sir."
how many times do you think we've done this?
"at least twice, maybe more."
let's hope we've got it down by now.
they're cutting through the doors.
control room.
let's get those doors open.
now.
i'd recommend putting more distance between us and that ship.
now!
t'pol to captain archer.
they've neutralised the warhead.
on our way.
"sir, it's gone."
gone?
"it dematerialised, and it's not aboard the tholian ships."
they're disengaging.
why didn't they fire on us?
good question.
they may have only wanted the vessel.
the vulcans?
"their warp drive is damaged, but life support is stable."
let's see if we can give them a hand.  prep a shuttlepod. have doctor phlox meet us in launch bay one.
"aye, sir."
i wish we'd had more time to explore that ship. who knows how many other rooms were down there? looks like they sent the whole kit and caboodle back to the thirty first century.
there's no evidence to support that.
"well, there's no evidence to contradict it, either. what i don't understand is how quickly everything disappeared. that beacon was online for less than a minute."
you're forgetting that time is irrelevant to these people.
irrelevant?
"if that vessel was from the future, whoever sent it had plenty of time to locate the signal and then travel back to any point in time to retrieve it."
"unfortunately, time isn't irrelevant in my engine room. i've got repairs to finish. see you later. sub-commander."
"i'm going to contact the high command, apologise for the trouble we caused them."
"as the captain of the tal'kir pointed out, a ship can be replaced."
i also need to thank them for helping us out.
"i'm sure the gesture would be appreciated. the high command has asked me to prepare a report on this incident, with your permission."
by all means. i wonder if they'll believe that humans and vulcans will be swapping chromosomes one day?
they're more likely to believe in time travel.
enterprise to shuttlepod one. enterprise to shuttlepod one. captain archer
"please respond. enterprise to shuttlepod one. captain archer, please respond."
lieutenant?
"they took some weapons fire. main power's offline. gravity plating, life support."
biosigns?
none.
"captain's starlog, supplemental. trip and i have left keto-enol, where we had        a successful first contact with the enolians. we also found time to squeeze in a little r + r."
there's only one more log entry after that. something about a pan zan match.
pan zan?
it's a sporting event. the captain said it was the closest thing to water polo he's seen        since we left earth.
sensor logs?
too badly damaged to be much help.
"if i may, i've been running a forensic analysis. there are traces of human blood on the        deck and bulkheads, both the captain's and commander tucker's. lieutenant reed believes they were abducted."
"if they were, they didn't go without a fight."
set a course for keto-enol.
i'll be right back.
captain.
"you in charge here? if you're not, i need to speak to your superior officer."
captain?
i'm okay.
i'd stay quiet if i were you.        the guards don't like questions.
do you know where they're taking us? i heard something about canamar. i assume that's where we're going.
it's a penal colony.
is this how your justice system works? ship people off to prison without a trial?
"there's a processing station in orbit. you'll be tried, sentenced, and sent down to the surface."
what if you're not guilty?
we're all guilty as far as they're concerned. why did they take you?
they think we're smugglers.
i wouldn't want to be accused of smuggling. they'll probably make an example of you.
we're on an exploratory mission. we believe our captain and chief engineer were abducted        after visiting your planet.
abducted by whom?
we don't know.
"we're the busiest trading outpost in this system. we get thousands of visitors        every day. unfortunately, that attracts just as many thieves and smugglers. as you might imagine,        my officers are kept quite busy. i wish i could help you."
let us send you their descriptions. perhaps you could find out if any of your officers        have seen them.
anything else on the menu?
"if you don't like it, give it to me."
i like it just fine.
give it to me.
eat your own.
you don't listen too well.
then why don't you save yourself the trouble and stop talking to me?
thanks.
you should be careful with the nausicaans. nasty tempers.
thanks for the advice.
"what were you smuggling? latinum, enolian spice wine?"
we're not smugglers. i'm the chief engineer of a starship. he's my captain.
captain of a starship? interesting. i should have tried that when they took me.        it might have helped. captain zoumas.
a patrol ship intercepted their shuttle as it was leaving orbit.
where are they?
"on board one of our transports. they were carrying what appeared to be contraband,        so they were taken into custody."
are your patrols in the habit of arresting innocent people?
smuggling is rampant in this system. my men have orders to board unfamiliar vessels.        mistakes can be made.
you certainly made one this time.
i've contacted the transport. they're expecting you. these are the co-ordinates.
i trust you'll accompany us to ensure there are no further mistakes.
what if enterprise doesn't find the shuttlepod?
"hopefully, there'll be a judge or someone on that processing station we can talk to."
and if not?
you might want to make friends with that nausicaan.
are you archer? you're being released. a ship's coming to retrieve you.
released? why?
we're not criminals.
how much did they pay you to let them go?
quiet.
"i'm innocent, too. i'll pay you."
"i said, quiet."
we're all innocent! how much?!
that's enough! keep still! all of you.
"keep still, all of you, if you want to get out of here."
i told you we needed the pilot.
he's alive.
does he look like he's in any condition to fly this ship?
he tried to get a weapon.
just watch them!
what about the rest of us?
you'll be released soon enough.
when? where are we going?
be patient. you'll find out.
"i'm sure we're all grateful for your courageous effort, but we've been in these restraints for three days.        couldn't you"
quiet! i'll see if i can access navigation.
you ever fly a warp ship before? it's harder than you think.
he's right.
"you hit the wrong control, you could overload the plasma manifolds or shut down the        antimatter containment field. we'd all end up a cloud of ionised gas."
you're a pilot?
"a damn good one. i'm a smuggler, remember?"
come with me.
my partner's an engineer. i could use his help.
just you.
i thought you were a pilot.
every ship's different. give me some time.
"these look like landing thrusters,        attitude control, warp stabilizers."
navigation?
navigation.
there's a binary system four light years from here.
this one?
set a course.
which planet?
i'll tell you that when we get there.
we're not going to get very far in a stolen
just get me to that system.
"you know what happens if he dies. if you get him medical attention, it'll work in your favour.        i'll tell the magistrate you showed compassion."
the guard said you were going to be released. why?
because we're innocent. i have friends who wanted to keep doing business with me.        they made a few discreet payments and now i'm innocent. i would have been off this ship by now        if you hadn't staged your little revolt. i hope you've thought this through.
every detail.
"i'm curious. how'd you get out of those restraints? you couldn't have        a lock pick, the guards would have found it."
would they? subdermal implants. they depolarise triburnium alloys.
how did you know you were going to need them?
"i served seven years on canamar before i escaped. i don't intend to go back.        so, i left prepared."
"i don't know what you have in mind, but i'm involved now.        i don't want to go to canamar any more than you do. if we run into trouble, my partner could help."
what is that?
subspace transceiver.
i hope you're not trying to send a message.
"i'm taking it offline. it leaves a subspace signature. even when it's not transmitting,        someone could track us."
now it's offline.
i'm picking up an automated distress signal.
that's one of our frequencies.
your transport vessel?
we have hundreds of ships. i don't know the signatures for every one.
"the signal originated near our rendezvous coordinates, but they've stopped transmitting."
try hailing them.
no response.
increase our speed to warp four point two.
we're still several hours away but we have patrol ships in that area.
contact them.
have you ever tried tojal?
what?
"there's nothing like it, but you have to eat it before it cools, otherwise it'll congeal."
sounds terrific.
it's the first thing i'm going to have when we're off this ship. where do you think they're taking us?
ask him.
i'll just wait and see. the enolians won't stop looking for us. we'll be fugitives.        i was thinking of having my face reconfigured. there's a surgeon on burala prime who can do it.        he could help you as well.
i'll take my chances with my own face.
have you ever been to burala prime?
can't say i have.
"if you ever go, avoid the polar islands. the people are friendly, but the cold        is unbearable. nothing but ice and glaciers. i was stranded there for three months        when some colleagues of mine decided to leave without me."
imagine that.
"the day i got lost, that was the worst. fourteen hours. it took me fourteen hours to find my way        back to the outpost. i lost three toes to frostbite. i've walked with a slight limp ever since,        not that you'd notice. i'm going to get that surgeon to do some work on my foot as well.        maybe he can replace the missing toes."
excuse me. can i change seats?
i'm surprised we haven't crossed paths before.
we're new to this region. we used to work mostly in the sol system.
sol?
that's our sun. our homeworld is called earth.
what is it?
two vessels approaching from aft.
let me see them.
enolian patrol ships.
they've found us.
"more quickly than i expected. when you were taking the transceiver offline,        you didn't activate it accidentally?"
you think i sent a distress call? i told you we should have gotten rid of this ship.        it's too easy to track. they're charging weapons.
do the same.
those are heavily armed patrol ships. we're only a transport.
we have weapons. use them.
we're outgunned. i'd rather take my chances on canamar.
and i'd rather not. now charge the weapons.
they're targeting our engines.
return fire!
no.
i'm warning you.
"we don't have the firepower. if we attack those ships, they'll destroy us.        i think i can get us out of this, but i'll need tucker's help."
what's happening?
"if those are patrol ships, you're going to be recaptured."
shouldn't we be getting to the escape pods?
the next person who speaks goes out the airlock. he needs to concentrate.
"trip, what's your status?"
almost there.
let us go! i don't want to die tied up like an animal!
ready when you are.
"cease fire, cease fire. we surrender."
"pressurize your docking port and prepare to be boarded,        or our next shot will breach your hull."
acknowledged.
now.
the plasma vents are open.
they've taken damage. propulsion is down on both ships.
lock weapons.
we should get out of here while we can.
target their warp reactors.
there's no need.
as soon as they repair the damage they'll come after us again.
do you think the enolians are just going to give up if we destroy two of their ships?        all i'm wanted for is smuggling. i don't need to add murder charges to it.        let me get us out of here.
all right.
is this really necessary? i just saved your skin and you still don't trust me.        do you know how much power flows through those plasma conduits?
how much?
a lot. i could have been electrocuted. the least you could do is say thanks.
thanks.
that was nice. it reminds me of the time i was on
shut up!
both our ships were disabled before the transport escaped.        my superiors don't want our patrols taking any more chances. they've issued orders to destroy the prison transport.
are your superiors aware that there are two innocent humans aboard?
"they're more concerned with the man who planned this escape. they were able to match his voice-print        to a prisoner named kuroda lor-ehn. he was responsible for many crimes, some of them brutal.        they're determined to stop him."
and we're determined to get our people back.
then i suggest you find them before our patrols do.
"that was a clever trick, igniting the plasma."
"i used it once before, outrunning a customs vessel near coridan."
"you obviously ran out of clever tricks, otherwise you wouldn't be here. what happened?"
"every ship leaving keto-enol was being boarded and searched.        to get through the checkpoint, i said i was a starship captain and tucker was my engineer.        i made quite a point about how i was on a peaceful mission of exploration."
they didn't believe you?
"what do you think? they turned our shuttle inside out, found my cargo, and we wound up here."
"my good fortune. you should consider coming with us. your partner, too."
doing what?
i have some business i wasn't able to finish before i was arrested. it could be profitable.
i'm a smuggler. i'm not good at much else.
"trust me, you'll be very interested when you find out what i have in mind."
"it's not as if i have a lot of options right now. before we're going to work together,        i'd like to know where we're headed."
the fourth planet. there's a trading outpost called tamaal.
and then?
a ship's going to meet us there. this transport draws too much attention.
"once you get past the texture, they really don't taste that bad.        the fun part is keeping them in your mouth. they jump around until you crunch down on them."
enough.
is something wrong?
"no. i love hearing how delicious melvaran mud fleas are or about the time you spent        two hours with an orion slave girl or the miracles doctors can perform these days, getting rid of fluvian fungus!"
"well, what makes you think i want to hear your stories?"
i haven't told you any. you won't let me get a word in edgewise.
i didn't realise i was being so annoying. we seemed to be getting along so well. i just thought it might be nice to have a pleasant conversation before i spend the next ten years in a penal colony.
"look, i'm sorry i snapped at you, but this isn't exactly the best place to socialise."
this thruster assembly took a lot of damage. we should have tucker take a look at it.
don't bother.
you're not the one who has to fly this thing.
it won't be flying much longer.  i'm not hungry.
you haven't eaten for two days.
i can wait.
don't be a fool.
i said i'm not hungry.
prison rations!
it's better than nothing.
you've obviously never spent time on a penal colony. i was fourteen when i first tasted those rations.        i've had enough for one lifetime.
sounds like you started your career early.
"i was young, but i was no criminal."
no?
"my father and i were working at a transport yard on keto-enol. a supervisor        accused me of stealing a brace of latinum. i had nothing to do with it,        but they couldn't find anyone else to blame. i was sentenced to five years at duronom."
that sounds pretty severe.
"enolian guards are known for their severity. haven't you seen that by now?        i learned far more in prison than my father could have ever taught me.        after i was released, i chose to put my new skills to use. i suppose i should be grateful.        if it wasn't for the enolian guard, my life would have been quite dull."
welcome to tamaal. where are your friends?
they'll be here.
do you have landing coordinates?
we're not landing. they're going to dock with us.
what about the others? are you going to let them go to prison?
"no. before we leave, you're going to set this ship on a decaying orbit."
it'll be incinerated.
"as far as anyone will be able to tell, we crashed trying to land."
why kill all these people? just leave them.
"no one will be looking for us if they think we're dead.        if you don't like it, you can always go back to your seat.        i may not know how to fly this ship, but i'm sure i can figure out how to crash it."
the transport's dropped out of warp. it's entered a binary system.        looks like they're heading for the fourth planet.
tamaal. it's a large trading outpost with over two million inhabitants.
a good place to get lost in the crowd.
drop to impulse. take us into the system. any human biosigns?
two. it's them. i recommend we use the transporter once we're in range.
you're forgetting that's a prison ship. it's heavily shielded.
where you going?
the docking hatch was damaged by the patrol ships. kuroda wants tucker to see if he can repair it.
nice of you to visit.
who are we docking with?
your guess is as good as mine.
he's taking us off on a shuttle. then he plans to crash the ship.
i hope you've got something else in mind.
we can't wait for enterprise. we've got to try to take control. think you can handle him?
"yeah, piece of cake."
there's a small vessel dropping out of warp.
patrol ship?
i don't think so. four biosigns. they're all enolian.
it's not one of our ships.
magnify. where's it heading?
the fourth planet.
they're trying to hail the prison transport. they're not getting a response.
they may have come to rescue kuroda. how heavily armed is it?
fore and aft particle cannons. nothing we can't handle.
my friends will be here soon. lay in a descent course.
their ship might be big enough to hold everyone here. why don't we take them along?
we have already discussed this!
trip.
how's that docking port coming?
i need a minute. it's a big job.
do your best.
"listen, i know we kind of got off on the wrong foot. no hard feelings. but now that we're friends,        i could use a hand."
you're the engineer.
"true. but i'm having trouble getting the intake valve open. i guess i don't have the muscle for it.        unless i'm mistaken, kuroda wants this hatch repaired."
"that one. if you could turn it counter-clockwise. yeah, a little more.        it's got to go at least ninety degrees. that's it. you almost got it."
what are you doing?
they said they were going to let us go!
they lied. they're planning to kill you. all of you.
how do you know that?
you're going to get us sent to canamar.
keep it down.
stay here.
watch out!
do you know how to repair that docking hatch? it's not easy. we're in a decaying orbit.        shoot me and you'll die with the others.
get to work.
you don't have to kill these people.
move!
you should thank me.
what? where's archer?
"he's with them, repairing the docking hatch. they said there's a shuttle coming for us.        i'm sorry i had to intervene, but you didn't give me much choice. you're lucky they didn't kill you.        kuroda was furious, but everything's fine now. they're going to set us free. you're welcome."
they've docked.
i see my message got through.
"loud and clear, sir."
"captain, would you mind?"
who are these people?
this will open the restraints.
get everyone        on that shuttle.
anything i can do?
not unless you have a spare thruster assembly. is everyone off?
just about.
i'll be right there.
"captain, travis says he can't maintain the docking seal much longer."
he won't have to. let's go.
we need to break orbit.
it's too late. we've lost thrusters.
you're lying!
we've got to get out!
kuroda. it's over.
i won't go back!
"it's now or never, sir!"
we've got some men in there who could use your help.
and you?
i'll be fine.
"on behalf of the enolian government, i'd like to extend our apologies for this inconvenience.        my superiors will want"
trip.
"er, captain? captain, my superiors will want a report on"
"i'll give you one right now. kuroda's dead, the other eleven prisoners are under guard.        as you're aware, my engineer and i were falsely arrested. we almost wound up in canamar.        makes me wonder how many others don't belong there. you wanted a report? you've got one."
sensors can't identify its hull composition. there doesn't even seem to be a warp signature.
it's approaching at warp six.
how big is it?
"it's big, more than five hundred metres across."
we're in visual range.
put it up.
look familiar?
it's not in the vulcan database.
try hailing them.
"no response, sir. i'm not even detecting a transceiver on board."
"they're gaining on us, sir."
what the hell is that?
tactical alert.
"weapons aren't charging, sir. they're offline. phase cannons, torpedoes."
tucker to the bridge!
go ahead.
"what's going on, captain? the engines just went down."
warp or impulse?
both.
"hold on, trip. have they dropped out of warp?"
there's no way to tell. our sensors can't penetrate their hull.
what about our life support?
fully operational.
that's one piece of good news. any biosigns out there?
none that i can detect.
rotate the dorsal camera.
hold it there. tilt up about thirty degrees. get closer.
the vapour doesn't contain any elements our sensors can identify.
any atmosphere?
"mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon."
"prep a shuttlepod. trip, meet me and malcolm in launch bay one."
"aye, sir."
you're in charge. keep a channel open.
"captain, look at this."
"the atmosphere's changing. seventy six percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen."
somebody seems to know what we like to breathe.
what's the temperature?
eighteen degrees.
florida in november.
let's see what we can find.
look at that.
i'm not reading anything. it's like they're not there.
they sure look there to me.
"if there aren't any life-forms here, then who modified the atmosphere?"
i doubt it's a coincidence.
captain.
"we may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things sure look alive to me."
are you okay? trip?
what the hell happened?
that's what i was about to ask you.
"i think i was up on the ceiling with those things. i was looking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. i can't explain it."
we should get him back to the ship.
"i was in tarpon springs, too, swimming with lisa. she was afraid it was getting too dark."
"it sounds like you were dreaming, commander."
i know the difference between a dream and something really happening.
"we're a hundred and fifty light years from earth, trip."
"i'm telling you, i was there."
i'm not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or wisps of smoke. he seems in perfect working order.
he said he had some kind of out-of-body experience.
"i don't forget florida, captain. i don't care how far away it is. i was there."
"it's a very common hallucination, returning to a familiar place."
what happened to the comm.? you three talking about me?
"you're clear, commander. free to go."
"thanks, doc."
you sure you're all right?
i'm fine. i can't believe how amazing it was.
"i'd prefer to keep you in sickbay for a few days, but i can't afford to. i need you to get those engines back online."
i'll see what i can do.
let me know if you take another trip to tarpon beach.
tarpon springs. i'll keep you posted.
"i want those weapons back online, too."
i'll see what i can do.
come in.
it's like we're in the belly of the beast.
we have no reason to believe their motives are hostile.
they're holding my ship hostage.
we don't know that.
"we don't? look out there. do you see any stars? our engines are offline, our weapons. seems kind of hostile to me."
i suppose it depends on how you look at it.
is there something you wanted to see me about?
ensign sato is trying to communicate with the life forms.
and?
"nothing yet. i've spoken to a number of officers. they say the crew is concerned, but remaining calm."
i've got to get them out of here.
"i tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the power grid isn't charging. commander? are you all right, sir? can i get you something?"
"i'm fine. goodbye, sir."
rostov to captain archer.
go ahead.
"i'm sorry to bother you, sir, but i think there might be something wrong with commander tucker."
"what do you mean, wrong?"
"he was confused, and seemed to think i was his superior officer."
i'll be right down.
"he's not here, sir. he left engineering."
did he say where he was going?
"no, sir."
"i'm afraid not, captain."
archer to commander tucker.  find him.
commander.
commander charles tucker iii.
hungry?
yes. it's all very good. have you ever tried this?
it's called bread. you've never eaten it before?
i've never eaten anything before.
where's commander tucker?
i'm here. charles tucker iii.
where's the man who used to be charles tucker?
he's exploring another realm. my realm. but he'll be back.
i want him back now.
please trust me. he's experiencing things he never thought he could.
where is he?
"it's not a question of where. he's no longer corporeal. but he will be again, i assure you."
"when we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. did you have anything to do with that?"
"wisp. interesting word. wisp. wisp. yes, i suppose you could call us that. wisp."
where do you come from?
"we live in subspace. we travel through it. we're explorers, like you."
why did you take commander tucker?
"it's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings. after we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realised we were compatible. you're very interesting. trapped in bodies that need maintenance. you have gender. you require mates to reproduce. you eat food. we were like you once, but we evolved. now we can learn how our ancestors lived."
"i want my crewman, and i want my ship released."
captain.
"your crewman will be returned. you claim to be an explorer, captain. open your mind to new possibilities."
what about tucker?
i've enjoyed my time with you.
sir.
wow.
wow what?
"i was riding right alongside hopalong cassidy chasing some bad guys. then i was with lisa again, except this time we were snow sailing in new zealand. then i was eight years old, maybe nine, picking up leaves with my dad. but it wasn't a dream, captain. it was as real as i'm sitting here. they told me you can try it. anyone on the crew."
who told you?
they did. the ones i was with.
i thought you were with hopalong cassidy and your girlfriend.
"i was, but it's hard to explain. you should try it. you'll understand what i'm talking about. you all should try it."
take him to sickbay.
"captain, i'm fine."
we'll let the doctor decide how fine you are.
commander.
something smells funny.
they've released the ship and commander tucker. they've done everything you've asked. have you considered they may have been telling the truth when they said they were just curious about us?
"captain's starlog, supplemental. now that the doctor's given trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is to get enterprise out of here. but trip tells me it'll be awhile before he can get the engines online. from what we can tell, these life forms have no mass. non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for starfleet. t'pol thinks they just want to get to know us. maybe she's right. maybe i don't trust them because they're so different. i'd hate to think that was the case.  computer, pause. come in."
i hope i'm not disturbing you.
everything all right?
i'm not certain. one of those beings appeared in sickbay a few minutes ago. it entered me right here.
but my physiology must not have been compatible. it left almost immediately.
are you sure you're all right?
i'm fine. but it was disturbing. the lifeform was trying very hard to reach me.
i'm going to b deck.
b deck is fine. are you a female?
sir?
"your gender. you are a female, correct?"
last time i checked.
i am a male.
"i'm aware of that, lieutenant."
there seem to be a number of anatomical differences.
sir.
come in.
sub-commander.
is there something i can do for you?
you are very beautiful. are you aware that you are the most attractive woman on board this ship?
do you think it's appropriate for you to be here at this hour?
would you mind taking off your clothing? i'd like to learn more about your anatomy.
have you been drinking?
"if we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if you disrobed."
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
would you please come to my quarters with a security team.
we're on our way.
are you afraid of me? you shouldn't be.
i'm capable of defending myself.
what is it like being a female? is it much different?
i wouldn't know.
"if you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out."
i don't understand.
"if you came to us, you could experience what it's like to be male. wouldn't that be helpful to you?"
i've never thought about it.
you should. we're capable of letting you experience anything you wish for. it would be a shame not to take advantage of that.
this isn't lieutenant reed.
enough! humans don't like doing things without their consent. when are you planning to return malcolm reed?
that depends.
"oh, does it? let's see how much you enjoy experiencing the human condition locked in reed's quarters."
tucker.
they've got malcolm. i need the ship
ready to go on my command.
"they're going to give him back, aren't they?"
we'll see.
"what did you do with the, er?"
"a security detail locked him in malcolm's quarters. get it down, trip."
"right away, sir. you heard him.  let's try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the injectors. tucker to ensign cook."
"yes, sir."
i need you and two other engineers down here right away.
i'll see who i can find.
commander!
quickly please. tucker out. something wrong?
run into a problem?
"problem? no, everything's fine."
did you have any luck priming the pumps?
i have no idea how to do that. this engine is very complex.
stay here. i'll be right back. tucker to the captain.
"go ahead, trip."
"it's rostov, sir. i think you need to get malcolm."
"i mean, whoever's running security, down here right away."
"hoshi, get a security team to engineering. have them put crewman rostov in his quarters."
"aye, sir. captain, we've been getting reports from all over the ship. some of the crew are acting very strange."
then we're going to need more than one security team. find out who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters.
how do we know the security officers are okay?
"for the moment, we're going to have to hope they are.  start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's not. maybe phlox can help you."
commander.
run into a problem?
"no, sir. just ready to calibrate the dilithium matrix."
great. wait till i give you the signal.
we polarised the hull plating as soon as we detected that ship. obviously it didn't do any good. what's keeping them from taking all of us?
archer.
"you've got impulse engines back, captain."
"thanks, trip."
hold our position.
i thought you said we needed to get out of here.
"they've got malcolm, and god knows how many others. until we find a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere."
what's the big secret?
we thought it best not to discuss this over the comm. we don't know who's been taken.
what have you got?
it was simpler than i thought. elevated acetylcholine levels in the autonomic nervous
"doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work."
the sub-commander programmed the medical computer. it's modifying this hand-scanner as we speak.
get to work as soon as you're ready.
tucker to ensign mayweather.
"go ahead, sir."
"i'm a little short-handed, travis."
think i could get you to go back to the starboard nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils?
"no problem, sir."
call me when you get to the catwalk.
i'm on my way.
there are two here.
ensign cole and crewman rossi.
mayweather to the bridge.
go ahead.
"one of those things just followed me up the starboard strut, but when i got into the catwalk it didn't come through. there must be something keeping it from getting in here."
then you'd better stay where you are.
"aye, sir."
archer to commander tucker.
"yes, captain?"
is there some kind of shielding
in the nacelles that might keep these aliens from getting in?
"the catwalk's reinforced with osmium alloy, but it's hard to say if that would do it."
travis thinks it will.
i need you to stop whatever you're doing and transfer all command functions
to the starboard catwalk. we're going to have to get everybody in there.
i'm on it.
i want you and t'pol to get the crew up there as quickly as you can. hoshi.
it would be best if they stayed where they were.
what?
we're offering them a great opportunity. they may never get another chance to experience existence as we do.
security to the bridge. you're taking over my crew. why?
"i understand how you may be frightened by all this. losing your substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once you've made the crossing, i promise you."
we're kind of fond of our substance. we're not very anxious to give it up.
those who've preceded you are safe and happy. they'll understand.
are you doing this for our benefit or for yours?
escort ensign sato to her quarters.
you'll understand.
how many?
"fifty eight, including us."
and outside?
"twenty four locked in their quarters, and doctor phlox."
"you okay, travis?"
"i'm fine, sir. thank you."
trip?
i saw him down near the command compartment.
thanks.
we need to learn more about these life forms.
what we need is to get our people back.
it's illogical to believe we can do that without learning more about the aliens' intentions.
do you have something in mind?
i'd like your permission to leave the catwalk.
you wouldn't have a chance. one of those things would take you before you got back to the saucer section.
"not necessarily. if a lifeform attempts to exchange its consciousness with mine, i believe i can prevent it."
what makes you think that?
"no offence, captain, but the vulcan mind is far more disciplined that yours. it can resist temptations, emotions, and i believe, invasions by these lifeforms."
"even if you're right, what would you accomplish?"
"if an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief period when our minds are conjoined. it's possible i can ascertain their motives."
it's too dangerous. i won't let you do it.
there's no other choice.
and if you're wrong?
it's a risk i'm willing to take.
"well, i'm not. they've already taken twenty four people. i'm not going to give them another one."
"you told me you trust my judgment. trust it now, unless you have another suggestion."
sickbay.
there's been an accident.
hoshi?
hoshi sato's been injured. i don't know how to repair the damage to her body.
what happened?
her leg is fractured. she's in considerable pain. she needs assistance.
"i'm armed. if you're near the door, step away."
she's on the floor. she can't move.
there's nothing the matter with you.
i need to find the rest of your crew. where are they?
i'm glad i brought you along.
doctor phlox.
"is everything going all right, doc?"
more or less.
good. t'pol and i are going to need your help.
sub-commander? t'pol?
have you succeeded?
phlox to captain archer.
did you find her?
i'm with her now. she's not acting like the others
but she's certainly not herself.
doesn't sound like that's the outcome she expected.
her neural pathways are hyperstimulated.
damn it. you'd better take her to her quarters.
"yes, captain."
come with me. everything will be all right.
i'm afraid i have to insist. i promise you
t'pol! what is my name? sub-commander!
they're lying to us.
my name.
"we don't have time for this, phlox. i have to get to the captain."
"their ship is deteriorating, and they have no way to repair it. they can't survive in space."
so they are doing this to save themselves.
eighty two of them are. one for every crewman on enterprise.
how many of them are there?
hundreds. the rest will try to find another vessel of corporeal beings. where's commander tucker?
i'm not sure.
please find him.
"if the commander can find a way to shield enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to warp."
and lose a third of the crew?
two thirds will survive.
unacceptable. we're going to find a way to get them back.
that may be difficult.
can they survive in a host that's dead?
it would be no different than being exposed to space. they'd die.
archer to phlox.
"yes, captain."
are you doing all right?
we're okay.
"how long do you think we'll be in here, ensign?"
i'm sure the captain will get us out as soon as he can. has anyone seen commander tucker?
"no, sir."
not for a while. i think he was down there.
thanks.
we'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds of respiratory failure.
that'll give you enough time to resuscitate them?
"oh, yes."
it's enough time. don't forget to close off the ventilation to the starboard nacelle.
we wouldn't want the gas to affect you and the others.
understood.
"sorry, captain, i can't find commander tucker."
has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches?
not since we sealed them.
you must've missed him.
i'll look again.
"four, five, six, seven."
all right. does it have an id tag?
junction four one alpha. atmospheric
recycling manifold.
good. do you see the releases on either side?
yes. there are four of them.
two blue.
two silver.
open them. the silver ones first.
done.
now pull the panel off.
what should i do with it?
whatever you want.
lay it down on the floor.
very well.
"right where you said it was, captain."
find the control panel.
it's right here. it has six green lights.
each of them should have a switch next to it.
about five centimetres to the left.
"now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation, you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon dioxide tanks."
and how do i go about doing that?
those six switches control the feed. you're going to have to recalibrate them in sequence for co2.
i'll guide you through it.
"commander, i've been looking all over for you! are you all right, sir?"
i'm fine.
the captain asked me to find you. he needs you in the command compartment. commander!
"you can't go out there, sir. it's not safe!"
what are you doing?
"i've reached the access tube, captain."
good. now pull off the panel.
it's not coming off.
it'll come off. you just need to use a little muscle.
i've used every muscle i've got. it won't budge.
try using your foot
for leverage.
good suggestion.
okay.
"now, the next part's a piece of cake."
"we've got a problem, captain."
"stand by, doc. what happened?"
commander tucker. he just went out the forward hatch.
what?
"i tried to stop him, sir. he didn't look like himself. i think one of those things got inside him."
if he knows what we're doing.
"we're going to have to speed things up, doc. trip's been taken. he left the catwalk a few minutes ago."
if he tries to let his buddies out of their quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him.
tell me what to do.
you'll have to purge the osmotic filters.
the valves are right behind the control circuit. you're going to have to get two fingers through the upper holes in the support plate.
"normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but wearing those gloves"
could make it difficult.
"back home, i'm known for my fine motor skills. i doubt a pair of ev gloves"
will deter me.
"there are two solenoids behind the openings. when you tap them simultaneously, the plate should retract."
did you say there were two?
about three centimetres apart.
got it.
you should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever.
i see them.
"open both valves all the way, then turn the lever to the three o'clock position. that should do it."
t'pol: the nine o'clock position will vent the gas when we're finished.
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead.
mission accomplished.
i'm monitoring commander tucker.
good job.
it's left commander tucker.
vent the gas.
"in a moment, captain. i need to be certain the co2 levels are consistent throughout the ship, that all the lifeforms are gone."
"ready, travis?"
"yes, sir."
it's done.
full impulse.
they're in pursuit.
stand by. now.
"what's going on, doc?"
just breathe deeply. you'll be fine.
i was just at a barbecue.
"in through the nose, out through the mouth."
i've never seen so many ribs.
"follow me, commander. we have a lot of doors to unlock."
bring in the prisoner.
you stand accused of conspiring against the klingon empire. how do you respond?
i'm not guilty.
"when this tribunal convenes tomorrow, you will be given a chance to prove your innocence. if you cannot, there is only one punishment."
you have five minutes.
glad you could drop by.
how are you?
i've been better.
i wasn't sure if i'd find you alive.
they promised me a trial before the execution.
something wrong?
xenopolycythemia can be highly contagious. i'm surprised they haven't put you in isolation.
"any residual symptoms? fever, dizziness?"
just a scratchy throat.
let's have a look.
when did you get here?
"two days ago, but they refused to let us see you."
enemies of the state aren't allowed visitors.
t'pol was finally able to convince them that your condition necessitated a visit from your doctor.
very thoughtful of her.
"she sends her regards, and she wanted me to assure you that starfleet, and the vulcan high command are doing everything possible to get you released."
are they having any luck?
"not yet, but she and commander tucker have begun exploring other options for regaining your freedom."
"when this is over, whatever the outcome, i'm counting on them to get enterprise safely out of klingon territory."
i'll let them know. how are your accommodations?
not so bad. can't say i'm a big fan of klingon cuisine.
"it may not appear appetising, but it seems like a good source of protein. i suggest you eat it."
is he infectious?
i don't believe so.
then return to your ship.
i'd like to run some more tests.
you're not here to treat him.
"thanks for the house call, doc."
i'm sure i'll see you soon.
"i'm kolos, your advocate."
jonathan archer.
the tribunal's about to begin.
we haven't even discussed what happened.
i'm familiar with the charges.
"well, i'm not familiar with your justice system. what can i expect out there?"
"now that you've been charged, the evidence against you will be presented."
do i get a chance to testify?
i will conduct your defence.
how can you do that when you haven't heard what really happened?
i know what happened. you mustn't speak during the tribunal. i'll speak for you.
what are they saying?
enemy.
i hope they're not the jury.
there is no jury.
who's that?
prosecutor orak. his success is well known.
what about you? what's your success rate?
i've performed my duty.
"this tribunal is convened. strength to the empire. prosecutor orak, you may proceed."
"i call duras, son of toral."
"captain duras, tell the tribunal about your encounter with the accused."
i am no longer a captain.
explain.
i am a second weapons officer serving on the ty'gokor defence perimeter.
the duras i called to testify is commander of the battle cruiser bortas.
i was recently reduced in rank.
"a distinguished klingon warrior, stripped of his command. did the accused have anything to do with your disgrace?"
yes.
"go on, weapons officer duras."
a group of rebels had fled the klingon protectorate at raatooras. i was commanded to bring these traitors to justice. we'd followed their warp trail to a system just outside klingon territory.
they're near the fifth planet. another vessel is docked with them.
show me.  what kind of ship is that?
"unknown, but they've taken the rebels aboard."
armaments.
torpedo launchers fore and aft. low-yield particle cannons. we can defeat them easily.
intercept.
they're signalling us.
viewer. identify yourself.
captain archer of the battle cruiser enterprise.
the people aboard your ship are wanted for treason. surrender them immediately.
by whose authority?
the chancellor of the klingon high council.
"i don't know your chancellor, and i don't give a damn what he wants. i've formed an alliance with these people, and i'm going to support their revolt."
"give them to me now, or i'll destroy your vessel."
"fire one shot, and you'll be joining your ancestors in the afterlife."
he refused to surrender the rebels.
yes.
i didn't say any of those things. can't you object?
it's not important.
and how did you respond to archer's defiance?
i pitied him. he was about to die in defence of these wretched traitors.
they weren't traitors.
"advocate, haven't you informed the prisoner of the rules of this tribunal?"
"my apologies, magistrate. be silent, or you will be removed."
continue.
"i showed him more patience than he deserved, but obviously he wanted blood to be spilt."
don't be a fool. your ship is inferior. you won't survive a battle with us.
death to the empire.
return fire!
they're heading for the ring system.
the coward thinks he can hide. pursue them!
where are they? answer me!
debris is interfering with sensors.
there. target their engines! all weapons!
we've lost sensors. shields are down!
manual targeting! fire!
they're leaving orbit.
follow them!
our engines are down.
it took us three hours to repair our warp drive.
"but of course, by that time, they were gone. you're fortunate your first officer didn't kill you for such a failure. you're dismissed."
you're not going to question him?
he'd say nothing that would help you.
do you have any further evidence to present?
"no, magistrate. duras' testimony is clear. he was attempting to carry out his mission to bring enemies of the empire to justice. but this aggressor, this human, conspired with them to disgrace a proud warrior and foment rebellion. there can be no doubt that he is our enemy as well. captain archer claims to be innocent. innocent of what? this tribunal has already been far too lenient. we haven't accused his crew, or his government. he's fortunate we haven't dispatched a fleet of warships to his homeworld, but we do demand that he be held responsible for the crimes he has committed. we demand that he receive the most severe punishment our laws decree!"
do you have a response?
"no, magistrate."
then i will consider the evidence and deliver my verdict.
i'd like a chance to defend myself.
you have been warned.
he's distorting the truth.
be silent!
"those people weren't rebels, and i wasn't trying to start a rebellion. i am not your enemy!"
this tribunal is in recess.
what is this?
targ.
it's a little underdone.
i told you to remain silent. you should have listened to me.
sorry if i interfered with your legal strategy.
my strategy may yet spare your life. i've spoken with the magistrate. he's willing to show you mercy if you co-operate.
how?
tell him where to find the rebels.
"i told you, they're not rebels."
it doesn't matter what you believe. they're subject to the laws of the empire. there's nothing you can say that will change that.
i haven't been able to say anything.
where did you take them? another ship? a planet? do you understand what will happen if you don't tell them?
i've a pretty good idea.
i'm offering you a way to save your life.
let's say i did co-operate. what would happen to these people?
they would be charged with treason.
and end up in a court like this one? tell the magistrate i'm going to pass on his offer.
only a fool would sacrifice himself for people he barely knows.
"i know them well enough. they're good people, and i won't turn them over. if you'd let me testify, tell my side of the story, it might become clear why i helped them. but from what i've seen, you're all perfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear."
don't be so quick to accuse me of sharing their interpretation of the law.
no? what's your interpretation?
i became an advocate many years ago. they were different times.
better or worse?
the courts were more willing to listen.
then maybe you should remind them of those different times. nothing like a good history lesson.
i'm an old man. too old to challenge the rules.
even if your client's life depends on it? i get the feeling you're as frustrated as i am. that you want to stand up to them. but you've given up. you're afraid of them.
i'm not afraid.
then prove it. challenge them. show them what a real trial is like.
strength to the empire. have you informed the accused of our offer?
i have.
and does he wish to address this tribunal?
he does. he wishes to testify in his own defence.
i object. the time for testimony is over.
"with respect, magistrate, no verdict has been reached."
irrelevant! i urge you to end these proceedings.
i am within my rights to present further testimony.
you're speaking of archaic rights.
"surely i don't need to remind the magistrate, the judicial charter of koloth states an advocate is entitled to challenge the charges at any point during the tribunal. to my knowledge, that charter has not been cast aside. from the time of kahless, our courts have stood as a forum where justice is dispensed with honour. now, will my case be heard, or will it not?"
call your witness.
identify yourself.
i'm captain jonathan archer of the earth starship enterprise.
"do you admit, captain archer, that you gave aid and comfort to a vessel fleeing the empire?"
we answered a distress call. they were starving. their life support was failing.
their health isn't at issue here. you helped them to escape!
"will my client be allowed to testify, or not?"
"prosecutor, you will show the advocate the same respect he has shown you. continue."
recount for this tribunal your recollection of the events.
"as i said, we had received a distress call."
magnify. biosigns?
twenty seven.
any response?
"no, sir."
malcolm?
"main propulsion's offline, life support is failing. they're in a bad way, sir."
can you dock with them?
"their port engine is venting reactor coolant. i can try to come in on the starboard side, but it'll be tricky."
do your best.
"our warp drive failed three weeks after we left. we tried to set a course for the nearest system at impulse, but main power went down."
how long ago was that?
"i don't know. six weeks, maybe more. we diverted auxiliary power to life support, but it wasn't enough. food processors failed, water recyclers."
"i've put them all on protein supplements, but two of them are in serious condition."
when we left there were fifty four aboard.
what brought you out here?
"several years ago, our colony was annexed by a species we had never seen before. they said they'd provide for us in exchange for our allegiance, that we'd become a part of their empire. but they stripped us of our resources, left us with nothing. we waited for them to return. they said they'd bring food, fuel. they never came back."
you knew they were fleeing the empire.
we knew that their colony had been abandoned.
and you chose to show them compassion.
they were starving. they wouldn't have lasted another week.
they were subjects of the empire. their welfare was not your concern.
"apparently it wasn't yours, either."
you see the contempt these humans have for us. he still believes he did nothing wrong.
and prosecutor orak has yet to prove that he has.
"he aided these rebels, and now he refuses to help us bring them to justice!"
i will hear what the accused has to say.
continue.
my chief engineer had determined that their vessel was beyond repair.
"some of the crew will have to double up, but i think we can accommodate all of them."
"i've already given the order. considering the alternative was to set the ship adrift, i anticipated your decision. where do you plan to take them?"
they were headed for a system a few light years from here. that should keep them safe from the klingons.
empires tend to expand. they may eventually discover they haven't travelled far enough.
"captain, please report to the bridge."
looks like they didn't abandon the colonists after all.
perhaps they're bringing the supplies they promised.
it's a d5 battle cruiser. i doubt it's bringing supplies.
how long before they get here?
seventeen minutes.
are all the refugees aboard?
"yes, sir."
cut their ship loose and go to tactical alert.
"so, you were preparing for battle."
i was preparing to defend my ship.
as any good klingon commander would be.
the accused has already admitted that he knew the rebels were subjects of the empire.
"they may have been subjects of the empire, but it sure as hell looked like you had abandoned them."
"and he knew the bortas was coming to retrieve them, yet he launched a deliberate attack against an imperial vessel. this human is guilty of more than inciting rebellion, he has committed an act of war!"
i don't suppose there's any chance of outrunning them.
their maximum speed is warp six.
if we could disable their engines.
"sustained fire from our phase-cannons should be able to penetrate their armour, but i doubt they'd sit still long enough to give us the chance."
what's the composition of those rings?
"nothing unusual. methane ice, isolytic plasma. diamagnetic dust."
"when we pulled that klingon ship out of the gas giant, did you get a look at their sensor array?"
"pretty standard multi-spectral sensors, not too different from ours."
"if we could ignite the plasma in those rings, would it disrupt their sensors?"
for a few seconds.
a few seconds will have to do. can you modify a torpedo?
i believe so.
how long?
how long do i have?
the klingon ship will be here in less than eleven minutes.
get moving.
"so, you've laid a trap for the bortas."
we had no intention of firing first.
such a noble human.
i was assured the accused would be allowed to speak without interruption.
by all means. i find his version of events extremely entertaining.
the bortas had dropped out of warp with their weapons charged.
they're on intercept course. two hundred thousand kilometres and closing.
hail them.
identify yourself.
"i'm jonathan archer, captain of the starship enterprise."
you're harbouring fugitives. surrender them.
i wasn't aware they'd committed any crime.
they're wanted for inciting rebellion.
"from what i can tell, they are in no condition to incite anything. apparently their colony was abandoned by"
"turn over the rebels, now!"
what do you intend to do with them?
that's none of your concern.
"i'm sorry, but i'm not prepared to hand them over without a little more information. if i could speak to someone in your government."
i speak for the empire.
fair enough. let's sit down and try to
hull plating's at eighty percent. no damage to the klingon ship.
head into the rings.
they're pursuing. ten thousand metres.
"we're approaching a large fragment, six hundred metres in diameter, bearing two two seven mark four."
put us behind it.
"they're closing, sir. four thousand metres."
stand by.
three thousand metres. two thousand. eight hundred metres.
fire!
our sensors are down.
"let's hope theirs are, too. get us out of here."
you say the bortas fired first.
yes.
and you tried to reach an accommodation with captain duras?
he refused.
duras was under no obligation to accommodate this human.
so you were simply defending your ship when you attacked the bortas?
yes.
and then what happened?
we left the system and took the refugees with us.
you could have destroyed the bortas. why didn't you?
because captain duras is not my enemy.
"not your enemy. i submit to this tribunal that captain archer is guilty. guilty of meddling in klingon affairs on more than one occasion. in fact, i've discovered his name is well known to the high council. the accused once stood before the chancellor himself and exposed a suliban plot that would have thrown the empire into civil war."
that is absurd.
"the facts are on record. perhaps the prosecutor has grown complacent with his research. the records of the imperial fleet also mention this man. his ship was instrumental in the rescue of the klingon raptor, the somraw, from the dense atmosphere of a gas giant."
"even if this is true, it has nothing to do with this case."
"it has everything to do with this case. it shows a pattern in archer's behaviour that was repeated in his encounter with captain duras. yes, he may be self-righteous, but his meddling has saved a klingon ship and perhaps the fate of the empire itself. if captain archer is guilty, he is guilty of nothing more than being a nuisance, and hardly worth the attention of this tribunal. and if he must be punished, let the punishment fit that crime."
how long should it take for a verdict?
it usually doesn't take long at all. i must have been more persuasive than i thought.
thanks for what you've done for me.
don't thank me yet. the odds are still very much against us.
what is it?
bloodwine. it should help make the wait more pleasant.
what's it the blood of?
don't feel badly if you can't stomach it.
i didn't say that.
how many cases have you won?
"oh, i'm not sure. over two hundred. but that was a long time ago, when the tribunal was a forum for the truth and not a tool for the warrior class."
there are other classes?
you didn't believe all klingons were soldiers?
i guess i did.
"my father was a teacher. my mother, a biologist at the university. they encouraged me to take up the law. now all young people want to do is take up weapons as soon as they can hold them. they're told there's honour in victory, any victory. what honour is there in a victory over a weaker opponent? had duras destroyed that ship he would have been lauded as a hero of the empire for murdering helpless refugees. we were a great society not so long ago, when honour was earned through integrity and acts of true courage, not senseless bloodshed."
"for thousands of years, my people had similar problems. we fought three world wars that almost destroyed us. whole generations were nearly wiped out."
what changed?
a few courageous people began to realise they could make a difference.
"i have weighed the evidence carefully. advocate kolos has made an impressive case, much to the surprise of this tribunal. based upon his arguments i am inclined to believe that the accused was a victim of his own foolishness. he was not fomenting rebellion. but, as prosecutor orak has made clear, the laws of the empire have been violated and captain archer must be held accountable for his actions regardless of his intent. i therefore find the accused guilty as charged.  however! however this tribunal cannot ignore his actions assisting the klingon people. therefore the sentence of death is commuted. silence! jonathan archer, you are condemned to the dilithium mines on the penal colony of rura pente for the remainder of your life. remove the prisoner."
i protest.
"i wouldn't protest too loudly, prosecutor. you've won your case."
and i compliment the magistrate on his just ruling. but the sentence for these crimes must be death.
"the sentence is death. you condemn this man to rura pente. what is the life expectancy of a prisoner there? six months, a year at the most? and you expect us to believe that this is an act of mercy."
"this court has shown you a great deal of patience, advocate. don't test my limits any further."
"i ask for no special treatment. only that my client be judged fairly, as any klingon would be judged. but it has been many years since anyone stood in this chamber and received justice."
watch your words. you insult the honour of this tribunal.
"honour? you acknowledged that captain archer acted with conviction and integrity, and how do you reward him? with this grand public display of compassion before sending him to his death in a frozen cave."
enough!
forgive me if i fail to see the honour in that.
"you are in contempt of this tribunal. since you have such admiration for the prisoner, you will join him on rura pente for a period of one year. remove them both."
the vulcan high command will continue to lobby for the captain's release.
so what do we do?
the klingons have only allowed us to remain here during the trial. we're to leave immediately.
and abandon the captain?
we don't have a choice.
what's this rura pente like?
it's quite inhospitable.
they're going to have to get there.
we're deep inside klingon territory. a rescue attempt is out of the question.
i'm willing to risk it.
the captain isn't. he made it clear he didn't want us to endanger the crew on his behalf.
so you're saying we just forget about him?
"i'm saying a rescue isn't an option, but there are diplomatic channels."
we tried diplomatic channels.
"not all of them. i've dealt with several klingon bureaucrats in the past. some of them can be persuaded. mister mayweather, take us out of orbit."
you! get back to work!
you all right?
perhaps i spent too much time in the law library and not enough in the battlefield.
not all klingons are warriors. remember?
"our ships run on dilithium, not talk."
leave him alone.
get back to work.
anymore trouble from you and you'll spend the night on the surface.
you're a fool.
you're welcome.
haven't you learned your lesson? this is why you were sent here in the first place. for interfering in affairs that have nothing to do with you.
we have a saying on earth. you don't kick a man when he's down.
"so, are all humans like this?"
like what? fair?
stupid.
it's in our nature.
"stand up. we have work to do, unless you want to sleep on the surface."
follow me. this way.
new arrivals?
prosecutor orak has been busy.
stay away from us. we have nothing you want.
captain.
it's all right. he's from my ship.
"it's good to see you, sir."
"you, too. lieutenant reed, this is kolos, my advocate."
pleasure.
how'd you get here?
t'pol knows a few klingon officials from her days in the ministry of security. one of them put us in touch with a corrections officer who was willing to look the other way for the right price. i came on one of the dilithium barges. we bribed the captain to bring us here and take us back to enterprise.
is there room for one more?
"i imagine so, but we have to hurry."
come on.
i can't go with you.
why not?
"i've been an advocate for fifty years, and i spent the last twenty of them standing in that tribunal playing my part, holding my tongue, and all the while honourable men were being sent to places like this without the benefit of a defence. and then i was assigned your case. you told me that on your world a few courageous people made a difference. i'm not sure i have the courage, but i know i'll never be able to restore honour to my people living as a fugitive."
you realise what that means. you said most prisoners here don't survive a year.
most prisoners here have very little to live for.
captain?
go. go!
thank you.
bridge to mayweather.
mayweather.
i'm on my way.
"the planet's orbit has shifted, taking it between two gas giants. their gravitational pull is causing its core to superheat."
starfleet thinks it will be covered with erupting volcanoes by the end of the week.
this system's almost thirty light years behind us.
admiral forrest assures me it's only a temporary detour.
some geologic fireworks. could be fun.
set a course.
"aye, sir."
come in.
"do you have a minute, sir?"
"several, actually. please. what's on your mind?"
i was wondering if i could make a personal request.
of course.
"my family's ship, the horizon, we're going to be passing close to it. i wouldn't mind going by for a visit. it's about ten hours off our flight path. enterprise can still get to the planet with time to spare. you could pick me up on the way back."
i think we can manage without you for a few days.
"thank you, sir."
your folks'll be surprised to see you.
my father's been ill for a few months.
"nothing serious, i hope."
my mother said he'll be fine. she's the ship's medic.
i thought you told me your mother was the chief engineer.
she's both.
i guess they have to wear a lot of hats to keep those old ships running.
"my grandfather held the record. five jobs at one time, two of them on the bridge."
there was a time when i gave serious thought to serving on a cargo ship.
"you, sir?"
it was a few years before starfleet was chartered.
why didn't you sign up?
"long story. i'll tell you the next time we have breakfast. after we dock, i'll have phlox go over with you, have him take a look at your father."
"i'd appreciate that, sir."
you'll be glad to hear the thermal scanners are up and running.
and the imaging relays?
"yep. we'll drop six of them in high orbit. that should give us a bird's-eye view of every volcano on the planet. you know, there's not going to be a lot to do once we get there. sensors will record everything automatically."
you should have plenty of time to practice your harmonica.
"i've talked chef into doing something special. starting tuesday, it's going to be movie night every night. thought you might be interested, seeing how you enjoyed that western. we're going to be showing the three greatest horror movies ever made. frankenstein, bride of frankenstein and son of frankenstein. we might even throw in abbott and costello meet frankenstein."
i have no interest in horror movies.
"how do you know if you've never seen one? you don't have to see all of them. just come the first night. i promise you'll like it. reanimated life forms, science run amok, they're right up your alley."
four years isn't so long. my last family reunion was almost a decade ago.
starfleet really ought to think about putting families on starships.
you must be joking.
no one would ever get homesick.
"yes. well, they'd better post a psychologist onboard because i'd need one if my parents were roaming the corridors."
"on a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running into your baby-sitter or a great-aunt."
bridge to ensign mayweather.
go ahead.
we've gotten a response from the horizon. it's your mother.
"thanks, hoshi. put it through to my quarters."
mind if i join you?
of course not.
i haven't been up here since we launched. come here a lot?
every now and then.
commander tucker told me what happened. i'm sorry.
"my mother sent a message to starfleet six weeks ago, but i never got it."
the civilian channels can be pretty slow.
i should have called him. we were in comm. range a few months ago. i guess i wasn't ready to talk to him yet. he wasn't very happy with me when i joined starfleet. he'd been grooming me for his job since i was kid.
"i'm sure it wasn't easy for him when you left, but i know for a fact that he was proud of you."
"with all respect, sir, i'm not so sure he was."
"did he ever tell you about the letter he sent me? it was almost two and a half years ago. there were a few candidates i was looking at for helm officer. i was having a little trouble deciding, so i contacted their former cos hoping for a more personal evaluation."
what did he say?
"he wrote the shortest recommendation. just one sentence. he said he'd never met a more natural stick and rudder man in his life and i'd be a fool if i didn't choose you. when i saw how you handled yourself at the helm, i knew he was right."
i wish he would have told me that.
"as i suspected, it's nothing more than a simple headache."
i was hoping for something more serious.
oh?
i've been coerced into watching tonight's movie.
"if you're looking for a medical excuse, i'm afraid you're out of luck. if it's any consolation, i'll be there as well. i agree this form of entertainment is rather crude, but it can often provide an enlightening glimpse into human behaviour."
don't be surprised if you see me here again afterwards. i have little doubt my headache will return.
just a quick tour of the engine room. that's all i'm asking.
the horizon's fifty years old. i'm sure you've seen far more impressive warp reactors.
"zephram cochrane designed that engine himself. i've heard rumours that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing. oh, almost forgot."
what's this?
a few family photos. i downloaded every picture i've taken since we left spacedock. thought your mom might like to see what her boy's been up to.
"thank you, sir."
you bet.
"i wouldn't call it a dangerous mission. we've gotten into a few skirmishes, but nothing we couldn't handle."
i got a letter from your sister. she said you mentioned a close call with some kind of storm.
we ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. the crew had to squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. she probably made it sound worse than it was.
she also mentioned something about alien soldiers forcing their way aboard.
it was really just a misunderstanding. they thought enterprise had been abandoned. captain archer convinced them to leave.
i guess there's no point in asking you about the romulan minefield.
how'd you know about that?
i've been serving on cargo ships for a long time. i've made a few contacts here and there.
stand by to go to warp.
charlie must be at the helm.
what makes you say that?
his warp jumps were always a little rough. where are we headed?
deneva station. just a quick run to pick up supplies. we'll have you back in plenty of time.
"watch your step, ma'am. travis?"
hey!
haven't seen you for a while. did you lock yourself in a cargo container again?
do you always have to bring that up?
"it's good to see you. if you're not busy tonight, stop by the mess."
i will.
did you forget your way?
guest quarters are over here.
you're not assigned to guest quarters.
i thought my room had been reassigned.
"it was, but they didn't mind giving it up for a few days. we don't get vips very often. i found some of your old things. thought you might feel more at home."
i can't believe you kept this.
"you stayed up all night for a month, mapping every system you planned to visit when you grew up."
i've still got a ways to go.
i'm glad you're home.
"me, too.  we're going to get through this, mom."
"those plasma injectors aren't going to align themselves. i should go. after you've settled in, come by the engine room. some people want to say hello."
transfer these canisters over to module four.
are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing?
an ensign ought to salute before addressing a captain.
acting captain. don't let it go to your head.
i'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
the jacket looks good on you.
thanks. didn't think i'd be wearing it this soon.
business must be good. i've never seen this module so full.
the biggest problem these days is keeping track of everything. dad kept a lot of the inventory in his head. i'm trying to reconstruct the database. we still can't find the stromatopod larvae we're supposed to be delivering to the demerians. i only hope they didn't end up in cold storage.
if you need me to help out with anything.
"thanks, but we can handle it. you're on leave. i'm not going to put you to work."
see you at dinner?
travis. you might want to change into something a little less conspicuous.
i've deployed the imaging relays.
how long until the show begins?
approximately thirty hours. the holometric camera still need to be calibrated.
i can help with that.
"get started. i'd like to share our pictures with starfleet, give admiral forrest a front-row seat."
echo three's within range. it shouldn't be too hard to set up a downlink.
"so, you coming tonight?"
if the sensors are calibrated by then.
"well, you'd better make up your mind. seats are going to fill up fast."
"according to the database, frankenstein is also a work of literature."
"mary shelley wrote it, the wife of a famous poet."
perhaps a dramatic reading would be more illuminating.
you expect a mess hall full of crewmen to sit still while someone reads to them?
they'd be more likely to appreciate the author's true intent.
"you want to start a book club, go right ahead. you're going to be there tonight, aren't you, sir?"
wouldn't miss it.
i'll save you some popcorn.
"might be a good idea for you to go, too. it might be fun, and a little fraternising couldn't hurt."
i don't understand how sitting silently in a darkened room constitutes fraternising.
"it's a communal experience. tell you what, let's make a night of it. dinner in the captain's mess eighteen hundred, movie at nineteen thirty. you'll be my date."
i beg your pardon?
"i'll be a perfect gentleman. and if you don't like the movie, i'll never ask you to sit through another one."
"all right, try it now.  i've increased the range of the navigation sensors. the helm will make course corrections a lot quicker."
what's wrong?
i'm just working on a few upgrades.
i don't remember asking for any upgrades.
"you were busy. i didn't want to bother you. you're going to love this. you know those port stabilisers that were always acting up? before i left, i spoke with commander tucker."
commander tucker.
"our chief engineer, on enterprise. he showed me how to reconfigure the spatial discriminators. shouldn't give you any more trouble."
"what's going to happen if these improvements of yours go offline? you'll be back on your starfleet ship, out of comm. range. who's going to fix it? i'd prefer it if you didn't modify any more systems without discussing it with me."
"whatever you say, sir."
"maybe you can stop by engineering, build us a warp five engine."
come in.
i heard we had a visitor.
word travels fast.
"i still can't believe he's gone. i'm so sorry, travis."
thanks.
aren't you a little old for this?
i don't know. i thought it might be fun to regress for a while. what do you say we turn off the grav-plating and jump on the bed?
and get grounded again? that wouldn't look too good on your starfleet record. how's enterprise?
"keeps us busy. we've gone a hundred and fifty light years, seen twenty two inhabited worlds."
in eighteen months?
you can't believe what's out there.
"columbus, magellan, travis mayweather. how long are you home for?"
just a few days.
any chance of getting an extended leave?
"i'm afraid not. i doubt magellan got much time off, either. what's wrong?"
"i don't mean to spoil your visit, but things haven't exactly been running like clockwork since your father died."
what do you mean?
"we missed a rendezvous with an orion freighter two weeks ago. the cargo authority wasn't too pleased. we're also low on deuterium. we've had to dip into the reserves twice this month. morale's been better, travis. horizon's lost its captain, and some of the crew are starting to wonder if paul's ready for the job. you might have noticed he's been a little on edge."
he's always on edge.
more than usual.
my mother hasn't mentioned any of this.
i guess she didn't want to worry you.
he's only been in command a few weeks. give him a chance. he'll grow into it.
"i hope you're right. i'm sure this is the last thing you wanted to hear right now, but i thought you should know."
thanks.
charlie at the helm?
just a little spatial turbulence. you've gotten spoiled on enterprise.
that's no turbulence.
hull fracture in module three. we're venting atmosphere.
seal it off. try hailing them again.
they're still not responding.
what's going on?
we're under attack.
by who?
i don't know.
should i arm the plasma turrets?
no. transfer reserve power to the hull plating. we need to get out of their weapons range. go to maximum warp.
you're hauling thirty thousand metric tons. you're not going to be able to outrun them.
you heard me.
"yes, sir. warp one point six, one point seven, warp one point eight"
they're still closing.
a little more.
one point eight five.
they're moving off.
reduce speed to one point five.
they attached something to the hull.
show me.
it's emitting a subspace signal. could be some kind of beacon.
call engineering. tell them to get someone out there to pry it off.
"i wouldn't recommend that. this is a dicobalt signature, a high-yield explosive. if anyone gets too close, it might decide to go off."
"the constellation sent us this. this ship attacked them eight weeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull. a day later, this cruiser showed up and demanded their cargo. the constellation tried to drive them off, but the aliens got aboard and killed three of their crew. then they took the entire shipment."
what kind of weapons does the constellation have?
"two plasma turrets, same as us."
there has to be a way to remove that beacon.
"i wouldn't risk it. if it detonates, you could lose the nacelle."
"if we jettison a few tons of that ore, can we increase to warp two?"
i don't see why not.
"that should allow us to reach deneva station ahead of schedule. it's well-armed, we should be safe there."
what happens if they come back before we arrive?
there's no other choice. we can't shoot our way out of this.
i've seen this kind of engine configuration before. it's not that different from a mazarite ship.
mazarite?
we had some trouble with them. we managed to knock out their engines with our phase cannons.
we don't have phase cannons.
i can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines. lieutenant reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent.
"i'm not going to risk all of our lives by getting into a fight we can't win. if they reach us before we make it to deneva, we'll give them what they want."
"if there's one thing i've learned from captain archer, it's that you don't give in to people like this. you're only going to encourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships."
"i appreciate the advice, but this isn't your problem. you're not part of this crew anymore. jettison that ore and increase our speed."
even your father had to make compromises. the safest thing to do is give them what they want. cargo can be replaced.
": fool. if this storm develops as i hope, you'll have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over. go on, fix the electrodes. this storm will be magnificent. all the electrical secrets of heaven. this time we're ready, eh, fritz? ready."
what are you doing?
i'm reviewing this morning's sensor data.
i thought you were going to give this a chance.
"just a few stitches. and look, here's the final touch. a brain you stole, fritz. think of it, the brain of a dead man."
"this doctor frankenstein, his technique is not dissimilar to a practice on b'saari two. they successfully used an isolytic current to reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased."
really.
"of course, the revived individuals weren't capable of more than basic cellular metabolism. however, the b'saari have developed a procedure that shows promise in repairing the synaptic"
we can stop the film if it's disturbing your conversation.
"in fifteen minutes, the storm should be at its height."
then we'll be ready. what's that noise?
captain? looks like someone's rerouting the impulse relays.
where?
module five.
you have the bridge.
i thought i made myself clear.
"if those aliens come back, you'll thank me."
"i told you, i'm not going to take this ship into battle."
you may not have a choice.
"i didn't ask for your opinion, and i didn't approve your modifications. stop what you're doing."
paul.
you heard me.
i didn't mean to undermine your authority.
really.
but you're being unreasonable. i just want us to be prepared.
us? you keep talking as if you're a part of this crew.
it's still my home.
you turned your back on us a long time ago.
"is that what this is about? me leaving? if you want to be an effective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside, listen to what other people have to say."
more words of wisdom from starfleet?
"no, your father. he said that to me a long time ago. if he was here now, he'd tell you the same thing."
"you quoting dad? you never listened to him. if you had, you wouldn't have abandoned your family. you barely spoke to him for the last four years. you weren't even here when he died."
that isn't fair.
"you knew he was sick, but you didn't really care. you only decided to stop by because it was convenient for you. hostile aliens aren't our problem, it's starfleet and people like you. do you have any idea how hard it is to find new crewmen? no one wants to run freight anymore. they all want to be explorers cruising around on state of the art ships with their personal chefs."
"you want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead. i've got better things to do."
take those upgrades offline. i'll confine you to quarters if i have to.
"i'm just trying to help you, paul. in case you haven't noticed, you could use a little help right now."
i don't want your help.
you want to take them offline? do it yourself.
"i understand you made a few modifications to the impulse relays. next time, you might want to check with me. i am the chief engineer."
i knew how paul would react. i didn't want to drag you into it.
i've played referee between you and your brother for a long time.
never thought i'd actually miss these.
nutri-paks?
"not just any nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. the first time i tasted real shortcake was in san francisco. it just wasn't the same."
i think they've ruined your taste buds.
"i wouldn't mind eating like this again. i'm thinking about asking for an extended leave. i'm sure captain archer would approve, considering."
how long would you stay?
as long as i'm needed.
but you're needed on your ship.
i'm not the only helm officer.
"even if your captain agrees, it could be a long time before enterprise is back this way again."
"there's a lot for me to do here. i can help upgrade the guidance and warp systems. with a little luck, we could make horizon the fastest j-class in the fleet."
"you're going to give up your career, move back home and take orders from your brother?"
my career's the last thing on my mind right now.
"congratulations. now you know what it's like to be a parent. i could spend every waking minute worrying about you two, but i'd never get any work done."
"he's not ready, mum."
"you should've seen your father when he took over. he was a year younger than paul is now. he was an engineer. he didn't know the first thing about running a bridge. we fell so far behind schedule, he almost lost his eca license. he wanted to quit. i wouldn't let him. your brother just needs some time."
you don't think i should stay.
"didn't we have this conversation? it was right here in this room, four years ago, when you first thought about joining starfleet."
"a lot has changed in four years, mum."
"that's true, and a lot more's going to change. will we be talking about this again in another four years? you're the helmsman of the first warp five starship. i'm proud of you. everyone here is. even paul, though he won't admit it. if you'll indulge a little motherly advice, don't let your guilt over leaving guide your decision."
i'll try to keep that in mind. good night.
night.
i find it hard to believe that no one on vulcan's ever heard of a horror movie.
there is something similar. a discipline known as tarul-etek. it uses disturbing imagery to provoke an emotional response.
they try and scare you to see how well you suppress your emotions.
i don't understand why humans would feel compelled to frighten themselves.
gets the heart pumping.
cardiovascular activity would be more efficient.
you never did give us your opinion of the movie.
there were many medical inaccuracies.
what did you think of the story?
i thought the protagonist was interesting.
doctor frankenstein.
"no, his creation. from my perspective, this was the story of an individual persecuted by humans because he was different."
that's one way of looking at it.
"in many ways, the film seemed quite prophetic. the reaction of the villagers, for example. it was similar to the reception vulcans received after landing on earth."
i don't recall anyone greeting a vulcan ambassador with torches and pitchforks.
"nevertheless, many humans reacted with fear and anger."
they didn't know what to expect.
i'm going to recommend that ambassador soval watch the film.
you're kidding.
i believe it would help vulcans who've recently arrived on earth.
maybe inviting her to movie night wasn't such a great idea.
on the contrary. i'm looking forward to bride of frankenstein.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"you might want to look out the window, sir."
thermal shear. some of those eruptions are getting close to enterprise.
take us up another five thousand kilometres.
"aye, sir."
"captain. i'm reading biosigns on the planet. to quote doctor frankenstein, it's alive."
i thought it was uninhabited.
it appears that several microbial species which live underground are being unearthed by the volcanic activity.
see what you can learn about them.
full power to the hull plating.
we're being hailed.
this is captain mayweather of the ecs horizon.
prepare to surrender your vessel and evacuate the crew.
"i'll give you our cargo, but not our ship."
you won't be harmed if you co-operate. drop out of warp.
we're dozens of light years from our homeworld. there has to be some compromise we can
they're charging weapons.
bring the weapon upgrades online. still think you can disable their engines?
"if i can get a clear shot, but i can't do that as long as they're behind us."
they've hit module five.
it's going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons of cargo. we've got to cut it loose.
"engineering, stand by to release the primary clamps."
you do remember how to fly this ship.
i'm sure it'll come back to me.
take us out of warp. release the clamps.
"they're closing. forty metres, thirty."
just a few more clamps.
ten metres.
starboard plating's down.
travis.
hull plating's gone.
i'm coming around again.
their weapons are going down.
"keep our turrets locked on them. open a channel. this is captain mayweather. i'd think twice before attacking any of our ships again. re-dock with the cargo section, then get us out of here."
"aye, captain."
come in.
all packed?
wouldn't want to wear out my welcome.
i got a message from enterprise. they're running ahead of schedule. we'll be docking in about twenty minutes.
"if you like, i'll speak with lieutenant reed. i'm sure he can help you remove that alien beacon."
"thanks. so, did you ever make it to trelkis three?"
what?
"trelkis three, the planet with the multi-centric rings. you used to talk about it when we were growing up."
we haven't travelled quite that far.
"when you do, how about sending me a subspace postcard."
you can count on it.
"well, i'd better get back to the bridge. see you in another four years?"
maybe sooner.
i'd like that.
welcome back.
"thank you, sir."
how's your family?
they're okay.
we spotted some damage on their port cargo modules.
probably an old meteorite impact.
you sure everything's all right?
"never better, sir."
feeding time?
when isn't it?
what is that?
it won't bite. it's called a tribble.
it was extremely difficult to acquire. they're outlawed on most worlds.
why? is it dangerous?
"oh, far from it. all it's capable of doing, really, is eating and breeding. the problem is they breed quite prodigiously."
"the only thing that keeps their population in check is the abundance of reptiles on their homeworld. are you feeling all right, ensign?"
i just came by to give you this transmission. it's from the denobulan science academy. marked urgent.
thank you.
these caverns go on for fifty kilometres.
they've mapped fifty kilometres. no one knows exactly how far they extend.
what were these scientists of yours doing down there?
this cave system is known for its mineral formations. the speleothems are supposed to be particularly unusual.
they've been underground for six months. the denobulan science academy lost contact with them three weeks ago. the planet's called xantoras. the government's been politically unstable for several years. in the last few weeks a militant faction has taken control.
"they're demanding that all off-worlders leave. anyone who fails to comply could face imprisonment, or possibly worse."
then why don't the denobulans evacuate their own scientists?
they can't get here in time. enterprise is less than a day away. we've been asked to pick them up. first we have to find them. you've had some caving experience.
"there are some pretty steep inclines here, but i think i can handle it."
what about you and malcolm?
"don't worry, captain. i'm sure travis is an excellent teacher."
get some gear together.
"aye, sir."
"i realise this was an unusual request, captain. i want to thank you."
"happy to help, doctor."
pitons.
all here.
ration packs.
a week's worth.
flex-cable?
five hundred metres.
waste disposal units.
what are these for?
we take out everything we bring in.
i just spoke to the xantoras regional governor. he's issued a general order. you have to get them out of there in three days.
that's not much time.
"the military's preparing search patrols to arrest any stray off-worlders when the deadline arrives. if you haven't found them in a day and a half, i want you to turn around and head back."
no arguments here.
what's the problem?
one of the transports leaving the planet just declared an emergency.
their reactor casings ruptured. the captain's asking the xantoras for permission to go back down.
can you put it on speaker?
several compartments have flooded with radiation. i have injured passengers and crew.
your request has been denied. leave orbit immediately.
our situation is critical!
"we're tracking your vessel. if you attempt to land, we will commence"
where are they?
in a low orbit. six hundred kilometres below us.
set a course. open a channel. i want to speak to their captain.
there could be internal bleeding. run a haemostatic scan.  treat these with dermalin gel and give him two cc's of anaprovaline for the pain. you're going to be fine.
he was working near the reactor when it ruptured.
doctor?
get him into the imaging chamber.
what have you got?
"nothing but three humans, one of which is not entirely convinced we're going in the right direction."
make that two.
this is the nearest entrance to their campsite. i'd be willing to bet they came this way.
watch your footing. there's a lot of loose rock.
"the last cave i was in had handrails, a gift shop, a snack bar."
there's an opening. over here.
still willing to bet they came this way?
"yes, sir."
isn't there a beginners' cliff we can start on?
"don't worry, i'll go first."
how's it going?
"these two are doing well. his injuries were more extensive. his body absorbed a heavy dose of radiation. i've stabilised him for now, but he's going to need intra-cellular regeneration."
what are his chances?
"it's a complex procedure, but i'd say the odds are in his favour."
here am i?
"you're on my ship, enterprise. i'm captain archer."
what happened?
there was an accident on your transport.
what's he doing here?
he's our doctor.
keep him away from me.
you need his help.
i'd rather die than be treated by him.
our two species have a complicated history. we've gone to war with the antarans on several occasions.
recently?
on the contrary. it's been three hundred years since our last conflict.
and there's still bad blood between you?
they've been particularly bitter disputes.
"if you explain to him that he won't survive without your help, maybe he'd set the past aside for a few hours."
i seriously doubt it. he insisted i leave the room. i don't think you realise how much bad blood there is.
you could always sedate him and perform the treatment.
i have to respect his wishes.
even if he wishes to die?
the will of the patient is the cornerstone of denobulan medical ethics.
don't you believe if you can help someone your ethically bound to do so?
hippocrates wasn't denobulan.
"this is an earth ship, doctor. i won't let that man die in my sickbay if it can be prevented."
"without his consent, there is nothing i can do."
i'm giving you an order.
"i'm sorry, captain, but i'm afraid i can't follow it."
"watch your footing, sir."
thanks.
travis!
"stay calm. commander, are you all right?"
just testing the rope.
why don't you take a break. i'll see what's below.
"hey, what's that?"
i think it's denobulan. i've seen characters like these in phlox's medical books.
you don't suppose denobulans carry out everything they bring in?
rock samples.
looks like we're on the right track.
how are you feeling?
i'd like to return to my ship.
your ship was damaged by the reactor leak. it'll be a few days before you can go back aboard. you were exposed to high levels of radiation. you need treatment.
i prefer to be treated by another physician.
"if you don't let phlox operate, you won't survive more than two days. i understand there's a troubled history between your peoples, but i can assure you phlox is an excellent doctor."
our history is much more than troubled. did your doctor tell you that their battle tactics resulted in twenty million antaran casualties?
he wasn't that specific.
i imagine not. they've been very successful at putting it behind them.
do you want to become a casualty of a war that ended three hundred years ago? phlox has been my chief medical officer for nearly two years. i've never questioned his skill or his integrity.
"it's quite possible he's a proficient surgeon, but i don't intend to find out."
you'd rather die?
i'm the first antaran to even see a denobulan in six generations.
"if you spent some time with him, it might change your perception of them."
a few hours in our historical archives might change yours.
"i prefer to make my judgments based on firsthand experience. i respect your history and the sacrifice your people made, but i can tell you that the denobulans you're describing are not the people i've met. don't sacrifice your life based on preconceptions."
why haven't you ever mentioned this?
do you know you're the first denobulan he's ever met?
and he is the first antaran i've ever met.
doesn't that seem odd to you? that in three hundred years neither side has tried to reconcile. maybe you put it behind you too quickly.
"as i said before, the situation is complicated. from childhood, every antaran is taught that denobulans are enemies to be feared, reviled."
this is your chance to prove them wrong.
i doubt i could.
"set aside your preconceptions. i made some headway with him, but i won't be the one holding the scalpel. show him that he can trust you."
do you believe i can earn his trust in less than thirty six hours?
"all i'm asking is that you try. your ethics might keep you from treating him against his will, but nothing's stopping you from talking to him. you're a doctor. he's your patient. find a way to help him."
toss a coin?
they went that way.
how can you tell?
"well, look at those."
"if i was a geologist, that's the way i'd go."
stay close to the wall.
i don't have much choice. it's getting steeper.
"let me lock off. check the safety, commander."
i can't reach it.
almost!
i can't hold this much longer.
"stand by. we'll try again. let's swing together. you ready? on three. one, two, three!"
the rope's slipping!
we're all right!
is it broken?
"yes. you tore a couple of ligaments, too."
we need to keep moving. just give me something for the pain.
"sorry, travis. you're not going anywhere."
"i can make it, sir."
"we're already behind schedule, ensign. we can't have you slowing us down. thanks for getting us this far."
you'll be all right.
"respectfully, sir, it's not me that i'm worried about."
give me some light on this.
what are you doing?
checking your biosigns. nothing else.
very diligent. what a dedicated healer you must be.
you're a long way from home. what brought you here?
practicing your bedside manner?
i enjoy a good challenge. you haven't answered my question.
i'm a teacher of xenomythology. i study the legends of alien species.
"well, i imagine the diverse population on this planet made it ideal for your research. enterprise is here to pick up three denobulan scientists. they also found this world uniquely suited to their fieldwork."
how delightful that we have so much in common. why do you want to save my life?
i'm a doctor.
do you believe that saving one antaran will assuage your guilt for killing millions?
i haven't killed anyone.
now you finally have your chance.
"i assure you, the regeneration procedure is quite safe. if you'll allow me to proceed"
you must know a great deal about our anatomy after what your doctors did to us.
"tell me, were you raised listening to stories about my people? the evil antarans. did they give you nightmares?"
i could ask you the same question about my people.
"do you have children, doctor?"
why?
did you tell those stories to them? did you teach them to hate antarans just like you were taught?
my children have nothing to do with this.
"don't they? if they were here right now, what would they think about their father talking to an antaran?"
enough!
would you even let them in the same room with me?
"i have tried to treat you with respect, but i refuse to listen to these insults. you're the reason we haven't been able to put the past behind us. you have kept this hatred alive. no denobulan would want to be in the same room with you!"
may i join you?
"actually, i'm not in the mood for company, sub-commander. wait. i'm sorry. sit down."
if you wish to be alone.
sit. please. please. how are the repairs to transport coming?
slowly. the damage was extensive. how is your patient?
"dying, but that seems to be his wish."
that's unfortunate.
"i've had patients refuse treatment before, but usually in the final stages of an illness. but this man seems determined to die just to prove a point. it's painful to admit, but i understand why. when i was quite young, i wanted to take a trip to an arboreal planet near our system. it was a park of sorts with a great variety of exotic animal life. some friends and i had planned the journey for months, but the week before i was supposed to leave one of my grandmothers took me aside and told me i couldn't go."
why not?
"she said the planet was tainted. antarans had lived there once. even though they'd been gone for years, she believed the place had been spoiled by their presence."
did you go?
"no, but when i had children of my own i took them there. i was determined not to raise them as i was raised."
your children are fortunate to have a father who taught them to embrace other cultures.
i certainly tried.
are you all right?
thanks for your company. good night.
can you see anything?
more of the same.
are you sure this is the way they came?
i didn't see any other passage.
"we'll give it another half hour, then we're turning back."
three biosigns. denobulan.
how far?
about fifty metres.
who are you?
commander tucker of the starship enterprise. this is lieutenant reed.
i hope you won't think i'm rude but there are many other caverns here to explore.
we're not geologists.
the denobulan science academy asked us to find you.
why?
the xantoras. they've given all the off-worlders three days to leave and that was two days ago.
then you'd better hurry.
"you don't understand. we've been ordered to take you out of here. we've got a lot of hard climbing ahead of us, so you'd better decide how much of this gear you can do without."
"we're sorry you came all this way, but we're not leaving."
were not leaving without you.
"you've warned us about the situation, commander. you've accomplished your mission."
not quite. your science academy will hold us responsible if we come back alone.
"if the academy knew the progress we were making, they'd never have sent you."
"you don't get it. when the xantoras get their hands on you, they'll throw you in prison. they may even execute you."
all the more reason for us to stay down here where we're safe.
you can't stay here forever.
"i doubt we'll need to. the government changes hands so often, everything will probably be cleared up by the time we're finished."
"i realise your work is important, but you can't risk your lives for these rocks."
"rocks? this is the most remarkable collection of speleothems we've ever seen. there's calcite, aragonite, botyroidal flowstone. i've spent fourteen years searching for tractosites this perfect. these samples can provide clues to prevent seismic disasters on denobula."
how much longer do you need?
"two weeks, maybe three."
"three weeks? i've spent the last two days falling down cliffs and getting stuck in lava tubes all just to find you. now, i've got an injured man waiting for us and we have just enough time to get out of here before we end up in front of a xantoras firing squad. my orders are to bring you back, and i promise you that's what i'm going to do."
you can't force us to leave.
"want to bet? we didn't risk our lives to hear you say, thanks, but no thanks. so pack up whatever you need because i swear, i'll tie you up and drag you out by your ankles if that's how you want it."
we have a lot of samples. we'll need your help.
fine.
i'd prefer to spend my last few days alone.
"that's your decision, but if my knowledge of antaran lifespans is correct, your last days won't come for about sixty years."
what are you talking about?
"once the intra-cellular regeneration is complete, you should be able to"
i refused your treatment.
i need to take you off the pain medication before i begin the procedure.
get away from me. i was told your principles prevented you from treating me against my will. or don't your ethics apply to antarans?
i did have nightmares.
what?
"you asked me if i had heard stories as a child about the antarans. my grandmother lived through the last war. i would lay in my bed at night thinking about her stories, terrified that one of those evil antarans would climb through my window."
"i hope your confession makes you feel better, doctor, but it doesn't change a thing."
"you also asked me if i have children. i have five. and no, i never told them my grandmother's stories. when they asked me about the antarans, i told them the truth, as best as i knew it. i told them about our military campaigns against your people. about how we had demonised you, turned you into a faceless enemy. i wanted them to learn to judge people for what they really are, not what the propaganda tells them."
how would you know who we really are?
"i don't. but i'm proud to say that my children would consider my grandmother's attitude archaic. all of them but one. we have grown more open-minded since the last war, but there are still denobulans who fear antarans, even hate them. my youngest son, mettus, was seduced by those people. i did my best to convince him he was mistaken. i told him i wouldn't tolerate the values he was embracing. it created a rift between us. maybe i didn't do enough to reach him. last time we spoke was nearly ten years ago. you wanted to know what my children would think if they were here now. i can tell you what mettus would think. he would be happy to have me grant your request and let you die. but that is not the example i tried to set for my children. why not live and set an example for yours?"
what's wrong?
nothing.
then keep moving.
what's the problem?
i don't know. come on. let's go.
i just need a moment.
we don't have a moment. what are you doing up there? are those rock samples? we can't carry any more.
it took us six weeks to extract these from the rock bed.
"if you don't start moving in the next five seconds, i'm going to take my phase pistol and shoot you in the ass."
these are priceless.
"one, two."
go!
could be some kind of seismic activity.
feels like weapons fire to me. pretty high yield by the sound of it.
we still got two hours until the deadline.  you better get your climbing gear on.
we don't have any climbing gear.
"you mean to tell us that you climbed down that rock face without any ropes, any safety equipment at all?"
exactly.
"well, in that case, after you."
get against the wall!
everyone all right?
i'm fine.
yes.
let's keep moving before we get trapped down here.
captain.
is that the governor?
he says his time is precious.
so is mine.
"captain archer, i thought i made myself clear."
"you did, which makes me wonder why you're attacking my people."
what do you mean?
one of your patrols has opened fire in the vicinity of the caves. your general order doesn't go into affect for another hour and a half.
"i assure you, they're not targeting your crewmen or the denobulans."
then who are they shooting at?
soldiers from the previous regime. they've refused to accept the shift in power.
that's not my concern. you're endangering my people. you've got to wait until they're in the clear.
i'm afraid that's impossible.
it's what we agreed to.
"we agreed to give you three days, nothing more."
target the patrol that's firing at those caves.
"if you attack us, we'll retaliate."
we're locked onto the co-ordinates.
charge weapons.
"do you really want to be at war with us, captain?"
the question is do you want to be at war with us. it sounds like you've got your hands full already. stick to our original agreement and you won't find yourself fighting on two fronts.
"commander, the bombing seems to have stopped."
we need to get out of here before it starts up again.
you wanted to see me?
what you said about your son. you seem sincere in your desire to set an example for your children. i wish more denobulans felt that way.
many do. perhaps if you met more of us.
that seems unlikely.
is that all you wanted to say to me?
you made me think about my own family. i have children as well. i've decided to accept your treatment.
my speleothems!
forget about them.
"fortunately, i have some other samples in my case."
try them again.
enterprise to commander tucker. please respond.
prep shuttlepod one. have a security team meet me in the launch bay.
the xantoras have mobilized their military patrols. they'll detect a shuttle launch.
noted.
tucker to enterprise.
"you're cutting it pretty close, trip. the deadline passed two hours ago."
better late than never.
the denobulans?
all aboard. along with some very rare speleothems.
"captain, there's a small craft closing on the shuttlepod. it's a patrol ship."
"you've got company, trip."
i see them. bearing one eight four mark two seven.
minimal damage. they're using low-power particle beams.
do you need assistance?
stand by.
i think they're just trying to give us a little kick in the pants.
how is he?
"he'll be a bit groggy when he comes out of the anesthesia, but the procedure was successful."
i'm glad you didn't defy my orders. i wasn't looking forward to throwing you in irons.
neither was i.
how did you convince him?
"you must be familiar with the principle of doctor patient confidentiality. of course, you could always order me to tell you."
"doctor phlox wanted to see you off, but he's busy treating one of my crewmen who was injured on the surface."
"that's all right, captain. the doctor and i spent more than enough time together."
it's too bad your research on xantoras was cut short.
the time i spent on your ship was an education in itself. thank you for your help.
you do know we came here to rescue three denobulan geologists?
phlox told me.
i understand they'll be heading home on your transport. i hope that won't be a problem.
have they been informed that i'll be travelling with them?
i had a talk with them.
and what was their response?
"they're willing, if you are."
"computer, begin recording. dear mettus, i know it's been time since i've written, and i know chances are slim that you'll respond to this letter. however, something has happened that compels me to try to reach you again. i've had an experience that has opened many old wounds. as painful as it's been, it's also changed something in me. i hope, if you're willing to listen, it might begin to change something in you."
it's losing mass at an extraordinary rate.
how long before it goes supernova?
"a hundred years, maybe two."
too bad we won't be around. it's going to be one hell of an explosion.
speak for yourself. i might very well be around.
"can't forget vulcan longevity, captain. a hundred years from now? how old would that make you?"
no earth ship has ever been within ten light years of a hypergiant. how much farther can we move in?
our hull temperature is approaching eleven hundred degrees. it would be unsafe to get any closer.
then we'll have to run our scans from here. tell astrometrics to get going. i'm sure they're champing at the bit.
"we may not be able to get any closer, but someone else has."
you found a ship?
bearing two six one mark four. they must be at least twenty thousand kilometres farther in than we are.
let's see her.
recognise it?
no.
hail them.
"the interference is pretty heavy, sir."
then try audio. this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. i assume you've detected us.
captain drennik. where have you travelled from?
the sol system. and you?
"we come from a system called vissia, more than twenty five light years from here. we saw you arrive yesterday. i assume you're here to study the hypergiant."
my species has never seen one up close.
it is quite a sight. have you measured its rate of nucleosynthesis?
i'm afraid we haven't developed the technology to do that.
"if you don't mind eliminating the development stage, i'd be more than happy to help you modify your sensors."
thank you. i'm not sure we have anything to offer you in return.
you could invite us to visit your ship. meeting new species is one of our primary goals.
it's one of ours as well. we'd be honoured to have you join us for dinner.
we'll be there within the hour. i look forward to it.
it'll be nice to have a first contact where no one's thinking about charging weapons.
tell chef we're going to have some visitors.
trinesium can withstand temperatures up to eighteen thousand degrees. we've been using it to construct our hulls for over a century.
you must be able to get down into the photosphere of most g-type stars.
we can get even deeper with our stratopod. it's got twice the shielding.
flying into stars is a long way off for us.
your technology will evolve. what's important is that you're explorers.
we have gone farther than any other humans.
you might enjoy going even farther. i'm taking the stratopod into the hydrogen layer tomorrow. i'd be pleased to have you join me.
i am an explorer.
this is called vanilla and this is chocolate. give it a try.
"oh no, wait. you've got to eat the cherry first. this."
why?
"well, you just do."
a human tradition?
exactly.
aren't you going to introduce me?
"this is malcolm reed, our armoury officer. this is traistana, a xenobiologist, and veylo is a tactical officer."
very pleased to meet you.
why don't you sit down? the captain did ask us to mingle.
indeed. i was just speaking with their chief engineer and his wife. maybe you should say hello.
see you later.
i'm told you're the chief engineer.
"commander tucker. lieutenant reed pointed you out. please, sit down."
thank you.
"this is my wife, calla."
i'm glad you invited us here.
are you enjoying your food?
"oh, very much."
i hope you get the chance to sample our food. it's more fragrant than yours.
i look forward to it. i'd also like to get a peek at your engine room.
by all means.
trip tucker. welcome aboard.
hello.
it has no name. it's our cogenitor.
cogenitor?
we're hoping to have a baby.
ah.
our warp core emits omicron radiation. i'd recommend you speak with your doctor about an inoculation.
sure thing.
this should do it.
"so, you've heard of these cogenitors."
"not all species are limited to two sexes. in fact, i have it on good authority that the rigellians have four, or was it five?"
"so you're saying that this man or woman or whatever, is a third sex?"
that's exactly what i'm saying.
"and she, it, is part of the impregnation process."
precisely.
"i'm pretty familiar with how it works with two sexes, but"
"multi-gendered techniques aren't always the same, but in this case i imagine the cogenitor provides an enzyme which facilitates conception."
what do you mean by provides?
"well, first, the female has to"
"no, no, no, don't tell me. i don't think i want to know."
"oh, well. i have pictures."
i think i'll pass. so how long is this going to last? i might want to stay there for a while.
it should protect you from omicron radiation for about twelve years.
"that should be enough. thanks, doc."
"keep an open mind, commander. you came on this mission to meet other species, no matter how many genders they may have."
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
where'd you hear that?
"hamlet, act one, scene five. your communications officer was kind enough to provide us with some of your literature. i assumed you approved."
"absolutely, but i didn't think you'd be quoting it the next day."
we retain most of what we read.
and you obviously read pretty quickly.
"after i finished shakespeare last night, i began reading the plays of sophocles. what do you recommend after that?"
seems like you're picking the good ones all by yourself. that's got to be ionised hydrogen.
it's generating magnetic currents.
i've got friends back at home who are not going to believe this.
i have friends who'll be equally impressed with macbeth. we're almost into the chromosphere.
the antimatter stream is compressed before the deuterium's injected into the core.
so you don't need magnetic confinement.
let me bring up the schematics.
"where we come from, earth, there are only two genders."
that's true of most worlds.
"i don't mean to pry but, does every family have a cogenitor?"
that wouldn't be very efficient. they are only needed when a couple's trying to have a child.
and when they're not?
"the cogenitor is assigned to another couple. they make up about three percent of our population, which seems to be a perfect ratio. nature has a way of finding the right balance."
is the one i met the only one on your ship?
"the only one. once calla and i are finished with it, i doubt it'll be needed before we return home. would you like to take a closer look at the plasma converters?"
"i would. thanks. so, does it live with you and your wife?"
"we keep it in our quarters, yes."
what does it do when you're not
"it eats, sleeps. there's not much else for it to do."
what about school?
they only serve one purpose. sending them to school would make no sense. why are you so curious about them?
humans are very curious.
"you might find this difficult to believe, but this polymer is composed of over two hundred naturally occurring elements."
that's impossible.
i read in your database that you've discovered only ninety two. i understand how this might seem unnerving.
"a lot of things around here do, but i'm trying to keep an open mind."
how long will you be gone?
close to three days. the circumference is nearly a billion kilometres. we'll be scanning surface features that are undetectable from higher altitudes.
"three days is a long time to be confined to such a small craft, especially with a person you've just met."
"i think i'll survive. these people are fascinating, t'pol. they have a lot to offer us. this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. which reminds me. they've asked us for a sampling of films. i've put together a few suggestions."
i'll see to it.
you're in charge.
of the ship or the movies?
commander.
captain left yet?
he'll be gone for three days.
he asked that you download these films and transfer them to the vissians' database.
did you meet their engineer?
briefly.
he and his wife are trying to have a baby.
how interesting.
there was someone else with them. they called her a cogenitor. you know what that is?
a third gender. why do you call it her?
"well, she looks more like a her than a him. they treat her like a pet, kept in her room, not taught to read or write, no name. porthos has a name."
it's not our place to judge the customs of other cultures.
"we're not talking about taking your shoes off when you walk into someone's house. this cogenitor's treated like one of phlox's leeches. you pull it out of its tank when you need it, then you throw it back in."
tri-gender reproduction is not uncommon.
that's not what i'm talking about. this is a question of human rights.
they're not human. captain archer hopes to develop a productive relationship with this species. it might be best you kept your opinions to yourself.
it's good advice. mating habits are often quite personal. some species aren't comfortable discussing them.
i'm not interested in discussing their habits. i'm concerned with the way they treat this cogenitor.
they're most likely one and the same.
"yeah, well, that doesn't make it right."
it's not a question of right or wrong.
you scanned them when they came on board. don't you always do that?
they weren't carrying any pathogens that would be dangerous to our crew.
is there anything you can tell me about the mental capacity of this cogenitor? is it any different than the males and females?
i'm afraid i didn't take any neural scans.
is that something i could do?
why would you want to?
just curious.
i suppose you could.
fruit and cheese compliment each other.
so cheese comes in eight varieties?
"actually there are hundreds, maybe thousands."
what made you choose these?
they have the strongest smells of anything we have on board. you said our food was aromatically bland. i thought this might change your mind. try some.
"mild, but very nice."
how about this one?
the odour is a little spicier. what's it called?
stilton. chef says it's pretty pungent.
haven't you ever tried it?
not for a long time.
here.
i'd say that's more than a little spicy.
and what's this called?
alsatian muenster.
interesting.
don't you find it sensual?
very.
can we visit the armoury later? i'm anxious to see your tactical array.
there's an old earth expression. i'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your father. that's hard to imagine. the man who developed warp drive on my world lived nearly a thousand years ago.
i'm surprised your ancestors never made it to earth.
we don't believe in travelling great distances. there's far too much to see close to home.
"well, maybe now you have a reason to visit us. it's not that far."
i'm sure we can make an exception. i'm going to take us down to the edge of the photosphere. it might get a little turbulent.
fine with me.
"when the engine reaches critical mass, a mixture of positrons and neutrinos is injected into the chamber. watch."
the efficiency is up over thirty percent. pretty impressive.
it's possible this technology could be modified for enterprise.
we'd be very grateful. we don't have any married couples on enterprise. do they give you special quarters?
the captain's very generous.
"i wish ours was. i've got a room not half the size of this one. i'd love to get a look at your quarters sometime. if i could describe it to captain archer, he might consider expanding my living space."
why don't you join us for dinner tonight? you did agree to try our food.
are you telling me you have a dining room?
we'll try not to prepare anything too pungent.
"it's pretty mild, considering the smell."
"for us, the aroma is far more important than the taste."
this must have taken you all day.
"if i had all day, i would have prepared a far more scented meal."
calla's in charge of the microgravity lab. we usually don't have much time for cooking.
will your cogenitor be joining us?
it rarely eats more than one meal a day.
"oh, so in our mess hall"
bringing a cogenitor to your ship was an exception.
too bad. i was hoping to say hello.
why would you want to do that?
commander tucker is very curious about our reproductive process. humans are bi-gendered.
i'll see if it's awake.
which one's the cogenitor?
right here. her synaptic density and neural mass are almost identical to the other two. your cogenitor appears to be no more or less intelligent than the male and female.
i wouldn't mind taking a turn at the helm.
our navigation controls are not like yours. they're based on five spatial axes.
i've been watching you. i think i can handle it.
you obviously have some experience.
"a little. there's a pretty big flare forming below us. i think i can loop around it, let you get a better scan."
it's giving off a lot of magnetic flux. it may cause false readings in the navigation sensors.
i'll keep an eye on it.
"so, by rotating the quantum inverters, you've tripled the antimatter flux?"
"exactly. three more, and i'll be finished."
"i haven't eaten anything since this morning. if you don't mind, i'll go to your mess hall, see what they're serving."
"if you wait until i'm done, i'll show you how to get there."
i'll be all right. i'm sure i can find the way. see you in a little while?
they're not here.
i came to see you.
why?
i brought you this. it'll teach you how to read.
now you try it.
i don't understand.
"you just touch the word, then you'll hear it pronounced. go ahead, try it."
today.
that's right. now go to the next one.
today we're
good. again.
why are you doing this? it's not right for me to read.
who told you that?
you shouldn't be here.
you're as capable as they are. as smart as they are.
that's not true. they need me to have children.
"it's not a question of what they need. you have the same rights, to learn, to choose how you're going to live, to have a name."
that may be true on your world but not on mine.
"when calla gives birth, who's going to raise the baby? who's going to take care of it?"
they will.
why? you're just as crucial in creating the child as they are.
you don't understand.
"okay, maybe. but we took scans. my doctor says you have the same potential as they do. the only thing that sets you apart is your gender. you're no more different than they are from each other. haven't you ever wished you could read? it won't hurt you, you know. there's nothing to be afraid of."
today we're going. today we're going to. today we're going to read.
i'm starting to get the hang of this. i could take us down a little closer if you'd like.
another ten thousand metres and i'll be able to get a particle count of the photosphere.
"aye, aye, captain. ten thousand metres it is."
are you all right?
absolutely.
if you can keep us at this altitude a little while longer.
no problem.
are these armed with photonic warheads?
photonic? i'm not familiar with that.
i'm afraid our weapons are somewhat more sophisticated than yours.
this technology must seem pretty antiquated to you.
"where i come from, antiquated can be very quaint."
is that how you see us? quaint?
and charming. what sort of power source do these use?
"sarium micro-cells. i suppose that's very quaint, too."
not at all. we charge our weapons the same way.
maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly.
please.
after you.
it has multiphasic emitters and a maximum yield of eighty gigajoules.
impressive.
i'm sorry it's so cramped in here.
don't be. i've wanted to get a little closer to you all day.
really?
i was hoping to spend some intimate time with you. maybe we could sleep together tonight.
"on earth, it's customary to ask a woman to dinner first before spending the night with her."
it's very different on vissia. it's only when a woman enjoys her intimate time with a man that she'll join him for dinner.
the didiron mountain range runs through the upper plains of the great continent.
amazing.
the text describes far more impressive peaks.
"i don't mean the mountains, i mean your reading."
the fauna and flora vary greatly on either side of the central plateau.
"look how much you've accomplished in a single day. and reading's just the tip of the iceberg. you could study all sorts of things. history, science. engineering's not bad. you don't have to sit in this room all day."
they would never let me learn those things.
"then you've got to convince them. it's not just learning. it's experiencing things. music, swimming in the ocean. you do have oceans on your planet?"
yes.
"and how about those didiron mountains? reading about them is one thing, climbing them is another."
i'd like to climb a mountain.
there you go. that's the right attitude. you keep at it. i've got to get back. they think i'm at the astrometrics lab. but i'll see you as soon as i can.
trip?
yeah?
"i'd like my name to be trip, just like yours."
"actually, my name's charles."
then i would like my name to be charles.
i'm flattered.
there's a flare forming ahead.
i don't see it.
you will. turn the axis forty degrees to port. i think we can bank around it.
it's too big.
take us up. try to get over it.
we're not going to make it.
increase speed.
it won't be enough.
what are you doing?
"if you can't get over a wave, you got to dive through it."
where did you learn to do that?
"north shore of oahu, body surfing. i think it's time you took the helm back."
would you be punished if they find out you've brought me here?
"punished? no, but they might get a little angry."
i would be punished.
maybe i should take you back.
"no, no, i want to see more."
"okay. we'll just have to be sure no one spots us.  this is our transporter. it turns things into a matter stream that can be sent just about anywhere, within two thousand kilometres or so. then it gets reassembled."
could it send a vissian?
i don't see why not.
i'd like to try.
i don't think that would be a good idea.
could i see where you work?
sure. follow me.
coast is clear. that's our main engine. fastest one in starfleet. i've had it up to warp five point one.
"i think my ship has something like this, but i've never seen it."
your ship has an engine that's a lot more sophisticated than this one.
do you live here?
no. my quarters are on b deck. have you ever seen a movie?
"it's not easy picking a movie for somebody who's never seen one before. what would you think about a western? no, not a western. i don't think a musical would be right, either. got it. the day the earth stood still. nothing like a little science fiction to break you in."
it's a story about your planet?
"yeah, but it's fiction. the earth never really stood still. sit down. you're going to love this."
why were the humans so afraid of klaatu and his android?
"well, before we made first contact with the vulcans, the people of earth were pretty violent. they had a hard time trusting things they didn't understand. the characters in the film knew nothing about klaatu. who he was, where he came from. so, they tried to kill him."
i understand.
does this mean i've won?
no one's beaten me at this in the last two years.
tell me about westerns. maybe i could watch a western next.
it's getting late. we'd better get you back before they realise you're gone.
i've been told you're no longer welcome aboard the vissian ship. why?
i wasn't exactly where i was supposed to be.
"no, you weren't. you told them you were going to the astrometrics lab. they tried to contact you, but you weren't there. then they tried their mess hall. you weren't there either."
i was with the cogenitor.
where?
"at first, in her quarters. actually, they're not her quarters. they belong to the chief engineer and his wife. she gets a room to sleep in, and if she's real good she can use their living space."
why were you there?
i'm teaching her how to read.
her education is not your concern.
what education?
where else did you go?
"i brought her here, gave her a little tour, showed her a movie."
it appears you're doing everything you can to undermine the captain's wishes.
"one day, that's all it took her. in one day she was reading a geography text."
first contacts are important to the captain. you may very well have damaged this one irreparably.
you're not listening to a word i'm saying.
i didn't see you. how you doing? you all right?
they don't want to help me. they don't want me to climb mountains.
"don't worry, they will. give it time."
"they're angry with you. they'll leave as soon as our captain returns. they won't help me, but you can. i want to stay here, please."
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
that was one hell of a ride. i'll tell you about it in a couple of hours. we've got a lot of data to download into their computers.
"i think it would be best if you come back immediately, sir. there's been an incident."
where is she?
"it's not exactly a she, sir."
where?
in my quarters.
how long ago did this happen?
last night after supper.
they demanded that she be returned immediately.
"i did exactly what you'd do, captain. it's not like i had much choice. i wasn't going to just"
"will you excuse us, sub-commander?"
"i might have expected something like this from a first-year recruit. but not you. you did exactly what i'd do? if that's true, then i've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here. you're a senior officer on this ship. you're privy to the moral challenges i've had to face. you know i've wrestled with the fine line between doing what i think is right and interfering with other species. so don't tell me you know what i would have done when i don't even know what i would have done!"
i didn't think it would hurt to teach her how to read.
"then you didn't think hard enough. we're out here to meet new species, not tell them what to do."
teaching her to read is no different than you giving them books or movies.
giving them books is a lot different than suggesting they defy their culture. and they asked me for the books. did she ask you to teach her how to read?
"no, sir."
"and sneaking into her quarters, bringing her on enterprise, lying about where you were going, why?  come with me."
you don't understand. i can't go back.
just until we resolve this.
trip said i have the same rights as they do.
it's not our place to tell you what rights you have. i'm sorry.
are you going to force me to leave?
some men can work together for years without creating the friendship and bond that we did in only two days. i'm certain we can resolve this.
"i'm afraid it may not be that simple. on my world, when someone asks for asylum it has to be given serious consideration."
"we're not on your world, and i doubt whether this person truly understood what your engineer was suggesting."
i've been told this person is just as capable of understanding as any of you are.
why are we debating this? the cogenitor belongs on our ship. or are you suggesting my wife and i abandon our plans to have a child?
i've been asked to give sanctuary to someone who believes she's been treated unfairly. i can't ignore that.
we're the ones being treated unfairly. do you know how long we've waited to be given a cogenitor?
given? you sound like you're talking about some inanimate object.
"you have no right to judge us. you know nothing about our culture. what if one of your stewards, the men who are forced to serve you food, what if they should ask us for asylum?"
they're not forced to do anything.
i apologise. but it's easy to misunderstand someone when you know nothing about their culture.
you can't expect me to ignore someone when they ask for my protection.
we're in no rush to leave. take your time. consider what we've said.
you shouldn't have misgivings. you've made the right choice.
come in.
captain archer.
i'm afraid shakespeare only wrote thirty six plays. so it might be best if you take your time memorising them.
by all means. i hope yesterday's unfortunate incident won't interfere with future relations between our people.
you sure you don't have an extra stratopod you could spare?
"i'm sure your starfleet will develop one soon enough. goodbye, captain."
safe journey.
"time to say goodbye to the hypergiant. prepare to get underway, travis."
go ahead.
"there's a call coming in from the vissian captain, sir. he sounds upset."
put him through.
come in.
"you wanted to see me, captain?"
i was just told that the vissian cogenitor died.
what? how?
"suicide, trip. she killed herself."
that can't be. why? it's my fault. i'm responsible.
"you're damn right you are. and it's not just her. there's a child who won't be conceived because of this, at least not for a long while. it's time you learned to weigh the possible repercussions of your actions. you've always been impulsive. maybe this will teach you a lesson."
i understand.
"do you? i'm not so sure you do. you knew you had no business interfering with those people, but you just couldn't let it alone. you thought you were doing the right thing. i might agree if this was florida, or singapore, but it's not, is it. we're in deep space and a person is dead. a person who'd still be alive if we hadn't made first contact. i guess i haven't been very successful at getting through to you. if i had, you would have thought a lot harder before doing what you did."
you're not responsible.
dismissed.
captain?
i think this is the place.
take a look around.
"over here! definitely humanoid, but i don't recognise the species."
seems very well preserved.
getting him out of here's going to be a delicate operation.
drake to arctic one.
go ahead.
set up a base camp. get alpha team started.
acknowledged.
contact starfleet. tell commander williams he owes me a bottle of scotch.
sir?
he'll know what it means. drake out.
i'm picking up em traces a few dozen metres under the glacier. there's a lot more here than we're seeing.  we've got another one!
i give up. what is it?
an arm. it's his.
you're joking.
"from what i can tell, it was integrated into his circulatory and nervous systems. he could probably operate it like it was his own flesh and blood."
"i met a vulcan scientist who wore a prosthesis. he lost his forearm. it's pretty sophisticated, but it doesn't compare to this."
"take a look at the eyepiece. judging by the optics, i'd say he could see most of the em spectrum."
did you run a genetic analysis?
that's even more interesting. they don't have much in common. they belong to two different species.
transmit your findings to starfleet. maybe they'll find a match in their database.
right away.
"sir, i've run every test in the book. i still can't identify this alloy."
what about this?
i thought it was simple thermal damage until i found signs of antimatter residue.
maybe their warp drive overloaded.
that could explain why there's not much debris. i did find some carbon traces.
could you date them?
this debris has been here for about a hundred years.
take a look at this. do you see those devices? they're repairing the cell membranes.
what are they?
"i believe you're looking at a form of nanotechnology. i found thousands of these in both aliens. they're not just regenerating the damaged tissue, they're repairing the mechanical components as well. as far as i can tell, this arm's as good as new."
"the denobulans have experimented with nanotechnology, but they have nothing like this."
"maybe we should move the bodies to module three, put them back in cold storage with the other samples. that way, we can examine them later under controlled conditions."
couldn't the bodies be damaged if we freeze them again?
i guess it's possible.
then we should leave them here. let the regeneration process continue.
what if it revives more of their systems? we don't know anything about this species or what they were doing here a hundred years ago.
there's no reason to assume they're hostile.
they don't exactly look friendly.
"starfleet has asked us to find out everything we can. keep them here for now, we'll see what happens."
anything?
oh! plenty.
you seem a little jumpy.
"cybernetic corpses, digging through frozen remains in the middle of the night, why would i be jumpy?"
i'd be more worried about the polar bears.
i've identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull. each one has the same curvature. i think this ship was a perfect sphere.
how big?
about six hundred metres in diameter.
the debris field could be a lot more extensive than we thought. we might want to get another excavation team out here.  what is it?
a warp signature.
help me with this.
just what the doctor ordered.
thanks.
how are your friends?
a little on the quiet side.
there's a broken heating unit in module three. they've asked me to take a look. will you be all right here?
go ahead. i'll be fine.
feeling better?
deuterium residue. might be some kind of warp coil.
seems too small for a ship this size.
"i'd like to bring it back to the lab, take a closer look."
"here, here. get me a medical kit."
"admiral, there's a problem with the a-6 excavation team. the science council hasn't heard from them in three days."
get a shuttle ready.
the admiral thinks that they're humanoids enhanced with technology. he believes they abducted the research team.
we're a long way from the arctic. what can we do?
earth tracking stations spotted the transport leaving orbit at warp three point nine.
that's impossible. those transports can't exceed one point four.
i think it's safe to assume these aliens reconfigured the engines using technology from their own ship.
does starfleet know where the vessel is now?
"not exactly, but their heading puts them within a half dozen light years of our current position. we've been ordered to find the ship."
it shouldn't be difficult to isolate their warp signature.
we'll start searching at these coordinates. go to tactical alert. lay in a course.
"aye, sir."
buried in the ice for a century.
hard to believe anything could survive.
handsome devil.
"you wanted to see me, lieutenant?"
"yes. the researchers gathered a great deal of biometric data on these aliens, but i'm having trouble making heads or tails of it."
how can i help?
"well, this arm might contain some sort of weapon. if i can determine its yield, we'll have a better idea of what we're facing."
what sort of people would replace perfectly good body parts with cybernetic implants?
"you, of all people, should be open-minded about technology."
"i don't have a problem with it, as long as it stays outside of my skin."
"if your heart was damaged, would you want me to replace it with a synthetic organ, or would you rather die?"
that's different.
"there's a species i once encountered in the beta magellan system, the bynars. when they're born, a surgeon removes the child's parietal lobe and replaces it with a synaptic processor. i saw the procedure performed once. it was very impressive."
"yeah, i'm sure it was. anything?"
i don't see any evidence of a weapon.
the research team was heavily armed. how did these aliens manage to overpower them?
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're receiving an automated distress call. it's from a tarkalean freighter.
"there's a lot of interference. to any ship within range, we're under attack by an unknown species. request immediate assistance. that's it, sir."
how long to reach them?
about an hour.
set a course.
"open a channel. this is captain archer of the starfleet vessel enterprise. stand down your attack, or we'll open fire."
they're charging weapons.
some kind of proton burst. those transports aren't normally armed.
"obviously, the engines aren't the only system they've upgraded."
any human biosigns?
nine on the arctic transport. the readings are erratic.
can you disable their weapons?
i believe so.
their weapons are down.
they're going to warp.
is there anyone alive on the tarkalean ship?
two biosigns on their upper deck. i'm reading minimal life support.
hold our position. get a shuttlepod ready.  you have the bridge.
"the tarkaleans should live but the nanoprobes have infiltrated their autonomic systems. their renal glands have been replaced with devices like this. essentially, these individuals are being transformed into some sort of cybernetic hybrid."
you said the human biosigns were erratic.
it's likely the researchers are going through a similar transformation.
can you remove the nanoprobes?
"not surgically. these devices are multiplying at an extraordinary rate. i could never extract them all. i'm attempting to slow their progress with a modified retrovirus, but so far i haven't been very successful."
perhaps you should isolate them in the decon chamber.
"if you do that, i won't be able to treat them as effectively. i don't believe they're a danger to the crew."
i'm not so sure. i'll have malcolm post a guard. keep me updated.
come in.
i've contacted tarkalea. i told them we're doing everything we can for their crewmen.
any sign of the transport?
nothing.
"there was something familiar about all this, but i couldn't put my finger on it until i find this speech zefram cochrane made eighty nine years ago. when i was a kid, i read everything i could about him. it took me a while, but i finally found it in the database. he was giving a commencement address at princeton when he started to talk about what really happened during first contact. he mentioned a group of cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his first warp flight when he was living in montana. he said they were defeated by a group of humans who were also from the future."
"as i recall, cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories. he was also known to be frequently intoxicated."
"no one took him seriously, and he recanted the whole thing a few years later. but you have to admit, there are similarities."
he said their ultimate goal was to enslave the human race.
"if he was right, they might be heading back to their homeworld so they can try again."
who are you?!
my name is phlox. i'm a physician. you are aboard a starship. we responded to your distress call.
what did you do to me?
your vessel was attacked. i'm doing my very best to treat you.  i'm going to sedate him.
doctor? phlox.
what happened?
"we were attacked.  i've been infected with the nanoprobes. one of the aliens injected me, some sort of tubules."
captain.
they left through here.
"seal off the maintenance shafts. post teams at every access point. when you find them, put them in decon. maximum security."
"aye, sir."
"use extreme caution, lieutenant. their physical strength has been enhanced. it's critical that you don't let them touch you.  you haven't been infected."
"thanks, doctor."
stay here in case there are any more problems.
understood.
call the bridge if you need anything.
"actually, it's feeding time for my edosian slugs. they're quite partial to boiled rootleaf. i usually pick some up from the galley, but under the circumstances."
i'll have it brought down.
"they've modified most of the primary systems. engines, hull plating. these look like weapons nodes. i don't even want to guess what this thing's for."
"doesn't look like they've enhanced the aft plating yet. if we can punch through here, we should be able to knock out this eps manifold, take down their main power."
one or two torpedoes ought to do it.
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
i've located the transport on long-range sensors. they're traveling at warp four point eight.
how far are they?
less than two light years.
i need you to coax a little more power out of the engines.
i'll give it a shot.
"travis, lay in a course, warp four point nine."
"aye, sir."
they doubled their top speed in less than twelve hours.
let's hope they didn't have time to upgrade their weapons.
"stop what you're doing! i'll fire if i have to.  i said, step away."
maximum setting.
fall back.
reed to the bridge.
go ahead.
they're in maintenance shaft c.
junction twelve. they appear to be modifying systems.
what's in that junction?
warp plasma regulators.
can you stop them?
our weapons were useless. they're equipped with some kind of energy shielding.
"sir, our warp field's destabilising."
it's them.
isn't there an outer hatch in that junction?
yes.
"malcolm, get out of that section and seal it off."
understood.
"come on, go."
take us out of warp.
"we're clear, captain."
sub-commander.
the junction's empty.
"close the hatch and re-pressurise. malcolm, i want you to work with trip."
find out what they were doing in there.
"aye, sir."
resume course and speed.
you had no choice.
room service.
what's this?
"rootleaf lettuce for your slugs, vulcan sandworms for the bat and angel hair pasta for the ship's physician."
it's best if i avoid food for the time being.
you need to keep up your strength.
"if i eat, my cellular metabolism will accelerate. the nanoprobes could spread further."
"well, it's right here if you change your mind."
why are you wearing a phase pistol?
"oh, it's lieutenant reed's idea. if you come near me, i'm supposed to shoot you."
i hope you'll use the stun setting.
"it's going to be a few hours before we catch up with that transport. i'm sure that captain archer wouldn't mind if i stayed for a little while, kept you company."
"i appreciate the offer, but it may not be safe to be near me right now."
"i'm armed, remember? you've looked after me more times than i can count. i want to return the favour."
the technology could assert itself at any moment. i don't know what will happen if it does. i underestimated these nanoprobes once. i don't intend to make the same mistake twice.
do you mind if i feed your animals before i go?
they did a real number on these circuits. it could take days to get all this junk out.
what do you think they were doing here?
"i don't know. but they almost overloaded the plasma regulators. doesn't make a whole lot of sense. why blow up the ship if you're still on it? hand me that, will you?"
that shielding of theirs was impressive. we might as well have been firing holographic bullets.
too bad you didn't get a closer look. that kind of technology could come in handy.
"there's got to be a way to get through those shields with phase pistols. if i cross-polarise the power cells, it might increase the particle yield. i'll be in the armoury."
coffee with cream.
i believe crewman cunningham is in the galley if you'd like something else.
this'll be fine.
is this seat taken?
please. lieutenant reed informed me that you plan to disable the transport when we find it.
he thinks we can knock out the power systems without causing too much damage.
so you still intend to rescue the humans?
that's the general idea.
"if they've already been transformed, that could be difficult."
"i want to take these people home, the humans and the tarkaleans, no matter what state they're in."
there are twenty nine lifeforms on that transport. it's logical to assume they've all been infected. we could endanger enterprise if they're brought aboard. perhaps you should reconsider.
are you saying we shouldn't go after that ship?
"i'm saying, we destroy it."
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead.
could you please come to sickbay?
on my way. i'm not ready to declare them a lost cause.
how are you feeling?
better than i anticipated. the nanoprobes seem to be having trouble with my immune system. but they're persistent little fellows. it won't be long before they adapt.
any progress finding a treatment?
"possibly. i've been attempting to treat the infection as if it were, well, an infection. then it suddenly occurred to me, this isn't a biological problem. i need to think like an engineer, not a physician. i extracted several of the devices and subjected them to different forms of radiation. their intra-molecular processors appear to be vulnerable to omicron particles. but if one of the nanoprobes survives, it will start to multiply again. so i'll need to programme a rather excessive dose. the side effects will not be pleasant, to say the least. you may want to keep this in the event i'm unsuccessful."
what is it?
a cure of sorts. it contains a neural toxin that will terminate my synaptic functions within a matter of seconds.
aren't you jumping the gun a little?
i have no intention of turning into one of those cybernetic creatures.
increase power another five megajoules. fire. keep it going. increase to seven megajoules. try eight. nine. the density's holding. bring it up to ten.
that should do it. we'll reach that transport in less than an hour. let's modify as many of these as we can.
the vessel's mass has increased by three percent.
they've improved their defences since we last saw them.
"they're accelerating, warp four point nine six, nine eight"
increase speed.
we're closing.
target that eps manifold.
they're dropping to impulse.
"they're sending a transmission, some kind of activation sequence."
block it!
i can't.
tucker to the bridge. these cybernetic circuits just lit up like a christmas tree!
they're disrupting our plasma network. main power is failing.
we're losing weapons.
they set us up.
they're hailing us. audio only.
this is captain
you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
hull plating's down eighty one percent.
"trip, we could use weapons."
it's going to be a few minutes.
plating's down another twelve percent.
is the transporter still on line?
for the moment.
then you're with me.
captain.
i'm counting on you to pull us out of there.
doctor?
"i've programmed the irradiation sequence, but i'll need you to activate it once the chamber's sealed. all you have to do is press this."
i've doubled the particle yield. it may take a few seconds to recharge after each shot.
put us as close as you can to their eps manifold.
"aye, sir."
hull plating's at twenty three percent.
this was one of the researchers.
was?
look at these biosigns. they're not human anymore.
sir.
"we've been boarded. six biosigns, c deck."
alert security. bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
how much longer?
i think i've isolated
one of the power relays. stand by.
another human?
same as the others.
that's it.
captain!
we've lost hull plating.
"they're cutting into the hull. e deck, starboard forequarter."
evacuate that section.
"they've adapted. hurry, malcolm!"
archer to enterprise. stand by transporter.
acknowledged.
now.
tucker to the bridge.
go ahead.
the alien circuits are losing power.
do we have weapons?
they're coming online now.
report.
"our engines and weapons are back online. the transport's been disabled, so has the alien circuitry. did you find the research team?"
there isn't anyone on that ship we can help anymore.
"sir, something's happening on the transport. their systems are being restored. they're charging weapons."
target their warp core. hit them with everything we've got.
get me admiral forrest.
aren't you supposed to be in bed?
"i'm merely catching up on some paperwork. nothing too strenuous, i assure you. it's vital to keep the mind occupied during the healing process."
they say doctors make the worst patients.
"captain, there's something you should know. i had a rather strange experience while i was infected. i believe i was connected with the aliens, possibly through some form of telepathy."
do you think they were trying to communicate with you?
not precisely. it felt as though i was part of a group consciousness.
you were under extraordinary physical stress. you may have imagined it.
"it seemed quite real. i couldn't understand most of what i was hearing, but i got the distinct impression they were trying to send a subspace message. they transmitted a numerical sequence. i heard it over and over again."
come in.
the computer analysed phlox's numbers. they're pulsar frequencies with geometric light year measurements.
spatial co-ordinates.
they told their homeworld how to find earth.
did you learn where the message was sent?
somewhere deep in the delta quadrant.
"then i doubt there's any immediate danger. it would take at least two hundred years for a subspace message to reach the delta quadrant, assuming it's received at all."
"sounds to me like we've only postponed the invasion until what, the twenty fourth century?"
"it could be a phantom reading, background radiation."
even your scientists have confirmed the existence of dark matter.
but never in such dense concentration.
"that's the point. if it really is a dark matter nebula, we'd be the first to directly observe one."
even with modified sensors there wouldn't be much to see.
i've heard of vulcan experiments where they were able to excite dark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles.
those tests involved very small quantities. this structure is nearly ten million kilometres in diameter.
could you rig some kind of spatial charges? something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area?
"if i can, it should put on a hell of a show."
"sorry to interrupt, captain. it's admiral forrest."
get to work on these charges.
"aye, captain."
"this is good timing, admiral. we just picked up some very interesting sensor readings."
"i'm afraid i've got some bad news, jon. it's ag. he was back on mount mckinley. there was an accident. he was killed. i'm sorry."
you've got six spatial charges. i rigged them myself.
what are their ranges?
"if there's any dark matter within five hundred kilometres, you'll know it."
thanks.
you sure you don't want some company?
"if this nebula exists, we don't know what effect it could have on the shuttlepod."
all the more reason to bring your engineer along.
"not this time, trip."
i still can't believe it.
"all the close calls he had flying warp trials, and he gets killed climbing mount mckinley."
i've brought some sensor enhancements.
thanks.
"we'll find them useful in mapping the nebula, if it's there."
we?
this is a scientific mission. it's only logical to bring your science officer.
i'd prefer to handle this myself.
commander tucker obviously didn't remind you that starfleet regulations prohibit the captain from leaving the ship unaccompanied.
"we should reach the edge of the phenomenon in two hours, forty six minutes. i can pass the time by meditating, but if you'd prefer to talk?"
go ahead and meditate.
would you like to join me? you seem quite unsettled since your call from admiral forrest.
i'm fine.
"commander tucker was reluctant to discuss it as well, though he did mention an old colleague had died."
a starfleet captain. a. g. robinson. i wouldn't be out here if it weren't for him.
i'm somewhat familiar with starfleet history. i've never heard of a captain robinson.
"i'm sure there's a paragraph about him in the vulcan data base. we were in the nx test programme, trying to break the warp two barrier. there was just a few of us. gardner, duvall, ag and me. we all wanted the first flight"
and i was cocky enough to think i'd be the one to get it.
come in.
"sorry i'm late, commodore. i came straight from the test bay."
"at ease, commander. i heard your got the warp reactor up to ninety percent today."
"ninety two. sir, you didn't call me here to ask about an engine test. we all know the assignment's about to be handed out. i'm guessing this is either really good news or"
i'm going with commander robinson.
ag's a fine pilot.
it wasn't an easy decision. you'll be backup.
sounds good. you know i spent more time in the simulator than anyone. if i can do anything to help ag prepare for
jon. it's your father's engine. i know how important this was to you.
the most important thing to me is that we succeed. is there anything else?
"no, commander. dismissed."
"thanks, ruby."
you all right?
"sure, why?"
the last time you had this much to drink was the day caroline moved to new berlin. my guess is forrest gave out the assignment today.
sherlock holmes has nothing on you.
they'll need a pilot for the next flight.
do you remember what buzz aldrin said when he stepped on the moon?
no.
"nobody does, because armstrong went first."
congratulations.
you mean that?
"of course not. i'm waiting for forrest to realise what a horrible mistake he made. until then, let me buy you a drink."
"no, i'll buy you one. consolation prize. two more, leo."
here you go.
"to commander a. g. robinson. we all worked hard to get this flight, but in the end the best pilot won. just ask him. ag."
ag.
"take it easy commander, you're due in the simulator at oh seven hundred. first flight's in two weeks."
you know why you didn't get this assignment?
i bet you're going to tell me.
"you tried too hard. you did everything by the book. you burned the midnight oil in that simulator, eighteen, twenty hour days. you shut everything and everyone out of your life just so you could be the first."
and?
you still don't understand. starfleet doesn't just want a great pilot. they want a great captain.
you said captain robinson was a close friend.
that's right.
"from what you've told me, your relationship seemed adversarial."
only one of us was going to get to fly that ship. nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.
he did have a point. it does take more than piloting ability to command a starship.
i agree.
"fortunately, you seem to have developed the necessary skills."
was that a compliment?
an observation. i assume captain robinson's flight was successful?
not exactly. he was lucky to come out of it in one piece.
nx control. i thought we built a warp ship so we could go to warp.
maintain your orbit. we're trying to run down a problem with the stabilisation protocols.
"i saw italy go by again. if this is going to take much longer, maybe you can send up some food."
what can i get you?
how about some of those deep fried mushrooms from the 602?
i'll send ruby up to take your order.
we are clear on the stabilisation protocols. restart countdown at thirty seconds.
good news ag. i just got word from the powers that be that you're good to go.
acknowledged. wsp is nominal. apu's are good.
warp field initialisation in twenty seconds.
i'm breaking orbit. at least the thrusters work. i did get a little variance on the rcs.
we noticed that here. do you want to bring her back to the garage?
not on your life.
we've got an stable warp field.
nx control to nx alpha. you have my permission to go to warp.
see you in a few light years.
warp one. one point five. that little bump you just felt was warp two. congratulations. now let's see if you can get it up to two point one.
she's getting a little shaky.
are you sure you've got that stabilisation problem ironed out?
field integrity's down to twenty percent.
the warp field won't hold.
"ag, we're getting some pretty unusual telemetry down here. we need you to go sublight until we get this sorted out."
did you hear me?
i'm at two point one. i think i can get more out of her.
negative. abort!
warp two point one five.
"this is forrest. drop to impulse, that's an order!"
two point two.
the field's collapsing!
"ag, you've got to get out of there."
we've lost telemetry.
"nx control to nx alpha, come in. ag, can you hear me?"
particle density is increasing.
we should be entering the nebula.
the readings could be misleading.
"as doctor phlox would say, optimism."
optimism doesn't alter the law of physics.
time to put trip's charges to the test. three seconds.
anything?
"we need to move deeper into the nebula, if it exists."
what happened?
"the field emissions on the charges could have been too low, or maybe we're just on a wild goose chase."
i was referring to captain robinson. his test flight.
"he made the record books for being the first person to deploy an escape pod at warp, but he lost one of two nx prototypes. nearly derailed the entire programme."
are you all right?
"a little shaky. trust me, you don't want to pass through the warp barrier in one of those. should make a nice addition to the starfleet museum."
what went wrong?
"i'm not sure, sir. the closer i got to two point two, the more trouble i had keeping the field stable."
you where ordered to abort.
"the abort call was premature. we had some instability on the previous tests, but it always settled down."
your engine design is obviously unsound.
there's nothing wrong with that engine.
"you have something to add, lieutenant?"
"tucker, sir. i'm on captain jefferies' engineering team. we've never pumped this much antimatter through the injectors before. it's going to take us a little time to get the intermix right."
that's precisely the point. your programme is moving too quickly.
just because it took you a hundred years to crack warp two doesn't mean it'll take us that long.
lieutenant!
"sorry, sir."
he's right. this is a new engine. it's bound to have a few bugs to work out.
"those bugs just scattered your ship across five thousand kilometres of space, and nearly killed your pilot."
we're not going to get anywhere without taking some risks.
"i know where you stand on this, commander."
we've got a lot of data to analyse before we know what happened. we should be grateful we only lost the ship.
cyrus.
cyrus.
who's cyrus?
it was my great grandfather's name.
"keep trying, tucker."
"chester. how about rosalie if it's a girl? come on, give me a hint."
she's had names for her kids picked out since she was ten. says she'll marry the first man to guess them.
"what's your name, lieutenant?"
"charles tucker, sir, but everyone calls me trip."
trip?
"my dad's charles tucker, and so was his dad. that makes me the third, so triple. trip."
"thanks with your help today with our vulcan friends, trip. my father would have appreciated it."
i don't get it. it's like they want us to fail.
i gave up trying to figure out the vulcans a long time ago.
commodore.
at ease. may i?
of course.
"can i buy you a drink, sir?"
it's the least you can do after that outburst today.
"i'm sorry, sir, i didn't mean to"
"i'll have a beer, mister tucker."
it's been a while since i've been in here. i see it hasn't changed much.
"is there something on your mind, sir?"
"i came here to tell you at the urging of the vulcan advisory council, that starfleet command has decided to put the nx programme on hold."
for how long?
indefinitely.
gentlemen?
one beer.
"what do you mean, indefinitely?"
"they want to go back to the drawing board, jon. develop a new engine from scratch."
"we have an engine that works now. if we start over, it'll be decades before we get into deep space."
starfleet's made its decision.
"permission to speak freely, sir? it's your father's engine. his life's work. you can't let them do this."
"bourbon, straight up."
i suppose you heard.
this is really going to throw a wrench in my career plans.
thanks.
last call. anything else?
i'll have another.
where have you been all day?
debriefing. after the flight surgeons were done with me i got hauled in front of the starfleet senior staff and the vulcans.
what'd you tell them?
"what do you think? the subspace field destabilised at warp two point two. primary flight controls failed, resulting in the loss of the vehicle."
aren't you forgetting something?
what?
the possibility of pilot error.
"i'm not interested in your opinion, lieutenant."
"you should be. the vulcans have been leaning on starfleet for years to rein in this programme. you walked in there today, ruled out pilot error, and told them just what they wanted to hear. our engine doesn't work."
"sorry to be the bearer of bad news, archer, but it doesn't work."
the engine's sound. we just need more time to balance the intermix.
we need more than time.
"i agree. we need a pilot who listens to orders. if you aborted, we'd still have a ship and probably another chance."
"another chance to what, get killed?"
"at the first sign of trouble, you should've throttled down."
it wouldn't have made a damn bit of difference.
i guess we'll never find out.
you weren't in that cockpit.
there's nothing wrong with that ship!
there's plenty wrong. you just refuse to see it.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
"every time there's a problem with this project, you blame it on pilot error or gravitational anomalies, or some technical malfunction. well, you're going to have to face the truth this time, because there's nothing left to point an finger at. your father designed a lousy engine."
that's enough!  do something!
"come on, come on, break it up."
break it up!
do you think this is going to get either of you any closer to warp five?
the fight was interrupted?
not before i got two bruised ribs and a cracked molar.
i suppose we'll never know. who would have won.
main power is fluctuating.
it's all right. auxiliary's kicking in.
there was a surge in the eps grid.
we must be getting close. trip said the dark matter might affect the shuttle's systems. he'll be happy to hear he was right.
it was probably nothing more than a simple malfunction.
i don't think so. our pre-launch checks were all fine. something else caused that surge.
i'm not detecting any dark matter.
"have a little faith, t'pol."
"even if you're right, it may be dangerous to proceed. another surge could disable life support."
one thing i learned from ag. you're never going to get anywhere without taking risks.
you obviously admired this man.
quite a bit.
and yet he cracked your molar.
humans can have funny ways of forming friendships.
to say the least.
he would have loved it out here. too bad he never got the chance. god knows he earned it.
i thought you said he was responsible for nearly ending the programme.
"he was also responsible for getting it back on course, with a little help from me and trip."
i see you're not losing any time.
we're done flying. no use hanging around. here you go.
i'm not clearing out just yet.
suit yourself.
i've been thinking about what you were saying last night about my father's engine.
"look, i was out of line."
"you were right. i wanted to see this thing fly so badly, it kept me from being objective."
"that's good of you to admit, but it doesn't really matter now."
"it may. i got my hands on the telemetry from your flight. it looks like tucker was right about the intermix, but i think we can compensate for it."
you heard forrest. the programme is on hold indefinitely.
"we can take this to starfleet, make a case to get off the ground again."
what about the vulcans? they'll look at your data and say we need to run computer simulations for another ten years to prove that you're right.
commodore forrest will back us up.
forrest answers to starfleet command. it's out of his hands.
"even if his two senior pilots insist that this ship can fly? if the three of us go in there together, we might be able to change their minds. you just went faster than any human being ever has and now your going to walk away? let them put the ship in mothballs when we're so close to breaking warp three? you're always talking about taking risks. what have we got to lose?"
"if you want to convince the vulcans, you'll have to do a lot better than showing them a bunch of antimatter calculations."
i'm open to suggestions.
we only lost one ship. still have one left.
they'll never give us clearance.
"can you think of a better way to prove it'll fly? you want to talk about taking risks? you're a great pilot, maybe as good as me, but you're never going to get out into deep space by playing it safe. when the first warp five starship is built, it's captain won't be able to call home every time he needs to make a decision. he won't be able to turn to the vulcans, unless he decides to take one with him."
we should be twenty thousand kilometres inside the nebula. let's load up two more charges.
"the history of your early warp flights is well-documented, but i've never read anything about two starfleet pilots stealing the warp three prototype."
it wasn't the kind of thing starfleet command wanted to advertise. don't you believe me?
"i have no doubt it happened, though i find it difficult to believe you had to be convinced to participate."
"well, you didn't know me then. i was a little more by-the-book."
the particle density has nearly doubled. shall we try again?  perhaps we should head back.
we still have two more charges. let's keep looking.
was your test flight successful?
promise you won't put this into the vulcan database?
we decided on a night launch.
"i've routed the intermix controls to the engineering station. if it becomes unstable, you'll be able to adjust it manually."
thanks.
"if i came along, i could monitor the antimatter flow."
i'll keep an eye on it.
you're going to have your hands full.
"we need you down here. don't worry, you'll get out there someday. if i had my own ship i'd sign you up in a second."
i'm going to hold you to it.
"thanks, trip."
no response from the auxiliary apu's.
that's because they haven't been installed yet.
"how's it coming, trip?"
i've disabled
the tracking sensors but i'll need a minute to divert the telemetry.
how long?
don't wait for me. i'll be ready by the time you break orbit.
acknowledged.
"not to late to call this off, head over to the 602 for a beer."
not on your life.
anyone noticed we're gone yet?
"no, as far as they know the doors are closed and the lights are out."
but new berlin should be picking you up in about six minutes.
"by the time they figure out what's going on, we'll be half way to jupiter."
come in. you're working late.
we just got a call. new berlin's detected the nx beta.
what?
internal sensors show it's still in the hangar.
has anyone bothered to look?
warp field is stable.
something wrong?
why don't you take it?
what?
i had the last flight. you're due up.
"besides, you could use the practice. i hope you and tucker were right about that intermix."
we're about to find out.
this is forrest.
what the hell is going on?
"just running an engine test, sir."
"archer? turn around right now, and i'll do what i can"
to keep you out of prison. if you
archer!
perfect.
that's warp two.
here we go again. i'm reading fluctuations in the intermix.
we see it.
your warp field's destabilising.
warp two point one five.  you'd better get that intermix locked down because i'm not backing off till i break your record. got it?
almost.
"come with us, lieutenant."
"nx beta, do you read?"
nx beta to commodore forrest. you might want to check your sensors. you'll see that we're holding steady at two point five.
congratulations. now get the hell back here.
"not only was it in violation of a direct order, it was utterly reckless, irresponsible and maybe even criminal."
sir.
"i'm not done, commander! you are both suspended from duty pending an inquiry, and by the time starfleet command gets through with you, you're going to wish that you had never come back. you're supposed to represent the best that starfleet has to offer. keeping this programme on track is hard enough without our own officers undermining it. what did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish? that just because you didn't get yourselves killed that we'd ignore that data we've collected, the testing we've done, the recommendations of the vulcan advisory council?"
"if we follow all their recommendations, we'll never make it into deep space."
"no one is suggesting that your warp programme be dismantled, only that starfleet proceed with more restraint."
get lieutenant tucker in here. ask any engineer on the project. they'll tell you this ship can fly. archer and i just proved it. we're ready to go. now.
that's not you decision to make.
"with all due respect, its not your's either. you're right, sir. we were reckless. we knew there'd be consequences. we knew we'd probably be thrown out of starfleet."
you may have been right.
"ag and i may never fly again, but its a small sacrifice to make if it keeps this project going. we didn't build this engine to make test runs around jupiter. we built it to explore. if my father were alive today, he'd be standing here asking, what the hell are we waiting for?"
you obviously weren't dismissed from starfleet. they must have found your argument convincing.
"convincing enough. we managed to avoid a court martial, but they grounded us for three months."
"still, the nx programme continued."
"eventually. the vulcans had us run every simulation they could think of for over a year before they finally admitted the engine would probably work. eight months after that, duvall broke warp three in the nx delta. five years later we laid the keel for enterprise. you know the rest."
the particle density has increased again.
i'd hate to see those last two charges go to waste.  anything on sensors?
it appears so.  fascinating. this data will certainly cause a debate at the science directorate.
"t'pol, come up and look at this a minute."
i have to monitor the quantum field.
let the sensors do it. that's why ag and i worked so hard to get out here.
captain robinson clearly wanted to command enterprise as much as you did.
"he wasn't alone, but by the end ag and i were the only two candidates left. they made the final selection six months before we launched. maybe i just got lucky."
thanks.
"congratulations, captain."
"to jonathan archer, first skipper of the starship enterprise,  and one lucky s.o.b."
luck had nothing to do with it.
"it couldn't have been talent. i'm just waiting for forrest to realise what a horrible mistake he made. still, they could have done a lot worst. anyway, i'd rather wait for the nx02. let you make all the mistakes so i'll have an easier time of it."
to the first skipper of the nx02.
"got to go. i'm catching a shuttle to alice springs at oh six hundred. more survival training. night, ruby. good luck, jon. hey, i'll see you out there."
captain. we should start back if we're going to make our rendezvous.
right.
welcome back. how'd it go?
your charges were effective.
was it a good show?
you should've been there.
i'll remember to ask you next time.
"i believe there's a human custom that says when you discover something of merit, you earn the right to name it."
what would you suggest? the t'pol - archer nebula?
i was thinking the robinson nebula would be more appropriate.
maybe you were light-headed from the altitude.
i didn't slip. that overhang gave way the moment i put my foot on it.
i walked on the same rocks you did.
maybe you loosened them. you do weigh a few kilos more than i do.
report.
it dropped out of warp thirty minutes ago. the pilot sent a brief audio message. he insisted on speaking with you right away.
any idea what he wants?
"he wouldn't say, but i did manage to find his ship design in the vulcan database. it's tellarite."
t'pol's mentioned them. open a channel. this is jonathan archer of the enterprise. what can i do for you?
you can start by telling me what you're doing here.
i didn't get your name.
captain skalaar of the tellarite mining consortium.
we're studying this planet. i have three science teams on the surface. we're also here for a little shore leave.
shore leave?
vacation. it's been a while since we've had a chance to relax.
"in that case, i recommend you visit the equatorial range. the view from the north summit is inspiring."
you've been here before?
many times. i prefer to think of it as my own personal retreat. you mustn't leave until you've experienced the hydrothermal pools of ren-gham.
where are they?
"the polar island chain, two hundred and twenty seven kilometres from the southern tip of the rykos shoreline. look for the pyroclastic debris field then follow the lava tubes"
sounds like we could use a guide.
i'd be happy to show you.
sure we're not intruding?
not at all. i'll meet you at your starboard docking port. i'll help you plan your shore leave.
t'pol says they're not the most agreeable species. apparently they enjoy a good argument. it's considered a sport on their planet.
i've got an old girlfriend this guy might like to meet.
"i'm picking up weapons fire on e deck, the starboard airlock."
send a security team. bridge to captain archer.
the tellarite ship's trying to undock with the seals locked.
engage the emergency clamps.
he's going to warp.
pursuit course.
"he's disabled our starboard nacelle. we can't follow him, sir."
get those teams up from the surface.
we're having trouble isolating his signature. there must have been something masking it.
how long until we have warp drive.
less than an hour.
i'm on my way to the bridge.
acknowledged.
"i'm afraid you're not going anywhere for the moment. we brought a stowaway with us, an unusual microbe."
is it contagious?
"i'll have to run some more tests. to be safe, we should both go through decon."
what do you want? i asked you a question.
i'd stay clear of those emitters if i were you. the very latest technology. i installed them last month.
i doubt this ship of yours will be a match for enterprise.
i've taken appropriate counter-measures. we won't be seeing any more of your starship.
"i want to know where you're taking me. my crew's not going to give up until they find me. if you take me back, i'd be willing to forget this ever happened."
you can either be quiet or spend the rest of this trip unconscious. which do you prefer?
this microbe is more resilient than i thought. it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to theta radiation.
perhaps you can increase the dosage.
that wouldn't be advisable. we'd both suffer permanent cellular damage.
there must be something else you can try.
"decon gel e may neutralise the microbe, but it will be several hours before we know if it's effective."
i can't stay here several hours.
"you have little choice. this organism appears to be infectious and humans would be far more vulnerable to it than you or i. commander tucker is quite capable. if he needs your help, he knows where to find you."
"fortunately no one else on the surface was exposed to the microbe. i suspect you and i were contaminated when we climbed into the second ravine. considering the quantity of fauna down there, i'm not at all surprised. we were probably infected by the marsupials i found."
i told you to leave them alone.
their saliva is a natural anti-coagulant. i couldn't return to the ship without a sample. i could use your assistance.
i wasn't aware a curtain was installed.
not everyone is comfortable with the idea of disrobing in front of others.
an odd attitude for a physician.
it's a characteristic of denobulan males. we're more inhibited than our women. it's led to a number of awkward moments. my starfleet physical was an experience i never hope to repeat.
if you wouldn't mind.
sensors are picking up a faint warp signature.
can you get a fix on it?
"bearing oh seven one mark three two. it's erratic, but it matches our tellarite friend."
"set a course, maximum warp."
you are speaking on a secure channel.
i'm trying to reach captain goroth. it's very important that i speak with him.
we're attempting to transfer you. stand by.
this is goroth. what do you want?
i have the fugitive.
he's in your custody?
he's standing about five metres from me. you'll be pleased to know he's still alive. i'm bringing him to kronos as we agreed.
no. i'm transmitting rendezvous co-ordinates. be there in two days.
i trust you'll have the full payment?
you'll get what was promised.
"a pleasure doing business with you, captain."
as always.
"how much are they paying you? you mentioned the klingon homeworld, kronos. i assume this has something to do with my escaping prison. you don't even know what i'm accused of."
"you're right, and i don't care to."
the signature's holding steady. looks like he's orbiting a g-type star.
go to tactical alert.
it appears to be a beacon of some kind. it's generating a warp signature identical to the tellarites.
a decoy! anything on sensors?
we're going to have to start all over.
i'm getting too much interference from that device. it's throwing off our scans.
then get rid of it.
"with pleasure, sir."
"i have no idea what the klingons are paying you, but whatever it is, starfleet will double it."
i don't take bribes from criminals.
i'm not a criminal.
klingon judiciary says you are.
my crime was helping a ship full of refugees.
"oh, that was very noble of you. you'll think twice before doing that again."
it's pretty clear i'm never going to get the chance. i was sentenced to life in prison on rura penthe. ever heard of it?
i'm familiar with rura penthe.
the magistrate isn't going to be so lenient next time. i'll probably be executed.
that's not my concern.
you don't care that you're sending an innocent man to his death.
i've captured dozens of fugitives. every one of them claimed to be an innocent man.
"if the klingons wanted them, they probably were. you don't have to do this."
goroth already knows you're aboard. if i don't deliver you he'll offer a reward for both of us. i've learned never to cross a klingon.
it must be difficult working for people like them.
i don't answer to those savages. i work for myself.
that's not how it looks from in here.
"if you knew how much they were paying me you'd understand. this has nothing to do with you. i'm sure you're not a bad person, just an unlucky one."
you're making it difficult to meditate.
you've developed a slight fever. i'm also reading elevated dopamine levels. the microbe may be affecting your limbic system.
i can't concentrate under these conditions.
i don't mean to be intrusive.
"the captain's been abducted, he may even be dead. my place is on the bridge."
"sub-commander, where are you going?"
open it.
you'll spread the infection.
i'll go to my quarters. if i seal off the ventilation system it should minimise the risk of exposing anyone.
your quarters are on c deck. by the time you reach them you'll contaminate half the ship.
unlock this door. i gave you a direct order.
"i'm sorry, but i can't obey it."
i can have you court-martialed.
i doubt that very
open it! i apologise. i'm having trouble suppressing my emotions.
"we'll know in a few hours whether the gel is working. until then, perhaps a mild sedative will help?"
the klingons are paying nine thousand darseks. that's more than enough to get tezra back.
you're not being realistic.
i already have the human in custody. the reward is guaranteed.
you've made this promise before.
in two days you'll see i'm telling the truth.
"even if you get the money, which i doubt, it wouldn't change my decision."
do you want to scrub plasma injectors the rest of your life? i'm giving you a chance to
who's tezra?
"tezra's not a person, it's a cargo ship. far more impressive than this antique."
you're going to use the reward to buy your ship back?
you'd be wise to keep quiet. the klingons pay me the same whether you're alive or dead. a vessel's approaching. i wouldn't get too optimistic. it's not your starship.
you have something i want.
"always one step behind me, eh, kago?"
drop out of warp and surrender the prisoner.
why would i do that?
don't force me to take action.
"goroth told you where i was, didn't he."
you had two months to find the human. goroth contacted me because you obviously weren't going to succeed. you're incompetent!
"if i was incompetent archer would be aboard your ship, wouldn't he?"
the human. now.
"or what, you'll destroy my shuttle? can't collect on archer if he's a cloud of vapour."
you may want to hold on to something.
let me out. i can help you.
you must think i'm a fool.
"you can't manoeuvre the ship and make repairs at the same time. i'm a pilot, let me take the helm."
if you try to escape.
"this is the warp field regulator, the impulse throttle."
navigation sensors.
there.
there's an l class planet in this system. i'm taking us out of warp.
what?
we can't outrun him but he may not be able to navigate as well as we can in the planet's atmosphere.
this ship wasn't designed for these manoeuvres. we've lost the aft cannons.
what about forward cannons?
still online.
what are these?
subspace beacons. they generate a false warp signature. i used one of them to evade your vessel.
get ready to launch them.
what good will that do?
"he's flying on sensors, just like we are. he'll only have a one in three chance of targeting us."
ready.
now.
we knocked out his engine. he's making an emergency landing.
don't celebrate yet. our reactor's leaking. the warp drive's offline. i'm never going to make the rendezvous.
isn't that a shame.
the reactor also powers life support.
then you'd better get to work.
it can only be accessed from the outer hull.
then we should set down here.
but kago's on the surface.
we'll land a thousand kilometres away.
what are you doing?
you said we'd need another treatment.
not for three hours.
is there any harm in starting now?
"i can apply it myself, thank you. perhaps you need another sedative."
rest is not what i need.
"sub-commander, this behaviour is hardly appropriate."
my name is t'pol. you don't find me attractive?
"of course i do, but that is not the issue."
i am familiar with denobulan sexuality. i know that your marriages aren't exclusive.
you and i are colleagues. it's against regulations.
starfleet regulations. there's no reason to be restrained by human morality.
it's obvious you're not well. please.
you have no idea what you're denying yourself.
your endorphin and hormonal levels are dangerously high.
you don't understand. i'm not ill.
these are hardly normal readings.
they're normal for a vulcan in my condition.
you know what's wrong with you?
it's not something we discuss with others.
i believe it's time for you to amend that policy. you have my assurance it will remain between us.
"we call it the pon farr, the cycle of mating."
have you gone through this before?
it's not time.
it's possible the infection acted as a catalyst.
"what caused it doesn't matter. if i don't mate with a male, vulcan or otherwise, i'll die."
"that ship you mentioned, the tezra, sounds pretty important to you."
"more than you know. if kago collects the reward he'll probably waste it on orion slave girls. not me, i'm going to do something useful with it."
i don't understand why you want a cargo ship. it doesn't seem practical in your line of work.
you think i've been chasing fugitives my entire life? once i get the money i'll have enough to pay off the impound fees. i'll be a freighter captain again.
my helmsman used to run freight. the two of you would probably have a lot to talk about.
"the tezra isn't like any other cargo ship. she was the first of her class, the fastest ever built. she could haul a million metric tons at warp four point five. even your starship isn't capable of that. i retrofitted her engines myself."
you never told me why it was impounded.
"my brother and i were hauling a shipment of fire-salt. i thought i could trim two or three days off our journey by cutting across the most insignificant corner of klingon space. i learned very quickly there's no thing as an insignificant corner of klingon space. we were lucky to escape with our lives, though we did pay a price."
they took your ship?
and it's cargo too. my brother never forgave me. i've been trying to find a way to get the tezra back every since. what are you doing!
did you really think i wanted this engine fixed? you're taking me to be executed.
"don't worry, we'll meet goroth on time."
feel any better?
i'm hungry.
our meals will be here soon.
i wasn't referring to food.
i'm working as quickly as i can. the serum should help alleviate most of your symptoms.
there's a far simpler treatment.
i'd prefer to explore a more conventional approach.
"you have the cure. it's unethical for you to withhold it, doctor."
this mating cycle of yours was artificially induced. we can't be certain that a physical encounter would help.
i'm willing to try.
sub-commander.
don't be frightened. i won't hurt you.
you're disturbing my serum! you obviously need to be sedated again.
no more hyposprays.
one of us should probably answer that. it could be news about the captain. this is phlox.
anyone hungry in there? i brought you some supper.
"just in the nick of time, commander.  it would be best if you remained here."
how are you two holding up?
well enough. have you been able to locate captain archer?
"we're tracking another warp signature, hoping this one is the real thing. are those the ones you wanted?"
"yes, thank you."
is that food?
yeah. i had chef make you some
is she all right?
she developed a slight fever. nothing to be concerned about.
bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
we're approaching the coordinates.
on my way.  call if you need anything.
what have you got?
"two matching warp signatures, both in the upper atmosphere. more subspace beacons. there is a ship on the surface. it seems to have suffered engine damage, but it's not tellarite."
biosigns?
one.
open a channel.
yes.
"sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a tellarite shuttle. have you seen one?"
how much did the klingons offer you?
"klingons? look, there must be some sort of misunderstanding here. we're looking for our captain."
your captain. he's got a price on his head. he's probably halfway to klingon space by now.
"travis, how close are we to klingon space?"
less than six light years.
if that tellarite's looking to collect some kind of reward we'd better find him before he gets there. set a course. take us back to warp.
"aye, sir."
what are you doing here?
i need your help.
you shouldn't have brought him.
you think i would have come here if i had a choice? i need an antimatter injector.
and i suppose you have no way of paying for it.
do you know who this is? he's the only prisoner who's ever escaped from rura penthe. the klingons are offering a fortune to get him back. tell him.  tell him!
"if i give you the injector, you have to promise never to come back here."
of course i'm coming back. you're going to be my first officer.
that was years ago. i work here now.
scrubbing plasma injectors? is that how you want your children to see you?
it's better than hunting criminals.
you think that i enjoy spending my time with vermin like him?
i have work to do.
"please, don't turn your back on me again. we can reclaim the tezra."
you won't want that ship after you see it.
why not?
"the klingons cannibalised her. every power relay, every conduit."
the engines?
"they're gone. i'll give you the injector, but after that i want you to leave."
what do you plan to do now?
get that injector and install it.
and then? i suppose you'll turn me over to the klingons. i'll be disembowelled with one of those nasty looking swords of theirs. you'll collect your nine thousand darseks but it won't get you the tezra back.
what are you trying to say?
"the klingons took your freighter, your livelihood, damaged your relationship with your brother, and what do you get in exchange? nine thousand darseks. doesn't seem like a very fair trade to me."
"what choice do i have? i told you, if i let you go they'd kill me."
maybe not. have you ever been aboard goroth's ship?
twice. why?
i beg your pardon?
let me out.
you know i can't do that.
the heat. it's unbearable.
"if i lower the temperature, the serum will start to congeal."
i don't want your serum. open the door.
"i assure you, you're going to feel much better in just a few minutes."
open it!
"this will only take a moment.  your biochemical imbalance is growing worse. if we don't treat it now, the damage to your limbic system could be irreversible. you said it yourself, t'pol, it could kill you."
stay away from me.
"one injection, that's all i ask. very well."
you're free to go. four two eight six four. that's the locking code. denobulan medical ethics prevent me from treating patients against their will. four two eight six four!
phlox to the bridge.
tucker here.
you may want to evacuate d deck.
"she's still in this section. the doctor says she's irrational, so use caution."
"yes, sir."
malcolm. i need your assistance.
"we've been very worried about you, sub-commander. let's get you back to the doctor."
i can't return to the doctor. he's refusing to treat me. how long has it been?
i beg your pardon
since you've mated. i've seen the way you look at me on the bridge.
why don't we discuss this in decon.
my quarters would be more comfortable.
doctor phlox was very insistent.
"follow me, sub-commander."
welcome.
the empire never forgets its enemies. taka!
what about my payment?
six thousand darseks.
we agreed to nine.
did we?
"that's blood money, skalaar. i hope you enjoy it."
"we're being hailed, commander. it's the tellarite ship."
what? put him through.
i've got them. bearing two two six mark seven one.
set a course. go to tactical alert.
"where do you think you can go, human? there isn't a planet within fifty light years."
he won't get far. drop out of warp.
should i charge weapons?
no. i want him alive.
i see him. eight hundred thousand kilometres.
what about the klingons?
they're closing in on him.
they're charging weapons.
return fire. deploy the grappler.
they're not making it easy.
malcolm?
"i'm doing the best i can, sir. their weapon ports are heavily shielded."
got it!
bring him in.
their weapons are down.
the pod?
"safe and sound, launch bay two."
let's get the hell out of here.
you'll be pleased to know the microbe's been eliminated from your system. your premature mating cycle has ended.
did i do anything inappropriate?
i've had patients treat me far worse.
did we?
denobulan males aren't comfortable discussing such topics.
i'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone.
i'd never violate a patient's privacy.
rough ride?
what's the status of the klingons?
we damaged their port nacelle. they're limping back to kronos.
where's t'pol?
she's in decon with doctor phlox.
what happened?
it's a long story.
"you're being hailed, captain."
i see you made it back safely.
do you think the klingons know you gave me that lock pick?
i don't see why they would.
what are you going to do with your reward?
i'm not sure. if you know of an old freighter for sale?
i'll keep my eyes open.
"be careful, captain. it's likely the klingons will double their bounty."
i hope you won't be the one to collect it.
no promises.
"twice, twice he's been captured, and twice he's escaped. our magistrate should never have shown him mercy. he should have been executed for his crimes."
"you had a simple mission, duras. locate the rebels that archer was harbouring and return them to the empire. but you failed. archer made a fool of you."
"we are offering you a chance to regain your command, and your honour."
i will not fail.
it must be something pretty serious.
what's going on?
the captain wants to talk to us.
about what?
he's speaking to admiral forrest. it's the third time in the last hour.
"well, something's obviously up."
i can't remember the last time he asked me to join the senior staff for a briefing.
maybe it has something to do with the
there's been an attack on earth.
"what do you mean, attack?"
a probe. they don't know where it came from. it fired a weapon that cut a swath four thousand kilometres long from florida to venezuela. there may have been a million casualties.
a million?
we've been recalled.
did they say why?
i didn't ask.
"it'll take a while to get back, sir."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"it's admiral forrest, sir."
"understood. set a course, travis. warp five."
come in.
"excuse me, captain."
trip.
"when you spoke to admiral forrest, did he say what part of florida was hit?"
"no, i'm sorry."
she may have been away. architects take a lot of trips.
older or younger?
my baby sister. when we were in school i made sure all the boys in her class got a good look at me. none of them ever messed with her.
maybe she was away.
anything you can tell me about what the admiral said?
the number of casualties has been revised. it's up to three million.
why would someone do this?
come in.
i spoke with ambassador soval.
and?
a vulcan transport located the pod in central asia. they retrieved it and brought it to starfleet headquarters.
what do they know?
"very little. there was a pilot, killed on impact."
who the hell was he? what species?
they don't know.
they say anything about what part of florida was hit?
no.
trip's sister lives in florida.  archer.
"captain, we've got suliban ships. eight of them, approaching at high warp."
just what we need. tactical alert.
hail them.
they're not responding.
try again.
the captain.
there's someone who needs to speak with you.
silik! i knew you'd have something to do with this.
do with what?
millions of people. you killed millions of people!
i'm afraid i don't know what you're talking about.
"that wouldn't be wise, captain."
what the hell am i doing here?
"there's someone who needs to speak with you. he has information you should find helpful. don't worry, you won't be harmed."
information about what?
something to do with your species. it's in great danger.
he can see you more clearly if you move closer.
who is he?
he wants to talk to you. it would be foolish to ignore him.
what do you want?
your planet was attacked.
i'm aware of that.
what you're not aware of is why. the probe was sent by the xindi. they learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years.
how would they know what's going to happen in four hundred years?
they were told by people from the future. people who can communicate through time.
are they the ones the suliban are working for?
the suliban work for me.
"so you're the one who tried to start a civil war in the klingon empire, the one who's manipulated my mission from day one."
"the people who have contacted the xindi belong to another faction. the probe was only a test. the xindi are building a far more powerful weapon. when it is completed, they will use it to destroy earth."
annihilate us before we can annihilate them. why are you telling me this?
"the xindi were not supposed to learn of their future. if they deploy this weapon, it will contaminate the timeline. you must not let that happen."
why should i believe you?
you have no choice but to believe me.
"if this time traveller is trying to protect humanity, why didn't he tell you all this before millions of people were killed?"
he didn't think we'd believe him. he's probably right.
i'm sure starfleet and the high command will find a far more logical explanation of who attacked earth.
"he may be telling the truth. if he is, i need your support, not your damn scepticism."
"captain, that's our sun."
a vessel's dropping out of warp.
where?
two hundred kilometres off port.
who are they?
they've fired some kind of
that one took out both forward phase cannons.
you still have torpedoes.
it's a klingon bird of prey.
"they want you, sir. they're saying they won't destroy enterprise if you surrender to them. archer's an enemy of the empire. he must be brought to justice if honour's to be regained."
duras.
both their nacelles are crippled.
weapons?
their cannons are down
cease firing. prepare a boarding party.
three ships approaching.
return fire!
shields are failing.
are they offline?
"no, sir."
then keep firing.
we've lost disruptor banks three and four.
withdraw! go to warp speed.
"it's captain ramirez, sir, on the intrepid."
what the hell was that all about?
a klingon named duras. he's not very fond of me.
"welcome home, captain. i wish it was under better circumstances."
i told command everything you said. they're having a hard time buying it.
do they have a better idea of who did this? and how about the vulcans? i suppose you think i'm hallucinating.
our science directorate has determined that time travel is impossible.
"are you willing to risk a second attack? all i'm asking is to take enterprise and find these xindi. what do we have to lose, a single starship. seems like a small price to pay if there's one chance in a million that he's right."
do you know where these co-ordinates he gave you are?
"at warp five, about a three month trip."
they're inside the delphic expanse.
what's that?
"a region of space nearly two thousand light years across. vulcan ships have entered it, but only a few have returned."
sounds like your talking about the bermuda triangle.
"there has been reports of fierce and dangerous species, unexplained anomalies. in some regions, even the laws of physics don't apply. twenty years ago, a klingon vessel emerged from the expanse. every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted, their bodies splayed open, and they were still alive. you'd be more than foolish to pursue this course of action."
"it's a risk i'm willing to take, and i imagine most of my crew would be with me."
this is typical of your impulsiveness. you'd be putting your crew's lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you were told were true.
"we've lost a lot of people already, jon. starfleet command would need some kind of proof before they let you go."
"i'm not sure the person i spoke to was from the future or not, but he knew this would be the reaction that i'd get, so he did give me proof."
jon?
"this is quantum dating the debris. take a look. the principal alloy in this piece was synthesised within the last four years. this one, about a year earlier."
"what exactly are you trying to show us, captain?"
twelve years for this piece.
"your point, jonathan."
i'm getting to it.
you might find this interesting.
your scanner's not working properly.
"why is that, sir?"
the quantum data reads minus four twenty.
what's wrong with that?
quantum dating always registers in positive numbers.
then i guess this ones not working either.
"you said he told you this faction from the future could only communicate through time, so how do you suggest they get this component to the xindi?"
"i haven't the slightest idea. but that doesn't change what's on these scanners. this fragment's from the future, unless you have another explanation."
a lack of another explanation doesn't make your assumption correct.
i'll speak with command.
i'd like to take a look in there.
are you suggesting this is a xindi?
i sure as hell would like to find out.
this is doctor fer'at.
i don't have a lot of time. what's up?
the vulcan research team detected traces of pyretic radiation in the alien debris.
why didn't starfleet catch it?
some of our technology is still more advanced then yours.
we're going to need to treat anyone who got close to the wreckage. doctor fer'at is here to determine the extent of your exposure.
"it shouldn't take long. please, have a seat."
have you experienced any nausea or dizziness?
no.
numbness in your extremities?
i feel fine.
i was told that you think a piece of the wreckage came from the future.
"i know, vulcan's don't believe in time travel."
"some of us do. tell me, this time traveller you met, was he humanoid?"
how do you know about that?
i was briefed before coming here.
"he seemed humanoid, but i couldn't see him that well."
have you encountered people from the future before?
a number of times. does this have anything to do with the radiation?
i was just curious. it must be very difficult to have so many people question your story. does it upset you?
doesn't help.
but how does it make you feel?
"i told you, it doesn't help."
i can sense some anger when you talk about this.
it's kind of strange that a vulcan would be so interested in my feelings.
"just curious, your exposure seems minimal. you'll require very little treatment. i imagine you must have felt very anxious after meeting someone from the future."
why would you imagine that?
i'm afraid this examination is over.
i'm nearly finished.
"you are finished, i just checked the vulcan database. there's only one doctor fer'at listed, and he's not a pathologist, he's a psychiatric analyst."
soval sure is persistent. what did he want you to do? come back with proof that i'm out of my mind?
you come to my sickbay under false pretenses. where are your medical ethics?!
i'm just doing what i was told to.
"well i'm telling you to get the hell off my ship. if you wouldn't mind, phlox, i'd like you to escort our guest to the airlock."
gladly.
jonathan.
"you're a sight for sore eyes, tommy."
good to see you.
slow tonight.
"people are staying home, ever since."
is she here?
over there. you are late.
thanks. bring me a scotch.
right away.
i'm really sorry.
i can't remember the last time you weren't late. did they bring you back because of what happened? for how long?
i wish it was longer. i was hoping to spend some time with you.
"do they know who did this, why they did this?"
"we know a little bit, but not enough. i'll probably be gone for a long time, becky."
"you've been gone for a long time before, and if i find out you've got a girl in every spaceport.  i suppose you expect me to invite you back to my apartment."
what are my chances?
you're in luck.
i'm so sorry.
the house was over there. less then a kilometre. see over there?
"that was the old movie theatre. when we were kids, if i didn't take my sister with me she'd scream like a banshee."
are you certain she was here when it happened?
someone would have heard from her if she wasn't.
come in. this is a nice surprise.
how'd it go with your folks?
i think i might need to brush up on my japanese.
i doubt it. we got the new upgrades for the universal translator.
that'll make life a whole lot easier.
it'll never replace a linguist with a magical ear.
not so magical.
"well, that's a matter of opinion."
languages of the sub-sahara. i'm surprised you're leaving that one here.
i haven't read it yet.
so why not take it with you?
"captain, i'm sending these books home to my mother. it'll give me more shelf space. there's been a lot written about alien languages since we've been gone."
and the clothes are going to?
my mother. thought it was time to upgrade my civvies.
i thought you were leaving.
why would you think that?
"i don't know. you're a teacher, an academic."
and that means i'm not capable of handling myself on the new mission?
that's not what i meant.
"i don't know what's inside this expanse, sir, but i think i've proven that i can handle myself in difficult situations and even provide a little help along the way. i assume you have no problem with my remaining on board."
i wouldn't have it any other way.
the nx-02.
she'll be ready to launch in fourteen months.
a long time.
hopefully you'll be back well before then.
hopefully. what kind of armaments will she have?
the same complement of weapons that you'll have once the retrofit is done. have you told your crew?
this morning.
how many are staying aboard?
"some haven't decided yet, but i don't think more then eight or nine will be leaving. i talked to general casey a few hours ago."
his team should be arriving at eighteen hundred hours. i was surprised you asked for them. you think you'll be comfortable with the military on board?
i don't have a problem with non-starfleet personnel. the general tell me these are the best he has. i'm going to need all the muscle i can get when we cross into the expanse.
you weren't told where in this expanse you were supposed to look.
not even a hint.
"this weapon they're building, did he say how long it was going to take them?"
i didn't think he would have warned us if we didn't have a chance of stopping them.
sub-commander. is there something i can do for you?
"are you confident with your decision, doctor?"
what decision would that be?
to remain on enterprise. crewman fuller just told me a shuttle's on its way with two hundred snow beetles.
they could be for my replacement.
there isn't a doctor in starfleet that would have the slightest idea what to do with them.
and what about you?
the high command has made it clear that they don't want me to enter the delphic expanse.
i'm much more interested in hearing what you want.
it's not my place to disobey the high command.
"nonsense. you've done it before. it's interesting. you and i, the only aliens on board this vessel. to go or to stay. for me, it was a simple question of loyalty towards the captain and the sad realisation that he'll need me more then ever on such a crucial mission. but for you it's a more difficult decision. does your allegiance lie with the high command or with captain archer?"
"this just arrived, doctor."
ah.
"thank you, doctor."
"photonic torpedoes. their range is over fifty times greater than our conventional torpedoes, and they have a variable yield. they can knock the comm. array off a shuttlepod without scratching the hull or they can put a three kilometre crater into an asteroid."
how long is it going to take to reconfigure the tubes?
"we've got three teams working on it. they promise me it'll be done before we leave spacedock, but i've got to start integrating them into the power grid."
let's go.
is there going to be some kind of service?
"for lizzie? if you're talking about a funeral, it's kind of pointless when there's nothing left."
i guess i was talking about a memorial.
my sister wasn't big on memorials.
i read there was a day of remembrance for all the victims a couple of months ago. i'm sorry you missed it.
why are you so obsessed with memorials?
i'm not obsessed.
she's dead. so are seven million others. she was no more important than any of them.
she was more important to you. there nothing wrong in admitting that.
"i'm getting real tired of you telling me what i can and can't do. and while we're at it, i don't need you to remind me that elizabeth was killed, so just let it alone. maybe you should pay more attention to upgrading your weapons, so you can blow the hell out of those bastards when we find them."
"with all due respects admiral, what is the point of me watching this. is it supposed to frighten me, make me change my mind about commanding this mission?"
it's important for you to see what you'll be facing. the vaankara was in the delphic expanse for less then two days when we received a distress call. this transmission arrived six hours later.
less then an hour later the vaankara was destroyed. there was no indication of a malfunction or an attack.
are you suggesting the crew was responsible?
i'm suggesting you reconsider this mission.
"is there anything else, sir?"
"i need to speak with you, t'pol."
"if all goes well you should be able to return to your duties on earth within a year. that is, if you're still interested. you haven't been back to vulcan for some time. you may find your assignment at the ministry of information refreshing."
i don't understand why i can't stay in san francisco.
you've spent far to much time with humans. it would be best if you returned home for a while.
you thought it was crucial to place a vulcan on enterprise during its first mission. why not now?
"you were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insisted on leaving before they were ready, but logic can't help them inside the delphic expanse."
can you be certain of that?
the high command was quite specific. you're to return to vulcan.
i believe that should be my decision.
this is not the matter of choice. defying the high command would mean immediate dismissal. you know that.
soval agreed to let us take her back to vulcan if it's all right with you.
it's not that far out of your way. how's that last refit team doing?
scheduled to be done by oh six hundred.
"i could tell you there are a lot of people counting on you, but i don't need to do that, do i?"
"no, sir."
"good luck, jon."
have they gone to warp?
not yet
charge weapons and prepare to bring them online.
it's bad enough one of us is up in the middle of the night.
"how's porthos holding up? if no people have returned from the delphic expanse, i doubt any dogs have."
he must be doing better then we are. he's fast asleep.
you picked a new science officer?
no.
"you're gonna miss her, aren't you."
"when they first assigned her, i felt like strangling soval."
she does kind of grow on you.
i would think you'd be the first one to show her to the airlock.
nah. to henry archer. i wonder what he would have thought if he knew his engine was gonna help save the human race.
"when i got this job, commanding the first warp five ship was about as big as a responsibility as i could imagined. then, we began running into so many bad guys, and i had to start thinking more about the safety of eighty three people."
and now the stakes have gotten a lot bigger.
"weight of the world, trip."
"literally. i can't wait to get in there, captain, and find the people who did this. and tell me we won't be tiptoeing around. none of that non-interference crap t'pol's always shoving down our throats. maybe its good thing she's leaving."
"we'll do what we have to do, trip. whatever it takes."
it's duras.
you've been wanting to test those new torpedoes.
what yield?
start low. we just want to get them off our backs.
what was that?
antimatter warheads.
increase shielding and target their weapon ports.
"they're still on our backs, sir."
bring the yield up. fifty percent.
i told you to target the weapons port!
their hull plating's been enhanced!
our warp drive is failing.
they're dropping to impulse.
"stand down weapons, sir?"
how long will it take them to repair their engines?
impossible to determine.
give me an educated guess.
"three hours, possibly more."
what's our speed?
"warp three, sir."
"go to four five. if we can make it to vulcan space before they get their engines back, they'll think twice about giving us any more trouble."
come in.
ensign mayweather says we're two days from vulcan.
"why don't you sit down?  just think, in two days you'll be eating real vulcan food."
chef's done an adequate job of approximating vulcan cuisine.
well you never did care for the way we smelled. at least you won't have to put up with that anymore.
i've gotten use to it.
how about all those emotions we bombard you with every day?
"i've grown accustomed to that as well, somewhat."
you're not making this easy. there's got to be something you're looking forward to back home.
i don't wish to return to vulcan.
what?
"i want to remain aboard enterprise, if you'll allow me to."
it's not a question of my allowing you. the high command would never agree to it.
i've decided to resign my commission.
"why? you've worked so hard, t'pol."
you're taking enterprise into a very dangerous place. this is no time for me to leave.
we'll be all right.
"you'll need a science officer, whether she's a member of the high command or not."
i've been thinking about who to promote.
"you need me, captain."
keeping away from those klingons isn't going to be easy as we thought.
sir?
"we're not going to vulcan. mister mayweather, set course for the delphic expanse."
"aye, sir."
distance?
nearly a million kilometres.
looks a hell of a hell of a lot closer than that.
a common mistake when viewing something of this size.
magnify.
not very helpful.
"it's not that dense all the way through, is it?"
"the vulcans said the expanse is surrounded by thick layers of thermobaric clouds. when their last ship went in, it took them almost six hours to get through it. anything on long range sensors?"
nothing beyond the perimeter.
"point two impulse, travis. let's head in."
anything?
nothing yet.
we've been in here for more then six hours.
let's be patient.
"we launched the communications buoy, sir. we got a test signal through to starfleet."
keep them apprised of our position.
"aye, sir."
got something?
yes.
probably the buoy.
not unless you launched three of them.
the targeting scanners won't lock on.
then get closer.
i thought you said the klingons wouldn't go into the expanse.
we're not in the expanse yet. hold your course. go to full impulse.
"i wouldn't recommend that, captain. the intake manifolds are having a tough enough time as it is."
"you heard me, travis."
"they're keeping up with us, sir."
we're being hailed.
put it up.
"surrender, or be destroyed."
go to hell.
"you're out-gunned, archer. come about and be prepared to be boarded. if you don't obey my orders i'll"
the perimeter clouds are dissipating. i'm detecting clear space ahead.
"that's why duras wants us to come about. he's afraid of the expanse. increase speed, travis."
the other ships are going to turn back.
cowards. we'll do it ourselves.
we're too close to the expanse!
"only one left ,sir."
keep firing.
the expanse is less than five minutes away.
maybe he'll turn around like his friends.
i won't bet on it. your new torpedoes aren't having the same effect as last time.
duras has transferred his aft shields forward. our weapons can't penetrate them.
"we just lost three antimatter injections, captain. any more and we're in big trouble."
"if he's transferred his shielding forward, what's protecting his stern?"
does it matter? he's chasing us.
what's protecting his stern?
minimal shielding.
think you can pull off an l4 at this speed?
"i can try, sir."
"then look for the densest cloud formation you can find. captain archer to all hands, hold on!"
captain.
looks good to me.
where are they?
fire.
"nice going, travis."
"i hope you don't ask me to do that too often, sir."
"the expanse is ahead, captain."
did you lose any more of those injectors?
"no, sir. we're good to go."
sure you still want to tag along?
it's only logical.
straight and steady. mister mayweather. let's see what's in there.
there's been an attack on earth. we've been recalled.
the probe was sent by the xindi. they learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years.
is there going to be some kind of service?
my sister wasn't big on memorials.
she was no more important than any of them.
she was more important to you. there's nothing wrong with admitting that.
are you suggesting this is a xindi?
i'd sure as hell like to find out.
you're to return to vulcan.
i believe that should be my decision.
"we received a distress call. every crewman had been anatomically inverted. their bodies splayed open, and they were still alive."
i want to remain aboard enterprise. i've decided to resign my commission.
do you think you'll be comfortable with military on board?
i don't have a problem with non-starfleet personnel. i'm going to need all the muscle i can get when we cross into the expanse.
"i can't wait to get in there, captain, to find the people who did this. and tell me we won't be tip-toeing around. none of that non-interference crap t'pol's always shoving down our throats."
"we'll do what we have to, trip."
it could simply be a coincidence.
you're being naive. their planet is fifty light years away. it is not a coincidence.
how do you know your contacts gave you accurate information?
it's the beginning of an invasion. hundreds of earth ships will follow.
they have no way of knowing that we launched the probe.
we must destroy the vessel.
how many humans are aboard?
it doesn't matter. they must be destroyed before they find the weapon.
when will it be ready?
the next series of tests is being prepared.
you will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests.
we must be patient. we must follow the plan that we all agreed to.
our future is at stake. this council mustn't be divided.
learn everything you can about this human vessel.
how long till we get there?
another three hours.
did the freighter captain say who we were supposed to contact?
the foreman of the north mine. he's expecting us.
what makes this captain so certain that the miner's is xindi?
he's not. he just said he thinks there was a xindi aboard a transport he took there a few years ago.
and it is safe to enter orbit? there are no security considerations?
he didn't mention any.
"with all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution. the freighter captain was of questionable character."
"where are we, malcolm?"
sir?
this room. what did it used to be?
"a storage bay, sir. conduit housings, i believe."
"but it got retrofitted. starfleet went to a lot of trouble to turn it into our new command centre. why is that, malcolm?"
"because of our mission, sir."
"to find the xindi, right?"
right.
"so this state of the art equipment was put in here to help us gather all the pieces of the puzzle, figure out who's trying to destroy earth."
right.
"six weeks. we've been in this expanse for six weeks. what data have we gathered? what pieces of the puzzle have we started to put together? not a single one. we don't have the luxury of being safe or cautious any more, and if the only lead we can find comes from a freighter captain of questionable character, then that's good enough for me. understood?"
understood.
is this seat taken?
ma'am.
i'm hoshi sato.
"we've familiarised ourselves with all the bridge officers, ensign. i'm major hayes, this is sergeant kemper, corporals romero and chang."
military assault command.
captain archer wanted the best.
you seem to have all gotten your space legs.
some of us are still visiting doctor phlox every morning.
the wonders of modern medicine.
"what do you think of our doctor, sergeant? i imagine you don't run into many denobulans in duluth, minnesota."
"actually, i'm stationed outside of atlanta. no denobulans, but we have our fair share of alien visitors. you must have gone pretty deep into our records. i haven't lived in duluth since junior high school."
"you may have left duluth, but you've still got plenty of duluth left in your inflections."
excuse me?
"ensign sato's a linguist, kemper. you give her enough time, she could probably tell you what street you grew up on."
"do you have any idea where we're headed, ensign?"
i'm sure captain archer will let us know when he has reason to.
"let's hope it's soon. the quicker you folks find these xindi, the quicker we can get to work. we have a briefing in a few minutes. if you'll excuse you."
just bay two?
yes sir. cargo bays one and three seem unaffected.
when did it start?
about ten minutes ago. ensign mcfarlane got pretty banged up but he's going to be okay.
you're sure it's not a problem with the grav-plating.
"trust me, captain. it's not the grav-plating."
"careful, sir. stay close to the door. they're scaring me."
you're right. it's not the grav-plating. any volatile material in those containers?
i would have known by now.
seal it off. let's hope this little anomaly doesn't last any longer than the others did.
"come, look at this. the pigmentation is far more colourful that i would have suspected."
what are we looking at?
"xindi epithelial cells, harvested from the corpse they found inside the crashed probe."
it looks more like scales.
precisely. when i'm finished constructing my physiometric profile i wouldn't be surprised to find he has reptilian characteristics.
you wanted to see me.
do you have any siblings?
no.
commander tucker had one sister. she was killed in the attack.
i'm aware of that.
he's having difficulty dealing with the loss.
it's to be expected.
"more specifically, it's affecting his sleep. i've been giving him sedatives, but i'd like to see him start tapering off."
i'm not sure i understand.
i believe the commander would be a fine candidate for vulcan neuro-pressure.
i doubt the commander would have the patience to sit in one place long enough to get through the first posture.
i'm certain with your delicate guidance
delicate is not a word i associate with mister tucker. the instruction of neuro-pressure is a very intimate act.
and he's suffered a very intimate loss. he needs your help.
have him come to my quarters.
"there's one little problem. assuming that you'd agree to my request, i suggested all of this to commander tucker earlier today, and he was less than enthusiastic."
i don't understand.
"perhaps if i could get him to go to your quarters, you might be able to convince him of the lasting benefits of vulcan neuro-pressure."
we should have worn ev suits.
the doctor said it was safe for short periods.
safe? you call this safe? i've been in
try not to breathe.
"yes, sir."
i'm captain archer of the starship enterprise. we've come to see your
this way.
archer.
i'm jonathan archer. this is lieutenant reed.
i've been told you might be able to make it worth my while if i were to arrange a certain introduction.
depends what you mean by worth your while.
"i've always had a fondness for platinum, specifically in its liquified state."
i'm afraid we don't carry precious metals on board.
pity.
i'm sure there's something else we could offer you.
"i don't make a habit of allowing people to interrupt my workers, xindi or otherwise."
what about the antimatter relays?
their linings are coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy. trip could probably strip them down and separate the metals.
how much platinum are we talking about?
"well, i'm a reasonable man. i'm sure you could part with, say, half a litre."
"i'd need to see this man, scan him, confirm that he's xindi."
that won't be necessary.
why would you do this?
unfortunate accident. i expect to see you back tomorrow.
good day.
"elizabeth! lizzie, you've got to get out of there!"
"elizabeth, please! get out of there!"
"a blood sample would have sufficed, some saliva."
is it xindi?
"yes, and no."
"i need something a little more concrete, doctor."
"the genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samples taken from the corpse found on earth. their base pair sequencing is far closer than, say, humans and chimpanzees. nearly identical, but not quite."
like humans and neanderthals?
"a reasonable analogy. after analysing the remains of the xindi corpse i was able to provide the computer with enough data to create this rendering. however, this humanoid is reptilian, that finger is not. it's covered with skin, not unlike yours or mine, but it's xindi all the same. i wish i could be more helpful, captain."
sir.
how's it coming?
"we're going to end up stripping more than two hundred relays to get half a litre of liquified platinum, but you'll have it by this afternoon."
let me know when it's ready. you okay?
i'm fine.
"i've got to have something stronger to help me sleep tonight, doc."
very well. come by at around twenty two hundred hours. i'll see what i can do.
thanks.
you're aware this stuff is volatile above thirty degrees celsius.
i'm familiar with the properties of liquid platinum.
i've insulated the outer container. it should keep everything pretty stable.
there's a little more than a half litre in here.
"what exactly do you want with our xindi friend? he's not very attractive, especially after his recent surgery."
i have something to discuss with him.
and what might that be?
i brought you what you asked for. now let me see the xindi.
his work group should be awake in about an hour's time.
it took six of my men half the night to extract this platinum. i think you could wake him an hour early.
is trellium-d the only thing you mine here?
the only thing. trellium-d.
i'm not familiar with it. what's it used for?
"insulation. mostly for interstellar vessels. what insulation does your ship use, captain?"
our outer hull is lined with duranium.
i imagine you must have a very large crew.
and why would you imagine that?
take your time.
do i have you to thank for this?
the foreman said it was an accident.
did he? what do you want.
you're xindi?
nine fingered xindi. what do you want?
where's your homeworld?
"you came all the way to this hideous planet, bribed the foreman to see me, for what? directions to my planet? i find that hard to believe."
we have important business with your people.
but you don't know where to find them.
"well, if you want information, you're going to have to help me escape from this place."
"what do you mean, escape?"
"do these look like volunteers? we're captives, slaves!"
"a simple set of coordinates, that's all i want. i'm prepared to pay you."
"the only payment i'm interested in is my freedom. if you can't provide me with that, stop wasting my time."
"i don't know what you're doing in this place and i don't particularly care, but we didn't come here to stage a prison break so why don't you just give us the co-ordinates and we'll all stop wasting each other's kind."
not until you get me off this planet.
"you know, i'm not sure why, but i'm just itching to kick the hell out of you."
"trip, take it easy.  archer here."
captain.
there are three warships approaching at warp. their hull alloys match the mining towers on the surface.
how long before they get here?
"two hours, sir."
go to tactical alert. we're heading back to the shuttlepod.
understood.
shuttlepod? you have a starship in orbit? you've made it so easy for them. usually they have to go out and find ships to replenish their labour force.  you flew right into their trap.
"archer to enterprise. enterprise, respond."
"you might consider waiting for your colleagues to rescue you, but it sounds like they're about to become quite busy. if you have a shuttlepod on the surface i can get you to it, but you'll have to take me with you."
there's an audio message coming in from the mine foreman.
this is enterprise.
i'm afraid your captain
"and his associate are going to be slightly delayed. we have three cargo vessels approaching, and we've had"
to begin de-ionising our landing decks.
how long a delay?
no more than an hour.
we've detected your cargo ships. they're heavily armed.
trellium-d is a highly
"valued substance, and i'm certain you've noticed that this is not one of the friendlier regions of space."
can i talk to captain archer?
not at the moment. he requested to speak to a miner who resides on level twenty two.
i spoke with him a few minutes ago.
the de-ionising process prevents us with communicating with the lower levels. i'll have him
contact you as soon as he returns.
keep trying to reach the captain.
something doesn't smell right.
i want you to come up with a plan to recover the captain and commander tucker. have it in place in one hour. get major hayes to help you.
sewage takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from a dozen different species.
"thirty one, to be exact. help me with this. there's a lever below your knees. pull it up."
plasma duct thirteen hasn't been used since i've been here.
why is there a hatch here?
there's one every eight levels.
what are you doing?
opening the emergency baffle up there. it's a steel plate that locks into place during maintenance cycles. follow me.
"looks a little close to the mine, but i suppose it'll be all right."
the ionised particles will cover our descent. it'll be all right.
have you heard from the captain?
not yet. the foreman isn't responding to our hails.
the ships?
less than an hour away. are you ready?
"they're armed to the teeth down there, but it is do-able. we only have one bone of contention. the major here thinks my security team is far to valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire. he wants to take his men."
"it's a simple matter of priorities. if those warships get here before we return from the surface, you could find yourselves dealing with a boarding party. you'd be in far better hands with a security force who knows enterprise inside and out."
i plan to have my men back on board with the captain and trip long before those ships arrive.
"with all due respect, sir, we can't be certain of that."
"the decision is yours, lieutenant, but i agree with major hayes. your team may not be back in time."
select six of your men and meet me in launch bay one. i'll be commanding the mission.
"very good, sir."
"coming from a military family, i've seen men like hayes all my life."
lieutenant?
that had nothing to do with who knows enterprise inside and out. it had to do with who the major thinks is more capable of carrying out this rescue.
"they're gone, all three of them."
that's impossible.
we've searched the entire cell perimeter.
post guards at their landing craft. if they get back to their starship i'll lose nearly a hundred new workers.
if this leads to the surface why didn't you use it before?
the residue in the atmosphere is at least thirty times more toxic than it is down here. this is the first time i've had the luxury of a ship waiting for me.
"the lower levels are hyper-saturated with ionised particles, so you'll have to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns."
we've got less than a half an hour to do it.
duct thirteen. they've opened two emergency baffles.
they're nearly to the surface. we should destroy their landing pod.
"no, too valuable. how long would it take to redirect the plasma flow into that conduit?"
i'll see to it.
"you've risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is, because you say you have important business with my people? which species? have you ever even met a xindi before today?"
"one, and he didn't look very much like you."
"not all of them do. there are five distinct species of xindi, and five distinct opinions on which one is dominant."
what was that?
that sounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened.
why would they open the rest? they'll just help us escape
i thought you said this duct isn't used anymore.
it isn't. they've obviously re-routed the plasma.
how far up to the next maintenance hatch? how far?
i don't know.
i think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one.
i think you're right.
that's where the plasma's coming from! we should go up.
suit yourself.
it's too late. we'll be killed.
shut up. just shut up.
"we're going to have to pick up the pace, gentleman."
wait a minute!
get out of my way.
what the hell?
you stupid son of a bitch. i ought to open this hatch and throw you down into
"they forced me to come with them. they said they'd kill me if i didn't. just now, this one, he tried to throw me into the plasma. said they didn't need me any more. thank you, thank you. if you hadn't been waiting here i don't know what i"
pick him up.
"i'd have preferred having you join your crewmembers as new additions to my workforce, but you've turned out to be more trouble than you're worth. select a detail. take them to the surface. shoot all three of them."
you okay?
"yes, sir."
nice shot.
"captain! it took a little doing, sir, but we got through the outer hatch."
where the hell do you think you're going?
you promised to take me away from here.
that was before your little performance back there.
"no, please, you have to help me!"
you had your chance.
the coordinates of my homeworld. if you want them you'll have to take me with you.
you're lying.
"no, i promise you."
reed to mayweather.
go ahead.
we've got them. lock onto my location and set down.
understood.
"fayette, go."
captain?
both shuttlepods have left the surface.
is everybody aboard?
everybody plus one.
the warships?
still at warp four. eta approximately seven minutes.
tell the pods to dock simultaneously. prepare to go to maximum warp.
come in.
"i'm terribly sorry, captain, but there was nothing i could do. i realise how important it would have been to have a xindi to help us."
"he wasn't a particularly helpful xindi, doctor."
"you'd be surprised. it was extremely difficult and painful for him to speak, but he managed to dictate this to me before he died. he said you'd know what it meant."
i'll be damned. they're the coordinates.
i must have been in the shower for two hours and i still had that crap in my hair and under my nails.
"we cleared bioscan, that's all that matters."
"yeah. the two new guys that got hurt, are they okay?"
the doctor's got them back in their quarters already.
"you've got to admit, their team did a pretty impressive job down there. nothing your guys couldn't have done just as well."
i'm not so sure about that. see you in the morning.
all right.
"how are you feeling, commander?"
tired. you said you'd give me something to sleep?
very well.
"if you wouldn't mind, commander. i promised t'pol i'd take these bioscans to her quarters, but i still have quite a bit of work to do here."
"no problem, doc. thanks."
sickbay to t'pol.
"yes, doctor."
"commander tucker is on his way to your quarters. he believes i just gave him a sedative, but it was only a placebo. he's had a rather difficult day. i believe you have your work cut out for you."
"sorry to drop by so late, but phlox said you were expecting this."
"thank you. please, sit down."
"i don't think i'd be very good company right now. anyway, i still have a few more showers to take before i get all this trellium-d off me."
would you like a cup of tea?
"thanks, but it might keep me up. the doctor just gave me a sedative."
you are having trouble sleeping as well.
i never would have pegged you for an insomniac.
i believe the expanse has been disrupting my rem patterns.
probably nothing a good hypospray couldn't cure.
vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create their own medicines.
so why are you still having trouble sleeping?
the neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult to reach. perhaps you could help me.
i don't really know if i can
three centimetres on either side of the fifth vertebrae.
you can apply considerable pressure.
i'm not sure which of these is
right there.
right here?
a little closer together. harder. harder.
if i push any harder i'll knock you over.
just like that. please continue. ahhh. that was far more effective than a hypospray.
glad to be of assistance.
"it would be only fair for me to return the favour. please, disrobe."
"i'm really flattered, sub-commander, and don't think under different circumstances i wouldn't jump at the chance"
are you implying i'm making sexual advances?
"no. no, no, no, not at all. i, i was just. you see, the doctor gave me this sedative and i think it's starting to work."
"the doctor injected you with a placebo. he sent you here because he wanted me to persuade you to try vulcan neuro-pressure. as i predicted, it was a pointless exercise."
why didn't he just ask me?
he did. you refused.
"oh, so this whole thing was just a set up."
the doctor knows how intransigent you can be.
intransigent!
unwilling to compromise.
"i know what it means, but it just so happens it's not true. i'm as willing to compromise as anyone else."
then take off your shirt.
"sir, we're approaching the coordinates."
tactical alert. stand by weapons. any indications that we're being scanned?
"no, sir. no vessels, no signs of technology, nothing."
how many inhabited planets?
"i'm not detecting any planets, inhabited or otherwise."
son of a bitch lied to us.
phlox said the xindi used his dying breath to give us these coordinates. why would he lie?
"sir, i'm picking up a debris field."
a ship?
it's a lot bigger than that.
put it up.
it's nearly eighty million kilometres long. it was a planet.
move us in closer.
how long ago did this happen?
"judging by the field dispersion, approximately one hundred and twenty years."
"i'm pretty sure there was a population here, captain. i'm picking up refined metals and traces of alloys. some of them match the hull of the xindi probe."
"they're building a weapon, planning to annihilate earth because they think we're going to destroy their world in four hundred years. how is that possible if their world doesn't exist anymore, hasn't existed for decades."
"we know the probe that attacked earth was built somewhere in this expanse, and it was built recently. it's logical to assume the new weapon is being developed at the same location."
"but, if it's not here"
prepare to go to warp four.
"what course, sir?"
deeper into the expanse.
long range sensors are showing increasing numbers of spatial distortions.
"you heard me, travis."
they scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago.
their heading?
toward the orassin distortion fields.
then it's unlikely they'll survive.
we can't assume that. i'm sending vessels to destroy them.
if they are the first wave of an invasion it would be best for us to remain hidden. let them keep searching.
he's correct. they won't find what they're looking for.
"finish the weapon quickly, or i'll destroy the earth ship whether this council approves or not."
come here.
what's the problem?
commander?
this can't be right. did you run a diagnostic?
twice.
let's check those relays.
captain to the bridge.
we're getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship.
the warp field's fluctuating.
bridge to engineering. report.
"i don't get it, captain. half the plasma relays have reversed polarity."
shut down the reactor.
"i'm trying, but it's not cooperating."
we're losing main power.
now.
"i've restored emergency power, but of our primary systems are still offline, including weapons."
"trip, what's your status?"
"we've got a hell of a mess down here, captain. it's going to be a while before i can even figure out what just happened."
keep me posted.
"sir, i'm picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port."
what's their heading?
"looks like they're holding position, or they could be adrift."
hail them.
our transceiver's offline.
what's our best speed?
one quarter impulse.
set a course.
biosigns?
"none, and there's no atmosphere aboard. artificial gravity's down as well."
any sign of what happened to them?
"no, sir."
"have you spent much time in gravity boots, corporal?"
i did a six week tour on jupiter station. the grav-plating went down a few times.
"only in simulation, sir."
"same here, captain."
this is an alien ship we're boarding. we could run into magnetic variances. watch your step.
"yes, sir."
we're looking for anything that could tell us what happened to them.
"and don't forget, just because sensors didn't pick up any biosigns doesn't mean you won't encounter anyone."
set weapons to stun.
aye sir.
weapons fire.
captain?  no external injuries.
let's find the bridge.
try to access that station. download what you can.
we counted seventeen bodies. most of them died when their life support ran out. the others were killed by particle weapons. what's our status?
"ensign sato managed to bring the transceiver online, but other than that."
archer to mayweather.
"go ahead, captain."
"resume our previous course, one quarter impulse."
understood.
it might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into the expanse. if we encounter any more anomalies
those people have been dead for less than two days. whoever attacked them could still be nearby. we'll have to make repairs on the move. mister reed recovered some data from their bridge. see what you can make of it.
let's try it again. watch that intermix ratio.
looking good. bring her up to forty percent.
shut it down. shut it down!
how's it coming?
"could be better. creating a stable warp field isn't easy when the laws of physics won't cooperate. the cochrane equation, it's not constant here. the problem's in the quantum variables. every time i try to compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack. either we get away from these anomalies or we're going to have to rewrite the book on warp theory, and i don't have to tell you how long it took zefram cochrane the first time around."
what about tactical systems?
weapons should be up and running within an hour or two.
make them your priority.
you worried about something?
"weapons, trip. as quickly as you can."
now where's isaac newton when you need him.
distance?
three thousand metres and closing.
they're charging weapons.
can you give me hull plating?
"i'm sorry, sir."
hail them.
two thousand metres.
hold your fire. are those warheads armed?
yeah.
stun grenade.
go! how many more?
"two in cargo bay one, four more in engineering."
get down there and help trip. corporal.
"woods, you're with me."
they're trying to download our database.
lock them out.
increase his anaprovaline by fifty milligrams.
how are they?
"stable. however, they've suffered extensive disruptor burns. i'd like to start them on regeneration therapy, but the imaging chamber was damaged in the attack. i'll need a repair team as soon as possible."
understood.
crewman fuller. i did everything i could.
what about him?
a few internal injuries. i'll need to keep him under observation.
you can observe him in the brig. see to it.
aye sir.
you might be interested to know that i recognise his species. he's osaarian.
he's not from the expanse?
not originally.
how bad is it?
"they made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasma rifles, two dozen stun grenades, chef says they cleaned out half of the food stores, cargo bay two's been stripped to the bulkheads, but that's not the worst of it. they took every one of our antimatter storage pods. all we've got left is what's in the main reactor."
"how long will that last, a month?"
tops. after that we're out of gas.
this is all you've got?
"high command hasn't had much contact with the osaarians. they have a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy."
any luck tracking their ship?
not yet. they've found a way to mask their ion trail.
"for a people with no history of piracy, they've gotten pretty good at it. keep looking."
it appears they've adapted their weapons and engines to compensate for the anomalies. pursuing them will be dangerous. we should consider other alternatives.
such as what? waiting for our antimatter to run dry?
i'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our supplies elsewhere.
keep looking.
open it.
doctor phlox said your injuries were minor. please get up.
why?
i have a dead crewman.
i didn't kill him.
"no, one of your friends did. but i don't have one of your friends, i have you, so get up and look at me.  thank you. you're going to help me find your ship, and after i've taken back what they stole from me, you and your colleagues are free to go."
"if you went anywhere near that ship you'd have more than one dead crewman. i can't help you. even if i could, my captain wouldnn't be very interested in having me back, would he. not after i told you where to find him."
"that's a risk you'll have to take, because the alternative is going to be a lot less pleasant."
i don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man. you and your crewmates are far too civilised for that. too moral.
i need what was stolen from me. there's too much at stake to let my morality get in the way.
"you're obviously new to this expanse. if you weren't, your ship's hull would be insulated with trellium-d. do you have any idea what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with trellium-d? what it can do to the people inside that ship?"
you masked your ion trail. how?
"well, my captain's a very clever man. he has to be. when you're forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have to be clever. you need to know how to hide."
so you were forced into piracy.
"when we entered this expanse we were no different than you. two merchant ships looking for trade routes. then the first distortion hit us. we decided to return home, but the perimeter, the thermobaric clouds, let you in but they don't let you out. one of our ships was destroyed trying. after a few more encounters with the anomalies it wasn't long before we became predators. this section of the expanse proved to be ideal for hunting. when a ship runs aground due to spatial distortions it becomes an easy target. our captain told us we wouldn't harm anyone, and we didn't. not at first. it takes time to learn to kill without remorse. you're not prepared to kill, or torture. not yet."
"i'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship, and if that ends up causing me remorse, then it's something i'm willing to live with. think about it."
"i've been studying the data recovered from the derelict. apparently, they decided to look for the osaarians as well. they found a way to modify their sensors to detect the ion trail. their life support failed before they had a chance to start."
did they leave a record of the modifications?
i've already given it to ensign mayweather.
what's our tactical situation.
hull plating's back online. we should have phase cannons within the hour.
torpedoes?
lieutenant reed is still having difficulty modifying the guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies.
i'll be in the armoury.
"black tea, hot. you finished rewriting the physics books?"
i don't think i'll be taking home a nobel prize anytime soon.
a few hours rest might do you a world of good.
no kidding.
you still can't sleep?
"t'pol's been trying to help, showing me how to stimulate my neural nodes. it's not what you think."
i wasn't thinking anything.
how are the weapons coming?
"the captain and i managed to bring the guidance systems online, but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. fuller knew those torpedo systems better than anyone. he won't be easy to replace. considering all the hostile aliens we've met, i suppose it's fortunate we haven't lost more people."
i doubt he'll be the last.
there's no reason to get cynical.
every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. we might as well paint a giant bulls-eye on the hull.
"what do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to earth?"
"all i'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds or not, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time."
the trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead.
any sign of a ship?
nothing.
t'pol?
curious. the trail resumes after another seventy thousand kilometres.
let's see it.
shall i alter course?
not yet. why would there be such a large gap?
their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds.
there would still be some residual particles.
"captain, the particle decay rates don't match. this one is at least nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago."
bring weapons online. take us to where the first trail ends.
travis?
i'm not reading anything.
power's fluctuating. forward plating's down.
microfractures are forming on the outer hull. we should come about.
keep going.
t'pol.
it's approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter.
ever seen anything like it?
no. it's constructed entirely of a single alloy.
who could build something that big?
take us in closer.
that cloaking field is enormous. whoever built this thing went to a great deal of trouble to conceal it.
"judging from those ion trails, the osaarians spent over eight hours here. i want to find out why. any luck scanning the interior?"
our sensors are being deflected.
see if you can find something that looks like a way in. take us into orbit.
"i'm detecting what appears to be a portal, twenty two degrees north of our current position."
put it up.
can you tell what the door's made of?
polyduranium. the same metal as the osaarian's hull.
can we fit through?
not with enterprise.
then get a pod ready.
we've cycled through the standard frequencies.
did you find the locking mechanism?
on the lower right side.
hold our position.
try it now.
"there's no indication of any ships, sir."
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
we're heading in.
understood.
there's enough energy running through here to power a dozen cities.
what's that down there?
those modules have a breathable atmosphere.
let's hope there's no one home.
"do you see that docking port, ensign?"
"yes, sir."
"we're all clear, sir."
"they've been busy. we've a lot of modules to search. fan out, keep open comm. links."
they're not going to run out of stem-bolts any time soon. this way. starfleet ration packs.
archer.
"i've found something, captain."
travis?
"over here, sir."
i'm pretty sure it's a cargo manifest.
how's your osaarian?
"not very good, sir."
download what you can. get it to hoshi. tell t'pol we're going to need another search team.
"aye, sir."
check behind those canisters.
look at this.
commander.
"i had a little accident, doc. i was reinstalling the deuterium injectors. one of them must have had a little juice left in it."
second degree burn. why don't you have a seat.
i could have sworn that injector was depolarised. i guess i'm getting a little punchy.
when's the last time you slept?
i got a full hour last night.
i'm surprised the neuro-pressure isn't helping. t'pol told me your first treatment went well.
"well, we only had the one session. haven't had a lot of free time lately."
are you certain that's the reason?
what do you mean?
vulcan neuro-pressure requires a certain degree of intimacy. i can understand that it might make you uncomfortable.
it doesn't make me uncomfortable. i just can't afford to spend an hour every night in t'pol's quarters. can you just give me another one of those injections? they put me out like a light.
they're not meant to be taken for extended periods. there is another treatment that might be helpful.
"all right, what have you got?"
aldebaran mud leeches.
what am i supposed to do with them?
"place one on your chest and one on your abdomen an hour before going to bed. their secretions act as a natural sedative. oh, please be careful to sleep on your back. if you roll over, you might anger them."
maybe an hour a night with t'pol isn't so bad.
the search teams have found nearly eighty percent of our antimatter. they're looking for the rest.
it's probably running through the reactor of that osaarian ship.
we've also recovered most of our weapons.
how's trip doing?
he'll have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes.
have the away teams speed it up. i want to go to warp as soon as they're back.
quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old.
what else?
the structure contains seven fusion reactors. each one is almost twelve kilometres long. only three are still operational.
any idea what they were designed for?
the sphere's emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. it may have something to do with the spatial anomalies.
take as many scans as you can.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"while i was translating the cargo manifest, something caught my eye. look at these markings. i had to double-check, but i was pretty sure that i had seen this ideography before. this is a piece of the xindi probe that crashed on earth. at least three of the symbols are an exact match."
your ship attacked a xindi vessel. i want to know everything you can tell me about them.
xindi?
you heard me.
i don't remember a species with that name.
you're lying. your manifest said you took their ship less than two weeks ago.
what manifest?
tell me what you know.
"it was a small ship, they were no match for us."
where are they now?
you destroyed them?
they resisted. we had no choice.
where did they come from?
i have better things to do than familiarise myself with our victims.
which species of xindi were they? what did they look like?
i don't remember.
are you sure?
"your threats aren't very convincing. i told you, you're too civilised."
we'll see about that.
sir!
as you were.
ensign.
are you taking me to your torture chamber?
shut up.
get in.
the xindi.
"this tactic doesn't suit you, captain."
this airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres per minute.
"you'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds you won't be able to. the xindi."
captain?
"everything's under control, lieutenant."
"the airlock's decompressing, sir. he'll die."
not for another twenty seconds he won't. the xindi.
sir.
your memory getting any better?  say again?
captain!
take him back to the brig.
let's go.
was he cooperative?
eventually. when they attacked the xindi ship they took more than fuel and supplies. they downloaded their database. how close would we have to get to tap into their main computer?
"pretty close. less than a kilometre, but we need to have the access codes."
he gave them to me. here.
they are heavily armed. are you sure it's wise to engage them?
i want that database. go to tactical alert. tell trip we're going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating.
their ion trail's already started to decay. they're going to be hard to find.
"we're going to wait for them to find us, travis."
something's passing through the cloaking field.
move us into position.  stand by. have they detected us?
not yet.
open a channel.
go ahead.
"this is captain archer. remember us? you probably noticed that our weapons are back online. you're outgunned, so stand down."
they're moving off.
"one kilometre, travis.  get ready."
hull plating's holding.
they're heading back into the cloaking field.
stay with them.
hoshi?
we're not close enough.
stand by.
another fifty metres. i'm into the computer.
anything?
i haven't found the xindi database. i'm losing them.
travis!
forward hull plating is offline.
"i've found it, captain."
how long do you need?
a few minutes.
"hull fracture on e deck, section fourteen. we're venting atmosphere."
emergency bulkheads.
they're getting too far away. i'm losing the comm. link again.
"our impulse drive's destabilising. we've got to get out of the cloaking field, sir."
head back to the sphere.
where are they?
still inside the field.
how much did you get?
about a third of it.
"take us closer to that portal. let's see if we can lure them back in here. use our forward phase cannon. fire a single burst, minimum yield."
travis?
no sign of them.
again.
that got their attention. they're coming through.
stay within a kilometre. return fire.
i'm back in.
can you take out their engines?
not without risking damage to their main computer.
ensign.
"i've got eighty percent, eighty five."
hull plating's offline. they're targeting our reactor.
i've got ninety percent.
good enough. mister reed.
their engines are down.
keep our weapons locked on them.
your codes worked.  get him out of there.
now that i've served my purpose you're taking me back to the airlock?
escort him to the launch bay. we're taking you back to the sphere.
"so you have let your morality get in the way after all. mercy is not a quality that will serve you well in the expanse, captain."
"computer, load the xindi database."
come in.
thanks for seeing me so late. you sure i'm not bothering you?
not at all.
georgia peaches. i picked up a crate when we were back on earth. chef's been keeping then in stasis for me. they're as fresh as the day they were picked.
thank you.
aren't you going to try one?
i don't usually eat this late.
come on. one bite?
this doesn't make up for the two sessions you cancelled.
"maybe you haven't noticed, but i've been a little busy lately. it's not like i didn't want to come back. after our last session i slept like a baby. first time in months. so, should i just"
please.
your shoes as well.
shoes?
there are many neural nodes in the soles of the feet.
hold on. you never said anything about feet.
is that a problem?
"well, for one thing, i haven't had a shower since this morning, and i know how sensitive that vulcan nose of your can be. and i'm a little ticklish. maybe more than a little."
i'll stop at the first sign of discomfort.
oh! your hands are ice cold.
long deep breaths.
"you sure this is safe? i mean, has anyone ever tried it on a human before?"
not to my knowledge. the risk of paralysis is minimal. breathe.
that's the spot.
t'pol.
it's the captain. i'd like you to join me in the command centre right away.
sorry if i woke you.
i wasn't asleep.
look at this.
another species of xindi?
"according to phlox, they probably evolved from some form of arboreal primate. i managed to piece together some of their starcharts. it took me half the night to figure out how they map co-ordinates, but i've been able to reconstruct the ship's course over the past few months. this is the last planet they visited before they were attacked by the marauders."
does it say what they were doing there?
"no, but it's only a day away."
we don't know if these xindi were involved with the ones who attacked earth.
we don't know they weren't. tell travis to set a course.
the ecosystem is prolific. there are several million chromophyllic plant species alone.
what about xindi?
"i'm not detecting any humanoid life, but it'll take several hours to search all the land masses."
"captain, i'm picking up a metallic signature at the northern end of those equatorial islands. it looks like a landing craft."
any bioscans?
none within a thirty kilometre radius.
now at thirteen kilometres.
there's a break in the canopy. it should be wide enough.
i see it.
sir.
"judging by the oxidation, this happened about two weeks ago."
right about the time the xindi were here.
it's definitely one of theirs. i recognise it from the database.  search the area. see what else you can find.  some of their databanks may still be intact.
captain. a body.
"it isn't xindi. at least, not one of the three species we're familiar with."
maybe it was one of the other two.
what about him?
the readings are the same.
this whole area's been scorched.
are you all right?
i never much care for the tropics.
keep looking.
lieutenant?
captain! t'pol to enterprise.
go ahead.
send a security team to the surface. we're being altered by some kind of
sub-commander?
stay back.
"captain, untie me. let me go."
thank you.
we have to get back to enterprise. enterprise?
"may i have that? the device, may i have it?"
this may help us understand each other. you're going to have to talk. talk. you need to talk.
"that's a vulcan biosign, i'm certain of it."
but these aren't human.
definitely not.
then where's the rest of our team? the only reason i don't have a search party down there right now is because you needed more time to analyse the data. now unless you can give me a damn good reason to wait around
"when t'pol called to the ship, she said something was happening to them."
she said they were being altered.
"it's possible she was speaking literally. something on the planet may have transformed them, physiologically."
you're saying these alien biosigns could be our people.
"from what we've seen of the expanse, it's a possibility we have to consider. the laws of biochemistry on this world may be just as unpredictable as the laws of physics."
"whoever they are, they're not staying put. they're heading due east of the landing site."
prep shuttlepod two.
"aye, sir."
i'd like a little more time to study these readings.
we'll use ev suits and biohazard protocols. have the decon chamber ready when we get back.
enterprise.
yes. it's your ship. you're the captain.
we don't have time for this. we have to find urquat. it's all that matters now.
urquat?
we have to keep looking. it's somewhere close.
why are you talking to her? she's trying to delay us. our people are there.
"they can help us, tell us what happened, why we can't remember."
"captain, that device. i can use it to call enterprise. you have a doctor on board. he can prove to you what i'm saying is true."
don't trust her. she's not one of us.
we don't know what she is.
urquat. you said we need to find urquat. we should keep searching.
it can't be far.
"no, thank you. i'm not hungry."
they're about three kilometres east of us. we don't have too many options for a landing site. hope you boys are up for a little walk.
it's a shuttlepod from enterprise. they won't hurt you. let me talk to them.
keep your weapons on stun. circle around.
chang!
captain! wait! don't you recognise him?
take lieutenant reed back to sickbay.
what about you?
i'm staying with them.
sub-commander!
he didn't even recognise me.
"don't be offended. in his current condition, i doubt he'd recognise any of us."
any idea what caused this?
"a mutagenic virus. his blood was swarming with them. it was apparently designed to re-write the dna of its host, to transform any humanoid it infected into another species."
why did it have so little effect on t'pol?
"vulcan k-cells. they seem to neutralise the pathogen. i've been synthesising an anti-virus using t'pol's genetic profile, but i'm going to need an active sample of her dna to complete it. we need to get her back to the ship as soon as possible."
i'm doing my best.
bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
"two ships just dropped out of warp, sir. they're on an intercept course."
they're hailing us.
open a channel.
your ship is in restricted space.
"sorry, it wasn't very well marked."
our scans indicate that one of the people on your ship has been infected with a dangerous virus.
we're aware of that. is there anything you can tell us about
your vessel's under quarantine. prepare to be boarded.
no one's coming aboard unless i say so.
the infected organism must be eradicated before the virus can spread.
that infected organism is a member of my crew.
does he still look like one of your crew? does he recognise you or even speak your language anymore? we've been studying the mutagen for sixty years. the only course of action is to neutralise the outbreak.
there isn't any outbreak. lieutenant reed is in medical isolation.
we won't allow your vessel to leave orbit with the contagion aboard.
"look, we've only been dealing with this virus for one day, so forgive me if i don't take your word for it that the only option is to neutralise our tactical officer. you want to come over to discuss the situation, fine, but if you try to force your way onto this ship you're going to have one hell of a fight on your hands."
how long was i asleep?
only for a few minutes.
"i saw it. in my dream, i was there."
urquat?
our city.
there are no cities on this planet.
you're wrong. it's below the surface.
tell me. what was it like?
"it was filled with thousands of loque'eque, waiting for us."
your home is a planet called earth. the people there are waiting for you. you're on a mission to save them.
urquat's my home. when we get there you'll understand. wait and see. we've rested long enough.
the decon chamber's sealed. i assure you there's no danger.
you wouldn't be so confident if you knew how easily this virus can spread. it infected tens of millions of people on my world. they all had to be destroyed.
destroyed?
the virus would have transformed our entire population within weeks.
where did it come from?
"it was engineered by the inhabitants of this planet, a race called the loque'eque. something decimated their species centuries ago and they lost the ability to reproduce, so they created this virus to transform other species into their own. it was the only way to save themselves from extinction."
"ingenious, but why didn't they programme the virus to stop replicating once their population was replenished?"
we've been trying to answer that question for a long time.
why's he so eager to get back to a place called urquat?
"the mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct to return to their home city, urquat. that's why we can't allow even a single infected organism to leave this planet. they can spread the contagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would be drawn back here. we can't risk another epidemic.  yes."
we've detected three more infected organisms on the surface.
prepare a containment team. more of your crewmen?
"one of them has an immunity to the virus. if i could have access to some of your research, perhaps we could work together."
"we will find these people and examine them. if there's anything to report, we'll let you know."
i'd prefer to have doctor phlox examine them.
"what you prefer doesn't matter. i'm under orders to contain this outbreak. if you attempt to interfere, i'm authorised to use any force necessary.  take me back to the airlock."
"if i don't complete the antivirus within the next two hours, it'll be too late. there won't be enough of their original genome left to resequence."
"we can't launch a shuttlepod, they'd detect it. do you think t'pol's contagious?"
most likely.
that rules out the transporter. she'd infect the entire crew.
"whatever you do, commander, do it quickly. i need that dna sample."
be right back.
bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
"one of those ships just launched a shuttle, sir. it's heading towards the surface."
keep an eye on them.
"it isn't far now. the passage was here, in my dream. help me."
you said they'd be waiting for us.
"i saw it so clearly. there was a fountain there, and gardens up there, floating. and there were people, thousands of people."
come back to enterprise. we'll help you find out what happened to your city.
"no, no. we're not leaving. this is our home. home, home."
look around. these ruins are ancient. no one has lived here for a very long time.
what about this?  this body isn't ancient. someone killed them. why? who would do this? your people?
no.
then who?
"i don't know, but if we go to enterprise we can try to find out."
i don't belong on enterprise. i belong here.
someone's coming.
more of your humans?
"i don't think so. we're not safe here. come, we must go. come, we must go."
we've found them.
"take the vulcan woman, then destroy the others."
understood.
who are they?
i don't know.
"you destroyed my city, killed my people."
captain! we have to get to the surface.
this way.
lower your weapon and move away. you won't be harmed.
"i said, move away."
you all right?
you said you'd never use the transporter again.
"believe me, i wish i'd had a choice. there are more of them in orbit. we'd better get back to the shuttlepod before they realise anything's wrong."
"captain, you can't stay here. you'll be safe on enterprise."
it's commander tucker.
"put him through. go ahead, sir."
"we're docking, travis. tell phlox to stand by in decon. go to warp four as soon as we're in."
understood.
report.
they're in pursuit. two thousand kilometres and closing.
try to stay ahead of them. stand by weapons.
they're hailing us.
don't respond. hold your course.
nine hundred kilometres.
they're charging weapons.
seven hundred.
full power to aft hull plating.
hull plating's down to forty percent.
we're being hailed again.
drop out of warp.
"look, we both want the same thing. a cure for this virus, right? our doctor thinks he's found one, but he needs a little more time"
"i won't warn you again, commander. we're going to contain this outbreak whether you co-operate or not."
why are you firing at my ship?
there are three infected people on board. we won't allow you to leave this system.
"this is captain archer and ensign sato. they're the people you nearly incinerated on that planet. as you can see, they're responding quite well to the antivirus i synthesised."
that's not possible.
run scans. see for yourself.
"like i said, he just needed a little more time. i'm sure we'd be happy to share the antivirus with you, but that'll be impossible if you destroy our ship."
this should help with the headaches.
have you got anything for my stomach? the chef's food isn't sitting too well.
"till your digestive tract is fully restored, you may want to avoid the mess hall."
what do you suggest i eat?
you're welcome to some of the moth larvae i feed to my pyrithian bat.
"how are you feeling, lieutenant?"
"not bad, sir. how about yourself?"
getting there. hoshi and t'pol are going to take the day off. you might want to do the same.
"thank you, captain. i could use a little rest."
you wanted to see me?
this is the last of the mutagenic virus. i assume you want me to destroy it.
no.
"captain, you experienced first-hand what this pathogen can do."
"those containment patrols aren't going to stop until they've wiped out every trace of it. now that they have your antivirus, they'll most likely figure out a way to succeed."
"considering the alternatives, that would be best."
"this was created as a final effort to preserve a civilisation, a people. that species we became, they cease to exist the moment this virus is gone."
captain.
"we came out here to stop the xindi destroying humanity. i'll be damned if i'm going to have a hand in destroying another race in the process. put it on ice, doc, in stasis, whatever. understood?"
how much of the lab was destroyed?
nearly all of it. three of my researchers were killed.
"and what of your work, degra?"
i haven't been able to assess how much data was lost. this will obviously delay us.
how long?
months perhaps. i'm not certain.
the humans have been through our space!
they attacked a trellium mine. we cannot wait any longer.
"think what you're asking me to do. build a weapon to destroy an entire world. do you understand how difficult, how dangerous this project is?"
are you saying you're not up to the task?
dissension will solve nothing. we knew there could be setbacks.
i agree. we are too far along to change our plan.
"besides, we have no alternative."
you know that isn't true.
that option has been discussed and rejected.
not by all of us.
perhaps it is time to reconsider our colleagues' proposal.
we do not have enough information about the humans!
that can be remedied.
it's too dangerous.
i agree. degra deserves more time.
"but if we do not see some progress soon, we'll have no choice but to consider all our options."
is that sufficient pressure?
"you could go a little harder. mmm, perfect. try that neck thing. what'd you call it?"
the khavorta posture?
"yeah, that one."
are you certain?
"don't worry, i've been practicing my breathing."
you have been practicing.
t'pol.
"don't speak. relax your jaw. excellent. now, the surah'than."
"you know, i really need to talk to you about something."
is there a problem?
"no. no, no, i mean, this feels great, and i really appreciate you taking the time. it's just, i'm not sure we should be doing it anymore."
you said this was helping you sleep.
it has.
then why do you want to stop?
people are talking. about us. about me coming to your quarters at night. they think there's more going on than neuro-pressure.
and that disturbs you.
"it shouldn't, i know, but malcolm and i were purging a clogged injector assembly only last week and he asked me why i didn't just massage it with my magic fingers."
i see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip.
it doesn't bother you?
"we're both senior officers. if we were pursuing a romantic relationship it wouldn't be lieutenant reed's concern, would it?"
i suppose not.
shall we continue?
you've been scratching again.
the itching kept me up all night.
have you been using the ointment i gave you?
"i tried, but the smell is a little strong."
"the more you scratch, the longer it will take to heal. i understand you may have found a source of trellium-d?"
a v'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he knows a way to synthesis it.
i hope he's correct. crewman cutler broke her arm when one of those spatial anomalies went through the exo-biology lab. the sooner the ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier i will be.
"we're working on it, doctor."
of course.
have you had any other symptoms?
just dreams. i keep seeing myself back at that alien city.
you were transformed into a different species. don't expect to recover overnight.
the chemist said his shop was on barge twelve.
phlox would have a field day here.
i'm afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for another time.
i don't recognise your species. you must be newcomers. welcome.
"thank you. we're looking for barge twelve, a chemist named b'rat ud."
it would be a shame if i let you leave our world without introducing you to the local wildlife.
that's not necessary.
"zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh is quite succulent when prepared properly."
"no, thank you. can you direct us to the chemist?"
barge twelve is that way. tier two.
i'm closed.
i have an appointment. we met at the deuterium station on norellus.
you'll have to come back later.
you said you could sell us the formula to synthesise trellium-d. i hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing.
captain archer? i remember now. how are you?
a little pressed for time.
"of course. trellium-a is extremely common, easy to synthesise, but trellium-d is rare, difficult to process."
and expensive?
"i'm confident we can agree on a fair price. i was thinking about you recently, captain. you were very eager to learn about the xindi, as i recall. what is your interest in them?"
we're on a diplomatic mission.
a diplomatic mission. some xindi arrived here last week. i thought you might be interested.
where can we find them?
they had business with another merchant.
who?
"i'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee."
"commander tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd be willing to barter. as a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell me where we can find this merchant, then you and mister tucker can work out the details."
i'm confident we can agree on a fair price.
do you like what you see?
"to answer your first question, i regret i cannot offer free samples."
b'rat ud said you might be able to help us.
i always welcome referrals. what is your pleasure?
we were told you've recently done business with some xindi.
"excellent customers. they purchased two u'tani serpent women. i'm afraid i don't have any more, but perhaps i could interest you in a nuvian concubine? she's quite skilled."
we're not interested. i want to know where we can find these xindi.
i believe they left orbit two days ago.
where were they heading?
"i wouldn't stay in business very long if i revealed confidential information about my clients, but i have females here from many worlds. who knows, perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about the xindi."
"you have an excellent eye, my friend. she can be very accommodating."
archer.
"captain, b'rat and i have agreed on a price. i'll need to go back to the ship for his payment."
understood. we'll meet you back at the shuttlepod.
how can you walk away from such beauty?
thanks for your time.
"after an hour in this place, i can't wait to get back to decon."
stop her!
"take me with you, please."
she seems determined to be sold today. let's go back to my shop and arrange for payment.
i don't think so.
then i'll take my merchandise.
looks like she doesn't want to go with you.
"if you're so concerned about what she wants, buy her. otherwise, stay out of this."
let's get out of here!
gladly.
you have the most intriguing eyes. i've never seen a retinal structure this complex.
how's our guest?
"i'm not familiar with her species, but she appears to be in perfect health."
i'm afraid i don't even know your name.
"i'm called rajiin. i'm very grateful for what you've done, captain. i'll serve you well, i promise."
let's get something straight. we don't believe one person can own another person. you're free to go wherever you'd like. how far is your home world?
"i don't know. i'm told it's called oran'taku, but i don't remember it."
do you have any family?
i've had many owners.
"we have some data on this region of space. i'll see if i can locate oran'taku. if it's possible, we'll take you there.  set her up in quarters, get her whatever she needs."
of course.
captain? thank you.
"on our planet, wars were fought over these. careful."
what's this one called?
"black pepper. there's paprika, mustard seed. i'm partial to the cayenne myself. i'm sure you'll find these all very exotic."
i believe you have something for us?
of course. i've reviewed your engineering specifications. you appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-d.
liquid?
trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. it's just as effective as the natural ore.
then all we need is the recipe.
there is one thing. be sure to follow the protocols precisely.
or?
"let's just say that in it's liquid form, trellium-d is extremely unstable."
how are your accommodations?
"much better than i'm used to. the last ship i was on, i never left the cargo hold. except for a few visits to the captain's quarters."
"there are some restricted areas on enterprise, otherwise feel free to look around."
your crew won't mind?
i seriously doubt it.
are they all from earth?
"nearly all. you've met doctor phlox, he's from denobula. my first officer's a vulcan."
doctor phlox mentioned you were on an important mission.
we're trying to make contact with a species called xindi. i don't suppose you know anything about them?
"very little. the two i saw looked reptilian, and they weren't very pleasant. at the time, i was just relieved they weren't interested in me. why are you looking for them?"
we're hoping to resolve a disagreement.
tucker to captain archer.
archer.
"we're in business, sir."
i'll be right there. excuse me.
how unstable?
enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up.
and we're supposed to insulate the entire ship with it?
"it's only volatile in it's liquid form. once we apply it to the inner hull and it sets, it's completely safe. the tricky part's cooking it up in the first place."
it'll require extremely precise calculations but i believe mister tucker and i can synthesise the compound safely.
get started.
"i recommend we set up a lab on e deck, within the emergency bulkheads, as a precaution."
come in.
"good evening, captain."
is everything all right?
i'm sorry to disturb you. i hoped you might have time to talk.
"er, i'm not quite, er. please. i meant to speak with you earlier. we have some good news. t'pol was able to locate your home planet in a database we acquired. it's only two days away. you don't seem very pleased."
"i was taken away when i was very young. i don't remember much about it, and i doubt anyone there would remember me."
you never know. you seem very memorable to me.
"i'm very grateful for what you've done, captain. i want to repay you for your kindness."
that isn't necessary.
i know.
"rajiin, you"
there's a reason i was taken from my home. i have certain gifts. would you like me to show you?
that really isn't something that i
it's all right.
"captain, is something wrong?"
no.
"well, i just wanted to say thank you again."
we'll be leaving orbit soon.
good night.
good night.
what's the molecular pressure?
up to eleven hundred units.
"boy, this stuff is tricky. decrease the theta bombardment by six, no, seven percent."
the pressure's still rising. fourteen hundred units. fourteen thirty.
damn it. kill the theta radiation altogether.
no effect. we should seal off this section and leave.
a sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick.
it might not. we should evacuate.
i'm going to ramp the delta at eighty percent.
it's not working.
you're welcome to leave.
the pressure is up to two thousand units. commander!
some of our calculations may have been slightly off.
we're back to square one.
we've been working for six hours. i suggest we take a break.
i can't argue with that.
come to my quarters in half an hour. we'll resume your neuro-pressure regimen.
i'll be fine.
i prefer you are rested before we make another attempt.
can i help you?
the captain said it was all right if i left my quarters. i'm rajiin.
i know. news travels fast on a starship. i'm ensign hoshi sato.
it's a pleasure to meet you. i was looking for the mess hall.
i just happen to be going that way.
what's your job here?
i'm the ship's communications officer.
i see.
i'd love to hear your language.
"actually, i speak quite a few."
you must be t'pol. i didn't mean to startle you. my name's rajiin.
i know who you are. what are you doing here?
your door was unlocked.
that's not likely.
i was hoping we'd have a chance to talk.
"perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols, but it is unacceptable for you to be in my quarters uninvited."
i didn't think you'd mind.
i'm afraid
"you're vulcan, on a ship filled with humans. why?"
vulcans and humans are allies. now please leave. what are you doing?
don't resist.
i need you to leave.
you have a disciplined mind. you're in such control of your emotions. try to let go. better.
stop.
let go.
no!
tucker to the bridge.
go ahead.
could you tell me where t'pol is?
"she's in her quarters, sir."
tucker to security.
i need assistance.
were you successful?
i have what you want. i can use their transporter device but you'll need to be within ten thousand kilometres.
signal us when you're ready.
is there something wrong?
the captain would like to see you.
there's no need to bother the captain.
i have my orders.
so do i.
are you in range? respond.
leaving so soon?
we jammed your signal. your friends can't hear you. who are they? take her to the brig.
you should let me run a neural scan.
i'll be fine. what happened to her?
"i can't even begin to speculate. she's suffered disruptions throughout her neocortex. if she were human, or denobulan for that matter, she'd probably be dead. but vulcan neurophysiology is a great deal more resilient than ours."
i want to talk to her.
i have to finish treating her injuries first.
how long?
a few hours.
have phlox take a look at your head.
who were you trying to contact?
i'm sorry.
i asked you a question.
i can't answer it.
what did you do to t'pol?
she shouldn't have resisted.
who are you?
i told you. my name is rajiin.
"that's right. kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life of slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape when i was at that market. the chemist knew i was looking for information about the xindi. is that why you showed up so conveniently?"
the only thing i can tell you is that you're in danger.
care to be a little more specific?
"if i say anything else, they'll kill me."
"who, the xindi? how do you know i won't do the same?"
"it's true that i deceived you, but that didn't make your decision to help me any less admirable. i don't want to see you harmed, captain. the best thing for you to do is let me go."
tell me who you contacted. who!
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"two vessels are approaching from aft. sir,"
the biosigns match the genetic profile of the xindi pilot who attacked earth.
"hull plating to full power, stand by weapons. the reptilian species. they're the ones who sent you."
i had no choice.
we're dropping out of warp.
i assume they're here for you.
they won't harm anyone if you let me go.
"forgive me if i don't take your word on that, but they murdered seven million people on my planet!"
bridge to the captain.
go ahead.
the smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port.
seal that airlock and post security teams. i'm on my way.
what was your mission?
they wanted information.
about what?
about you. they're building a weapon.
we know that.
this is different. a bio-weapon.
go on.
they need data about your species before they can begin.
where are they building the weapon?
i don't know.
when will it be ready?
i don't know. they didn't tell me anything else.
get a security detail down here. no one's taking her anywhere.
fall back!
"three boarding parties, at least five men each."
they're heading for the brig. try to cut them off.  you're with me.
archer to the bridge.
go ahead.
don't let those ships get away. lay in a pursuit course.
aye sir.
"he's dead, sir."
captain
those ships just entered some kind of vortex. they're gone.
this gland released a fatal dose of neuro-toxin into his bloodstream.
what kind of species is born with a suicide gland?
"not this one. he was surgically enhanced, if you can call it an enhancement."
"i want a complete autopsy, doctor, and have malcolm take this weapon apart. i want to find out it's range, power output and how we can defend against it."
aye sir.
are you okay?
yes.
"good, because i want an analysis of the scans we took of those xindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they went through. i don't want them dropping in unannounced again. dismissed."
you put all of our work at risk.
and exposed us to the humans. allowed one of your soldiers to be captured.
he wasn't taken alive.
you agreed to give me more time. you don't have enough data to construct the bio-weapon.
don't we? bring her!
show them. show them!
we couldn't pursue the bio-weapon because we didn't have enough information about the humans. now we do.
we must proceed on both fronts.
do you expect us to reward you for this act of insubordination? this has left us more vulnerable that we were before.
there's more to these humans than you can learn from a set of biometric scans.
that's enough! take her.
she's coming to!
let me go. let me go!
stop.
i'll kill you.
we're not going to hurt you.
you liar! no! get away from me.
the damage is more severe than i expected.
can you reverse it?
i'm not certain. t'pol
what's he doing?
it's all right. he's trying to help you.
he's trying to kill me! you killed the others. murderers! get away!
i talked with chef at dinner. he's a little worried about the crew. people are skipping meals. he figures they're either too busy or the stress of this mission is starting to get to them.
i haven't had much of an appetite myself.
movie night's been on hold since we entered the expanse. maybe we should start it up again?
there'll be plenty of time for movies after we've dealt with the xindi.
"no one hates the xindi more than i do, captain, but i'm telling you this crew needs a little r and r. unless you want phlox to start medicating people, we gotta, we've gotta find a way to boost morale."
what did you have in mind?
i was thinking about a comedy. one of the classic hope and crosby pictures.
good choice.
captain.
we've been reviewing some of these xindi star charts. trip thought they might be able to help us figure out if there are any more spatial anomalies in the region.
i would have helped you do that.
"it's late. i didn't want to get you out of bed. besides, our resident insomniac was looking for something to do."
you have plans tuesday night?
not at the moment.
"mess hall, nineteen hundred hours."
movie night?
back by popular demand.
: bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"i'm picking up an automated distress call, sir. it's vulcan."
have you tried hailing them?
several times.
i'm on my way.
where are they?
"three point two light years, bearing oh one six mark twelve."
i recognise the transponder frequency. it's the seleya. they entered the expanse nine months ago.
keep hailing them. set a course.
the asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion. their paths are unpredictable. it may be the result of some spatial anomalies.
where's the vulcan ship?
approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead.
i can guess why they were interested in this field. the asteroids are loaded with trellium ore.
it looks a little too crowded in there for enterprise. wake up mister reed. tell him to meet us in the launch bay.
"aye, sir."
try to get your hands on some of that ore. t'pol.
"starboard bow, three hundred forty metres."
i see it.
"no damage, though we may need a fresh coat of paint."
how much farther?
twelve hundred kilometres. i could take the helm if you'd like.
maybe on the way back. so what else do you know about the seleya?
a great deal. i served on it for over a year. it was my last assignment before joining the consulate on earth. i was the deputy science officer under captain voris.
any idea what they were doing in the expanse?
they were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter. after several days they reported that they'd become caught in some kind of subspace eddy and were being pulled into the expanse. it was their final transmission. the vankaara was sent to find them. you already know what happened to that crew.
let's hope the seleya fared a little better.
"directly ahead, two hundred metres."
hang on.
good isotope density. we should get at least half a kilo out of this one.
let's try for something bigger this time. how about this one.
i've got a lock.
travis?
there's an overload in the resequencer.
shut it down.
i can't.
this thing's useless. the coils are fused.
what if i could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones.
they're pretty unpredictable. you sure you could land safely?
i can try.
this'll be a new one for the maintenance crew.
main power's offline. their hull's taken quite a beating.
life support?
minimal. decks twelve and thirteen have decompressed.
i'm reading multiple biosigns.
"this is captain archer of the starship enterprise. please respond. seleya, come in."
the starboard docking port is still intact.
captain. they were lining this bulkhead with trellium. they didn't get very far.
i'm reading biosigns on this deck. i can't isolate them.
take starboard.
vulcan blood.
one biosign.
you all right? t'pol?
i'm fine.
his synaptic pathways have been severely damaged.
let's get him in the pod.
captain!
keep back!
archer to reed.
go ahead sir.
have you come across anyone?
not yet.
watch yourself. something's happened to them. they've become violent.
"aye, sir."
"lieutenant, you okay?"
what happened to them?
"seven more, that direction, thirty metres."
captain.
let's get out of here.
what are you doing?
stun isn't working. we should set our weapons to kill.
these are vulcan officers and we're on a rescue mission.
"with respect ma'am, they don't seem to want our help."
you heard me!
keep your weapons on stun.
"yes, sir."
"captain, over here."
what are they doing?
we're from the starfleet ship enterprise. do you understand me?
is there another way to the airlock?
no.
that way.
go. go on.
archer to enterprise. enterprise respond.
if their comm. system's intact we may be able to contact enterprise from the bridge.
where is it?
seven decks above us.
seven. how many vulcans are on board?
"assuming the entire crew is still alive, one hundred and forty seven."
"if i'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level. maybe we can use one of their shuttles."
"the bay's depressurised, probably from an asteroid impact."
we have to get back to our pod.
that'll be difficult. all four bulkheads leading to the airlock have been sealed.
we should keep moving. how's your arm?
"it's fine, sir."
"he's losing a lot of blood, captain. we've got to treat this wound."
how far to their sickbay?
it's two decks up.
let's go.  are you all right?
"since we've come aboard, i've been experiencing anxiety. whatever's happened to this crew may be starting to affect me."
we'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
"this one's more isolated, and i'm reading large deposits near the surface. can you set us down?"
there isn't a flat spot much bigger than my quarters.
"you're the pilot, it's your call."
let's go. i'm matching the rotational velocity.
looking good. two hundred metres. you're drifting to the left.
got it.
i hope you won't write that landing up in your log.
are you kidding? i'm going to recommend they give you a medal.
let's try to make this quick.
any idea what's causing this?
i'm not a doctor.
but you are my science officer. i need to know i can depend on you.
i'll do my best. his name is solin. when i served here he was the chief engineer. i knew him.
"can you understand me? sub-commander t'pol. we served together. don't you recognise me? we're here to help you but we need to know what happened to your crew. solin, look at me. something has made you very ill. you've lost control. tell me what happened. tell me!"
this is going to happen to me.
you don't know that.
it's already started. i can feel my control slipping away.
we're getting you off this ship.
it's too late.
"we're going to take the scans you made back to phlox and figure out what's going on here, but first we have to get to the shuttle. how do you open those bulkheads? the bulkheads."
there's an auxiliary control room on the engineering deck.
okay.
are you okay?
"t'pol, we have to keep moving."
i don't need your help.
two more biosigns fifty metres beyond that hatch. it's the only way to the engineering deck.
"we'll go deal with them. stay with her, hawkins."
aye sir.
"water? no offense, but you look like you could use some."
thank you.
"i apologise for the way i reacted before. you were right, this is a rescue mission. may i ask you a question? how is it possible that this crew could turn so violent, when vulcans aren't supposed to have emotions."
"a common misconception. we have emotions. we simply keep them suppressed, under control. something has obviously caused them to lose that control."
why would they want to kill us?
there was a time in the past when we were an extremely violent race. we nearly destroyed ourselves. paranoia and homicidal rage were common.
five metres.
any more where they came from?
not at the moment.
archer to hawkins.
"go ahead, sir."
we're all clear.
understood. we're on our way.
i heard about the accident you and t'pol had in the lab.
it was minor. nothing to write home about.
but you're sure this stuff is safe to bring on board?
don't worry. it only tends to blow up in its liquid state.
enterprise to commander tucker.
go ahead.
"sir, we've just picked up a spatial anomaly at your coordinates."
we saw it.
it's altered the course of
the asteroid. you're heading into a denser part of the field.
"grab a seat, commander."
don't worry about me. just get us the hell out of here.
the starboard thruster's failing.
there's debris in the intake manifold. can you purge it?
we're clear. we've only got one thruster left.
can you get us home?
i think so.
shuttlepod two to enterprise.
"go ahead, commander."
"we're on our way back, but we've taken damage."
alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking.
understood.
secure the door.
the transceiver's been damaged.
any chance of repairing it? t'pol.
what!
any chance of repairing it.
there's an auxiliary transmitter. if i can get access to it we may be able to contact enterprise.
"sir, i've encrypted the locking codes, but if they're determined to get in."
looks like the impulse assembly took a beating. open up the engine housings and run a diagnostic.
bridge to commander tucker.
tucker here.
we're receiving a transmission from the captain. it sounds urgent.
route it down here.
"go ahead, captain."
"trip,"
we're going to need some help getting off this ship. how fast can you be here?
"pod two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir. we're looking at a couple of hours before we can launch again."
what's the problem?
it's the vulcan crew. something's wrong with them.
we're going to transmit some biodata.
tell phlox to start analysing it. see if there's anything we can do to help these people.
acknowledged. anything else?
just get that shuttle flying.
aye sir.
archer out.
you heard the captain. get a repair team down here.
"the bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine. i've rerouted them through the auxiliary grid. mister reed, are you finished with those actuator circuits?"
they've all been realigned.
you okay?
what did you do?
"i realigned the circuits, just like you asked me."
these aren't sequenced correctly. you overloaded the locking mechanism!
then we'll have to try something else.
it's pointless. the circuits are damaged! i should have been watching him. you didn't want me to see. now i know what you were doing in the command centre.
what are you talking about?
"the xindi starcharts. you were analysing them behind my back, undermining my work."
no one's trying to sabotage your work. we should all just focus on getting off this ship safely.
"there might be another way, sir. if we overload the power grid, it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkhead mechanisms."
the warp reactor is unstable as it is. disrupting main power could shut down the anti-matter containment. you'd cause a reactor breach.
i don't think we have much of a choice.
you want to kill all of us.  you don't trust vulcans. you never have.
"sir, that pistol's set to kill."
give me the weapon.
"don't think i've forgotten. you blamed us for holding you back, for undermining your father's work. now you've decided to take revenge.  i'll fire!"
listen to me. this is a rescue mission. we're here to save these people.
you're lying. you want to kill them.
"if that's true, then why would i keep our weapons on stun? it's not logical."
it doesn't make sense. t'pol and i have been working with trellium for weeks. she hasn't shown any symptoms.
"i don't imagine she would have. despite your best efforts, you weren't able to synthesis it in any significant quantities. the crew of the seleya, however, had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid field filled with the compound. trellium-d is a potent neurotoxin to the vulcan nervous system. it disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow them to control emotions. unfortunately the rate of decay is accelerating."
is it too late?
"i can treat her, but i nee to begin synaptic regeneration as soon as possible."
what about the vulcan crew?
"phlox, do you read me?"
"i'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others. they've been exposed for too long. the neurological damage is irreversible. they're dying, captain."
he's lying. he wants them all to die.
"doctor, there are over a hundred and forty people on this ship."
"i'm sorry, but they've been exp"
"enterprise. phlox, do you hear me? respond."
they've shut the comm. system down.
"captain, they're flooding the compartment with hexafluorine."
shut it off.
i can't. they've bypassed the environmental controls.
they won't let you destroy this ship.
"after you initiate the overload, how long do we have?"
"about fifteen minutes, maybe less."
no!
"you heard what the doctor said. they can't be saved, but you can."
murderer!
help me get her out of here.
malcolm?
just about there.
come on. climb!
malcolm!
we don't have much time.
"no, no, no."
you can't stay here.
another twenty metres.
captain!
how were you at the long jump.
watch her. reed.
"come on, you can make it."
get away from me.
"it's okay, i'll help you."
touch me and i'll kill you.
"go. i said, go!"
give me a hand.
what's wrong?
i can't release the docking clamps. full power to thrusters.
we're being hailed.
"are you all right, captain?"
the docking
clamps are jammed. we could use a hand.
stand by.
"you're clear, sir."
the ship's about to blow. get the hell out of here.
archer to shuttlepod two. are you still in one piece?
"we're fine, sir. see you back on enterprise."
we got over   sixty kilos. that should be enough to line the forward hull.
it may be a while before phlox finds a way to inoculate t'pol. take this to cargo bay one. store it in the biohazard locker.
"aye, sir."
how'd it go?
"you got her out in time, captain. her synaptic pathways are mending nicely, but it will be a few days before she fully regains control of her emotions."
i'd like to talk with her.
phlox was able to help you. you're going to be okay.
the seleya?
"it was destroyed. i'm sorry, but i didn't have a choice."
they were beyond help. their fate was sealed long before we arrived.  please don't be long.
was commander tucker successful?
"yes and no. he collected a good supply of trellium, but it turns out it was trellium that poisoned the vulcan crew and you."
it's essential you protect this ship. leave me on the next habitable planet.
i'm not going to do that.
you can't allow your concern for a single crewman to affect your mission. this expanse destroyed everyone aboard the seleya. don't let it happen to enterprise.
"we'll find a way through this, but i won't leave anyone behind. not if i can help it. i can't try to save humanity without holding on to what makes me human."
something tells me we haven't seen the last of the detective in the bow tie.
"no, he died in a house fire."
"ah, did he? the autopsy was inconclusive. i wouldn't be surprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strange limp. you never did see him leave the house."
what about the gardener? he was there too.
too tall. even the primitive forensics of the mid-twentieth century would have determined that.
"perhaps we should watch, and find out."
"part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it ends, using logic. you of all people should appreciate that."
then use logic more quietly.
all hands report to stations. tactical alert.
it's all right. you're on enterprise. you're safe.
hoshi.
hello?
do you understand me? i think you do. can you see me?
ensign sato to security.
go ahead.  hoshi? is everything all right? hoshi?
i thought i was the only one who lived here during my off hours.
i'd like you to see this. these are the locations where we've encountered spatial anomalies. i analysed the sensor logs from the xindi database. these are the co-ordinates where that vessel was affected.
seems pretty random.
"that's what i thought, until i ran a vector analysis of the gravimetric waves coming from the sphere we discovered. the interference patterns implied another wave source."
a second sphere.
it appears so. the simulation suggests that the anomalies occur where the waves intersect.
"if you're right, then we should be able to start predicting where we're going to run into trouble."
"if we're going to create an accurate map, we'll need precise measurements of the sphere's gravimetric fields."
"assuming there is a second sphere, how far away is it?"
less than four light years.
set a course.
nothing?
i ran every scan in the book. there's no sign of any intruder anywhere on the ship.
maybe our sensors missed something.
i went through all the logs for the last twenty four hours. to say they were uneventful would be an understatement. this is good news.
that i'm imagining things?
you're a little on edge. it's not uncommon to see the enemy out of the corner of your eye.
i thought that was called paranoia.
"whatever it is, it's not uncommon. just the other night i thought i heard clicking sounds in my quarters. for a moment, i could have sworn there was a xindi insectoid lurking in the shadows."
what i saw wasn't a shadow.
"all right, i'll keep an eye out."
"there's some mild vasodilation in the pre-frontal cortex. that would account for your headaches. other than that, you're in perfect health."
are there any more tests that you can run?
what do you expect me to find?
"the last few days i've had the strangest feeling that i am being watched. i've heard whispering down corridors, in my quarters. could i have been exposed to something that's making me hallucinate?"
there's no evidence of any mind-altering substances on board.
so basically this is all in my head.
it appears to be.
great.
i suppose you believe you're dealing badly with stress.
it's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren't there.
"well, that's a matter of opinion. on denobula, when a person under stress hallucinates it's considered healthy. a harmless way for the subconscious to release nervous energy. i've always envied those who had that facility. i tend to keep too much bottled up inside."
i should get going. t'pol's asked me to translate a section of the xindi database.
hoshi.
that's where i'm waiting for you. that's where i'm waiting for you.
ensign sato to lieutenant reed. i need help in the command centre.
hoshi.
who are you?
don't be frightened.
hoshi.
how did you get on board?
i'm nowhere near your ship.
what do you want?
you're searching for something. i can help.
hoshi. you all right?
i'm not picking up anything out of the ordinary.
we still haven't found any ships nearby or any uninvited guests on board.
"i am not imagining it, captain."
you have to admit it's a possibility.
"with respect, sir, i know that my mind can be overactive sometimes, but that is not what's happening. this is real."
"i want you to keep hoshi under observation until we can sort this out. post a security detail outside, and assign teams to engineering and the armoury until further notice."
"are you expecting an attack, sir?"
"around here, you never know. i'll see you both in the morning."
isn't it about feeding time?
i'll take care of it after i get you settled.
would you mind? i'm really not that tired.
be my guest. the vulcan root-leaf's in that container.
"that's strange. it's. when the alien communicates with me, it's almost like he's inside my head, looking at things through my eyes, experiencing what i'm experiencing, and talking to him is like talking to myself. does that make any sense?"
it makes perfect sense. listening to your thoughts has been very pleasurable.
what?
"i've been with you for several days. studying your mind, your memories. learning so many things about you."
why me?
my telepathy only works in rare instances. it takes a unique mind to process it. yours is the first i've found in many years.
what do you want?
i'm only three light years away. my home is what you're seeing right now. all i want is to meet you.
i don't think that'll be possible.
i know you're on an urgent mission. that's what i want to talk to you about.
what did he tell you about the xindi?
he's saving that for my visit.
he could have given you something as a show of good faith. this could be another attempt by the xindi to infiltrate enterprise.
i think he wants to help. he was horrified that seven million of us were killed. he says he's willing to use his abilities to help us find the xindi. i think that's reason enough to meet with him.
archer to mayweather.
"go ahead, sir."
we're taking a slight detour.
i asked hoshi to come alone.
the captain's always a part of first contact missions. star fleet regulations. i hope that's not a problem.
"not at all, captain."
"i'm pleased all three of you could come. my name is tarquin. i'm obviously not what you expected. i didn't want to frighten you, so i created a human image when i contacted you on enterprise. thank you for coming to me."
you said you could help us with our mission.
"you're searching for a weapon that could annihilate your planet. i may be able to find it, but i'll need an object that's associated with the xindi."
why?
"every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it, who used it. i have the ability to sense those imprints."
i can arrange to have something sent down. how much time would you need with it?
no more than a few days.
we didn't pick up any other biosigns. i take it you live here alone.
alone.
it's an awfully big planet for one person.
"i've lived here for a very long time, mister reed. my only contact with the outside world has been through telepathy. bring me the artefact. i'd like to get started."
we'll be back as soon as we can.
"captain, one small request. i'd like hoshi to stay with me while i'm working."
i'm afraid that's not appropriate.
"nonetheless, it's a condition of my helping you."
if i'm comfortable with this. i don't get the sense that he would harm me.
my instincts tell me otherwise. he's hiding something.
"if he's insistent, we could put off looking for the sphere, stay in orbit. it's only for a few days."
"we don't have the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time anymore, sir. if he can tell us something about the xindi weapon it's worth the risk. i can take care of myself, captain."
this is from the weapon that attacked your planet.
we think it was a prototype. from a much larger weapon.
this will be very useful. may i?
thanks. i need a minute.
take your time.
do i have to tell you to stay on your toes?
"i think that falls under the goes without saying category, sir."
did you bring a phase pistol?
i'll keep it under my pillow.
you know how to reach me.
do you always eat like this?
only when i have company.
thank you.
i thought you might enjoy something familiar.
programming these dishes was a challenge. i had to recreate their tastes and textures from your memory. please.
it should approximate the recipe from fiorella's on fountain street in san francisco.
you have certainly done your homework.
i've enjoyed it.
what's this?
dessert.
it's a delicacy from the arakon system. i think you'll like it.
"you know, my stomach is a little unsettled."
you told your grandmother that every time she tried to serve you soba noodles. now it's one of your favourite foods.
"since you seen to know so much about my past, i think it's only fair that i know a little about yours. where are you from?"
"my homeworld is thirty light years from here. a wonderful place to live, provided you're not born telepathic. the odds are one in fifty million. i was among the unlucky few. we're considered a threat to the rest of the population. there's only one solution for people like me. to live out our lives in exile. so we're sent to places like this.  to solitude. i think you're familiar with it."
what do you mean?
"your parents learned you were gifted, so you spent your childhood with private tutors, studying languages. you thought it was normal to go through your days alone. i'm sorry, i forget you're unaware of how much i know about you."
are you reading my mind continuously?
not since you arrived. now that you're here with me i would rather get to know you the way other humans do.
"this is great, but i'm pretty tired."
of course.
"if you need anything else, let me know at supper tomorrow. i'll be working most of the day. feel free to wander. there are a lot of interesting things here, but i strongly suggest that you stay inside. the winds can be treacherous."
i'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied.
"if you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this. it's written in a dead language, over a thousand years old. everything about these people, their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time."
thank you.
you don't have to feel alone.
"i won't, i'll be busy with this."
"that's not what i meant. you often feel isolated, even around other people. you don't have to."
archer to the bridge.
"yes, captain."
i assume we're getting close?
you assume correctly.
take us out of warp. i'm on my way.
"yes, sir."
status.
we're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.
i got you.
"breaches on decks b, c and e. emergency bulkheads are in place but three subsections have decompressed."
we're losing structural integrity in the forward hull.
all stop! the anomalies are stronger here.
"if there is another sphere in the region, it's emitting a lot more gravimetric energy than the first one."
"which means if we continue, there's a good chance the ship is going to get torn apart. if it is there, how far?"
approximately seventy five thousand kilometres.
it might as well be seventy five thousand light years.
bridge to commander tucker.
go ahead.
how are your engines
holding up?
"so far, so good, but i wouldn't recommend putting them through a lot more of this."
how long would it take you to insulate a shuttlepod with trellium-d.
i'd need a day to refine enough ore and at least twelve hours
to reconfigure the hull.
get started.
"aye, sir."
hold our position.  you might want to steer clear of the launch bay for the next couple of days.
indeed.
"i'm sorry, i didn't mean to disturb you."
not at all. please.
have you had a chance to look at the book i gave you?
i'm about halfway through.
i didn't expect you to translate it so quickly.
aren't you supposed to know me better than that?
what did you think of it?
"it's an interesting language, reminds me of medieval klingon. any progress?"
"a few images, impressions. did you know that there are five xindi species?"
that's what we've heard.
there's a great deal of conflict among them. they don't trust one another.
do you know where they're building the weapon?
not yet. i'm going to need more time.
what's this?
"it helps me extend the range of my telepathy. my family gave it to me when i was exiled. without it, i never would have found you. would you like to try?"
is that possible?
with guidance.
"if you close your eyes, you begin to sense light and colour. let the images take shape. let the shapes become more distinct. can you see them?"
i think so.
you're trying too hard to find them. let the images come to you.
how do you make sense of all that?
it takes practice. try again.
maybe later. i should let you get back to your work.
"feel free to return, if you'd like some company."
thanks.
i asked you to stay inside!
is this why you didn't want me out here? who are they?
they're people i knew. the last one died over a century ago. we should go inside.
how did they die?
very few lifespans are as long as mine.
how old are you?
i was born over four hundred years ago.
who were they?
"the first one was morianna taal. she was my first companion. like you, she had a unique mind."
and the other three?
"companions as well. when i lost morianna i began to search for another, then another. sometimes i don't know what is worse, being alone or having to bury the people i've come to care about. it's been many years since i found someone like you."
you're right. we should go back inside.
all i'm asking is that you consider the possibility.
you know that enterprise is on an important mission. i just can't abandon my duties.
it's possible that with my help your mission will be over soon.
do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on a desolate world with someone i have known for less than two days?
"the others had similar doubts, but over time they came to appreciate what i had to offer them. no one will ever understand you the way i can."
"i am grateful for your help and i'm happy to stay here while you work, but i have no intention of becoming your next companion."
"if you think projecting yourself as human is going to make me change my mind, you're mistaken."
"you've let your fear of the unknown stand in your way far too many times. you almost left enterprise early in it's mission because you didn't think you could control your fears. but in spite of that, you stayed. it strengthened you. this situation is no different."
"you obviously misinterpreted a few memories, because this situation is very different."
"i'm giving you the chance to experience something you've searched for your entire life. it's the reason you study languages, to make unique connections with people."
i don't need you to help me do that.
then why do you seem so isolated? you live on a ship filled with your own people and yet there are many times when you feel alone. stay with me. i'll teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions no human can.
"i already told you, i'm not interested."
"you're lying, hoshi. i can hear everything you're thinking."
what i'm thinking is none of your business!
"michio. your grandfather. he's the last person you were truly close to, but he died a long time ago."
leave me alone.
you can have that kind of connection again.
leave me alone!
i'm sorry. i know this must seem overwhelming. think about what i've said. you're going to have a great deal of time.
sensors say we're passing through a gravimetric distortion.
no anomalies.
trellium seems to be doing it's job.
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
we're approaching seventy nine thousand kilometres. still no sign
of the cloaking barrier.
adjust your heading to oh one six mark two.
stand by.
that felt promising.
i believe you just grazed the perimeter. turn starboard three point six degrees.
i think we've found it.
maintain course. you should be heading directly towards the cloaking barrier.
power's fluctuating.
hull integrity?
"some microfractures, but nothing we can't handle.  switching to backup."
trip.
let's get going with the scans.
"ah, hell."
is there a problem?
the sensor relays were damaged.
how much time do you need?
"not long, but we'll have to get back to enterprise. i need to open up the circuit housings on the undercarriage. no way to get to them from the inside."
bring the descent thrusters online.
you're not planning to land on that thing?
"thrusters, trip, and get the ev suits ready."
not exactly my idea of shore leave.
get to work. i'm going to take a look around.
don't get lost.
"how's it coming, trip?"
"almost there, sir. just two more relays."
captain!
what happened?
the port thruster ignited.
i can see that.
"when i was bypassing the last relay, i must have triggered a surge in the propulsion system. son of a bitch!"
it's going to be a long time before enterprise decides to come looking for us.
can we launch without a port thruster?
we can sure as hell try.
whoever gets the first clear shot.
"careful, sir. that was awfully close to the o2 recycler."
i need to spend more time in the armoury.
archer to enterprise.
"we're here, captain."
"it was right where you said it was, t'pol. we got all the scans you asked for."
may i come in? i won't be long. i just heard from your captain. enterprise will be here in a few minutes. i have learned a great deal about the xindi weapon. i'm sure he'll find the information useful.
thank you for all your help.
have you given any more thought to my offer?
"i can't stay here, you know that."
i understand. i was foolish to think it was even a possibility.
"the next time you invite someone for a visit, you might want to let them know you're looking for a life-long companion."
i won't forget. please keep the book as a reminder of your time here.
"i was hoping you'd say that. i'm nearly done, and i'm anxious to see how it ends."
"after i've briefed captain archer, i'll send him to you. it was a privilege knowing you."
how was your stay?
it'll be good to get back to enterprise.
"i'm sure. if it's any consolation, your time here was well spent. we've learnt more about the xindi than i expected, and he's offered to keep supplying us with information for as long as we're in range, thanks to you."
"glad i could help, sir."
there is one condition. he wants you to stay with him while he continues his work.
i assume you told him that wouldn't be possible.
"i won't order you to do this, hoshi, but it may be our best chance of finding the weapon before it's too late. with any luck, it'll only take a few weeks, maybe a month. we'd come back for you as soon as the mission's over. i don't need to tell you what's at stake, ensign."
i'll go back to my quarters and pick up a few things.
"thank you, hoshi. there's no reason for you to leave. just give me a list of what you need and i'll have it sent down."
i should brief my replacement on the ut upgrades.
we'll take care of it. don't worry.
at least give me a chance to say goodbye to the crew!
i wish there was time.
"it won't take long. sir, i might not see my friends again."
i'm sure travis will understand.
travis?
travis and the others. they realise how important this is.
i was just thinking about travis. you're a regular mind reader.
we've known each other a long time.
where is captain archer?
we'll be back for you as soon as we can.
where is he?
hoshi.
where is captain archer!
hoshi.
open a channel to ensign sato.
"our signal's not getting through, sir. there's some kind of disruption field."
sir.
what's going on?
my station's down.
"everything's going offline. main and auxiliary power, warp engines, life support."
"nice try. what were you planning to tell my captain when he got back? were you going to appear as me and beg him to let me stay? no, you can't do that, can you? i'm the only one on board that you can play your tricks with."
enterprise has already returned. their fate in in your hands.
what is that supposed to mean?
"i can't let you leave, hoshi. i've waited too long to find you."
what's happened to enterprise?
"if you agree to stay, they won't be harmed. they'll be free to leave orbit."
let me speak to captain archer.
that's not possible.
why the hell not?
"you'll be happy here, i promise you."
why can't i speak to captain archer?
"there's no power on your vessel, and there won't be until you agree to remain with me."
you would kill over eighty people to keep me here?
i don't want to kill anyone. that's why it's essential that you agree to stay.  you mustn't do that. it's very fragile.
"i'm counting on that. now, undo whatever you've done to my ship or you will never contact anyone again with this thing."
"an empty threat, hoshi. as long as you're with me i won't need to contact anyone else."
"as long as i'm with you. another sixty, seventy years, and then what.  what'll you do when i'm grave number five out there? without this you will never find another companion. you will be alone for the rest of your life."
"please, think of what i can offer you."
this is your last chance.
report.
power's returning to all systems.
malcolm.
weapons are coming back online.
tactical alert.
"aye, sir."
it's ensign sato.
put her through.
"captain, are you all right?"
we are now. what the hell's going on?
i think it's time to come get me.
what have you got?
the data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate map of the anomalies.
nearly?
these are the coordinates where we've encountered strong anomalies.
the waves aren't intersecting where they're supposed to.
exactly. the locations are being influenced by more than two gravimetric sources.
a third sphere?
"a third sphere would correct some of the error but not all of it, so i had the computer run a covariant extrapolation."
how many?
"we'll need to get farther into the expanse to be certain, but, at least fifty."
"fifty man-made spheres, each one the size of a small moon."
and each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy.
did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things may have done it to create the expanse?
why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies?
what are you doing here?
did you enjoy the ending?
you can't do this. i don't want you watching me.
"this is the last time, i promise. i've brought you information to give to your captain."
why now?
"you're on a dangerous mission. i don't want to see you harmed. who knows, you may change your mind about me someday."
come in.
i thought i told you to get some rest.
he came to my quarters.
i was afraid that might happen.
he gave me these coordinates.
what are they for?
a xindi colony. he said they're building part of the weapon there.
"we're preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet in the calindra system,        but we're going to need another shipment of kemocite. at least one hundred kilograms."
"i'll contact gralik. if the test is successful, how long before we can deploy        the weapon?"
a matter of weeks.
there are no defensive systems?
"no active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites, no vessels anywhere in the        vicinity."
we've seen how different xindi technology is. they could have defences we can't detect.
it's also possible that what we've been told about this colony isn't accurate.        we're putting a lot of faith in hoshi's telepathic friend.
what about these energy readings?        they could be coming from a weapons complex.
"they could also be electrical storms, deposits of diamagnetic ore, or"
"or a glitch in our sensors. i know. but if there's any chance that something on        that planet could lead us to the xindi weapon, we have to investigate it. after we        enter the system we'll stay on the far side of that moon. it should keep us out of view.        tell major hayes he'll be joining us on a reconnaissance mission. we launch in two hours."
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
i've found a landing site twelve kilometres north of the energy readings. any        sign they've detected us?
scans are still negative. your signal's breaking up.
i've set a steep approach vector and we've ionised the hull. it'll help        disburse any scanning beams.
acknowledged.
"if anyone sees us, they'll think we're a meteor."
how much further?
"eight hundred metres, just over that rise."
that's definitely the source of the        energy readings.
they're xindi.
reptilian?
"no, one of the other species we saw on the database."
"we've picked up readings across the spectrum. positron emissions, antiproton        bursts. whatever they're doing in there, it's using a lot of power."
corporal hawkins is standing by with an assault team.
tell him to keep standing by. i'm not ready to send in the troops        just yet. we've checked out the perimeter of the complex. i think we can get inside        without being detected.
we'll maintain communications silence inside the complex. i'll contact        you at oh four hundred. archer out.
i'm not picking up any security devices.
what about people?
"approximately eighty inside the complex, but not within a hundred metres."
captain. some kind of radiolytic compound. it doesn't match anything in        our database. there's several hundred kilograms n this room.
there were impurities in the last three production cycles.
we found a ruptured seal in the tertiary processing chamber. it's been repaired.
we'll have to increase the production rate by at least sixty percent. assign two additional teams.
degra isn't being realistic. this facility wasn't designed to manufacture such large quantities.
"your job is to synthesis kemocite. i suggest you get back to it. have these canisters retested.        salvage what you can, then destroy the rest."
"we have it, captain."
i need an analysis as soon as possible.
acknowledged.
"captain, this place obviously has something to do with the weapon. it seems to me the        sooner we put it out of commission, the better."
two spatial charges. that's all it would take to destroy the complex from orbit.
"that might set them back for a while, but we can't lose sight of our main objective.        i want to know where they're shipping this kemocite. it could lead us to the weapon."
i have some questions for you.
who are you? what do you want from me?
sit down!
"there's nobody else here, sir. apparently he lives alone."
take watch outside.
what's your name?
gralik durr.
my name's jonathan archer. i'm from earth.
is that supposed to explain why you forced your way into my home?
tell me about kemocite.
it's a multiphasic isotope.
used for what?
there are numerous applications. it depends on the level of refinement.
you're working with someone named degra. who is he?
that's none of your concern.
what's he using it for?
kemocite can be used for any number of purposes. i don't make a habit        of asking our clients what they plan to do with it.
"maybe you should, because this batch is being used to create a weapon to exterminate my people!"
what?
i want to know where the weapon is being build and when it's going to be ready.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i'm not leaving here until i get the answers i need.
i managed to identify a sub-quantum imprint. it matches the signature of        the xindi probe.
"there's no doubt about it, captain. this isotope was used in the weapon        that attacked earth."
have you learnt anything from the interrogation?
"not yet, but this should help."
"something else, captain."
"i ran a scan on that rifle we picked up. there it was again, the same        quantum imprint. i'd like permission to take it apart."
go ahead. we'll contact you in a couple of hours.
understood.
"congratulations, sir. three months ago we entered the expanse with no        idea who these xindi were or how to find them, and now we're about to destroy        one of their weapons facilities."
"i thought we were here to try and stop a war, not start one."
they struck first.
because they were told we're going to attack them. they think they're        acting in self-defence. by destroying this complex we'll be confirming their        worst fears about humanity.
let's not forget the seven million people who were killed.
"have major hayes lay down blast suppressors. when this facility goes,        i don't want to take the rest of the settlement with it."
"what about gralik, sir? he'll tell them about enterprise."
i'll deal with gralik when the time comes. i don't intend to let        anyone know we were here.
i can't imagine what the captain wants this for.
he was quite insistent.
we ran the quantum analysis three times. doesn't he trust us?
he said he needed it to help prove a point.
how long are you going to keep me here?
that's up to captain archer.
"well, you can tell him that i'll be in my study."
i'm afraid you're going to have to stay right here.
i have work to do.
and i'm under orders. please sit down.
i've already told you everything i know.
"ah, captain archer. i        was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me."
you said you weren't involved in building weapons.
that's correct.
explain this.
i don't know what this is.
"it's a fragment of a probe that murdered seven million people.        the dead pilot was xindi, the alloy is xindi, and it's imprinted with the        quantum signature of the compound you produce here. we know you're constructing        a larger version of the weapon, big enough to destroy a planet. i want to know        where it's being built!"
"you burst into my home, show me some twisted piece of metal and tell me        it proves i'm a mass murderer? i've never seen your species before. i've never        heard of a planet called earth, and whether you believe me or not, i had        nothing to do with killing millions of its inhabitants."
"i'm flattered you requested my assistance, commander, but weaponry isn't        exactly my area of expertise."
"my scans of this thing showed organic components, and i figured anything        biological is more your turf than mine."
what do you think?
they appear to be generating synaptic impulses.
is it alive?
"wouldn't make a very good pet but, definitely organic."
and it appears to have reproductive        capabilities.
the kemocite is extremely refined.
did it come from this facility?
"it did. we supply many species with kemocite, not just xindi.        it has countless applications. when degra requested shipments so        highly refined, we celebrated, realising the wealth it would bring        to our colony. we never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite.        perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility that it would be used in constructing a weapon."
is degra a reptilian?
"no, he's a xindi primate."
i met one at a mining complex.
"they're similar to you. ape-like. degra and his people have        always been fair, truthful. that may have been why i believed him when        he said the shipment was for research. perhaps he's become as untrustworthy        as the reptilians."
"we've run into a few of them, too. it's hard to imagine five sentient        species evolving on the same planet."
"five? i suppose there are, now."
"no, thanks."
do you mind?
"no, go ahead."
"there was a sixth species, the avians. they've been gone since the war."
gone?
"extinct. as far as i'm told, none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed."
we found some debris. how did it happen?
"the war went on for nearly a hundred years. the sides changed, alliances were        forged and then broken. by the time it ended i doubt any of the six species remembered        what started it, but everyone remembered what ended it. as well as being unstable politically,        our planet was even more unstable geologically. in a final desperate act, the insectoids and        reptilians detonated massive explosions beneath the eight largest seismic fissures. i'd like        to think they didn't realise how devastating the result would be. my grandfather lived there.        he told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with avians. now they're gone."
"the other five species did survive. from what i can tell, they don't all live on        remote colonies like this one."
"the descendants of those that escaped are scattered across the expanse. many live        peaceful lives, but obviously not all."
captain.
i'll be right back.
sir.
it's okay.
"the suppressors are in place. the blast wave should be mostly confined        to the facility. sir, i noticed a lot of activity down there. it seemed like something is going on."
archer.
"captain, we've detected a ship approaching the planet. the hull        configuration matches the xindi vessel that attacked us."
reptilians.
recognise anyone?
the reptilians seem rather upset about something.
you got something?
i've been running scans of the weapons organic component. it's        neural pathways appear to help modulate the rifle's power output.        it's the most sophisticated example of biomechanical engineering i've ever seen.
"you said you had good news, doc?"
"ah, yes. i've been attempting to break down this creature's immune        system."
you're trying to make it sick?
"however, it's proving to be quite resilient. i tried an array of        viruses and pathogens, but it's immune to all of them. then i began        exposing it to various radioactive spectra. a sustained burst of        delta radiation."
if we rig up portable em emitters we can knock out reptilian        weapons before any of them get the chance to pull the trigger.
"in theory. unfortunately, the amount of radiation required would        be extremely hazardous to any humans in the area."
"it's still a place to start. great work, doc. keep at it."
"and, commander, i'd avoid exposing any of the xindi technology       to omicron radiation. it seems to thrive on it, as you can see."
i'll keep that in mind.
they're ahead of schedule. we weren't expecting them for another        three days. you might not have much time left to accomplish your mission.
what makes you say that?
"we've been processing kemocite for them for nearly six months.        they're here for their final shipment. captain, i'm the primary        technician in this facility. they'll want to talk to me before        accepting delivery, to confirm that all of their technical requirements have been met.        i may be able to obtain some information for you about this weapon."
that could be dangerous.
i'm willing to take that risk.
"how do i know you won't expose us, tell them about enterprise?"
"i'm proud of my craft, captain. i've practiced it for many years.        i won't let my work be corrupted in this way. seven million people. if i'd chosen my clients more carefully,        that tragedy might not have happened. i don't intend to let it happen again."
archer.
"captain, there are two xindi biosigns heading this way."
"gralik, are you there? gralik?"
degra's probably wondering where i am. his companions don't like to be kept waiting.
captain. they've gone.
they'll return. probably with armed reptilians.
just because you didn't show up for work?
there are fewer than a hundred people on this planet. it        doesn't go unnoticed when one of them is missing. degra won't leave        until he sees the results of the final isotopic analysis. you should reconsider my offer.
"that's good, right there."
are you sure this is wise?
that's four inches of solid duranium. if this thing can blast a hole        through it then we're in even worse trouble than we thought.
"still, it might be prudent to find a more suitable environment to test it."
we don't have time to go looking for some deserted asteroid if that's what you mean.
if i may? commander tucker and i have learnt all we can from examining the        workings of the device. a practical test is the next logical step.
i've rigged up four of malcolm's force field emitters. they'll contain any blast debris.
what about radiation or particle disbursement? you know nothing about this device.
"that's the point. those xindi took out half of our security force        when they came aboard. now, if we don't start making some progress        understanding their weapons, we won't stand a chance in hell of beating them when the time comes."
let me know when you're ready.
give us an hour.
more delays?
we did surprise them by arriving early.
that's no excuse. they should have been ready by now. such lethargic creatures.
"you could learn something from them. patience, for example. where's gralik?"
we can't find him.
"in a complex this size, how difficult can it be?"
we've searched everywhere. no one's seen him.
he often takes walks outside the settlement.
walks?
without his analysis i can't proceed.
we've organised search teams.
we don't have time for you to go foraging through the forest. we'll find him ourselves.
what is it?
"someone's closing on our position, sir. four hundred metres."
reptilians?
i'm not certain. three hundred and fifty metres.
stay with him.
"still closing, sir. two hundred metres, one fifty. they're bloody fast, whoever they are."
take cover.
it's a seeker. the reptilians built them for reconnaissance.        they were used to great effect during the war. it seems as though you may have been exposed after all.
let's hope they didn't get a very good look at us.
there are some caves not far ahead. they should provide us with some        cover in case we encounter any more of those.
"ready, doc?"
ready.
what's wrong?
it won't fire. i don't understand.
perhaps it has a safety device.
what's that?
it's coming from the weapon.
looks like some kind of countdown.
the energy levels are increasing. it's overloading.
i can't shut it down. damn thing's booby-trapped.
if you remove the power cell
it'll just grow back.
"quick thinking, commander."
"you were right. we probably should have found a nice, empty asteroid to test it on."
the xindi ship is still in orbit. we haven't detected any other vessels.
understood.
"captain, if the xindi have detected your presence,"
i strongly urge you to return to the ship.
i appreciate your concern.
but we still have a few loose ends to tie up down here. archer out. anything?
"no, sir. we just might have stopped those bloodhounds before they transmitted our        position."
let's hope so.
no sign of the reptilians.
"i doubt they'll find us. that's topaline ore. it should disrupt their scanners.        even their seekers won't locate us here. what do you intend to do now, captain. destroy our facility?        do you plan to wait until i'm back inside or will you simply dispose of me here in the forest?"
i've been considering another option.
i'd certainly like to hear it.
the people in this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet. i'll be         damned if i'm going to make them pay for it. you offered to help us. are you still willing?
if you're prepared to trust me.
"then we'll give them their kemocite, but it won't be exactly what they ordered."
make sure he gets home safely.
"yes, sir."
it would be better if i went alone.
good luck.
and you.
permission to speak freely?
go ahead.
i'm not sure it was wise to let him go.
he could lead the reptilians back here.
"are you speaking freely as well, major?"
"just offering a tactical assessment, sir."
noted. he said he'd help us. i believe him.
"it's the captain. go ahead, sir."
tell the armoury to hold off on those spatial charges. there's been a change of plans.
is everything all right?
"i'll let you know in a couple of hours. right now, i have an assignment for you and hoshi."
they're looking for you.
have you started loading the shipment?
not yet.
good! i want to run another refinement test.
we've completed three already. the impurities were less than six parts per million.
we have to be absolutely certain that we've met their specifications.        you know how important this is to all of us.
we should get started.
"you two perform the isotopic analysis, i'll run the sub-molecular scans."
we've got it.
we've modified
"the radiolytic signature. if you can get it onboard their ship, i'll be able to track it."
understood.
where were you?
my personal activities aren't your concern.
and do your personal activities involve destroying one of our seekers?
i was hunting tree scarabs. your drone was frightening them.
who was with you?
i prefer to spend my time in the forest alone.
our scans detected other biosigns.
i was alone.
"if you saw the drone, you knew we were here. why didn't you return?"
you're two days early.
what are you doing?
running some final tests.
what kind of tests? we were told the shipment was ready.
"forty two years. that's how long i've been running this facility, and never        once have i allowed a single gram of kemocite to leave the premises unless        it was perfectly calibrated. i take pride in my work, but if you're so eager to get underway        then go ahead, take your shipment. but if it doesn't meet your requirements don't        expect me to produce another hundred kilograms overnight, because we do have other clients besides you."
finish quickly.
"there are two of them, loading containers."
"stand by, captain."
acknowledged.
they're heading back.
"you're clear, sir."
reed to enterprise.
go ahead.
the captain's inside the xindi shuttle.
acknowledged.
"captain, three xindi have just come out of the complex."
understood.
"lieutenant reed, report."
we've run into a small problem. stand by.
we appreciate your efforts.
perhaps you'll need our services in the future.
perhaps.
i'll miss the pleasure of your company.
"we should go, degra. we're behind schedule already."
we've invested a great deal in this project.
and you've been well paid for it.
"yes, you've been more than generous, but i'd appreciate it if you could tell me what this shipment        is being used for. i don't think it's an unreasonable request."
it doesn't concern you.
it concerns all of us. we've learned there's a threat to our people.
what kind of threat?
"a ruthless alien species. if we don't act, they'll destroy us."
i'm glad we could contribute.
take pride in what you've done here.
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
what's the status of that xindi ship?
"it broke orbit five minutes ago, captain."
are you picking up the tracking signal?
loud and clear.
keep an eye on it. we'll be as soon as we can.
acknowledged.
thank you. is something wrong?
i may have just betrayed my people to a ruthless alien species.
"i promise you, you haven't. please trust me."
to trust.
"eventually, degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite."
it should delay their progress considerably.
he'll come back here.
don't worry. i can deal with degra and his friends. you should        just be concerned with finding this weapon.
their ship entered an energy portal after it left orbit. we've lost our tracking signal.
the portal's range is only a few light years. keep searching.
i'd better get back to enterprise.
"if everything you've told me is true about the attack on your world, i hope you remember        that all xindi are not your enemy."
i will.
archer to the bridge.
i'm sorry sir. i've orders to keep you here.
orders? from whom?
the captain.
we're losing forward hull plating!
target their engines.
no effect.
what the hell's going on?
someone take him back to his quarters!
weapons are offline.
captain!
hello?
you're up early.
t'pol?
i know this all seems unfamiliar. i promise i'll explain everything. why don't you sit down. breakfast is almost ready.
where are we?
"jonathan, please, sit down. i'll answer all of your questions. today is a very important day. i have a great deal to tell you. what's the last thing you remember?"
i was in the command centre looking at long range scans.
do you remember what happened after you left the command centre?
"we were in a corridor. you and i, on our way to the bridge."
"this will be difficult for you to accept, but that was twelve years ago."
you coming tonight?
i hadn't planned on it.
"i can make movie night mandatory for senior officers. you'll enjoy it. rosemary's baby, it'll scare the hell out of you."
archer to the bridge. report.
there's a power surge in the starboard nacelle. it seems to have been caused by an anomaly.
take us out of warp.
the helm's not responding. the starboard injectors are fused.
i'm reading more anomalies ahead.
after course. twenty degrees to port.
you have to get out of here!
i'm not leaving you.
how do you feel?
like a shuttle pod landed on my head. was anyone else hurt?
"no. captain, there are a few questions i have to ask you."
"well, it'll have to wait. i want to get to the bridge."
i'm afraid i have to insist. when did you last speak to commander tucker?
"this morning, staff briefing. why? what's going on, phlox?"
the anomaly in the corridor left something behind. we've never seen it before. this is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus. you've been infected by several clusters of parasites. they haven't caused any tissue damage but they're impairing certain synaptic functions. they're preventing you from forming new long term memories.
long term.
"you can recall events that happened before the infection, but everything after fades within a few hours. captain, you've been in sickbay for the past three days. you last spoke to commander tucker about seven hours ago. he came to see you, right here."
you can't remove these parasites?
"so far, they haven't responded to any traditional therapies, but i'm synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. you can be assured i won't stop working on this until i find a cure."
the doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next several weeks. commander tucker and i did our best to keep you updated each day on the progress of our mission.
"it looked like we had a lead on that xindi ship, the one we planted that tracking devise on, but it turned out to be a garbage scow."
they were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic signature.
"i had an idea this morning, after you told me what happened. i came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers. we can travel farther on less fuel. let me guess. i already gave you these specs."
"a week ago, but your upgrades are working nicely. well, i should get back to engineering. see you both later."
"i imagine that must happen often. maybe these daily briefings aren't such a good idea. looks like it's just a waste of your time, and trip's."
i disagree. we both rely on your experience. you can still contribute to the success of this mission.
i'm sure you have work to do. i'll be in my quarters.
"in the corridor, when the anomaly hit, i urged you to leave me behind. if you had, it's likely i'd be the one suffering from this condition."
"fortunately, i don't take orders from you."
"captain, i never expressed my gratitude for what you did."
i suppose there's not much point in thanking me. a few hours from now i won't remember.
bridge to t'pol.
go ahead.
we're receiving a haul through the subspace buoy. it's starfleet.
i'm on my way.
this was not a conversation i was looking forward to.
it was admiral forrest. the command council had reviewed the doctor's report on your condition. they relieved you of duty and granted me a field commission.
"forrest made you captain. i suppose congratulations are in order, even if they are belated. i guess these parasites weren't so easy to remove after all."
phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside normal space-time. they exist in a state of interspatial flux. none of his treatments had any effect on them.
what about the mission? did you find the xindi weapon?
"after several months of searching, we learned where the weapon was being constructed, but the xindi knew we were getting close. they dispatched two vessels to intercept us."
that last one took out warp engines.
they're locking on to the starboard docking port.
send security teams.
"i'm reading twenty three intruders on decks c, d and e."
have your men set up a defence perimeter on b deck.
we've lost weapons.
is their ship still docked with us?
it is.
both ships are disabled.
"we've lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical."
the xindi?
we've taken nine prisoners but the brig was only designed for two. i'm not sure what to do with the others.
blow them out the airlock.
put them in crew quarter's under heavy guard. how are the repairs coming?
"we should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of hours. the warp drive's another question. the starboard nacelle's a lost cause, half the coils have been fused."
how long to repair them?
"if we were at jupiter station, three weeks. out here i'd have to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch. six months minimum. for now the best i can give you is a warp one point seven."
we're not going to get very far at that speed.
resume our previous heading. dismissed.
how can we keep going with one warp engine?
there's no option.
what the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship?
i chose the logical course of action.
"since the captain got sick, this mission's taken one wrong turn after another."
"if you believe i've acted improperly, i suggest you contact admiral forrest."
you said we eventually found the weapon. how could we manage that without warp engines?
"we located the facility where the xindi constructed the probe, but it had already been deployed."
earth?
"destroyed. they didn't stop at your homeworld. they attacked every human outpost they could find. mars, alpha centauri, vega colony, all were destroyed."
how many of us are left?
less than six thousand.
we're on the fifth planet in the ceti alpha system. it's far from the expanse.
what happened to the crew?
"most of them are still aboard the ship. it's in orbit, patrolling this system."
how did all these people get here?
survivors from human colonies realised they needed a place to take refuge. several convoys headed for this system. one of them was lead by enterprise.
there's a ship approaching at high warp. it's vulcan.
they're hailing us.
ambassador.
"i need to speak with you, t'pol."
come in
"that uniform doesn't suit you, captain."
i doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire.
i want you to return with me to vulcan.
i'm no longer under your authority.
"it's not an order, it's a request for your own safety. two weeks ago, the high command received a distress call from the earth convoy in the mutara system. by the time our ships reached them, they found nothing but a field of debris. the weapon signatures were xindi. even if your ships do manage to reach ceti alpha, it's most likely you'll find an armada waiting for you."
we're prepared to confront them.
"it was a mistake ordering you to leave enterprise. it forced you to make an impulsive decision. if you return with me now, the high command is prepared to reinstate your rank."
i won't leave them.
them or him? there are specialists on vulcan that can help archer.
you'd take him as well?
"if you return to vulcan. you owe the humans nothing. they chose to leave earth before they were ready. if they'd accepted our counsel, this tragedy would have been avoided."
we could have saved them.
how?
"we held back their warp programme for one hundred years. a policy which you supported. if we would have helped them develop faster ships, better defences."
"your emotional attachment to archer is clouding your logic. we'll be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider."
come in. did things go well with the vulcans?
how did you know that they were?
there was obviously a reason i chose these quarters. you can see a lot from this window. what did they want?
they were here to replenish our supplies.
"ha. i've been thinking about everything you told me. i realise i'm not fit to command the ship, but there's got to be some way i can help. i could give trip a hand in engineering."
we tried something similar to that a few months ago. it was uncomfortable for you.
so i'm supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day?
"you often take porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on d deck. the children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions."
"in other words, just stay out of the way."
"after nearly a year, we arrived in this system. our convey was the only one to reach it. the others had all been attacked and destroyed."
this planet's barely minshara-class. maybe we should've picked one with a little more blue and green on it. i'd like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony sites.
you're needed on enterprise. the civilian leaders are going to want to meet with you.
me? you're the one they deal with.
i'm resigning my commission.
you're sure you want to do this?
"captain archer will be better off on the surface with the others. he'll need a caretaker, someone he trusts. i can't be in two places at the same time."
you're making one hell of a sacrifice. why?
i have my reasons.
"the civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw materials. we used them to construct the settlement. at this point, you often wonder if you're a victim of some elaborate deception."
the thought did cross my mind.
"margaret mullin. you met her when you were twenty four years old, during flight school in san francisco. the night before you graduated, you asked her to marry you, outside of her apartment on westgate avenue. she turned you down. she said she didn't want to become a starfleet widow."
how the hell did you know that?
our relationship has evolved over the years.
exactly how far has it evolved?
nothing seems to have changed since your last exam.
"is this why you came all the way from denobula, to give me a check-up?"
"you didn't tell him? after this settlement was established, it became clear that i was never going to find a treatment for your condition if i remained here, so i returned home and consulted with some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on denobula. my colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short of vaporising you in a subspace implosion. they assured me the technology to do what was required did not exist, and they were correct. it took almost a decade to develop, but now i'm ready to put it to the test. the procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy, levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered starship."
we're going to enterprise.
it's good to see you sir.
captain tucker. i don't think you need to call me sir anymore.
old habits. i apologise for the low lighting. we're running on reserve power. antimatter's at a premium these days.
how long has it been since you took command?
nine years. i've got some people who'd like to say hello.
"you're looking well, sir."
"thank you, commander is it?"
"actually, i've been promoted to captain."
malcolm's taking over the intrepid from ramirez.
did everyone get their own ship while i was gone?
"not everyone, sir."
hoshi.
there's a reception in the mess hall if you're feeling up to it.
a visit to engineering may be in order first.
i'll be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate the parasites. we'll start with this cluster today.
why not remove all of them at once?
this procedure's never been attempted before. we should move cautiously.
when can you begin?
the emitters should be calibrated within the hour.
come in.
you left the reception early.
"it was a little disturbing. from my perspective, i saw most of those people just a few hours ago. it couldn't have been easy for you, telling me the same story over and over again for twelve years."
i don't always tell it in detail.
"i hope i've told you before, but, i'm very grateful for everything you've done for me. if this works"
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead
we're ready.
i'm picking up an intermittent duranium signature.
is it a ship?
i'm not certain. it's in a close orbit around the sun.
we've better check it out. lay in a course.
increase to eight hundred millicochranes.
increase to eight fifty.
there's a small vessel just outside the chromosphere.
is it xindi?
the hull configuration doesn't match. there's one biosign on board.
open up a channel. this is captain charles tucker. is there something we can help you with?
he's moving.
follow him.
his warp coils are charging.
target one of his nacelles.
bring it into the launch bay.
"just as my simulations predicted. there's no trace of the parasites i targeted. well, i understand i may have a passenger on my voyage home."
i'm remaining at the settlement for the time being. he may need my help during his recovery.
have you told the captain how you feel about him? it's obvious you've become quite attached. it's nothing to be ashamed of. vulcan's experience the same emotions as any other species. they're simply better at hiding them.
i'm not hiding anything. he risked his life to save me. i'm merely repaying a debt.
"i can only imagine what it must have been like. spending all those years in that house, learning so much about him, yet he remembers nothing about you beyond the day he became ill. if we're successful, perhaps things will be different."
there's a discrepancy in these scans.
what is it?
i deal in rigelian flamegems. i was waiting for a prospective buyer when you attacked me.
you picked an odd place for a business transaction.
we searched your ship. we didn't find any cargo.
that's because i jettisoned it all. i thought you where going to arrest me. flamegems are illegal in this region.
we found your species in our vulcan database. it appears yridians are information dealers.
who hired you? was it the xindi?
xindi?
"maybe we didn't give his vessel a close enough look. go back to the launch bay, use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat little pieces. keep at it until you find some evidence that supports his story."
you're going to destroy my ship? it's not you they want. it's the denobulan.
phlox?
i was hired to follow him.
hired by who?
"i don't know, they work through intermediaries. i was paid to follow the denobulan if he ever left his home world."
what did you tell them? answer me.
what's the problem?
your engineers won't let us continue with the captain's treatment.
"those are my orders. look, i'd do anything to help the captain, but we've got bigger problems at the moment."
"this maybe the only solution to your problems, captain."
"destroying these parasites is most likely the key to saving humanity, and earth."
earth's gone.
"this image was taken a few minutes ago. you can see the region where i eradicated the first cluster of parasites. it's gone in this image, as well."
doc.
this scan was taken over twelve years ago. the cluster has disappeared from all the scans i've taken over the last twelve years. it's as if it never existed at all
"by destroying the organisms in the present, we appear to have neutralised them in the past."
"we know they're from another spatial domain. apparently, they also exist outside of time. if we can eliminate all of the parasites, it's possible the captain's infection will never have occurred."
history may be altered. captain archer will have remained in command of enterprise. our mission in the expanse could have an entirely different outcome.
we only have to divert power for a few hours. i am certain i can complete the procedure in that time.
i'm sorry. we need all the power we've got for the weapons.
if the xindi are on their way there's very little we can do to stop them..
"well, we can't just run up the white flag."
"bridge to captain tucker. you'd better get up here, sir."
i'm on my way. we'll talk about this later.
i'm getting a signal from one of our sentry probes. six xindi ships have entered the system.
charge the phase cannons. is everyone in position?
"aye, sir."
the xindi ships are in range.
fire!
our shields are holding. nice to know they work in combat.
remind me to send a note to general shran. adjust your heading. three one oh mark two seven. full impulse.
two of their ships are breaking off. they're following us.
what about the others?
still heading towards the planet.
the insectoid ship's been damaged. they're losing power.
target the second one.
their engine's disabled.
the other xindi ships have changed their heading.
i think we're going to find out how much of a beating these new shields can take.
"t'pol, what's happening?"
"jonathan, you need to rest. where are you going?"
to the bridge. i'm not going to just lie here while they destroy what's left of humanity.
you should remain here.
forward shielding's at fifty two percent.
turbolifts are down.
intrepid's taken a direct hit. they've lost their port nacelle.
tell them to withdraw.
our phase cannons are down. our forward shield's collapsing!
"hull breaches on b deck, c deck!"
they're targeting the bridge!
hard to port!
the bridge is gone.
t'pol to phlox.
go ahead.
meet us in engineering. we're going to finish the procedure.
understood.
we don't have time to worry about parasites right now.
that's not necessarily true. come with me. i'll explain.
"i'm sorry, captain. the chamber's been damaged."
didn't you say that we could destroy the parasites with a subspace implosion?
"yes, but then we"
can we create one?
we would have to overload three plasma injectors. that would send a feedback pulse through the reactor.
you'll destroy the ship?
"at this point, it won't make much of a difference. you two get to a shuttlepod. they're only after humans. if this doesn't work out you'll still have a chance. that's an order."
"with all due respect, you were relieved of command."
one of the plasma injectors was damaged. we'll have to replace it. they're in supply locker c on the upper level.
we're back in business.
phlox! phlox?
how much longer?
stand by.
how do you feel?
like a shuttlepod landed on my head. what's our status?
we've cleared the anomalies. there is minor damage to the starboard nacelle. repairs should be complete within an hour.
you suffered a mild concussion. i'd like to keep you overnight for observation.
"all right, doctor."
you could have been seriously injured. i told you to leave me behind.
"fortunately, i don't take orders from you."
i believe you wanted to see this.
rosemary's baby?
"you were obviously looking forward to it, and since you're not going to be able to attend tonight."
thanks. would you mind bringing me another pillow?
would you turn down the lights just a little?
anything else?
"you know, you'd make a wonderful nurse."
any last words?
go to hell.
i didn't know skags believed in hell.
who's paying for the box?
i hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery.
"his people don't bury their dead, but i wouldn't expect you to know that."
i'm sorry i didn't get there in time to stop them.
what difference would it have made?
he'd have gotten a trial.
and the same people who lynched him would have been sitting on the jury.
"bethany, he killed a man. self-defence or not, that's a hanging offence for a skag."
what have you got?
i've confirmed that they're human. their dna is a perfect match.
"looks pretty authentic, captain, right down to the spittoons."
"and the hangings. if these people are from earth, how the hell did they get here?"
archer to enterprise. report.
we've scanned ninety percent of the surface.
the human settlements are clustered within a few hundred kilometres of your location. about six thousand people.
and the aliens?
fewer than a thousand.
their closest encampment is ten kilometres north west of your present position.
"any signs of technology, energy signatures"
vessels?
"none, sir. our quantum scans put the earliest structures at over two hundred and fifty years old."
that sounds about right.
but they're all constructed of materials indigenous to the planet.
acknowledged. i want you to go check out that alien settlement. see what you can find. there's no telling how anyone would react if they find out who we really are. keep a low profile.
"aye, sir."
morning.
can i help you folks?
i hope so. we need a horse.
what happened to yours?
excuse me?
it's a long way from the next town. how'd you get here?
our horses perished several miles north of your town from heat exhaustion.
"well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you, or those skags."
"come on. this one here, four years old, good stock. twenty dollars, she's yours."
sounds kind of steep. don't suppose you'd be interested in a trade?
"well, that depends what you've got to trade."
"look, i know it's not worth the horse, but we only need him for a couple of hours. we just want to ride out and grab our gear. we'll be back before you know it. well, how about i leave my gun for collateral."
"you got yourself a deal, buddy."
do you have any experience riding these animals?
i've seen every john ford western.
who?
how hard can it be?
better hold on.
afternoon.
what can i get you?
i'm passing through town. i was hoping i could sit in here for a while till it cools down.
coffee's on the house.
thanks.
where're you headed?
my brother's got a ranch down south. he said he could set me up with some work.
"what's he raising, bluehorns?"
how'd you know?
land down there's not good for much else.
see the resemblance?
"yeah. yeah, i do. you're not telling me you're related to cooper smith?"
he's my ancestor.
i'll be damned.
yep. you're looking at the only direct descendant of the man who overthrew the skags.
i'll bet you've got some stories.
got a few i could tell you.
friends of yours?
not particularly.
how about a little service?
what'll it be?
anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday.
why don't you join us?
"you know i'm not allowed to do that, mister bennings."
"it's deputy bennings, and i can bend a local ordnance if i choose. have a seat.  i imagine you could use a drink, after what happened last night. let's raise a glass to the dearly departed. to dead skags."
drink up.
i thought you people could hold your liquor. your friend had a few in him the night he killed clay stanton.
he didn't drink.
beg your pardon?
i'd better get back to work.
"oh, no, wait a minute. i don't think i heard you right. you're telling me that a sober skag had the nerve to shoot a man? i find that hard to believe. maybe you could demonstrate."
"pick it up, shoot me right here between the eyes. this is your golden opportunity, don't pass it up."
"i know you'd like to kill me. that's what all you skags want, isn't it? go ahead, or maybe you need to finish that drink first."
excuse me. can i get some more coffee before you shoot him?
who the hell are you?
name's archer.
"well, mister archer, you could learn a thing or two about manners."
i don't like being interrupted in the middle of a conversation.
i'll keep that in mind.
is there a problem here?
i was just having a drink with our friend draysik and this gentleman decided to butt in.
i saw you this morning at the undertakers. what's your business here?
just passing through town.
this skag a friend of yours?
i just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee.
"it's a little hot for coffee, don't you think?"
maybe you're right.  it's been a pleasure.
"keep an eye on him. make sure he leaves town. and bennings, leave the skag alone."
i'd estimate this vessel has been here for at least two centuries.
where are you going?
the captain said to learn whatever we could.
he also said to keep a low profile.
i plan to.
didn't mean to startle you.
what do you want?
"my name's jonathan archer. i saw you this morning, paying for that man's casket."
"i don't know where you're from, mister archer, but around here no one refers to a skagaran as a man. if you'll excuse me."
can i help you with that?
i'll manage.
it's no trouble.
i'll ask you again. what do you want?
i'd like to learn more about the skagarans.
everyone knows about the skagarans.
there aren't any where i come from.
where's that?
"up north, quite a ways."
"if certain people had their ways there wouldn't be any around here either. i heard about what you did in the saloon today. deputy bennings has a nasty temper. why would your risk getting thrown in jail, maybe worse?"
i don't think that skagaran's life is any less valuable than mine.
"so, what do you want with me?"
"well, you are the teacher around here, aren't you? the first skagaran i ever saw was today, lying in that coffin. seems i'd be more likely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there."
would you like to meet more of them?
it's all right.
captain?
"bethany, these are the friends i told you about."
you're from up north too?
that's correct.
"the children will be here soon. you said you wanted to learn something, mister archer. you're welcome to stay for the lesson."
thanks.
kinda late at night to be teaching school.
it's illegal to teach skagarans.
a ship?
what's left of it.
we found these in a data module.
"go back to enterprise, see what you can salvage."
you're not coming with us?
don't want to miss my first day at school.
"nine times twelve, don't forget to carry the one. yral?"
nine times twelve equals one hundred and eight.
"that's right. you're doing very well with your multiplication tables. tomorrow night we'll start with something a little more challenging. long division. kret, collect the slates, please. i've brought a friend with me who'd like to learn more about your people. who can tell mister archer how the humans and the skagarans came to live together? taliyah?"
our ancestors took the humans from their planet and brought them here.
and why did they do that?
to make them work.
"but the humans didn't want to work for the skagarans, did they."
"no, we didn't."
"go on home now. go on, it's all right."
"i tried to warn you, bethany. teaching skags is a crime. you know that."
nobody's being hurt here.
"so you say, but i'm afraid the law is the law."
i thought you could bend the local ordnances.
"that's true, but this is one i have no intention of bending."
get away from me.
sheriff gave you a chance to leave town. you should have taken it.
"get away from there. go on, now."
best i can do.
thanks. what's going to happen to you know.
don't worry. this isn't the first time the sheriff and i haven't seen eye to eye.
you didn't get to finish your lesson. i'd like to hear the rest of it.
you know the story. everyone does.
"everyone seems to have their own version. i'm curious to hear the way you teach it to the skagarans. that wreck at their settlement, was that their ship?"
"they used it three hundred years ago to go to earth and bring our ancestors back here. they were building colonies, they needed workers."
you mean slaves.
it was a terrible crime.
tell me about cooper smith.
"that's where the stories differ somewhat. to the humans he's a folk hero, our liberator. i'm sure that's what you were taught. but the skagarans, they call him rakh'tar. it means butcher. he and his men burned the skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons. they murdered most of them. entire families. have you heard that version? smith wrote the first laws that kept the skagarans from going to school, owning property, even marrying."
so they could never enslave the humans again.
that's how they justified it. men like bennings are happy to carry on the tradition.
sheriff wants to talk to you.
"care for a shave, mister archer?"
no thanks.
you sure? there ain't nothing like a barber shave to make a man feel civilised.
i feel civilised enough.
suit yourself. thanks henry.
"any time, sheriff."
"have a seat. skagaran whisky. it's illegal, but i've let henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth."
packs a hell of a wallop.  i thought you were heading south to raise bluehorns.
that's the plan.
then maybe you can tell me why you were out in skagtown in the middle of the night.
that a crime?
my deputy says you and miss bethany were teaching those children. that's a crime.
"but if i decided to lynch a skagaran, that'd be legal?"
the law was laid down a long time ago to protect men like you and me.
protect us from what? children?
"you really want those children to learn how to read, how to do their numbers, and then maybe they can learn about how they used to be in charge around here. how they had guns that could kill a man with a beam of light, and the human beings were nothing but their labour force, their property. is that what you want those children to learn, mister archer?"
you're judging them on something that happened over two hundred years ago.
"and it's my job to make sure it never happens again. now, i'm not saying it's fair. it's just the way it's always been. i expect you to be out of town in an hour."
what's going to happen to bethany?
she's been warned. she knew the consequences. minimum sentence is ten years.
archer to enterprise.
go ahead
captain.
any luck with those data modules?
"several of them were damaged, but we managed to access some of the logs."
"i'm still working on the translation, sir."
i'll meet you at the landing coordinates in an hour.
there's something i have to do first.
i was on my way out of town and realised i forgot something.
what are you doing?
it's called a jail break where i come from.
"it's called that here, too. where do you expect me to go?"
there are other settlements. i'm sure they could use a good teacher.
things won't be any different there.
"maybe not, but you won't be spending ten years in prison."
it was archer.
they couldn't have gotten far. get nash and franklin.
archer to enterprise. lock the transporter onto my position. there are two of us.
"drop that, whatever it is."
did anyone see you transport?
i didn't exactly have time to find a secluded spot.
these are volatile and suspicious people. your disappearance may have consequences.
"i've removed the projectile, but her injuries were extensive."
will she make it?
i believe so. there are a few things about her physiology i still don't understand.
what do you mean?
"aren't you familiar with this woman's ancestry? the cranial genes are recessive, which explains her human appearance. my guess is they came from her maternal grandmother. she's one quarter skagaran."
you heard the story same as me. cooper smith said the skags could move through thin air from one place to another.
"maybe you ought to get your eyes checked, bennings. archer's a human."
he's working with them.
you don't know that.
what was he doing out in skagtown? why'd he stick up for draysik in the saloon yesterday?
'cause you were being a horse's ass.
"and who was he talking to on that little box he had? it was the skags. they helped him escape. this is what we were afraid of, mac. they'd try to take over again. it's time to put an end to this."
you have something in mind?
i say we ride out there tonight and burn 'em out. i guarantee there'll be plenty of volunteers.
"now you listen to me. i'm not going to murder those people just because some stranger spooked you with a parlour trick. now if i get some proof that the skagarans are up to something, i'll take care of it."
"you've always been too soft on them, mac."
"and you've always harassed them while i've looked the other way, and that's going to change right now. as long as you work for me, our job is to enforce the law. understood?"
understood.
"the story she told you was basically true, captain. the skagaran ship brought them here to provide labour for a colony they were trying to establish."
they apparently found the humans suited to survive in this environment.
"there are a lot of reports of disciplinary problems, and then six months after they arrived, the logs end."
they kidnapped the wrong people.
so what do we do? they're humans. we can't just leave them here.
we can't transport six thousand people back to earth.
"once we've dealt with the xindi we'll come back here. do what we can to help them. for now, they deserve to know that earth hasn't abandoned them."
we need to talk.
and you were born there?
"i was born in up-state new york. spent most of my adult life in san francisco, though. you've heard of san francisco?"
pacific coast. why didn't you tell us who you were?
i wasn't sure how you'd react. we thought we'd better get the lay of the land first.
"well, i can't say i blame you. a part of me never believed earth even existed. i thought it was something people made up because they couldn't stand living here. you taking us back?"
"we can't, not right now. anyway, our ship isn't big enough. someday we'll come back for you. you, you realise it's not the same world your ancestor's left. a lot's changed in three hundred years."
you're telling me.
"we've moved past things like intolerance, prejudice."
"the skagarans abducted my ancestors, captain. turned them into slaves."
that was a long time ago.
"well, we tend to have a long memory when it comes to that sort of thing."
the captain's been in there quite a while.
i imagine the sheriff has a lot of questions.
yeah.
we did what we had to do.
"i understand, but if you do make it back to earth you're going to have to leave all that behind."
it's all right. these folks aren't going to hurt anybody.
"this is my first officer, t'pol. she's from a planet called vulcan."
pleased to meet you.
ma'am.
doctor phlox reports that his patient is doing much better.
good. i thought we'd bring mister maccready
have your men drop those guns.
"let's talk this through, bennings."
i never was one for talking.
"trust me, you don't want to pick a fight with us, deputy."
should have thought of that when you threw in with the skags.
we're not taking sides here.
then where'd you get that machine and those weapons?
"these people are from earth, bennings."
earth? you're lying.
i can prove it to you. just give me a chance.
lay down some fire.
stay back. i'll kill her.
secure the area.  find the captain.
"we're up too high to see it but your town is down there, towards the right edge of that mountain range. how are you feeling?"
i feel fine. not even a scar.
doctor phlox does excellent work.
"you must think we're barbaric. all the things humanity's accomplished, building ships like this, travelling to other world, and we're still down there shooting each other."
"the progress on earth, it didn't happen overnight."
"but it was progress all the same. you've managed to change, we haven't. even if you could take us back, i don't think we're ready."
"it may be a while before we're able to start sending ships here. my guess is, by the time they arrive they'll find things have changed."
i think you're giving us too much credit.
"it's happening already. i spoke with maccready. he agrees that, in light of recent events some of your laws might be a little outdated."
"before people could travel through space to other planets, they had to get off the ground first. almost forty years after my human ancestors left earth, two brothers from ohio became the first human beings to build a successful flying machine. their names were orville and wilbur wright. would anyone like to see a picture of their airplane? you all would. well, here it is, right here, and you can see here's orville wright, and his brother wilbur is flying the plane. now this is the machine that actually made"
"the most difficult task facing any captain, any crew, is the loss of a shipmate. we've come here to honour one of our own. in the time we knew him, he showed us just how much one life can truly matter. we will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved so much. we will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on this ship, but for all the citizens of earth."
"we just reroute the system taps, compress the antimatter stream before it reaches the injectors."
that will stabilise the warp field?
every simulation i run comes back with the same result. we'll be able to cruise at warp five point oh with no field fluctuation. i'm talking about a ride so smooth you could build a house of cards on the warp reactor.
"if we can maintain high warp for extended periods, we can cover the expanse more quickly."
which boosts our chances of finding the xindi weapon in time.
to the left.
"oh, sorry. you get me talking about the engines and i forget where i am. don't know what it is about fine-tuning a piece of machinery."
lie on your back.
"you know, you made this sound a whole lot worse than it is."
advanced neuro-pressure can place great demands on the body.
"well, i have to say that so far, it's a piece of cake."
we haven't gotten to the more challenging postures.
"well, i'm always up for a challenge."
breathe.
tucker to the bridge.
archer.
we're all set down here.
i'll need at least four point nine
to get the plasma hot enough to compress the stream.
"you heard the man, travis. four point nine."
"aye, sir. four point five, four point six, four point seven, four point eight."
the warp field is fluctuating.
four point nine.
initialising stream compression.
"damn, that's a beautiful sound."
field fluctuations have dropped to zero.
we just got our second wind.
something's flooding the intake manifolds.
drop to impulse.
i've lost helm control.
"trip, status."
i've got a primary injector flare.
"i'm shutting down. it's not responding, captain."
the flare is causing a system-wide overload.
fires reported on b and c deck. emergency crews en route.
helm control is still down.
analysis.
"some kind of polaric field, approximately eleven thousand kilometres in diameter. composition unknown. i'll need more time to complete a detailed scan."
is that what stopped us?
it's a logical conclusion.
keep scanning.
"numerous injuries throughout the ship. mostly minor, except for one. commander tucker. he's been taken to sickbay."
the nucleonic particles are being drawn to the hull.
polarise the hull plating.
"i already tried that, sir. no effect."
then purge the intake manifolds and shut all the exhaust ports.
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead.
would you come down to sickbay?
on my way. run a full sensor scan. i want to know what we're dealing with.
"aye, sir."
report.
"when we entered the field nucleonic particles flooded the manifolds, causing the injector flare. if commander tucker hadn't shut down the reactor, we could have had a breach."
how much time before we can get the engines back online?
we're still running diagnostics. the damage is significant. it could take weeks. commander tucker's going to have his hands full.
you'll be supervising the repairs. i've just come from sickbay. trip's in a coma. he has extensive neural damage. doctor phlox says we have to prepare for the possibility that trip won't survive.
how is he?
"his condition's unchanged. i'd like to show you something. this is one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie, a lyssarrian desert larvae. it's epidermal layers secrete a viral suppressant that i use as a salve for cuts and bruises."
how does this relate to trip?
"the larvae have another, somewhat more controversial, property. when implanted with the dna from another species it exactly replicates that species' life-cycle, albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate."
it becomes a clone.
"essentially, but one that is born, grows old and dies in approximately fifteen days. the lyssarrians call them mimetic simbiots. they're a closely guarded secret. very few people know of their existence."
and you want to do this with trip. use his dna to grow a simbiot.
"to harvest it's neural tissue for transplant. there's no guarantee that human dna will stimulate the larvae's growth cycle, but as it stands now it may be commander tucker's only hope for survival. to ensure the tissue's compatibility, i'll have to wait until the simbiot reaches commander tucker's present physical age, then i can excise the tissue from a non-critical region of the simbiot's cerebral region. it would experience no discernable side effects and should be able to live out it's normal life span."
it's fifteen day life span.
"i don't make this proposal lightly, captain, but i'm obligated to provide you with all available options."
come in.
"we sent out an ev team. they retrieved a sample of the substance accumulating on the hull. multiple hits with a plasma rifle were required to dislodge it. it's composed of highly charged particles, mostly ferric ions, but there are several elements that we can't identify.  and it's highly magnetic. so far, the danger to the ship seems negligible."
"but the longer we remain in the field, the more these particles build up. do whatever you have to do, but we need to get those engines back online."
"understood. regarding the lyssarrian procedure doctor phlox proposed, may i ask if you've reached a decision?"
i approved it.
are you aware that the lyssarrian prime conclave has banned the creation of simbiots?
we don't answer to the lyssarrian prime conclave.
"simbiots are living, conscious entities. we'll be growing a sentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue."
"i'm aware of the ethical implications. if we weren't in the expanse maybe my decision would be different, but we've got to complete this mission. earth needs enterprise, enterprise needs trip. it's as simple as that."
"it's rather sensitive to light at this stage. by tomorrow morning, if all goes well, we'll have a healthy baby boy on our hands."
"perfect genetic duplicate, right down to the birthmark on his right side."
he certainly sounds healthy.
and hungry. excuse me.
"there, there. oh, it's been some time since i've had a new-born, but i see i haven't lost my touch."
"three days ago he was just another one of your creatures, something you kept on a shelf."
he's certainly come a long way in a short time.
in a short time he'll be a lot older. have you thought of where he's going to live?
"why not right here? i can't think of a more stimulating environment for a developing young mind, and i'd be able to keep a close watch on his development."
sounds like you've found yourself a new roommate.
"now all i need to do is find him a name. the crew's been offering suggestions but nothing sounds right. steven, enrique, dennis. dennis? you see my dilemma?"
i'm sure you'll think of something.
chief medical officer's log. after much deliberation i have finally thought of a name for this newest addition to our crew.
"it's all right, sim. it's all right."
"lucky for me denobulans require little sleep. i'm at a loss as to how human adults endure the rem cycle interruptions that accompany the teething stage. though i knew what to expect, i can't help but be astonished by sim's rapid physical development. a side note, i may have stumbled across an effective fertiliser for my orsic fern."
those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of it's a - app - appearance.
that's very good.
can we just skip to the part where the martian machines attack?
we just showed you this book. how do you know about the martian machines?
my mum read it to me.
your mum?
uh huh. i think it's chapter ten.
it's become quite evident that sim's remarkable scholastic progress goes far beyond an aptitude for learning.
he's remembering things that happened to trip when trip was this age.
"so the older he grows, the more of trip's life he'll recall?"
"there are some species that rely solely on genetic sequencing to pass on their cultural memories. evidently, humans have a similar capacity. this could be an important discovery. he certainly possesses commander tucker's curiosity. this morning he took apart my medical tricorder."
he's starting to look like trip.
and he's beginning to ask questions. where did i come from? where's my mother and father? why am i here?
it's only been three days and he's already beginning to realise how different he is.
"he's going to have to be told the truth, soon."
i gave the order that created him. i should be the one to explain why.
whoa! where do you think you're off to?
i was trying to teach him to fetch.
"now, don't take it personally. fetching isn't his style."
"i'm sorry, captain. i was in the middle of giving porthos his physical. i only turned my back for a moment."
: it's all right. is he okay?
"yes, indeed. he's in peak physical condition. which is more than i can say for myself."
it's almost time for his dinner.  do you want to help me feed him?
sure.
come on.
there's nothing porthos likes more than dinnertime.
can he do any tricks?
"i haven't taught him any. mostly what he does is eat, sleep, and not fetch. just fill it up half way."
"okay. i used to have a dog. his name was bedford. he was so big, i could ride him like a horse."
is that right.
that's zephram cochrane. he invented warp drive.
"that's right, he did."
doctor phlox says your dad helped design the warp five engine.
"that's a picture of him right there, and this is me on my first day of flight school."
did you always want to be a starship captain?
as long as i can remember.
why?
it's what i was meant to do.
bet it's a fun job.
it has its moments. let me show you something.
keep the nose up. that's right.
it pulls a little to the left.
trim the port aileron.
"that feels better. my dad says i should be an engineer. my mum thinks i should study architecture, but i want to do what you do, be a starship captain. you know what's weird?"
what?
"my parents call me trip, but everyone here calls me sim. where's my mum and dad? are they back on earth?"
that's a little difficult to answer.
it's broken.
nothing a little glue won't remedy. i crashed it plenty of times myself.
i miss my parents.
come with me.
doctor phlox says i'm not allowed to go in there.
it's okay.
he's trip.
that's right.
"my parents. they're not really mine, they're his."
yes.
"so, that time i put a garden snake in lizzie's dollhouse, that wasn't me."
no.
so i'm just some kind of copy of him.
"you're more than that, sim. you have trip's memories, but you also have your own memories, the ones you're making here on enterprise."
how long have i lived here?
you were born only four days ago.
i feel older.
"it's hard to understand, i know. there's part of you, something inside you, that trip needs. doctor phlox is going to have to perform an operation."
will it hurt?
not at all. you won't feel a thing.
doctor's always say that.
"when phlox says it, it's the truth."
can we go fix the model now?
sure.
wave guides for the primary port bypass. think i've made some progress.
this looks promising.
they're showing 'a night at the opera' tonight. marx brothers. wondered if you're planning to go.
i'll be reviewing the field coil equations. they need to be finished in time for tomorrow's reactor test.
oh. what about dinner? want to grab a bite?
"i appreciate the offer, but i'm afraid i have to work late into the evening. ensign massaro is running a diagnostic on the plasma assembly. i'd like you to assist her."
"yes, ma'am. it's because i'm different, isn't it? the reason you don't want to do anything with me. i guess it must be weird, being with someone like me. five days ago i was wearing diapers."
"i simply believe that our attention should be focused on the ship's engines, at least until the current situation is resolved."
i probably won't be around after the current situation's resolved.
archer to t'pol.
go ahead.
would you please come to my ready room.
on my way.
warp drive should be functional in two weeks.
i'm afraid that won't be soon enough.
"sir, i"
"according to malcolm, the accumulation on the hull is generating a diamagnetic field. it's having a dampening effect. the more the particulate builds up, the more powerful the field becomes. in another four days every system on the ship will be offline. if we don't make it out of here by then, we never will."
key lime pie.
i suddenly realised it was my favourite dessert. now i know why.
do these memories just come to you?
"the older i get, the more i remember. it's like i've lived this whole other life. can't explain it."
i can't imagine it. you wanted to ask me about something.
"yeah, i did. do you think it's possible to redirect the phase cannons so they can fire back onto the hull?"
i suppose so. why?
i want to try and blast off enough of that particulate so we can open up the launch bay doors.
is someone planning on going somewhere?
"all we need to do is build up enough momentum to can get the ship out of here, right?"
right.
"well, we've got two perfectly good engines sitting in the launch bay. if we string a couple of grappler lines between the shuttlepods and the ship we can tow ourselves clear."
the shuttlepods don't generate that kind of thrust. we'd never build up enough momentum to get clear of the field in time.
leave that to me.
can i come in? did you have a chance to look at my calculations?
i reviewed them thoroughly.
and?
a fusion overburn has never been attempted with a shuttlepod engine.
that doesn't mean it won't work.
"i agree. despite the risks, i believe it's our best option."
so you're going to recommend the plan to the captain?
i already have. was there something else?
you and trip used to spend a lot of time here together.
i was instructing him in the practice of vulcan neuro-pressure.
"i remember. we were lying right there, working the neural nodes on each other's feet, talking about the warp engines. how i was hoping to modify them."
how commander tucker was hoping to modify them.
"right. commander tucker. you know, he was really starting to enjoy those sessions with you."
they were helping him sleep.
i'm not sure that's the only reason.
what do you mean?
was there ever anything between you and trip?
"if you're referring to a romantic relationship, no."
"the reason i ask is, well, you're all i think about, if you know what i mean. and i'm not talking about an adolescent crush. that was, well, that was two days ago. this is much more serious, the way i feel about you. anyway, what's driving me crazy is, i don't know if these feelings are mine or his."
i can't answer that.
i didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
i'm not uncomfortable.
"i just thought i should tell you this, while i still had the chance."
come in.
i want to pilot one of the shuttlepods.
that's out of the question.
it's my plan. i think i should have a say in how it's implemented.
this is a dangerous procedure. you've never flown a shuttlepod before.
"yes, i have. trip has thousands of hours of flying time and i have his memories."
i can't jeopardise this ship on the strength of those memories. mayweather and reed will pilot the shuttlepods. i want you to co-ordinate from the bridge. t'pol will assist you.
"you're worried something'll happen to me, aren't you. you want to make sure i'm around because you need part of my brain."
"yeah, that's part of it."
so your concern for my safety is really about saving trip.
my main concern is that this plan work. if we don't make it out of here in the next six hours it won't matter if trip survives or not. we'll all be dead.
i've realigned the targeting scanners. they're set for close proximity.
phase cannons are charged and ready.
try the doors.
they're still frozen.
archer to shuttlepods one and two.
you are clear to launch.
acknowledged.
shuttlepod two. acknowledged.
whenever you're ready.
set the overrun ratio. we'll start at oh point one seven five.
acknowledged.
oh point one seven five.
prepare to initiate on my mark. now.
one thousand kilodynes.
thrust vector holding steady.
come on.
two thousand kilodynes. engine temperature's rising.
i'm reading zero forward momentum.
two thousand five hundred kilodynes.
engine temperature's nearing critical.
we're still not moving.
come on.
increase the overburn ratio another
thirty percent.
captain?
go ahead.
increasing thirty percent.
i've got a temperature warning light.
i'm reading five hundred degrees above critical.
their systems are overloading.
sim.
a few more seconds.
they won't last a few seconds.
"sorry, sim. archer to the shuttlepods."
we're moving. point six two kilometres per hour.
twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating.
how much do we need?
at this speed we'll emerge from the field in six point one hours.
that's good enough. archer to shuttlepods one and two. come on home.  well done.
thanks captain.
you wanted to see me?
there's been a development.
i'm listening.
sim won't survive the transplant.
you told me you could remove the tissue without harming him.
"that assessment was based on simbiots grown from lyssarrian dna. my tests on sim show that human based simbiots are not as resilient. if i excise the quantity of neural tissue i need to save commander tucker, sim will die. i'm sorry, captain."
your shift ended ninety minutes ago.
just want to get these initiators in place.
you've been working for eighteen straight hours.
"if you had five days left, would you spend them sleeping? besides, tomorrow morning i'm walking into sickbay to donate some of my unneeded neural tissue. which means that pretty soon i'll be answering to the real trip, and if i know him, he's going to want these engines in as good a shape as they can be."
i haven't commended you on the successful implementation of your plan. you saved the ship.
i appreciate that.
lyssarrian desert larva.
"i wanted to learn something about my own species, so i've been doing a little research. mostly on lifespans. did you know that at one time in history human beings lived an average of only thirty five years? the average vulcan lifespan was only forty?"
your point?
just that both species expend a lot of effort to change those statistics. i guess it's just natural for people to want to stick around for as long as possible.
"why not give up my life? i've only got five, six days left anyway."
that isn't how we see it.
"let me ask you something, doc. when you researched lyssarrian larvae did you come across any references to the velandran circe?"
they were a group of lyssarrian scientists who conducted illegal experiments on simbiots. they claimed to have developed an enzyme that stopped the rapid aging process.
is there any truth to it?
why do you think he kept it a secret?
doctor?
"the enzyme is experimental, with very little empirical evidence to suggest that it works. that's why i didn't mention it."
"there's not much evidence, but it exists. the fact is, i may not have to grow old and die in a week. there's a chance that i can live out a normal lifespan. i can't change what happened to him but maybe i can change what's going to happen to me."
come in.
how long have you been staying here?
"i was on the way to my room last night, but i came here instead."
these are trip's quarters.
"which is where i belong. i have his memories, i have his feelings, i have his body. how am i not trip?"
commander tucker is lying in sickbay.
then what am i? just something you grew in a lab? does that make it easier for you to condemn me to death?
if you refuse to go through with this you'll be condemning trip to death.
i didn't put him in a coma.
"no, but you can save him."
"in a way i will, by saving myself."
phlox says there's almost no chance that the enzyme will work.
my life is at stake! any chance is worth taking.
but at what cost? it'll take a day to synthesise the enzyme. by that time your neural tissue won't be compatible with trip's anymore. he'll die.
i know.
i can't let that happen.
"so what are you going to do? drag me down to sickbay, force me onto a biobed at gunpoint?"
"if you truly have all of trip's memories, you know the answer to that. i don't have to tell you what's at stake. i must complete this mission, and to do that i need trip. trip! i'll take whatever step's necessary to save him."
even if it means killing me.
even if it means killing you.
you're not a murderer.
don't make me one.
i was wondering if there's anything i can still do. maybe there's a panel i can install or something. i've got a few hours to kill before my operation.
you wish to spend your last hours in engineering?
why not? the two things i care most about are in this room.
"if you'd like, the a3 injector port needs replacing."
i'll get right on it.
what's the problem?
someone's rerouted the launch bay controls. we're shut out.
archer to the launch bay. come in.
"captain, i'm reading one person in there."
i was all ready to do it.
what stopped you?
"where the hell was i going to go? we're nowhere near any habitable planet. didn't really want to spend the rest of my life floating around in a shuttlepod which doesn't even have any toilet facilities. can you imagine a lousier way to spend your old age? cooped up in that thing, peeing in a bottle? actually, i can imagine a worse fate."
what would that be?
"being stuck in there with malcolm. damn, this is a screwed up situation."
i can't argue with you there.
"a lifetime in eight days. it's not that i'm scared of dying, it's just that i can't imagine not being here tomorrow. you want to know what really stopped me?"
what?
my sister. and she was my sister as much as trip's.
i believe that.
i don't want what happened to her to happen to anyone else.
that's why i gave the order to create you.
"do me a favour when this is over. if commander tucker decides to do any more modifications to the engines, tell him to watch his ass."
yes.
we're ready for you.
on my way.
may i come in? i just wanted to say how much your absence will affect the crew. how much it will affect me.
"i appreciate that. all in all, i guess i've had a pretty good life."
i couldn't have asked for a better going away present.
"i'm sorry i doubted you, doc."
no need to apologise.
"i'm serious. you see, i don't just remember trip's childhood, i remember mine. you made a damn good father."
you were a damn good son.
"you said to me once that commanding a starship was what you meant to do. i guess this is what i was meant to do. good luck, captain."
thanks.
you owe me one.
"we will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved so much. we will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on this ship, but for all the citizens of earth."
hello?
have you made your selection?
"yeah, yeah, it's all set, just like we discussed."
we'll be expecting you.
"and the money, same as last time, right?"
the same. be careful with the sedative. you nearly killed the last one.
"one hundred milligrams. don't worry, i'll get it right."
we'll be expecting you.
"looking for a date, honey?"
maybe with your friend.
you don't know what you're missing.
"ooo, what can i do for you, sweetheart?"
"hey, i know you from this morning. you brought me the apple juice."
what?
at the clinic?
"oh, yeah. now i remember. small world, huh?"
want me to get in?
"sure, yeah."
"bye, girl. see you tomorrow."
there's a nice place to park right in the neighbourhood. turn left at the next light.
"georgia tandy, o negative."
how the hell would you remember that?
"er, it's another two blocks."
"if that's drugs, i am not interested. what you got in there?"
come here.
there you go. there you go.
it's okay. they said they won't hurt you.
yes?
loomis.
"there you go, nice and comfy."
good boy. cheese?
this is your last piece.
"it's okay. how've you been, jon?"
"about time you showed up. our mission's changed quite a bit since the last time i saw you, but i suppose you're aware of it."
i am.
maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me. the xindi weapon would be a good place to start.
we don't know any more than you do.
i thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping an eye on the time line. you're from the thirtieth century. hasn't all this happened already?
history doesn't mention anything about a conflict between humans and xindi.
how could that be?
the events that are taking place are the result of temporal incursions. they are not supposed to be happening.
but they are happening.
"yes, they are, but the outcome hasn't reached us yet. it takes a while for changes to ripple through the time line."
"the time traveller, the man the suliban worked for."
what about him?
he's the one who told us about the weapon being built. should i believe him?
you have no reason not to.
you said i'm supposed to play some crucial part in history. does this have something to do with it?
"i wish i could say that it does, but i don't know. i told you, none of this was supposed to happen."
you're not being very helpful. why are you here?
we've detected three xindi where they're not supposed to be.
this expanse is filled with xindi.
"i'm not talking about the expanse. i'm talking about detroit, michigan, a hundred and fifty years ago."
"sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait."
come in.
i just had a visit from daniels. i think all your doubts about time travel are about to go out the window.
meaning?
daniels and his team have discovered three reptilians on earth in the early twenty first century. he wants to send us back to find out what they're doing.
us?
"he told me i could bring one person, no more."
"if daniels is the time traveller he claims to be, why doesn't he find our for himself?"
it took him a long while to get permission to interact with me. there are clearances. he said it would take too much time.
i would think he would have all the time in the world.
"he said the three xindi travelled to earth from our century. they've been there for two months. they're not sight-seeing, t'pol. we have to find out what they're up to."
how are we supposed to accomplish this?
"he wants us to meet him in the command centre at oh eight hundred tomorrow.  come on, boy. check the database. find something to wear that won't stand out in 2004."
last time daniels sent you to another century you had one hell of a time getting back.
"he gave me this, said he'd return us whenever we signalled him."
these are temporal tags. we can use them to bring back anything that doesn't belong there.
"if anyone asks where you went, what should i tell them? with two shuttlepods in the bay it'll be hard to explain."
i'm sure you'll think of something. try to stay out of trouble.
you too.
here's the duty roster.
we just travelled ninety light years back to earth.
and a hundred and fifty years into the past.
forgive me if i'm not entirely convinced.
you will be. come on.
this one has a motion activated security system. this one too.
we're in.
this apparatus. it appears to have been designed to incapacitate the vehicle.
"sunday, the tri-state speedway, an all-star line-up of all your favourite monster mayhem."
have you ever operated a vehicle from this period?
i can pilot a starship. r n d 2 3 4.
i suggest you begin with two.
foot controls.
i don't believe you've activated your external lighting.
what year is that map from?
2002. it was the closest i could find in the starfleet database.
the layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years.
turn starboard on twenty fourth street.
"if that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres, how far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city?"
"i have created a search grid that requires a journey of approximately eighty kilometres, but it's probably we'll find them before we complete it."
what's that icon?
it's a gasoline pump. we need to get fuel.
where?
where isn't the problem. we're going to need money. us currency.
that's going to be difficult at this time of night.
not necessarily.
people used to go to jail for this.
we'll return what we don't use.
yeah?
are you vaughan strode?
who are you?
i'm from the blood bank. we had a screw-up this afternoon. we gave you the wrong papers to sign.
i'm not giving the money back.
"no, no, no, they don't want the money back. in fact. they're going to pay you again. twenty five bucks. they just need you to sign the right papers."
you bring them?
"no, they wouldn't let me. you've got to do it in front of the supervisor. you know, the fat broad that paid you. they sent me to drive you down."
it's eleven o'clock at night.
"yeah, i know. they want to send your blood work out first thing in the morning and they can't do it without the right paperwork. you want the twenty five bucks or not?"
this going to take long? i don't want to miss conan.
were they aware at this time that earth's supply of fossil fuel was nearing depletion?
"they had been for thirty years, but it wasn't until 2061 that they finally"
"one kilometre, straight ahead."
second structure from the left. three xindi biosigns.
any humans?
"five, in another part of the building."
"this doesn't look very residential. set your phase pistol to kill. when the reptilians boarded enterprise, stun had no effect. see what you can find out. i'll look over there."
go ahead.
there's a neutronic power source coming from the first floor.
i've found a gate with an electric locking mechanism. we shouldn't have a problem. do you see the vehicle?
i see it.
yes?
loomis.
did you disinfect your hands?
"i insert ivs all day, i told you that. if there are any infections here it won't be because of me. you forget something?"
we've decided to compensate you for the final three patients in one payment.
"well, that's not what we agreed. you said i'd get paid for each one."
bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated.
"we should wait a while, a few more days at least. there was something on the news. cops are starting to get some complaints that people have gone missing."
we can't wait a few more days. we need the last two.
"look, as soon as they figure out that all these people here have been to the clinic, it won't take a rocket scientist to point the finger at me."
then i suggest you finish your work quickly.
"look, i don't know what you guys are up to, and i don't want to know. it's not my business. but the cops don't take kindly to people who help terrorists. i gotta be real careful."
"we will double your fee for the final three, but the last two must be here by tomorrow."
"double? tomorrow? yeah, all right. i'll have them here by tomorrow."
here he comes.
"ninth floor.  two hundred and eighty pounds.  william myers, second floor."
and the man in the wheelchair. why were you bringing him to an abandoned factory in the middle of the night?
i swear i don't know what you're talking about.
what's this?
"oh, i took that from the clinic. i work at the blood bank on porter street. check with them, they'll tell you. i've been there for over a year."
why would you take it?
make a few extra bucks. there's plenty of people on the street looking for that stuff.
really. why would anyone on the street be interested in acquiring methohexitol?
you make it a habit of climbing out your window when someone knocks on the door?
i don't like cops.
tell us about your friends on carpenter street.
i've never been to carpenter street.
you were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair. now tell me who's inside that factory.
"i told you, i don't know what you're talking about. i think it's time you find me a lawyer."
untie him.
you heard him. untie me.
that's better.
i didn't feel right doing that with you tied up. carpenter street.
you're not allowed to hit me.
untie him again.
"no, no, no, no, wait a minute! wait a minute! wait a minute, i don't know who he is, i swear to god. a doctor, maybe. says he's working on a vaccine, experimental. he doesn't have approval or something like that so he needed me to bring him people."
does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research is being conducted in an abandoned factory?
"i thought about that. just tonight, i thought maybe he's some kind of terrorist. but i swear if i knew that for a fact i never would have agreed to help him."
"in one individual we've managed to find the worst qualities of this era. greed, violence, moral corruption."
but he said he wasn't going to hurt anybody. i just saw them an hour ago. they're all okay.
how many?
"five. no, no, six. the wheelchair guy was number six."
how did this doctor find you.
"i told you, i work at the blood bank. he wanted someone from every blood type. eight blood types, eight people. he figured i had access to that kind of information."
did he also figure that you'd have no compunctions about abducting people?
what's he paying you?
"five thousand apiece, double for the last three."
is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century?
"i told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them."
what does he look like?
"he only calls me on the phone. i saw him a couple of times, but he stays in the shadows. you know, he's kind of tall, that's all i can tell you. why don't you let me go. i swear to you, i will never do it again."
"you are going to do it again. that is, if you have any hope of staying out of prison."
what are you talking about?
"these two files, ab positive and b negative, they're the final two?"
yeah.
"well, then you're looking at your next victim, a healthy male with b negative blood."
"if you think you're going to be in there a long time, we should get something to eat first."
be quiet.
"come on, i'm not talking about anything fancy. a burger, a taco? there's a drive-through less than a mile from here. cops have to eat, don't they? what is the matter with you two? i'll pay."
i told you to be quiet.
what side of the street is it on?
"welcome to burgerland. how may i serve you, sir?"
"i'll have the double superbeef, no lettuce."
"one double superbeef without lettuce, please."
you can make that a triple for only forty cents extra.
do it.
a double will be fine.
would you like to make that a combo?
"yeah, fries and a medium root beer."
will there be anything else today?
"a hamburger, ketchup only."
you can make that a double for only forty cents extra.
"no, thank you."
would you like to make that a combo?
"no, no combo."
will there be anything else today?
does the fiesta salad contain animal products?
"no, but we can add three strips of bacon for only seventy five cents more."
"nothing for me, thank you."
you're sure?
quite.
"you guys don't mind, do you? i'm starving. you know, it'd make it a lot easier if you'd untie my hands. it's not like i'm going anywhere."
do the best you can.
"uh oh, i told you. let me get that for you. oh boy."
"you're a veggie, i forgot. why don't you take a fry, they're probably okay. have it your way."
they'll come in to take fresh blood samples every hour. they re-administer the sedative every six hours. i recommend you do whatever you're going to do before then.
number seven.
which one is it?
"b, b negative. you'll have ab positive by tomorrow night, i swear."
make certain i do.
engage the engine and proceed to the second location.
nice ray gun. am i supposed to believe that thing's for real?
drive.
ten grand a piece for the last three and i'm not going to see a penny of it.
don't speak until we're out of visual range.
fifteen millilitres from the new arrival.
"you catch these guys and i get immunity, right. we're not talking about copping to a lesser charge."
when my associate returns we'll discuss the details.
"hey, i'm taking a big chance here, okay? if your associate doesn't catch them, they're going to come looking for me, okay? you two have to keep your word."
you've been abducting people for money and you're questioning our honesty?
sit back.
"relax, just getting a smoke."
what are you doing?
"i don't know about you, honey, but i'm a little tense. know what i mean?"
extinguish that now!
"if you want some air, open your window."
now.
stay exactly where you are.
t'pol.
they brought a bio-reactor with them. they're synthesising some kind of viral agent.
rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon. this could be it.
why would they travel back through time?
daniels said they might be hiding from someone.
the past seems like a pretty good place to hide.
we've got to keep them from getting it back to our time.
are you in a position to disable all three of them?
"i don't know. i was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor, but i could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city."
"they must have some kind of temporal beacon. if you can destroy it, they'll have no way of getting back."
i've got to find it first.
modify your scanner to a delta band frequency. that should help you locate the signal from the temporal beacon.
they've gone out the west door. they could be headed for the street. they have the virus.
t'pol.
"yes, captain."
they're in the west alley way north of the main
building. i could use some help.
acknowledged.
drive.
trouble?
drive.
pull over and stop here.
they give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it do you.
lower your window.
i knew your partner's plan wouldn't work.
be quiet. they're coming.
stop!
come on.
he's trying to release the toxin.
we've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century. perhaps he has no other choice.
"if he's trying to destroy humanity, he's not going to be able to do it with that. they only modified the virus for six blood types."
"if they can infect three quarters of earth's population, it's unlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future."
let's hope he can't see in the dark. keep laying down fire.
don't move a muscle. drop it. why a second weapon? where were you going to take it?
we won't allow you to destroy us. your species is doomed.
let's go.
"problem, sir?"
it's done.
sir?
archer to lieutenant reed.
go ahead.
get a team down to the command centre on the double.
aye sir.
wait here for malcolm. have everything brought to cargo bay two. i've got to get this to phlox.
what's going on?
come with me.
get out of the car.
he's on something.
get out of the car.
keep your hands where we can see them.
come on. come on.
what's going on?
"hey, hey, hey, i didn't do anything."
we got a tip says you did.
you're just lucky all six of them are still alive.
"those two cops who came to my place, they offered me a deal. that's the only reason i helped them."
i don't know what you're talking about. get him out of here.
"those creature, the lizard people, they're around here somewhere. you've got to find them."
"no problem, we'll get right on that."
"be careful, be careful. they've got ray guns."
ray guns. got it.
watch your head.
it's identical to the other two. even the smallest features are exactly the same.
like they came off an assembly line.
"i'd like to see the factory that made these. well, that's the last sensor sweep. should give t'pol plenty to chew on for a while."
power fluctuations.
i think we're getting the hang of this.
we're coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier.
"they're emerging, heading back to their ship."
visual.
i want to know what kind of armaments they're carrying. we may have found what we're looking for.
this new data should help us map the anomalies more accurately. i should also be able to calculate the exact number of spheres in the expanse.
any new theories on their purpose?
not yet.
bridge to captain archer.
archer here.
we've picked up a vessel approaching at impulse. they're transmitting a distress signal.
they're trapped in a cluster of anomalies. they've taken engine damage.
let's see them.
twenty three biosigns.
hail them. this is captain jonathan archer of the starship enterprise. can we assist you?
"enterprise, we've suffered heavy damage. our engines are inoperative, our life support system is failing. please assist us."
what kind of weapons do they have?
minimal.
can you get us through the anomalies?
i believe i can plot a safe course.
full impulse.
their life support system's failed.
take full security precautions. make sure none of them are armed.
you'll be fine. next case please.
"thank you, doctor."
how are they?
i'm unable to perform detailed bioscans.
why?
"they have an aversion to any kind of invasive medical care, for religious reasons. however, i have managed to ascertain that aside from some minor injuries and one slight case of malnutrition, they appear to be fine."
they're no strangers to anomalies. that looks like an old scar.
i found similar injuries on four others. apparently they've been in the vicinity of the sphere for several months.
which one's the captain?
"he prefers the term pri'nam, a religious designation."
i'm captain archer. welcome aboard.
my name is d'jamat. i can't express how grateful we are. you saved our lives.
i understand you've been in this region for quite some time.
"yes, we're on a pilgrimage to the twelfth sphere. it's taken us a year to make the journey."
your ship's in pretty rough shape. my engineer's taking a look at it.
"it's an old vessel, but sturdy. unfortunately we are better at prayer than we are at space travel."
"maybe there's some information about the spheres we can share. if you're feeling up to it, i'd like you to have dinner with me and my science officer tonight."
"i'd be honoured to accept your hospitality, captain."
our home world is called triannon. it's six point three light years from here in the maradas star cluster. have you heard of it?
doesn't ring a bell. we're new to the expanse.
the expanse? you mean the chosen realm.
"i think we're talking about the same thing. we're here to learn everything about a species you may have run into, the xindi?"
i'm not familiar with them. we place very little emphasis on meeting other lifeforms. space travel for us is merely a means to bring us closer to the spheres.
you've studied them for some time?
"we're not here to study the spheres, we're here to venerate them. we believe that it is through prayer and meditation that the makers become manifest."
the makers?
the creators of the spheres. i've felt their presence here.
you're referring to spatial anomalies.
"the maker's breath. it reshapes reality, allows ordinary men a glimpse of the divine."
that breath nearly destroyed your ship.
"well, we became careless. it's easy to do when you're in the presence of a sphere."
they're certainly impressive. we've found three of them so far.
you're fortunate to have such a fast ship. i regret that i'll die having seen only one of the many thousands of spheres.
"actually, we've determined that there are fifty nine spheres in the expanse."
i think your estimates are a bit low.
that's doubtful.
with the makers there is no doubt.
doubt is the basis of all scientific progress.
scientific progress has led many people astray.
perhaps this is a subject we should discuss some other time?
"i agree, captain."
you'll be glad to know my engineer believes that he can repair the damage to your vessel. he thinks it shouldn't take more than a couple of days.
that is good news. i certainly hope that we'll have the opportunity to repay your kindness.
may i help you?
i'd like to speak with you.
what is it? are you feeling ill?
"i wanted to ask you about a certain procedure. i'm sorry, it's very difficult for me to talk about."
why don't you have a seat? i was about to make some janaran tea. would you like some?
"yes, thank you."
is everyone in place?
yes. they're just waiting for your signal.
you sound hesitant.
"i'm sorry pri'nam, but are you certain this is the right thing to do?"
do you think this ship just came to us by coincidence? this encounter was clearly ordained by the makers.
but these people risked their lives to save us.
"they desecrated a sphere. what we are about to do is not just for our salvation, but for theirs as well. i know it can be difficult. we've been away from home for a long time, but we have been given the means to end the bloodshed for once and for all. don't lose your faith now, yarrick."
"never, pri'nam."
they believe that god-like beings they call the makers created the spheres a thousand years ago.
we have determined that the spheres are nearly a thousand years old.
"well. they also believe that the makers are using the spheres to reshape the expanse, creating a paradise for when they return."
mythology often has a basis in fact.
come in.
am i disturbing you?
not at all.
excuse me.
i said before that i hoped to be able to repay your kindness.
that isn't necessary.
"it's already underway. captain archer, you, your crew, this vessel, are all about to embark on a glorious mission. at this moment a number of my people have taken positions around your vessel. their bodies have been equipped with powerful organic explosives. with a single command i can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives."
cala detash. shika venus tikel. shika venus tikel. shika venus tikel.
there's been an explosion on c deck. we've got a hull breach.
seal off the area. get security teams
"stop. two of my men are positioned next to your warp reactor. unless you turn this ship over to me, i'll destroy it."
he has severe burns! the other two are suffering from the effects of rapid decompression. they need immediate medical attention.
my orders are to escort everyone to their quarters.
i will not leave without treating these people.
watch him.
they say they'll destroy enterprise. i have to believe them.
i can't believe you're going along with this.
"remember what's at stake, why we're out here. right now we don't have a choice. don't take any action against them. is that clear?"
"aye, captain."
this isn't over.
make yourself at home.
you made the right decision. i promise you your people won't be harmed.
you just murdered one of my people.
i had to erase any doubts you might have had about our resolve.
what do you want with my ship?
"when i'm satisfied the situation is secure, i'll answer your questions. i also lost a crewman in that explosion, captain. i'll say a prayer for them both."
save your breath.
were you given the coordinates for triannon? set a course. your highest warp factor.  prepare to fire two of your torpedoes. target my ship's reactor. you heard me. release the docking clamps.
a strike here will cut off their supply route.
"no, i don't want a victory by attrition. we're going to assault their positions directly."
"if you use enterprise to attack your enemies you may prevail, but your war will not end.  vulcan was once torn by violent conflict. numerous factions with opposing doctrines on logic. each decisive victory drove the defeated faction underground until they could regroup and fight again. the cycle perpetuated itself for centuries. only when we embraced non-violence did we achieve peace."
we also plan to embrace non-violence. as soon as the heretics are eliminated.
that's illogical. it's not possible to eradicate everyone who disagrees with you.
"with the help of the makers, all things are possible."
i promised you an explanation. i owe you that.
where are you taking this ship?
"to my homeworld. we'll be there in three days. for the last century, a violent group of heretics have tried to undermine our way of life. with your ship i can deliver a final, decisive attack. i can end this conflict forever."
a war. that was the glorious mission you were talking about?
i'm trying to save my people.
why do i have the feeling these heretics would say the same thing.
"they might very well, but it doesn't change what they are. enemies of the truth."
your truth.
there's only one.
how many people do you intend to kill with my ship?
"your species is obsessed with numbers. a characteristic of your misguided belief that the secrets of the universe can be revealed through science. this may sound barbaric to you, but it doesn't matter how many heretics die. when the makers return, only the faithful will survive. non-believers will be swept away. not only triannons, but every race within the chosen realm."
doctrines like that make it real easy to wipe out everyone who doesn't agree with you.
"you're wrong. it's not easy. if it were, i wouldn't be dreading what i have to do next. i've been reviewing your records. you've committed terrible acts of desecration. not only have you flown within the cloaking barrier of three spheres, you've landed on one and entered another. for crimes of this magnitude my faith obligates me to destroy your ship and put your crew to death. however, i cannot ignore the fact that you put yourselves at risk to save us, and that i like you, captain. i believe you're an honourable man, so i am going against what my faith dictates. i'm going to temper the punishment. as commander of this ship you may choose one member of your crew to give up their life."
you're out of your mind.
"if you won't choose, i'll choose for you. i take no pleasure in this, captain, believe me."
i need time to think about this.
"you have six hours. i urge you to use this time to search within yourself, and put these lies out of your mind. all of this data that you've collected must be erased from existence."
"six hours, captain."
an update on the repairs to your ship. d'jamat felt you should be kept appraised.
"that's very considerate of him. wait a minute. your name's yarrick, isn't it?"
it is.
i understand your wife paid a visit to sickbay. she had a long talk with my doctor. she's pregnant.
yes.
i guess you also know she wants to end the pregnancy.
that's between her and me.
"my doctor got the impression that she doesn't exactly agree with d'jamat's interpretation of your faith. as a matter of fact, phlox said she's grown to hate everything about it."
that's not true.
he also got the impression that you're not happy with the way things are going either.
d'jamat is my spiritual leader. i will follow him to my death.
"from what i've seen, i'm pretty sure you're going to have that opportunity."
you went to the doctor. you've put us at risk. he told his captain.
does d'jamat know?
i don't think so. did you have the procedure?
"no, the doctor said he needed time to review our physiology. he's under guard now. it's too late."
it's just as well.
have you changed your mind?
i'm not certain it's the right thing to do.
i won't watch my son or daughter fight in d'jamat's war.
we have the ship now. we'll end the war once and for all.
you don't believe that any more than i do.
"enter. ah, i'm glad you've come. i was just looking at your captain's logs. i had no idea we were such kindred spirits."
what makes you think that.
"i know why you're here, in the expanse. it turns out we're both fighting to save our people."
i'm trying to stop my world from being destroyed. you're trying to wipe out everyone who doesn't share your beliefs.
our situations aren't as different as you think.
i draw the line at murdering innocent people.
and not torture? in your log there is an incident with a prisoner. an interrogation that made use of an airlock.
i needed information critical to my mission. he wasn't hurt.
"i sympathise with you, captain. i've had to make hard choices as well. when i was young, i fought with the holy regiments. i was commanding a mission. we'd infiltrated a village known to be a heretic stronghold. we were instructed to stay concealed and relay intelligence about enemy movements, but one of the villagers discovered us. it was a small boy, no more than six years old. we knew if we let him go he would alert the village, and if we tried to hold him he might give us away. there was only one action to take, so i took it."
you're proud of that.
"in the service of the makers, all actions are blessed ones."
"there are no makers. at least, not how you perceive them. the spheres are machines built for a reason you and i don't understand."
"i was once like you, but then i felt the breath. i prayed for you, captain. i had hoped that the makers would open your eyes to the truth, but it seems that they've turned away. you had a choice to make."
i've made it.
and which crew member have you selected?
"i've chosen myself. you wanted to kill someone, kill me."
i urge you to reconsider.
i won't make someone else pay for something that happened under my command.
"but what about your mission? when i'm through with your ship, your crew will need their captain."
t'pol's a fine commander.
"we are more alike than you think, captain. i would make the same choice. i respect your decision."
then maybe you'll grant a request.
what is it.
"my people have certain customs regarding death. there's a device on board. we use it to dispose of hazardous materials but, on rare occasions, when the situation arises, we've also used it for executions. it's considered humane."
where is this device?
the molecules have been disassembled. quick and painless.
i can't chance your mind?
no more than i can change yours.
very well. proceed.
captain.
ask phlox to keep an eye on porthos. take care of enterprise.
this won't end here.
you have my sympathies. you should inform your crew. they deserve to know.
you've been quiet.
"i'm just thinking about what's ahead, pri'nam."
i know you too well. tell me what's wrong.
we've just begun this mission and already three people are dead.
and that bothers you.
shouldn't it? these people are not our enemy.
they are non-believers. that makes them our enemy.
why?
do you believe the makers speak through me?
yes.
"then when you question me, you question the makers, and there's a word for that. heresy. yarrick, when you begin to sympathise with the enemy you risk becoming the enemy."
don't feed him cheese. can you talk?
go ahead.
can you neutralise the organic explosives?
need triannon internal scans.
can i help you?
"i know, medical scans are against your beliefs. i don't think the makers will mind."
enter.
lyaal's missing. he's not at his station.
lyaal. lyaal. we'll use the ship's internal sensors to find him.
i need to locate one of my men.
we're dropping out of warp.
main power is being disrupted.
from where?
i can't identify the location.
"i'm telling you, i didn't do anything. ask your flunky over here. he's been looking over my shoulder the whole time."
it's true. he never left my sight.
this did not happen by accident.
"pri'nam, there's something wrong with the eps manifolds on deck d, section j15."
"yarrick, go with him."
it's on the left.
you past it.
you don't want to do that.
you can't win. they'll destroy the ship.
not if you help me.
no.
"you know this is wrong. everything he'd doing, we can put a stop to it. all of it."
i won't betray my faith.
your faith betrayed you. is this really what the makers want? to kill people by the thousands in their name? is that the faith you were raised in?
no.
"then do what's right. if you don't help me, you'll be condemning your wife and child to death, because that's how this is going to end. as long as people like d'jamat dictate what's true and what isn't, all you'll ever have is war."
have you located lyaal?
internal sensors aren't functioning. systems are down all over the ship.
what is it?
there's a convoy of ships approaching.
let me see them.
these people you're fighting. what makes them heretics?
we believe the makers created the chosen realm in nine days. they believe it took ten.
"for that, you've been at war for over a century? found it."
what is it?
the environmental controls need to be re-routed to sickbay. that can only be done from the bridge. i'm going to show you how to do it.
why?
"doctor phlox has synthesised an airborne agent. it neutralises one of the enzymes used in the organic explosives, renders it inert."
they're hailing us.
surrender now.
i have four ships.
if you had ten ships you wouldn't survive against this vessel. run your scans. you'll see that i'm telling the truth. surrender and you'll be treated fairly.
"you consider us heretics. we know what you do to them, d'jamat."
target the lead vessel. do what i say.
no.
prepare to fire torpedoes.
one of the ships has lost engines.
target their main reactor.
"don't worry, it's harmless unless it's agitated."
captain.
we have to get to the armoury. we're retaking the ship. we need the macos.
pri'nam.
it's begun. what's the status of the engines?
we've located the problem. it's under repair. the warp reactor should be functioning in a few hours.
they're retreating.
stay with them.
do what i say!  bring us within firing distance. prepare to lock weapons.
"careful, there's no antidote for the venom."
"there'll be an extra helping of snow beetles for you tonight, young lady."
their engines are at maximum. we're still gaining.
good. we'll eliminate them one by one.
hold your fire.
don't move.
they're coming into range.
lock weapons.
they're sending a transmission. they want to surrender.
continue firing.
weapons aren't functioning.
archer to the bridge. we've rerouted command functions to engineering. i've taken weapons offline.
find him.
we've also neutralised your organic explosives.
you're lying.
"go ahead, try to blow yourself up."
i'll wait.
stand down before anyone else gets hurt.
you know i won't do that.
pri'nam! they're coming about.
"they're firing again, captain. i suggest you bring your weapons back online. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of your crew?"
"captain, it's reed. we have the bridge. this'd be a lot easier if i had weapons back."
stand by.
hail them.
this is captain archer. d'jamat is no longer in control of this vessel. please respond. we've retaken the ship. i'm in command again.
why should i believe you?
i'm powering down my weapons. see for yourself.
they're moving off.
we just entered orbit around triannon. let's go.
"you've done a terrible thing, captain. you've interfered with something that was ordained. after centuries of fighting, i was going to bring an end to the war. we would have had peace."
"peace? one of my crewmen is dead, six others are wounded, my ship is damaged."
none of that is important. all that matters is the sacred truth.
you want truth? i'll show you some truth.
"from what we've been able to learn, this happened eight months ago. both sides have been decimated. there are no major cities left. millions are dead. your faith was going to bring peace? here it is."
yes.
"commander shran, would you come to the bridge."
status.
we've lost the warp trail.
"continue scanning. you know what we're looking for, lieutenant. it shouldn't be that difficult to find."
commander. we've been searching for weeks.
and we'll continue searching until we've accomplished our mission.
or until we're destroyed? you've seen what this place is like. what are the chances they've survived?
we have our orders.
we should head back to andoria while we're still able.
"you sound like you're afraid of this expanse, lieutenant. i'd expect that from a vulcan, not a member of the imperial guard."
continue scanning.
"don't underestimate these pinkskins, lieutenant. they're still out there."
where are the others?
delayed.
i said the matter was urgent.
typical humanoid arrogance. you expect us to come scurrying whenever it suits you.
"i'm sorry to inconvenience you, but i'm sure you'll find the journey worth the effort."
the weapon is ready?
not quite.
then why are you wasting our time?
the new prototype has been completed. we've scheduled a test.
when?
"three days. you'll be able to view the test remotely from this chamber. if everything goes as planned, we should be ready to deploy the final version in a month, maybe sooner."
and the human threat will finally be eliminated.
i hope you find that worth your time.
the signal was so weak i wasn't even sure it was there at first.
but you are now.
"yes, sir. the isotopic signature matches the kemocite that you planted on the xindi ship."
set a course. tell trip i want everything he can give me from the engines.
"captain, as you know, ensign sato and i have been working to reconstruct our database."
and?
we've managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data out of the redundant memory core.
enough to begin piecing together a map of the spatial anomalies. the signal lies just beyond a dense field of them.
here.
how long to go around it?
a field this massive? seventeen days at warp five.
alert the crew. it's going to get rough.
tucker to the bridge.
go ahead.
i've got the warp reactor buttoned up.
we're as ready as we'll ever be.
acknowledged. t'pol?
"i've charted the largest anomalies, but the field is extremely dense. we may not be able to avoid all of them."
"do your best. travis, take us in. one half impulse."
"aye, sir."
come to bearing two seven five mark eight. hard to port!
we just grazed it. no damage.
just how accurate is this map of yours?
considering i only have thirty percent of our database to work with. there's an anomaly forming directly ahead. it's expanding.
expanding?
"i've never seen this before. they're merging, building on one another."
"which way, sub-commander?"
it's growing too rapidly.
emergency power to hull plating. brace for impact.
we're losing hull integrity. atmosphere's venting on d deck.
come about. get us out of here.
the helm's not responding.
we've been completely enveloped.
main power's going down.
"sir, i'm picking up something out there. i think it's a ship."
can you identify it?
there's too much distortion.
a tractor beam's locked on to us. we've been pulled out.
they're hailing us.
i guess we owe someone a thank-you.
captain archer. look at the trouble you've gotten your pink skin into this time.
you're braver than i imagined. i wouldn't try to traverse an anomaly field in a ship this fragile.
you don't seem to be having any trouble.
we've discovered a few tricks to deal with them.
how did you locate us?
we have a record of your warp signature from our last encounter. our ships are considerably faster than enterprise. it wasn't difficult to catch up with you.
that explains how you got here. it doesn't explain why.
"your world was brutally attacked. the imperial guard thought you'd be grateful to have an ally, considering no one else came rushing to your aid."
and how did the imperial guard know earth had been attacked?
seven million killed? not exactly a state secret.
especially if you're monitoring communications between starfleet and the vulcan high command.
"what happened to your uniform, sub-commander? not that i don't find your new look becoming, but it's not exactly regulation, is it?"
i resigned my commission.
"yes, i believe i heard something about that."
why are you here?
"your world is in jeopardy, and where are your friends, the vulcans? where is their mighty fleet? they couldn't even spare one officer. she was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship. a remarkably selfless act, for a vulcan. but we've come to your aid. we've come into the expanse when they refused. we're here to help you. if you don't want our assistance, we'll leave you to deal with the xindi on your own. just like the vulcans have done."
"targeting sensors are down, hull plating. we're damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode. if one of them had detonated."
phase cannons?
they haven't even got enough power to light a camp fire.
how long to fix them?
i couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out.
commander shran offered to send his tactical officer over to help.
"we'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir."
"the kemocite signal hoshi picked up could lead us to the xindi weapon. we're going to need our defences. i don't like the idea of having the andorians down here any more than you do, but we could use their help."
"aye, sir."
the andorian shuttle has docked.
good. let's put them to work.
i recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew.
"you been talking to lieutenant reed? they're here to help, t'pol."
that doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise caution.
i'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads just because you don't like them.
i neither like nor dislike andorians. i've simply had a great deal of experience with them.
"i appreciate that, but whatever problems exist between vulcan and andoria don't involve us."
"not at the moment. we weren't always so antagonistic, captain. in fact, despite their heightened emotions, our first contact with andorians seemed promising."
what happened?
they were duplicitous. they only honoured agreements that didn't conflict with their interests.
is that your assessment or the high commands?
"considering the importance of this mission, i feel compelled to point out that they've proven untrustworthy in the past."
"i don't trust them either, t'pol, but based on my experience i think i can trust commander shran."
"coffee, black."
no tea?
"yeah, no crumpets either, thank you. i need all the caffeine i can get. what's the situation in engineering?"
bad. the armoury?
worse.
which one of you is reed?
i'm lieutenant reed.
"i assumed i'd find you in the armoury, not relaxing here. what is that?"
"it's coffee, and just for the record, i haven't left the armoury for so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours. and you are?"
lieutenant talas of the imperial warship kumari.
"this is commander tucker, our chief engineer."
pleasure.
i've been ordered to assist you.
"indeed. well, i'll see if i can find something for you to do."
"i have duties of my own. the sooner your ship is repaired, the sooner i can get back to them."
"well, i'll let you two get acquainted."
"i wasn't sure we'd find you alive. under the circumstances, i'd say we have something to celebrate."
"i appreciate the gesture, but we have a lot of repairs to make."
and your crew's doing a fine job of making them. have a drink with me. you've earned a brief respite. andorian ale. you seemed to enjoy it the last time we met. i took the liberty of bringing a few extra bottles.
thanks.
to a swift victory.
"so, how did you get picked for this assignment?"
"i volunteered. it made sense. i've had the greatest amount of contact with pink, with humans, and the last time we met you helped my people avert a war. i don't like unpaid debts."
we keep doing each other favours.
isn't that how alliances are born?
"i haven't seen you in a while. as long as you're here, maybe you can give me a hand. touch this onto the phase regulator, there, while i check the polarity. i thought you might be avoiding me."
three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you. the captain asked for an update on your repairs.
"three of the injectors are burnt out, the restrictor coils are completely fried."
how long until we have warp?
"i would say at least two days, but the blue guys really know their stuff. should be up and running in about twelve hours? is there a problem?"
no. keep me informed of your progress.
"hand me the micro-spanner, please."
i've brought some equipment that should align those relays much more precisely.
the spanner will do the job nicely. if you wouldn't mind.
"is there anything else i can get you? some coffee, perhaps?"
that'd be lovely.
"since you clearly don't need my help, i'll return to my ship. thank you for the hospitality."
give my regards to commander shran.
"for what it's worth, lieutenant, i'm not here to steal your secrets. it would hardly be worth the effort."
i beg your pardon?
last time i saw weapons like these was during my early tactical training.
i'm sorry i wasted your time on our primitive systems.
not at all. i found it nostalgic. just be careful when you reconnect that to your power grid. you didn't reset the eps synchroniser. you may singe your eyebrows when you bring it back online.
lieutenant talas. i apologise if i've been rude. why don't i get us both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together.
two hundred million kilometres.
"close enough, travis. we don't want to give ourselves away."
"aye, sir."
"it's a g-type star system, six planets with over a hundred moons."
any biosigns?
there's a great deal of debris in the system. i can't tell from this range.
our sensors are more sophisticated than yours. we should be able to scan the system without betraying our presence. if i may?  this is commander shran.
go ahead.
transfer our long range sensor data to enterprise.
"yes, commander."
it's coming in.
"four vessels, all xindi."
many of the moons show evidence of extensive weapons bombardment.
why attack an uninhabited system?
i don't think they attacked anyone. it's bikini atoll.
what?
when my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons they needed places to test them. one was a remote island called bikini atoll.
so you believe this is some kind of proving ground.
"it's possible. if they are getting ready to test their weapon, we're running out of time."
"i wouldn't recommend a frontal assault. your weapons are damaged, critical systems are down all over your ship, and your out-numbered four to one."
i thought it was four to two.
even our combined forces don't stand a chance against that kind of firepower. i'm not ready to risk my ship when we don't even know if the xindi weapon is here.
i agree. we need to get a closer look.
what do you propose we do? fly up to them and ask them what they're doing?
ensign.
commander.
i'll take him from here.
mister tucker. how are your repairs coming along?
"pretty well, thanks to your people, but i was wondering if i could ask a favour. i'm told your anti-matter injectors use variable compression nozzles."
told by whom? that's rather sensitive information.
"i don't want to get anyone in trouble, but one of those injectors would work wonders for our engines."
"i imagine it would. i don't know, commander, that's a sophisticated piece of technology."
i thought we were allies here.
that remains to be seen. you have my condolences over the attack on your world.
thanks.
i understand your sister was killed. captain archer told me.
"well, lots of people lost family."
"no great victory comes without sacrifice. the dispute between my people and the vulcans hasn't been bloodless. border skirmishes were common a few decades ago. they'd violate our territory, we'd retaliate. i was still in school when my older brother joined the imperial guard. he was assigned to a forward surveillance unit. i can understand why you seek vengeance against these xindi."
"i'd love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack, but that's not why we're here."
you have no desire to make these people pay for the death of your sister?
i just want to make sure they don't get the chance to finish what they started.
"so, any help you can give us."
i'll have that anti-matter injector delivered to you.
i appreciate it.
"degra, what's the delay?"
stand by.
we have been standing by for nearly an hour.
we're confirming final
power readings. i wouldn't want you to be disappointed with the results. deploy the weapon.
initiate firing protocols.
what is it?
a ship just entered the system.
what kind of ship?
we can't identify it. abort the test. return the weapon to the launch platform.
"degra, report."
stand by.
activate all defence systems. contact the other vessels and have them intercept that ship.
degra!
we're securing the weapon.
i'll resume contact when i can.
we're receiving a transmission from the ship.
allow me to introduce myself. my name is shran.
of the andorian mining consortium.
you've entered restricted space. leave immediately.
restricted? i had no idea. we don't want to cause any trouble. we're looking for a rare element
archerite. we picked up some promising readings coming from your system.
i don't care what you're looking for. turn your ship around and leave.
"of course, of course, but you don't mind if we finish our scans? archerite is"
extremely valuable to us. even a few kilos will pay our expenses for the next ten cycles.
they're scanning our ships.
we're not trying to violate your privacy.
our sensors are omni-directional. there's nothing to be concerned about.
"deactivate your scans and leave, or we'll destroy you."
"there's no need for threats. we'll leave, but if this system does contain archerite, you just missed out your opportunity to collect a generous percentage."
"stop the scan. take us out of the system, but not too quickly. the andorian mining consortium runs from no one."
it's emitting high levels of radiation.
"it could be anything. power generator of some kind, fusion reactor."
it has the same quantum signature as the weapon that attacked earth.
what's the status of our repairs?
"impulse and warp engines are nominal, hull plating's at eighty two percent."
weapons?
mister reed reports the anomaly caused more damage that he originally estimated.
how long?
he isn't certain. perhaps two days.
"if they are here to test that thing, we may not have two days."
why the urgency? this can't be the final version of the weapon. t'pol's analysis shows it isn't powerful enough to destroy an entire planet. let them run their tests. why destroy this prototype when we can see it in use and gauge it's destructive power?
"i don't intend to destroy it. if we could get our hands on this weapon, starfleet might be able to figure out a defence. we're going to take it."
the phase couplers are charging.
all we have left is to reset the emitters.
what's the frequency?
i'll do it.
you don't trust me.
"no offence, but when it comes to our weapons frequencies i wouldn't trust my own mother."
is your mother considered a security risk?
it's just an expression.
an odd one. my mother's security clearance is higher than mine.
really.
she commanded an imperial infantry unit.
you come from a military family.
four generations.
"three, on my father's side."
he must be disappointed in you.
what?
betraying your family tradition by serving on a ship of exploration.
"actually, we haven't done much exploring for quite a while, but since you ask, he wasn't very pleased. the royal navy was his life."
"perhaps he'd feel differently if he saw you now, fighting for the survival of your race."
"i'm sure he would. right, all done. i'll power it up and we'll see where we stand."
report.
they've launched the prototype.
can we get a closer look?
this is shran.
"yes, commander."
transfer our sensor telemetry to enterprise.
are these the satisfying results you promised?
you said the moon would be destroyed.
the device was building to an overload. we were forced to shut it down.
why?
what happened?
i need
time to analyse the data.
"time? we have given you more than enough time. we were promised a weapon to destroy the humans in one stroke, not hack away at them bit by bit."
"he's right, degra. our patience is wearing thin."
"that moon was nearly split in two. clearly, progress has been made."
not enough. every failure puts us at risk.
degra
can the problem be rectified?
"once i've recovered the device, i'll have more information."
we hope so.
"the output was much greater than the probe that attacked earth, but still, i don't believe the device reached it's maximum yield. we detected power fluctuations. it appears it was building toward an overload."
are you saying this was a failure?
"a spectacular one, but yes."
gralik. an arboreal xindi that we met at a facility that manufactured one of the components for the weapon. he promised to help us. looks like he kept his word.
why haven't they retrieved it?
it's still emitting high levels of radiation.
how long until it's safe enough to get close?
"six hours, at least."
"we've got to get to it before they do. what if we shield the launch bay, evacuate all the adjacent compartments. could we bring it aboard any sooner?"
our shielding wouldn't be sufficient to protect the crew.
use my ship. our forcefield will contain the radiation. we'll secure the device in our cargo bay until it's safe to transfer to enterprise.
"that's a generous offer, but what are we supposed to do, cheer you on?"
"it's four against two, remember? this would be a joint venture."
archer to lieutenant reed.
"reed here, sir."
what's the status on weapons?
"torpedoes are back online, and thanks to lieutenant talas we should have phase cannons within the hour."
we're going to need them. archer out.
i wish we had more time. you're only going to get ninety four percent efficiency from the phase cannons.
"i've never gotten them above ninety three. if you ever decide to leave the imperial guard, starfleet could certainly use you."
"and if you get tired of exploring, you'd do well in the imperial guard."
"i appreciate your offer, shran. we accept."
i'll return to my ship.
i'm going with you. i plan to be there when you bring the weapon aboard.
that won't be necessary. we'll keep you informed.
that's not good enough. if something goes wrong.
kumari is a warship with a battle-tested crew. they're capable of performing their duties without you looking over their shoulders.
what happened to this being a joint venture?
"we'll render whatever assistance we can, but my crew won't take orders from you."
they're going to have to.
"the imperial guard doesn't serve at your leisure, pinkskin."
this is my mission.
and you'd pass up your best chance for success over a matter of pride?
"this isn't about pride. the xindi killed seven million humans, not andorians. i won't put the fate of my people in the hands of the imperial guard. now, we could use your help, but if you're not happy with me calling the shots then we'll go it alone."
"i've seen the scans you transmitted, commander. impressive."
archer's science officer believes the weapon is unstable. it nearly overloaded.
the vulcan.
i have no reason to doubt her assessment. she seems competent.
we'll review her data. proceed as planned.
"general, the humans may yet become valuable allies."
"if your mission is successful, we won't need an alliance with them, or anyone."
why squander the opportunity? is this mission worth making enemies of them?
"it's not up to you to determine the value of this mission, commander. i trust your regard for this pinkskin won't cause you to forget that."
what are you doing? why are you accessing the sensors? they weren't damaged.
"not by the anomaly. with all the bypasses we've been running, we obviously could have created some additional problems."
you're just being thorough.
you wouldn't want to be in a battle with the xindi and suddenly find yourself flying blind.
"so, anything we need to worry about?"
your lateral array was out of alignment. i corrected it. all other systems are functioning properly. i'd take this ship into combat myself.
even with our primitive weapons?
"it's not the weapon, it's the soldier who wields it."
what is it?
a ship.
the andorians?
no. biosigns are human.
send the escort ships to intercept. we have to keep them away from the weapon.
two xindi ships approaching.
"tactical alert. evasive manoeuvres, ensign."
aye.
hail the captain.
the two reptilian ships are moving towards us. the other vessels are holding position.
try to keep them busy.
acknowledged.
i await your orders.
let's go get it.
charge weapons. set a course.
another vessel. it's the andorian ship. they're heading for the weapon.
they're working together. get our ships back here now!
hull plating's holding.
return fire. target their engines.
they're breaking off.
they're heading back into the system.
"pursuit course, ensign. continue firing all weapons."
we have it.
"take us out of the system, maximum speed.  are they following?"
no. the human vessel disabled main propulsion on both ships.
what about enterprise?
they've gone to warp. no apparent damage.
contact t'pol. have her meet us at the rendezvous point. is there a problem?
"inform the imperial guard we have the weapon. set a course for andoria, maximum warp."
what are you doing?
i'm afraid we won't be taking orders from you any longer.
"now i see why you generously offered to let us use your ship, you son of a bitch."
i was ordered to retrieve the weapon by whatever means necessary.
i'm starting to think the vulcans may be right about you.
the vulcans are the reason we're doing this.
what are you talking about?
for two hundred years all that's kept them from invading andoria is the threat of massive retaliation. with a weapon of this magnitude at our disposal they wouldn't dare attack us.
you're putting earth at risk because of a border dispute with the vulcans?
"we disrupted the xindi test, took their weapon. we may have helped save your world."
i guess i'm not familiar with the andorian concept of help.
"i don't need to justify my actions to you, pinkskin. i swore an oath to the imperial guard, my loyalty lies with them."
my crew won't let you take the weapon without a fight.
your ship isn't fast enough to catch us.
you'll have to slow down to pass back through the anomaly field.
"i anticipated that. when talas was working on enterprise she disrupted the main sensor array. they may be able to catch up to us, but they'll have no way to find us."
you like to talk about repaying debts. i've owed you that for a long time.
"take the captain to an escape pod. don't worry, i'll alert enterprise where to find you."
we disabled main power on both reptilian ships. the other vessels aren't pursing us.
what about our sensors?
"back online. you were right, sir. if i hadn't been watching that andorian officer it might have taken weeks to find where she'd sabotaged the array."
their ship?
it's approaching the anomaly field.
they've reduced speed. we'll intercept them in fourteen minutes.
we've begun examining the weapon.
excellent work. i'll see that you receive a commendation.
"with respect, general, i'd prefer you didn't."
transmit your analysis as soon as possible.
commander shran.
what is it?
enterprise is approaching.
where are they?
eighty thousand kilometres. they're hailing us.
captain archer. glad to see you made it back safely. how did you find us?
you don't think i'd let your people work on my ship without appropriate supervision. give us the weapon.
"i respect your perseverance, but you don't actually think you'll be able to take it from us?"
"no, i think you're going to give it to us. willingly."
i should have warned you. don't drink too much of that andorian ale in one sitting.
"you tossed me overboard before i had a chance to thank you for letting us access your sensor telemetry. when the xindi tested the weapon we were able to intercept their activation codes. give it to us, or we'll detonate it in your cargo bay."
you'll lose your prize.
i'd rather do that than let you take it back to andoria.
why? we're not your enemy.
i can't take the chance that you'd use it against the vulcans.
what have the vulcans done to deserve your loyalty?
"you said you came to help us, shran. you can still make good on your offer."
"i'm sorry, pinkskin."
you're not giving me any choice.
i don't believe you. take us into the anomaly field.
t'pol.
shran to cargo hold three. what's your status?
the firing matrix has activated. i believe the device is arming itself.
shut it down.
"we're trying, commander."
i'd get rid of it while you still can.
report!
they have less than thirty seconds.
shran.
twenty seconds.
clear the hold. prepare to open the bay doors.
six seconds.
let's get moving.
"already on it, sir."
no damage sir.
the andorians?
they were much closer than we were. their hull's intact but there's significant damage to their engines and power systems.
open a channel to shran. ask him if he requires our assistance.
you have something?
just before we went to warp we received a transmission from the andorian ship.
it wasn't on one of their normal comm. frequencies. it was encrypted to look like subspace interference.
let's see it.
apparently they had time to take some detailed scans while it was aboard their ship.
"judging by the clandestine nature of the transmission, i'd guess that whoever sent this didn't want to be discovered."
get it to starfleet command right away.
why don't you and trip join me for dinner tonight. i have some andorian ale you might like to try.
who are you?
they're targeting our engines.
what do you want with me?
"you're the weapons expert. see if you can get those shields back online. if we don't raise the shields, the only that's going to be left of this ship is a cloud of vapour."
insectoids!
these could be shield emitters. they're not going to last for long.
open a channel to those ships.
what?
they're xindi. i'll order them to hold their fire.
it's been a long time since any xindi took orders from you. we're carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboard tanks. we'll have to vent it. turn these down on my mark. they're going to destroy us. now!
what happened?
the plasma got into their intake manifolds. their engines are overheating.
i want to know who you are. why you've abducted me.
"you really don't remember. i was afraid this might happen. it's me, archer."
what species are you?
you've been through a lot in the last two days. just let me figure out
what species!
i'm human.
you're from the earth vessel.
"degra, you have to listen to me. i'm not your enemy anymore. you've spent the last two days in an interrogation chamber. whatever the insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory. my name is jonathan archer. the two of us just escaped from an insectoid prison colony."
prison?
we've shared a cell for almost three years.
that's not possible.
roll up your sleeves.
the conflict between our people is over. we both lost. i promise i'll explain everything. right now we have to get out of here before our friends out there repair their engines.
what are you doing?
there's a system about a week from here. it's isolated. i doubt they'll look for us there.
you expect me to believe my own people would hold me prisoner? you think that's amusing?
it's been a while since you referred to those overgrown grasshoppers as your own people.
why don't i remember you?
probably because of the bloodworms.
bloodworms?
"they're used during interrogations. their secretions act as a truth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. but there's a side effect. sometimes they can suppress memories. the same thing happened when they questioned me. i forgot everything that happened since flight school. it'll start to come back to you. give it a few days."
you claim that i've been a prisoner for three years.
three years.
"if that's true, why would they question me now?"
they wanted information about the weapon.
what kind of information?
this is going to take some time. what's the last thing you remember?
"i was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the calindra system."
the weapons test. it failed because your prototype was sabotaged.
how would you know that?
because i'm responsible for it. your kemocite shipment was tampered with.
gralik.
he wasn't too happy when i told him what you were planning to do with his kemocite.
he'll be executed for this.
"he was. in the end it didn't make much of a difference. we didn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. a few weeks later the weapon was launched. it destroyed my planet."
we were successful?
i don't know if you'd call it a success. after earth was destroyed the old xindi rivalries surfaced again. the insectoids started attacking other xindi colonies. they killed thousands of your people.
the reptilians and aquatics would never allow that.
"there wasn't a lot they could do. while you were busy constructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundreds of new ships. they used earth as a diversion. their real goal was to dominate the other xindi species. are you all right?"
it's just a bloodworm. it'll work its was out.
can you remove it?
hold still.
i think you need this more than i do. suit yourself.
i don't understand how a xindi and a human could put aside their differences so quickly.
"trust me, it didn't happen overnight."
"you gave me this the first day we were locked up together. the guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell. they even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. i was in pretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. your people killed everyone i ever cared about. i was going to make sure you never walked out of that cell. for weeks we tried to kill each other. i was lying in the infirmary when i finally asked myself, what was the point. my world was gone, but so was yours. so i made a proposal. the two of us would work together to get out of that place. took us longer than either one of us thought, but here we are."
i don't recognise this type of ship.
it's a malosian cargo shuttle.
malosian.
"they're traders. they bring supplies to the prison a few times a month. no weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we're going."
perhaps we should set a course to your vessel. is it still in the expanse?
"not exactly. when we were getting close to finding your weapon the insectoids sent their ships after us. they boarded enterprise and took me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warp reactor. my crew was still aboard when they detonated them."
"the insectoids were always the aggressive species, but i never thought them capable of this. they destroyed everything the council worked for."
the council?
"it was formed when our planet was destroyed. it was created to find a new home world for all xindi. after years of searching we found a few suitable locations, but as usual couldn't agree on a final choice. our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of the threat from earth. i was ordered to begin designing the weapon. i devoted years to it. i made so many sacrifices. so did my wife. do i know what happened to my family?"
you told me you'd heard from naara before you were sent to prison. she and the children were safe. we have a ship now. we can look for them.
they were on a colony near a red giant.
there's nothing in range. do you remember the coordinates?
i doubt if there's anything left. it would have been one of the first colonies to be attacked.
there may have been survivors.
it's too dangerous. patrol ships are still looking for us. we should find a refuge in case.
reactor coolant. the conduit must have ruptured in the attack. take it.
what about you?
you're the one with a family. you want to see them again? try to seal the rupture. i'll see if i can close off the coolant tanks.
t'pol.
he should remain unconscious for at least two hours.
the son of a bitch designed the weapon.
keep an eye on him. trip.
what have we got?
"there are seven red giants in this region, but they're spread over approximately forty light years."
can we scan them for a weapons facility?
not at this distance.
this red giant might be a red herring. he only told you his family was living near one of these stars. we don't know that the weapon is there.
degra's a senior official. we know he's designing the weapon. there's a chance he'd keep his family close by.
"for a moment, i thought he was going to give you the co-ordinates."
too bad he didn't go for the andorian ale. that would've loosened him up.
you appear to have gained his trust. perhaps you should try a more direct approach.
what do you mean?
ask him where the weapon is being constructed.
"it's too risky. if he suspects something, we'll wind up right back where we started. he'll tell me. i just need a little more time."
i'm picking up a ship at the edge of the system.
it's xindi.
why didn't we see it before?
it may have been travelling through one of the subspace vortices that they use. it's hull signature matches the xindi ships that were here two days ago.
"captain, i'm reading three biosigns on board."
have they seen us yet?
i don't believe so.
set course for the inner moon. stand by to deploy the sensor drones.
what's that?
weapons fire.
from where?
there's a ship closing. it's the human vessel.
you said there was no one in the system.
they must have been hiding in the debris.
contact the council.
they've disabled our subspace transceiver.
they're making a run for it.
see what you can do about their engines.
"they're not going anywhere, sir."
hail them.
stand down and prepare to be boarded.
thalen.
anything?
they were attempting to erase the computer core when we boarded the ship. there's very little data left.
what about navigational logs?
they've been deleted.
"i may have something here, sir. i think these are fragments from a personal file. there are parts of a letter from someone named degra."
does it mention the weapon?
"no. there's a reference to a planet he visited recently, azati prime."
let me know what else you find.
i'd love to spend an afternoon taking this engine apart.
not your typical nacelle configuration?
look how everything's tied in through their main deflector.
learn everything you can.
i want to know where you're building the weapon.
i don't know what you're talking about.
the hell you don't. your name is degra. i was at the xindi colony when you picked up your shipment of kemocite. your people are planning another attack. i'm not going to let that happen.
"by capturing us, you've accomplished nothing."
where's the weapon?
archer to the bridge. report.
there's a surge in the plasma network.
what's causing it?
radiation from the debris field. it's starting to affect our systems.
"sir, i recommend putting a safe distance between us and the test site."
all right. take the ship out of the field but keep us close by.
understood.
"if you won't tell me what i need to know, perhaps one of your men will."
"when my superiors learn we're missing, they'll find your ship and destroy it."
"i could make a truth serum, but it could take weeks to synthesise the correct formula. i've been studying xindi neuro-physiology. it may be possible to erase his most recent memory engrams. that way degra will never know that he came aboard, or that he met any of us."
but this is a xindi reptilian. would it work on a primate?
"their neural pathways are virtually identical. i'll need to perform a few tests, but i don't expect it will be a problem."
how selective could this memory wipe be?
i've built flight simulators for starfleet training. this wouldn't be that different.
"it's not simply a matter of constructing a shuttle, it has to be designed. what species built it, what language would the control interface use."
hoshi can help with that.
i've recovered a letter degra wrote to his wife a few months ago. her name's naara. they have two children.
it may be necessary to communicate with you while you're inside the simulator.
the macos use subdermal transceivers.
they're relatively easy to implant.
let's get started.
"t'pol, i could use your help with some of the details."
details?
"if he buys into this, degra's going to want to know everything that's happened in the last three years. i can't make up the whole story on the spot."
nice work.
"thank you. dermal art used to be very common on denobula. fortunately, my parents insisted i study it. i've also stimulated his hair follicles."
i'm not sure about the grey. this is only supposed to be three years from now.
"ah, but you're forgetting about the stress of imprisonment and torture. it could very well have an effect on hair pigmentation."
you're sure these are safe?
"oh, yes. i've treated patients with regulan bloodworms for years. there should be no side-effects aside from a thoroughly cleansed lymphatic system. please try not to injure it. they're difficult to replace."
i'll do my best.
what is it?
spatial anomalies. we're passing through a field of them. hold on.
t'pol to cargo bay two.
increase hydraulics to level six.
is the hull lined with trellium?
obviously not.
increase to level seven.
"on my mark, initiate a sharp jolt to starboard."
how sharp
do you want it?
sharp.
you heard the lady.
let the captain know.
"this is going to be a rough one, sir."
we're losing structural integrity. i'm taking us out of warp. we'll never make it through this field in one piece.
can we go around?
we don't have enough fuel. we should send a distress call. one of your ships might be close enough to hear it.
what if the insectoids pick it up?
we don't have a lot of choices.
there's a comm. channel used by high-ranking primate officials. i doubt the insectoids know it.
what's the frequency?
it would be easier for me to enter it directly.
ensign?
i've got it.
stand by to respond.
bridge to command centre.
go ahead.
i'm picking up a distortion in subspace. i believe it's a xindi ship.
how long until they arrive?
about six hours.
their sensors are pretty sophisticated. they might see us long before then.
"lieutenant, take us back into the debris field."
the radiation could overload our systems again.
i'm aware of the risks. carry out my orders.
acknowledged.
one of the inmates told me all about maarek three. he used it as a staging area when he was smuggling dilithium.
what did he say it was like?
"beautiful, with beaches that go on for thousands of kilometres. first thing i'm going to do is find a cold lake and take the longest bath of my life."
"it sounded a lot like earth, the way he described it."
the captain's certainly drinking a lot.
the doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant.
"this colony of yours, you never told me about it."
"it was bleak, desolate."
the planet was barely habitable.
why'd you live there?
"it wasn't by choice. naara was desperate to leave, she didn't think a military habitat was the right environment for the children. do you have a family, captain?"
"it's been a long time since anyone called me captain. it's jonathan, remember? i never really had an opportunity to start one. i was away from home a lot."
"you should make the time. i've learned that our work, in the end, means very little. our real legacy is the children. i would do anything to protect mine. after i was told of the threat from humanity i left my theoretical studies and agreed to design the prototype weapon. when it arrived in your star system, i watched the incoming telemetry with the other members of the council. seven million lives were extinguished in front of my eyes. i asked myself how many of those were children. i suppose i've told you this before."
"actually, you haven't."
three years. my children may not even recognise me after so much.
"we're being hailed. whoever it is, they must be pretty far away. i'll try to clear it up."
transmission. this is thalen responding to your distress call. please acknowledge.
it's one of my colleagues.
"thalen, can you hear me? it's degra."
degra? it's good to hear your voice. i'd heard from my sources
that you'd been captured by the insectoids. there were reports that you had been executed.
they haven't killed me yet. i need your help. my friend and i
have escaped from an insectoid prison. their patrols are looking for us.
i'm losing your signal. please repeat.
better make it fast.
"thalen, where are you?"
i'm on azati prime. it's safe here.
"is my family still there, are they safe? thalen!"
"naara is here, and the children. i'll tell them to expect you."
at least you know they're all right.
there were more than a thousand primates and arboreals at that colony. i don't understand why it wasn't destroyed.
we should still change course. do you know the coordinates? what's wrong?
"you must forgive me. to me, it's been only a day since we were enemies. giving you the coordinates to a classified installation is difficult."
be my guest.
they're coming in. one one two seven point four by four zero five two by three nine zero one point one.
a red giant. open a comm. line to the captain.
you encrypted the navigation controls.
yes.
"captain, the coordinates match the location of one of the red giants."
do you mind if i ask how long it will take to get there?
not long.
approximately three weeks at maximum warp.
a considerable detour if the weapon isn't there.
what will your people think when you show up with me. humans probably aren't their favourite species.
i'll tell them everything you did to help me. i'm a senior official. there won't be any problems.
i appreciate that.
it's a diverse community. far more pleasant than most military
travis?
the port hydraulics are acting up.
shut them down.
they're not responding.
t'pol to cargo bay two. report.
the radiation from the debris is
overloading the hydraulic system.
can you stabilise the simulator?
i'm working on it.
more anomalies?
i'm not sure.
"captain, we're having some problems. stand by. t'pol to the bridge. take us out of the debris field."
understood.
bridge to the command centre. we're clear of the debris field.
acknowledged.
what was the problem?
subspace turbulence.
"really. i'm curious, jonathan. if we've been friends for as long as you say, i must have told you the names of my children."
"you still don't believe me, do you."
there's something in his hand.
i'm sure i would have told you
magnify.
it's been years since you've said anything.
"captain, he has a weapon."
i just need you to tell me.
what their names are.
we're coming in.
this isn't necessary.
piral and jaina.
piral and jaina.
which one is older.
"it's not in here, sir."
you'll never find the weapon.
take him to the brig.
"we were told humans were ruthless, but i didn't know you were also skilled at deception."
when did you realise.
"i had my suspicions from the beginning, but it was the comm. signal from my colleague on azati prime that confirmed them."
"we know your ship has been there, recently."
"there's an insectoid deuterium facility on azati prime. that's the last place my people would have gone to hide from them. if it weren't for that one mistake, your plan might have succeeded."
you gave us the coordinates of a red giant.
i gave you what you thought you wanted.
"i guess i'll just have to wipe your memory clean again, go back into the simulator and start this whole thing over."
i doubt there's time for that. we both know my people are searching for me.
i think you didn't figure it out until after the malfunction. i'd be willing to bet those co-ordinates are real.
then i suggest you proceed there at maximum warp.
why would he encrypt the coordinates if they weren't accurate?
perhaps he thought it would make them appear more convincing.
"he's got to be lying, sir. something must have happened during the radiation surge that tipped him off."
we can't afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isn't there. have you learned anything more about how they open the subspace vortices?
"they use some kind of phase deflector pulses. once they're in, their ships can travel half a dozen light years in a couple of minutes."
i want to see all the data you've collected.
archer to the bridge.
we're ready.
tactical alert. engage.
open it.
sir.
"you two, come with me. i said move!"
we'll fracture the hull if this goes on any longer.
hull breaches on decks d and e.
emergency bulkheads! you're the engineer?
yes.
"you're going to help us. we adapted your technology, used our main deflector to open a subspace vortex."
that's impossible.
the vortex is starting to collapse. i need you to stabilise it.
"if you don't do what he says, this ship will break apart. lieutenant."
tell him to do what he's told.
do nothing to help them.
the pylons are buckling.
"engineering, we're losing hull integrity."
trip.
"it wasn't me, captain."
i'll be damned. travis inverted the warp field. it dropped us back into normal space.
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
please report to the bridge.
take him back to the brig.
report.
"we've reached the coordinates. ensign, magnify."
i'm picking up several xindi vessels. i'm also reading significant quantities of kemocite.
what's our status?
minimal damage. the hull plating's coming back online.
"arm all weapons. lay in a course for those kemocite signatures, full impulse. get him out of here."
you'll never get close to the weapon! our defence perimeter will destroy you!
show him.
thanks for your help. take him to sickbay.
"i think you overdid the turbulence just a little, ensign."
"i'll try to do better next time, sir."
how's it coming?
"we've made it appear as if a plasma conduit ruptured, rendering them unconscious."
i'm injecting them with trace amounts of the plasma. it won't be harmful.
this accident won't explain how their computer core was deleted.
"as long as they don't know we were here, we can leave them with a mystery.  go ahead."
"the xindi vessel's less than an hour away, sir."
"malcolm can be a tough man to get to know, i'll grant you that. he likes to keep to himself. this feel okay?"
"but, you spend enough time around him, you come to realise there's no one you'd rather have watching your back."
i thought you said you weren't ticklish.
i didn't used to be.
maybe i'm doing this wrong.
maybe we should try another position.
posture? sure. take a seat.
"i just get the feeling whenever lieutenant reed looks at one of us, he sees the enemy."
i don't think malcolm thinks of macos as the enemy. competition maybe. relax.
this is one of the first pressure points t'pol worked on. helped me get through many a night.
feels great. too bad this can't be a part of our training routine.
you should bring it up with hayes.
his training regimen hasn't changed since i joined up. major hayes likes consistency.
"so does malcolm. he told me that while he was in starfleet training, he ate the exact same three meals every day for a year."
they're definitely cut from the same cloth.
maybe that's why they get along so well.  how's it feeling?
still great.
there.
feel like i've just had twelve hours sleep.
well i guess i did it right.
well.
well.
that was unexpected.
nothing wrong with unexpected.
no. with a little warning.
consider that a little warning for next time.
come in.
"you wanted to see me, sir."
i had a conversation with major hayes this morning. he wants to put your security team and all the senior officers through a series of training drills.
we run drills twice a week. senior officers are free to attend.
these would be different. they'd be conducted by major hayes and the macos.
sir?
we're heading into a hostile situation. we don't know what we're going to face when we get there.
"my people are ready, sir."
"the macos' tactics and technology are two, three years beyond starfleet's. why not let them pass on some of that expertise? you don't agree."
"the macos' expertise comes from simulated combat, all conducted on earth. on the other hand, we've fought numerous alien species on many different worlds. if anything, we should be giving the macos the benefit of our experience."
"hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on this mission, including the xindi. they've handled themselves pretty well. i'd like you to co-ordinate the training sessions with the major."
"aye, sir."
"ah, i appreciate your stopping by so quickly."
what did you want to ask me.
are you acquainted with corporal amanda cole?
she's one of the macos.
"she was in this morning with a mild headache. says she's been experiencing it for a week now. every test i ran came back negative. frankly, i was mystified until she mentioned she was receiving vulcan neuro-pressure from commander tucker."
you believe it's causing her headaches?
"well, i wanted to ask you. neuro-pressure's a highly specialised discipline. commander tucker's only be receiving it for a couple of months. i thought it was possible that he might have misapplied one of it's techniques."
it's possible.
"well, i've already spoken to corporal cole about using caution, but i was wondering if you might have a word with commander tucker. perhaps during your next session with him?"
gladly.
everything all right?
yes. if there's nothing else.
"oh, there is one other thing. if you find time, perhaps you could schedule a neuro-pressure session with corporal cole. maybe undo some of commander tucker's work."
"okay, tuesday, wednesday, friday. how does oh eight hundred sound."
i prefer to train in the evenings.
any reason?
"you get a better workout. muscles are looser, reaction times quicker."
"how about tuesdays and fridays in the morning, wednesdays in the evening."
"how about tuesdays and fridays in the evenings, and wednesday in the morning."
you're not making this very easy.
i'm not trying to make it difficult.
"with all due respect, i think that's exactly what you're trying to do."
with all due respect? is that what you call circumventing my authority?
i wasn't aware i'd done that.
and what did you think you were doing when you went to the captain with this proposal?
if i'd come to you first you'd have turned me down flat.
"you're probably right, but the decision was mine to make."
i didn't mean to deprive you of the opportunity.
i think that's exactly what you meant to do.
"whatever you might think, sir, my only concern is the successful outcome of this mission."
"as is mine. tuesdays and fridays, in the evenings."
what's the problem.
"i can't understand it, captain. it's like the stars keep shifting positions."
what do you mean?
"there, they just did it again."
maybe it's one of the navigational sensors.
i've already run two diagnostics. i can't find anything wrong.
i think i have the cause. an unusually strong gravimetric disturbance approximately three light years away.
let's go take a look.
it appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies.
it's more than seven hundred million kilometres in diameter.
"captain, i'm picking up an intermittent signal. very faint."
"an object, approximately five metres in length."
let's see it.
it's just a few hundred metres from the edge. i'm reading one biosign. humanoid.
could be an escape pod.
are there any other ships in the vicinity?
none. the biosigns are very erratic.
bring the grappler online.
try again.
i'll see if i can compensate.
travis.
we're losing systems all over the ship.
helm's not responding.
there are rising levels on ammonium sulphide in the atmosphere.
archer to engineering.
commander tucker.
the helm's not responding. we need full reverse
right away.
i'm on it.
helm's back online.
get us out of here.
love to.
we're ready to open the hatch.
he's suffering from a form of rapid cellular degeneration.
do you think you can stop it?
"i don't know yet. i've managed to revive him, but he's in a fair amount of pain."
i'm captain archer.
you had no right to bring me here.
we were trying to save your life.
i didn't ask for your help. return me to my ship.
your vessel has minimal life support. you wouldn't last too long if we took you back.
that's none of your concern.
what was that pod designed to do?
i'm not answering any of your questions.
"you're dying. we're doing everything we can for you, but"
take me back to my ship!
he may be going into shock.
how's it coming?
"good, sir. we're adjusting the nav sensors to compensate for the gravimetric waves."
get us underway as soon as you can.
just need a day to upload and test these corrections.
learn anything?
"a great deal. the disturbance appears to be expanding at a rate of several kilometres per second, and it's location is exactly equidistant to five of the spheres."
do you think the spheres have something to do with creating this thing?
it's possible. this planet was once an inhabited world. it was engulfed some time ago. i couldn't find any signs of life.
maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor.
a possibility.
"i want you and trip to take a look at the pod. if we can't revive the alien, it may be our best source of information."
"we incorporate elements from numerous disciplines. it's extremely effective in hand to hand situations. what i'd like to do now is break up into sparring pairs, run through some of the moves you just saw. let's get started."
try the combination. nice cross.
excellent. effective combination.
you were looking at his hands when you should have been watching his eyes.
good match.
"all right, why don't we take five minutes"
that's all for today.
we still have the shoulder throws to cover.
session is over.
"okay. for next time, work on your forearm blocks, and the elbow strikes."
dismissed.
what the hell was that.
that was a sparring demonstration.
it was way out of line. that last throw was completely unnecessary.
he was on his feet. that made him fair game.
fair game.
"it's just a little blood, sir. no one got hurt."
"these are training sessions, major. if your men can't understand that then i'm going to put a stop to this right now. is that clear?"
perfectly.
jolly good.
i think it's a transmitter. i just can't pin-point the frequency.
doctor phlox has asked me to speak with you.
what about?
corporal cole's been experiencing headaches. the doctor believes they might be caused by your neuro-pressure sessions.
she never said anything about headaches.
perhaps she didn't want to worry you.
why would neuro-pressure be the cause?
"it shouldn't be performed by novices. if misapplied, you could cause nerve damage."
i've performed it on you plenty of times.
under my supervision.
i see. you want to supervise me and corporal cole?
i think it would simply be best if you ended the sessions. these electrodes were collecting biometric data from the occupant.
amanda won't be too happy about ending the sessions.
i'm sure she won't.
what do you mean by that?
i've noticed that you and corporal cole have become somewhat friendly.
friendly.
"last week you were eating together in the mess hall, and in the training session yesterday she touched your behind."
you've been keeping a pretty close eye on us.
you're hard to miss.
"look, amanda and i just share a lot of interests, that's all. we both come from florida"
there's no reason to justify your behaviour. i was simply suggesting you might use some discretion.
discretion.
it's not appropriate for a senior officer to fraternise with a subordinate.
she's not starfleet. there's nothing inappropriate about it. what's wrong?
we need to get this data to the captain immediately.
there's no mistake. the pod's hull contains the exact combination of alloys we found on the surface of the spheres.
you remember the triannon creation myth?
they believed the spheres were created by divine beings who will one day return to the chosen realm.
and that the spheres were reshaping the expanse into a paradise for the faithful.
perhaps triannon mythology has a basis in fact. it appears the pod was designed to transmit data regarding the alien's physiological status. i believe he was inserted into the disturbance so someone could monitor his exposure to the environment.
"a canary. on earth, miners used to take canaries into the tunnels with them. if the canary didn't die, the miners knew the air would be safe to breathe, and they could proceed."
his condition has worsened. he's literally disintegrating and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it.
i want to talk to him again.
i don't even know if i can revive him.
find a way.
"captain, this man is dying a painful death. to keep him conscious is unethical."
"until i get the answers i need, we're going to have to bend a few ethics."
"very well, i'll do what i can."
notify me when he's conscious.
corporal. come in.
"thank you, ma'am. i appreciate your doing this."
please sit down. remove your jacket. i assume commander tucker briefed you on the proper breathing technique.
he did.
begin with a deep breath. good. doctor phlox did caution you against any further neuro-pressure from commander tucker?
i got the lecture.
you and commander tucker appear to enjoy each others company.
we do have a lot in common. did he tell you we grew up less than fifty kilometres from each other?
he didn't mention it.
"our high school's were rivals, we went to the same movie theatres. what are the odds?"
extremely low.
"unfortunately, neither of our home towns exists any more. they were both destroyed in the attack."
did you lose any relatives?
my family moved up north a few years ago. i was lucky.
commander tucker was greatly affected by his sister's death.
he talks about her a lot.
you're quite fond of him.
"what's not to like. he's a gentleman, he's great to be around, and he has very nice arms. ow."
i apologise. i'll try not to press so hard.
"we developed this specialised training system at jupiter station a few months ago. the goal is to hit as many targets as you can in ten seconds. lieutenant, if you're up for it. fall back. start him off at level two."
"four targets in ten seconds. not bad for a first go, but you might schedule a little extra practice time. kick it up to level four."
"nine hits. that's a mid-range score. corporal cole here has the record, fourteen hits at level four."
i was having a lucky day.
"okay, lets do some shooting. we'll start at level two and work our way up. who'd like to go next?"
that target practice was something. sure looked a easier than it was.
you don't say.
"oh, come on. your score got a lot better as the session went on."
i started picturing hayes' head in place of the target.
you two really ought to declare a truce.
"oh, no. this is a fight to the death."
"i guess if i were in your shoes, i'd be just as upset."
"he's determined to take over the security of this ship, you know."
you really believe that?
everything he does points to the fact.
"well, it could also be that he wants everyone to be as prepared as possible. you have to admit the extra training isn't such a bad idea."
just drop it.
okay.
"so, why don't you tell me about you and miss cole?"
we're friends. is everyone on this ship watching us?
you're pretty hard to miss.
that's what t'pol said.
is it true she's giving amanda neuro-pressure now?
so?
i heard it was damage control from your tender touch.
t'pol's just smoothing out some of the rough spots. that's all.
and why were you giving amanda cole neuro-pressure anyway?
what's it to you?
"well, from what i'm told, it's a pretty intimate procedure, for just friends."
i do it with t'pol. are you implying there's something going on there as well?
that's the rumour.
"look, for the last time, there's nothing going on with any of us, between any of us."
right. you're all just friends.
that's right.
i guess this vulcan neuro-pressure isn't that intimate after all.
exactly.
"in that case, i've got a nasty little pain just"
just drop it.
we know you were sent here as some kind of test subject. the region of space where we found you. what is it?
his pain medication's wearing off.
hold off a second.
captain.
i was sent against my will. i am not from your part of space. i come from a trans-dimensional realm.
keep going.
i don't know why i was sent here.
i find that hard to believe.
"it's the truth. i was a prisoner. because of my transgressions, i've spent my entire adult life inside a cell. one day the guards offered me freedom if i would participate in an experiment. i agreed. that's all i remember before i woke up here."
"we found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks of monitoring equipment. you're telling me you have no idea why?"
the experiment was important to them. they wouldn't abandon me. take me back.
that's impossible.
"if you don't, i'll die. please.  what's happening to me? what's happening to me?"
"between all this training and the extra shifts in engineering, i've been looking forward to this all day."
sit up.
you aren't saying much tonight. don't tell me you're still upset about me and amanda.
i'm not upset.
it sure sounds like it.
you're mistaken.
why would a few neuro-pressure sessions between me and a maco be such a big deal? unless.
unless what?
unless you're a little jealous.
i don't experience jealousy.
you're doing a pretty fair imitation of it.
"i am not, in any way, jealous of you and corporal cole."
"you know, your voice is tensing up. it's a dead giveaway."
i didn't know you were an expert in vocal inflections.
"i don't need to be an expert to read you. come on, admit it. you're a little jealous."
you're implying that i'm attracted to you.
"that kind of goes along with the assumption, doesn't it?"
i think you're mistaken about who's attracted to whom.
are you saying i'm attracted to you?
i don't need to say it. you already have.
i don't remember that conversation.
"it wasn't you, it was your clone. sim told me."
sim?
he said he had feelings for me.
he told you that.
standing right there.
what the hell was he doing in your room?
your voice is tensing up.
"oh, now you're the vocal expert."
i don't need to be an expert to read you.
i can't believe this. i'm jealous of myself?
you're jealous?
"no, absolutely not. okay, maybe. maybe i am, a little."
which would mean you're attracted to me. it goes with the assumption.
what just happened here? did we? are we?
you're not like the others on this ship.
they're from a different world than i am.
"what are they called, your two worlds?"
"mine is called denobula, my shipmates are from earth."
am i going to die?
i'm doing everything i can.
"i'm grateful to you for trying, doctor."
try to rest.
are you leaving so soon?
i don't want to distract you.
"it's no distraction. in fact, i could use a sparring partner, if you're up for it."
always. good forearm block. nice back-fist. show me the combination.
faster on that combination. you're improving.
"you want to keep that left up. that's it, stay loose, excellent"
you're improving.
"you see, you were looking at my hands when you should have been looking at my eyes."
"okay, lieutenant."
major.
tell me something.
what.
why won't you let me do my job?
"because you're here to enhance the combat capacity of this crew, not take over security."
is that what this is all about? you think i want to replace you?
"you just can't stand taking orders from me, can you."
i have no problems taking orders from you.
after lunar survival training i could handle just about anything. good sparring with you.
hayes!
as you were.
what was that?
it's a little klingon move i picked up.
tactical alert. senior officers to their posts.
he's disrupting systems as he goes. we can use that to track him.  that was the secondary relay coupling.
he's on b deck.
between the a1 and a3 bulkheads.
we're coming up on access tube seventeen baker.
he's moving in your direction.
can you be any more specific?
"malcolm, status."
our weapons had no effect on him.
he's heading towards the centre of the ship.
archer to engineering.
tucker.
lieutenant.
magnetic containment is fluctuating.
we need to reverse polarity on the plasma coils. it'll trigger a feedback pulse. turn the t-valve all the way to the left.
all right.
let's see if you can handle this.
morning.
commander.
"coffee, strong. some night."
eventful.
"i don't know who did more damage to the engine, the alien or malcolm."
how long before we can get underway?
another day at least. i guess we should talk about what happened last night.
i've been briefed on the situation.
"well, i was referring to what happened between us, in your quarters. i guess i'll go first. actually, why don't you go first?"
i suppose i should thank you.
no need to thank me.
for facilitating my exploration of human sexuality.
i'm not sure i follow.
it's one of the many aspects of your species which i've been meaning to explore since i left the high command.
sounds like you're saying last night was some kind of experiment.
i wouldn't use that term.
but that's the general idea.
are you getting emotional?
"no, i'm not getting emotional. i just don't like being compared to a lab rat."
i'm sorry if i offended you.
"forget it. i'd appreciate it if we could keep this between us. in fact, we probably should forget it ever happened."
agreed.
doesn't mean we can't keep doing the neuro-pressure though.
"doctor phlox says you have a detached retina, a bruised left kidney. we're in a dangerous region of space. we're trying to stop an alien race from destroying earth. we face attacks from all sides, enemies everywhere we go. the last thing i need is to hear that two of my senior officers have been admitted to sickbay because they suddenly regressed to the level of five year olds."
captain.
"don't try to tell me who started it! i don't know what the problem is between you two, and to tell you the truth i don't care, but i want it settled right now. settle it! that's an order!"
"there's no problem, captain."
"it's settled, sir."
how are the drills going?
"good, sir."
"very good, sir."
archer.
"please come to sickbay, captain. the alien has regained consciousness."
on my way.
think we're dismissed?
i'm afraid there's nothing i can do.
you weren't sent here against your will. you know exactly what your mission was. what were your people trying to do? you tried to destroy my ship. why? answer me!
"when the xindi destroy earth, my people will prevail."
damn.
"porthos, come back here. porthos, stop. return. heel, that's it. heel. porthos."
"all right, but just for a moment."
that's enough. you can come and see him again tomorrow.
"it says here that canines can be quite territorial. is that why you keep returning to the captain's quarters? on earth, a dog called scruffers travelled three thousand kilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. i heard of a pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to it's home world, but i don't believe it had a name. i could use a walk. how about you?"
"dear doctor lucas. i apologise in responding to your last letter. as you can imagine, the crew and i have been quite busy."
"in we go. i was deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the xindi attack. you have my condolences. it's unfortunate you were forced to cut your time on denobula short, but obviously you're needed on earth. perhaps when our mission is successfully completed i'll see you back in san francisco. the expanse. an extremely curious place."
"for example, we've recently encountered a phenomenon that, er.  do you want one of these? i doubt you'd like it. it's a leech, you know. it will clean out your intestinal tract. don't tell the captain."
"i apparently find myself in somewhat unsettling circumstances, doctor lucas. although they have allowed me the luxury of catching up on my correspondence."
we first encountered the phenomenon responsible for this situation two days ago.
it's directly on our route to azati prime.
why didn't sensors pick it up before now?
because it wasn't there before now. it's similar to the phenomenon we encountered several weeks ago.
a trans-dimensional disturbance.
this region is being rapidly reconfigured as we speak.
how long would it take to go around it?
two weeks.
another detour.
"perhaps not. since this region was formed only recently, it hasn't been completely reconfigured. we should still be able to cross it safely."
you said nothing from our universe could survive inside these things.
doctor.
"that's true, unless we take the appropriate precautions. the reconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex, but i can counteract the effects by dampening the crew's neurological activity. it would be like, oh, shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ion storm."
how do you plan to shut down our neocortexes?
"quite simply, i can place each of you in a comatose state until we've passed through the affected region."
how quickly can we get across it?
less than an hour at warp four.
i don't want to risk going to warp in there. who knows what kind of effect this disturbance will have on our warp field. we'll be safer sticking to impulse. you'll have to keep us in comas for at least four days.
that's still less time than it would take to go around it.
can you keep us under that long?
shouldn't cause any problems.
"commander tucker was none too keen on my plan. however, i was able to convince captain archer. since my denobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance, i volunteered to watch over the crew. so far, they've been no trouble at all."
"while the computer's controlling most of the ship's systems, i was given a quick tutorial, just in case. despite the dire circumstances i must say i relished the challenge and soon developed a new-found respect for ensign mayweather."
"you need to check this every two hours, minimum."
every two hours.
"if the impulse manifolds get clogged, the engines'll overload. that would be very bad."
i imagine it would.
"no offence, doc, but under normal circumstances i wouldn't even let you in here without four years of starfleet training under your belt."
these are hardly normal circumstances.
"listen. if something happens, something you can't handle, i want you to wake me up."
i can't do that. even a few minutes of exposure would cause permanent damage.
"if it comes down to saving the ship? look, i'm making it easy for you. okay?"
how's the rest of the crew doing?
"sleeping peacefully, except for you. now, lie back."
doctor.
"please, captain, i've told you the procedure's completely safe."
"i'm sure it is, but i"
"captain, i have already had this discussion with commander tucker, lieutenant reed and virtually every other officer on the ship. i'm not comfortable being incapacitated, i really should be at my post, i'm willing to risk staying awake. well you can't, nor do you need to. i assure you i have everything well in hand."
"i know, doctor. as captain of the ship i'm the one who's responsible for everyone aboard. there aren't many people i'd willingly turn that responsibility over to. you're one of them."
"well, thank you, captain."
i just wanted to say that before you put me under.
"i must say, doctor lucas, that i appreciated the captain's vote of confidence. i had in fact been feeling some trepidation over the responsibility i'd been handed, but after two days at the helm the ship is running perfectly."
"hello? hello?  nonetheless, i'm not ashamed to admit i'll be relieved when i can wake up the crew in two days, sixteen hours and forty three minutes."
"i know, i know, i'm sorry i'm late."
"i don't want the vessel with the pestle, i want the chalice from the what?"
the chalice from the palace.
it's a little crystal chalice with a figure of a palace.
the chalice from the palace have the pellet with the poison?
"no, the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle."
"oh, oh, the pestle with the vessel."
the vessel with a pestle.
what about the palace from the chalice?
not the palace from the chalice! the chalice from the palace!
where's the pellet with the poison?
in the vessel with a pestle!
don't you see? the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle.
the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true!
"it's so easy, i can say it!"
well then you fight him!
"listen carefully. the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true."
"where the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true."
good man!
did you hear that?
just remember that.
"sir giacomo, into your armour, and you to your place in the pavilion."
"the pellet with the poison, the pellet with the poison."
"computer, mute sound.  that doesn't sound normal, does it. i suppose we should investigate, hmm. i'm not going alone. come, porthos, come.  i'd be better off talking to my pyrithian bat."
perhaps we are letting our imaginations run away with us. i should never have let mister tucker talk me into watching the exorcist last week.
"hello? it's doctor phlox.  porthos! porthos, come back here. porthos."
"well, now don't you feel foolish."
i called out. didn't you hear me?
i was running a diagnostic. do you require my assistance? what are you doing here? i thought it was movie night.
you could hear that all the way from the mess hall.
i'll make a note of it in the maintenance log.
"bangs, squeaks, rattling chains."
is this a starship or a haunted house?
"are you all right, doctor? you seem somewhat agitated."
considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock.
i apologise if i startled you. you're certain that's all?
i have had a slight headache since we entered this region. perhaps vulcans and earth canines are better able to adapt to it than denobulans. how are you? i've barely seen you the last two days.
"i've had my duties to attend to. the rest of the time i've spent in my quarters, reading, meditating."
then you're due for a night out. why don't you join porthos and me?
i'd like to complete the diagnostic.
the movie's quite amusing.
"no, thank you."
"t'pol, i, er, perhaps you'll share a meal with me later."
if you like.
hello?  t'pol? is that you?
stop! phlox to t'pol.
go ahead.
would you mind not creeping around the ship like a draxxan cloud viper.
doctor?
please. i wouldn't have imagined that vulcans engaged in childish games.
i don't understand.
what were you doing in engineering just now?
"doctor, i'm on the bridge."
"i hope you don't mind eating here in the galley. mess hall seems a bit, er, oh, melancholy. all the empty chairs."
this is fine.
"my fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings . chef's tried to prepare it, but he never gets it quite right."
"yes, his plomeek broth leaves something to be desired as well."
"i always thought so, but was afraid to mention it. t'pol, you're sure you weren't in engineering today?"
quite sure. what were you doing there? i'm responsible for monitoring the engines.
we're supposed to be assisting each other. it's a large ship for two people to maintain.
do you have anything to report? doctor?
i could have sworn there was someone in that room with me.
a member of the crew?
"no, everyone except us is in deep neuro-sedation."
then obviously you were mistaken.
"obviously. you've never been to denobula, have you."
no.
"the cities are quite crowded, by choice, not by necessity. the atmosphere is vibrant, communal."
it sounds fascinating.
"what i'm saying is that we're a sociable people. being alone on enterprise, just the two of us, has proven more stressful than i imagined. two people aren't even enough for a denobulan marriage, a proper one anyway."
i'm sorry i haven't been better company.
that isn't what i meant.
"i know. it is ironic, however, that i should be your sole companion. unlike your people, most vulcans will go to great lengths to find solitude. at times it has been trying for me to co-exist with eighty humans. especially the more irrational ones."
such as commander tucker.
i've found the last two days to be a welcome respite.
"i understand, but i for one will never complain again when i can't get a good seat on movie night."
"despite the tragic circumstances surrounding your homecoming, doctor lucas, you must be happy to return to earth. as i've mentioned before, i've no regrets about accepting my position on enterprise. however, it has struck me recently how much i miss the familiar pleasures of my home."
"you've experienced the nightclubs in our kaybin district, so you know the excitement of meeting a new companion or two. the intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties are receptive. you humans are a truly remarkable species, doctor lucas, but when enterprise has accomplished its mission i look forward to being among denobulans again. the more of them, the better."
"good afternoon, captain. how are we feeling today? neurochemistry looks excellent, theta waves are good, you should wake up extremely well rested."
phlox to t'pol.
internal sensors don't show any additional biosigns.
"i told you, it was outside of the ship, on the hull."
there are no lifeforms anywhere in this vicinity.
what about alien vessels?
you can see for yourself there's nothing there.
you said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems. what if it's interfering with our sensors?
"that's possible, but we should consider another explanation. you mentioned you were having difficulty adjusting to the solitude of the past few days."
i didn't imagine it! i saw something.
"outside the ship, crawling on the hull."
what about what i saw in engineering?
"you ran the scans yourself. there is nothing unusual on board. you said you haven't slept much since we entered this disturbance. perhaps you should return to your quarters, try to rest."
i need to finish my rounds.
get away from her!
phlox to t'pol.
"go ahead, doctor."
it's the xindi. they're on board.
we'll need to arm ourselves. i saw two. there could be more of them.
there's nothing on sensors.
then the sensors must be wrong.
doctor. phlox! i thought you were going to get some rest.
they were real. i saw them.
"if that's true, then how did they get on the ship? all external hatches and docking ports are sealed."
they could have transporter technology.
there were no transporter signatures.
"what difference does it make how they got on board. if we wake up lieutenant reed or the macos they will be incapacitated in minutes, dead within hours. it is up to us to deal with this situation. i plan to start on g deck and work my way up."
i'm going to stop them whether you help me or not.
we've searched four decks.
that leaves three to go.
"if there are xindi aboard, why are they concealing themselves?"
they could be trying to destroy enterprise. what better time than while the crew is incapacitated.  a biosign.
"there are over eighty biosigns aboard, not counting your pets in sickbay."
this isn't human.
neither are your pets.
i can't lock onto it.
"there must be some interference, possibly from the reconfigured space."
you said it wasn't affecting our sensors.
"i said it wasn't affecting main sensors. that hand scanner is far less powerful, you know that."
i have it.  it's just ahead.
doctor!
it's all right. fortunately i'm not very proficient with hand weapons.
how did he get out?
"i, er, i believe i. we went for a walk earlier. i might have neglected to put him back in my quarters."
and you simply forgot.
i've been distracted. i would have thought this could tell the difference between a giant insect and a beagle.
"it can, if you use it properly."
"you're the science officer, you might have offered some assistance in that area."
you feel i haven't been helpful? how would you characterise the two hours i wasted searching for a figment of your imagination?
i'm not delusional.
"are you certain? as i recall, you once told ensign sato that it's considered healthy for denobulans to hallucinate. it's how you release stress. you've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't you, doctor."
"it's not unheard of, but i"
you said you've been having headaches. is there anything else you care to tell me?
i'm fine.
you nearly shot the captain's dog!
i'm going to recalibrate this to exclude canine biosigns and then i'm going to finish searching this ship. i'm not seeing things and i intend to prove it.
ensign sato to the doctor.
hoshi? hoshi?
ensign? hoshi? what are you doing? i have to put you back under sedation immediately. you'll suffer permanent damage.
hoshi?
you did this.
what?
you said we'd be safe.
let me get you to sickbay.
you promised us!
"t'pol, please meet me in sickbay immediately."
where've you been? i was calling you.
captain. what are you doing up?
t'pol woke me. she said something was wrong.
i don't know what's happening.
she said you've been seeing things. something about xindi on board the ship.
you're not concerned about that?
i'm more concerned about you. i obviously expected too much from you.
you're not real.
why don't you go to your quarters. lie down. i'll take over. you did the best you could.
you are not real!
doctor.
"i was so busy monitoring the crew i never thought to run another neural scan on myself. the effects are subtle and difficult to detect, but there are disruptions deep within my neocortex. you were right. i was hallucinating."
are you in danger?
"i don't believe there'll be any permanent damage. however, it's obviously affecting my judgment. i have no choice but to put myself under neuro-sedation and ask you to look after the crew."
i don't have the medical expertise.
"with your scientific background, you should have no problems."
i have my own duties. i can't possibly monitor the entire crew.
"it won't be for long. we'll be coming out of the disturbance in less than six hours. t'pol, i'm asking for your help."
i can't.
why not?
"when we were searching the ship, i became irritated with you."
"apparently, i deserved it."
you don't understand. i was on the verge of losing control of my emotions. this reconfigured space is effecting me as well.
why didn't you tell me?
"i'd hoped to control it, but it's proven more difficult than i thought. the crew is better off in your hands."
"i doubt that. i nearly killed porthos, remember. what if one of these delusions causes me to open an airlock or shut down life support?"
you won't do that.
how do you know?
"because your duty is to look out for the welfare of this crew. why do you think the captain allowed you to sedate him over commander tucker's objections? because he trusts you, as do i."
i'm not sure i trust myself.
"just a few more hours, doctor."
"so, doctor lucas, while the past few days have proven challenging, both t'pol and i are relieved that our adventure is nearly over."
once we've confirmed we're out of the disturbance i can begin waking the senior officers. my medical staff should be next. they can assist me with the rest of the
we should have been out of the disturbance half an hour ago.
there could have been some slight navigational discrepancies.
i thought space travel was supposed to be precise.
not always. check long range sensors.
what do you think i'm doing. there's more than a slight discrepancy.
this can't be correct. we're nearly a quarter of a light year from the far edge.
"at our current rate of speed we won't be out of this for another ten weeks! autonavigation is still engaged, engines are online, why aren't we through?"
the reconfigured space has expanded.
but we knew it would. travis said our course and speed would compensate. t'pol?
obviously the rate of acceleration has accelerated. we need to increase speed.
we're already at full impulse.
"as you can see, that's insufficient. we need to go to warp."
commander tucker said it would be too dangerous. we don't know what might happen.
what do you propose? keeping the crew comatose for the next ten weeks?
"all right, what do we do first?"
i'm afraid i may not be of much assistance.
"do i need to keep reminding you, you are the science officer."
"i already told you, i'm finding it difficult to focus."
on your worst day you're more qualified to operate the warp engines than i am.
"unfortunately, this is by far one of my worst days."
"i'm a physician, not an engineer."
you hold a dozen scientific degrees.
none of them are in warp theory.
the procedures for restarting the reactor are in the database.
you're suggesting i read the manual?  output must be confined to within three hundred and three hundred twelve millicochranes to prevent fusion of the dilithium matrix.
that seems simple enough.
"unless the spatial compression index is greater than five point six two percent, or the ship is within two parsecs of a class c gravimetric field distortion?"
i realise this is a complex procedure.
complex? this is utterly baffling. it might as well be written ancient klingon for all the sense i can make of it. i'm sorry.
i understand. i just wish i could be more helpful.
you're doing fine. we have to close the plasma relays before we can begin the start-up sequence. would you mind?
what the hell are you doing? i told you not to mess with the warp engines.
i don't have time for this.
"you'd better make time, doc. i told you, you can't start the warp reactor inside this disturbance."
"actually you told me it would be difficult, not impossible."
"that machine was designed to manipulate space, to violate the laws of motion. you make the tiniest mistake, you'll collapse the warp field, you'll crush this ship."
thank you for the warning.
"you're going to screw this up, phlox!"
go away.
you're going to kill everybody.
can't you see i'm busy!
"doctor, are you all right?"
fine.
"doctor, i can't find the plasma relays."
i'll do it myself.
deuterium pressure is nominal. anti-matter constrictor coils are online. warp two should be sufficient.
shall we try?
the intermix is stable. a warp field is forming.
what's wrong?
i don't know.
i followed the procedures exactly. what did i do wrong?
you need to
"what? what, t'pol? help me. is it the particle confinement?"
perhaps you should increase it.
how do i do that?
"particle confinement, particle confinement."
"doctor, perhaps we should wake commander tucker."
he'll die.
"if we destroy the ship, we'll all die."
i know.
"if we can't accomplish our mission, billions of people on earth could die. isn't it logical to sacrifice one life to save so many?"
i'm not willing to make that sacrifice yet. particle confinement. increase power to the magnetic constriction coils.
t'pol! here.
the field is stabilising.
it's holding.
then i suggest we go to warp.
"engaging warp engines. warp one point one, point two."
pressure on the hull's increasing.
what are you doing?
"lieutenant reed insisted on showing me how to transfer power to the hull plating, just in case. it seems to be working. warp one point eight, one point nine, warp two!"
doctor.
lie still. your neocortex may need a few moments to warm up.
are we through the disturbance?
yes. i'll begin waking the rest of the crew shortly.
any problems?
"a few minor glitches. it will all be in my log. if you're feeling up to it, you have a visitor."
"hey.  thanks, doctor."
how are you feeling?
a little woozy.
i'm not surprised. you haven't eaten anything in four days. get to the mess hall.
"aye, aye, doc."
i'll assist you in waking the others.
"oh, that won't be necessary. i appreciate the offer but you need some rest. let me walk you to your quarters."
doctor's orders?
thank you.
i'll stop by and check on you in a few hours.
"as you might guess, doctor lucas, i had considered deleting this letter and starting over, since large sections of it are now obviously fictitious. however, i decided that my delusional account would probably prove entertaining. as always, you have my best wishes. your friend and colleague, phlox."
may i join you?
of course. commander tucker was complaining that it will take him days to realign the warp coils.
"yes, he gave me quite a talking to."
"he also said, and i quote, phlox did one hell of a job. you must have enjoyed having the ship to yourself."
it wasn't nearly as empty as i'd anticipated.
magnify.
"it's definitely xindi, sir. the hull composition matches the other ships we've seen."
it doesn't look like a reptilian or a primate design. biosigns?
none that i can detect. there's no atmosphere aboard.
anyone else in the system?
"no, sir."
put a team together.
"aye, sir."
we'll take them back to enterprise. tell phlox i want a complete autopsy.  the major and i will search the port side. see if you can access their ship's database.
it's a computer interface.
see what you can download.
"my father'd love to get a look at this place. he's fascinated by insects, always filling the house up with bugs he's collected. drives my mother crazy."
maybe we can bring home something new for his collection.
it's heavily reinforced.
it's pressurising. oxygen nitrogen atmosphere.
after you.
"a little stale, but breathable. biosigns, very faint. coming from in here."
some kind of shuttlecraft?
"more like an assault vehicle. i'm reading a half dozen particle cannons, torpedo launchers. archer."
"you'd better get over here, sir."
the dna is identical to the bodies we found. they would appear to be the crew's offspring.
a hatchery?
"they built this place to take quite a beating. reinforced bulkheads, back-up power systems."
thirty one eggs are still viable.
they won't survive for long. the bio-support's losing power.
do you think you can repair it?
i wouldn't even know where to start.
there's a shuttlecraft in their port bay. get it back to the ship. i want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
aye sir.
did you find their bridge?
i'm not certain there is one. their command functions appear to be distributed through various
captain!
i'm all right.
we should get you to sickbay.
a mild neurotoxin. likely part of an autonomic defence system. the egg probably considered you a threat.
humans seem to have that effect on the xindi.
an analgesic should take care of the irritation.
malcolm's bringing you two dead insectoids. i want you to learn as much as you can about them.
understood.
we've located their armoury. we found several particle weapons and torpedo casings.
what about the data you recovered?
ensign sato's translating it. we'll be ready to leave orbit as soon as the xindi shuttle's aboard.
we've cleared the thermosphere.
you might want to do a better job securing our guests.
i think it's safe to assume it's dead.
just being cautious.
certain insects on earth are known to hibernate.
"do you intent do shoot me, major?"
"it's not you i'm worried about. i've been going over the results from the last training session. your senior officers have shown a lot of improvement, but i think they can do better. with your permission i'd like to schedule some more target practice for monday evening."
that won't go over well with commander tucker. monday night is movie night.
maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of this mission.
the senior officers do have other duties. we can't all spend our time playing holographic games in the armoury.
i'm not sure that's how the captain would see it.
enterprise to shuttlepod two. you're clear to approach.
acknowledged. deploy the docking arm.
come in.
i think we figured out what happened to them. one of the nacelles fractured when they were coming out of a subspace vortex. they probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet.
"according to phlox, the insectoids we found weren't killed in the crash, they suffocated?"
most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred their life-support to the hatchery.
they sacrificed themselves to save their children. you said the hatchery's losing biosupport. how long will it last?
"another day, at most."
i want you to assign a team to repair it.
captain?
what about azati prime?
it's not going anywhere. this is a sentient species. we can't abandon them.
"captain, with all due respect, why the hell not? i've got half a mind to take a plasma torch to that place."
what if we found a nursery filled with thirty one infant primates. would you want to torch them? the xindi are trying to destroy earth because they heard that humans are ruthless. this is a chance to prove them wrong.
"we can bring the eggs aboard, reconfigure one of the cargo bays."
"i already talked to phlox. he says they're integrated into the hatchery walls. if we remove them, they'll die."
"sir, this is crazy. these people are trying to kill us."
this isn't open for discussion. i'll lead the engineering team. i need you up here to help travis figure out how to operate that xindi shuttle.
captain.
i've made my decision. get to work.
"they may know how to make a weapon, but these people could learn a thing or two about designing a comfortable chair."
"for an insectoid, maybe they are comfortable."
and the power grid doesn't make much sense. almost half of it's routed to structural integrity.
you could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant.
assuming you could figure out how to fly it.
this icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds.
give it a shot.
i don't think this ship likes us very much.
you're going to have to remove the relays here and here. that should disable the security protocols.
we can't initialise the engines without them.
what about the ship on the surface? we might be able to salvage what we need.
yeah.
any word on how much longer he's planning to stay in orbit?
the repairs are moving slow.
"i'd be the last to question the captain's orders, but doesn't it seem a little odd that we're staying here to save a nest of xindi?"
"the captain thinks it's the right thing to do. we may be at war, but these creatures need our help."
"meanwhile, their big brothers are trying to destroy earth."
every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their weapon.
"look, there's a chance we'll run into more insectoids when we reach that red giant. spending an extra day or two studying their tactical systems might be useful."
"ah, captain. i've learnt quite a bit about this fascinating fellow. perhaps fellow is the wrong word. their species is genderless."
then who made all those eggs?
they reproduce asexually. each adult appears capable of producing multiple egg sacs. i wouldn't be surprised if every insectoid vessel had it's own hatchery. i'd estimate their lifespan is no more than twelve earth years. this individual may be one of the elder members of the crew. it was nearly ten years old.
what about the hatchery? when will the eggs mature?
"without knowing more about their incubation cycle it's impossible to say, but probably no more than a week at most. captain, if you don't mind my saying, you look as if you could use some rest."
we've got to get the repairs finished.
surely a few hours sleep wouldn't
contact me if you find anything else.
"is there a problem, corporal?"
"no, ma'am."
why are you guarding this chamber?
captain's orders.
lieutenant reed's report.
what?
you requested a tactical analysis of the insectoid ship.
later. are we ready?
"just a few seconds, captain."
there are two macos posted outside.
i asked major hayes to assign them. these eggs are vulnerable. there are breaches in the outer hull. there could be predators around.
"aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on this planet."
trip.
"we're ready. start at forty megajoules, but keep an eye on that matrix converter. take it up to fifty."
trip.
shut it down. what happened.
"it must have been a surge in the power grid. i'll need a few minutes, captain."
archer to enterprise. medical emergency.
there was nothing i could do. i'm sorry.
how's hoshi coming with that translation.
their iconography is different from the other xindi species. it's taking some time.
"when she's done, ask her to search their database. see if she can locate anything about their burial rituals."
do you plan to hold a funeral?
tucker to captain archer.
go ahead.
i think i've figured out the problem. their power grid can't handle our converters.
it's going to take at least three days to make them compatible.
what about the reactor? any way to bring it online?
it's possible
but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident.
stand by. work with trip. help him get their reactor up and running.
sir?
we're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship. use as much as you have to.
our reserves are at less than sixty percent.
i'm not going to let any more of them die.
"to get that reactor running again, we'll have to use a third of our antimatter reserves."
why so much?
every system on that ship is integrated. the only way to bring biosupport back online is to power up the whole thing.
"that's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes, never mind our engines."
did you inform the captain?
i wanted to run it by both of you first.
"i never imagined captain archer would put the welfare of a few xindi before his own people. do you know, he spent nearly two days in that hatchery. from what i'm told, he hasn't stopped working long enough to even sleep!"
delay the transfer for now.
the captain gave us an order.
i'll speak with him.
where's trip? did you bring the antimatter?
no.
what's the problem?
initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by over one third.
we can spare it. we're only a few light years from the red giant. we'll still have more than enough fuel get there.
we don't know for certain if the weapon is in that system.
there are lives at risk here.
billions of lives are at risk on earth if our mission fails.
"i'm well aware of that. these xindi are innocent. if we let them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us. i don't know much about vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality out the window when things start getting a little rough."
commander tucker and lieutenant reed also believe that this would compromise our mission.
your opinions have been noted. now get back to enterprise and start the antimatter transfer.
"i'm sorry, captain. i can't obey that order."
"you may not be wearing a uniform, but you can still be charged with insubordination."
"perhaps we should contact starfleet, and discuss this with admiral forrest."
"you're relieved as first officer. major, escort t'pol back to the ship and confine her to her quarters."
sir?
i gave you an order.
ma'am.
come in.
the first shuttlepod's on it's way.
how long will it take to transfer the antimatter?
"using both shuttlepods, about four or five hours."
i didn't realise how badly i needed a shower. i've spent too much time in that hatchery.
"if you're looking for a new first officer, you should consider malcolm. you're going to want someone on the bridge full time, and i'm a little busy at the moment."
i'm happy with the command structure the way it is. this is only temporary. t'pol just needed a slap on the wrist.
"she's questioned your orders lots of times, but you've never locked her up before. you have to admit its a little out of the ordinary."
"these aren't ordinary circumstances. t'pol refused a direct order in front of the crew. i can't have senior officers behaving like that, especially on a mission this important."
"maybe you ought to confine me to quarters too, sir, because i'm still not sure we're doing the right thing here. if the roles were reversed i can't imagine these xindi would do the same for us."
"my great grandfather was in north africa during the eugenics wars. his battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when they came under attack. there was a school full of children directly between them and the enemy. if his men had returned fire, they might have hit it. so he called the commander on the other side, and got him to agree to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school. there are rules, trip, even in war. we have to help these children."
"this is what you wanted to show me, a battle simulation?"
scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tactical capabilities. much more that we'd learn from a standard analysis.
"i asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play more games."
"this isn't exactly a game, lieutenant. the simulation found that they're vulnerable here. they've got minimal shielding around their impulse manifolds. a pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the engines."
"those manifolds are pretty narrow, but our targeting scanners should be able to get a lock. nice work."
"thank you, sir."
i apologise. i over-reacted. a lot of the crew's on edge lately.
they certainly are.
i heard things got pretty ugly down there.
it's not every day i'm asked to confine a senior officer. i can't say i disagree with the captain's decision. if one of my men disobeyed orders i'd throw him in the stockade.
i've got to get back to the bridge. let me know if your simulation finds anything else.
i need to see t'pol.
"she's not suppose to have any visitors, sir."
"this isn't a social call. i'm here for my neuropressure treatment. doctor's orders. you don't want me to bring phlox down here, do you?"
what's our status?
the antimatter's on it's way. i had a talk with him. everything's going to be all right. this whole thing'll blow over in a day or two.
"our antimatter supply will be depleted by then. the captain's behaviour is becoming increasingly illogical, even for a human. he's preoccupied with the hatchery, he's displaying signs of paranoia."
i think you're overstating things just a little.
you can't allow him to use our antimatter.
"what do you suggest i do, start a mutiny?"
you have to speak with phlox. ask him to run a full exam on the captain.
what good would that do?
"if the doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical grounds to relieve him of command."
"relieve him? look, i know you're upset about what happened, but i think you're taking this personally."
how long before the reactor's brought online?
"assuming hoshi can translate the interface, about twelve hours."
you have to delay it until we can verify the captain's mental state.
"if he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the brig. you're asking me to betray him."
you can't allow your personal feelings for the captain to affect your decision. we both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.
what is it?
a subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
"tactical alert. captain archer, report to the bridge."
"it's an insectoid, three biosigns aboard."
they're firing.
they're moving away at full impulse.
pursuit course. arm phase cannons. disable their engines.
no effect.
their main deflector's charging. they could be trying to open a vortex.
torpedoes. maximum yield. target their impulse manifolds.
ready.
fire.
what the hell's going on?
"an insectoid ship, sir."
you destroyed them?
they were opening a vortex. they would have escaped.
the crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
sir?
we could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"they would have told their superiors, sir. given away our position."
"if you'd explained to them why we were here, you might have avoided a fire fight."
"with all due respect sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
archer to major hayes.
"go ahead, captain."
"report to my ready room, on the double."
"aye, sir."
"i'm relieving you as tactical officer. from now on, you'll report to major hayes."
i did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
you'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
captain.
dismissed.
"yes, sir."
are you done with that translation?
almost.
i want you to put together a distress call in the insectoid language. transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
understood.
"there's nothing more important than the success of this mission. do you agree, major?"
"of course, sir."
"my senior officers don't seem to understand what i'm trying to do here. i guess i have myself to blame. in the past, i've encouraged them to ask questions, but we don't have time for that now. i need officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders."
"it won't be a problem, sir."
"i thought what happened with t'pol might have been an isolated incident, but i'm not so sure now. lieutenant reed destroyed a ship that could have helped us. i'm starting to wonder if he deliberately tried to sabotage this mission. you're in command while i'm on the surface. you answer to me, and me alone. is that understood, major?"
"perfectly, sir."
that'll be all.
"can we talk to you for a minute, sir?"
what is it?
i'd like you to go to sickbay with phlox.
do i look sick to you?
hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
that's right.
don't you think that's a little dangerous?
we'll be light years from here before the xindi respond to it.
we don't know how far away their ships are. if we send that message we'll be taking a hell of a risk.
we can't afford to play it safe anymore. this mission's too important.
"this mission is to save earth, not an alien hatchery."
"captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days. you've shown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia."
"if it'll make the two of you feel better, i'll go to sickbay for a complete physical as soon as that reactor's online."
"that's not good enough, sir. phlox has the authority to order you to sickbay."
"t'pol's manipulating you, isn't she. if i'm declared unfit for duty, then she takes over."
"captain, if you won't come with me then i'll be required under starfleet order 104 section c to relieve you of command."
"i expected something like this from her, but not from the two of you. corporal."
i've already confined two senior officers today.
his neurochemistry appears normal.
there's nothing wrong with him?
this scan is hardly conclusive. i'll need to get him into the imaging chamber and run a complete neurological series.
"when hoshi sends that distress call, every xindi ship that picks it up will start heading this way. he's got hayes on the bridge, macos posted all over the ship. whatever we do, we're going to have to do it fast."
"what are you proposing, commander?"
i think it's time we throw the rule book out the window.
captain.
"i'm sorry sir, no visitors."
you let me in before.
i have new orders from major hayes.
"look, t'pol was a little rough with me during the last session. i think she caused some nerve damage."
"you'll have to speak with the major, sir."
this is a starfleet ship. i don't have to ask major hayes for anything.
"step away, sir."
"stand down, corporal."
"the captain gave hayes control of the bridge, posted macos on every deck."
is he still on the surface?
yeah.
retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
i'd advise securing the bridge first. if hayes gets wind of this we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
perhaps we should approach the major and explain the situation. he seems like a reasonable man.
"that would be risky. if hayes sides with the captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
we'll need more people. who's on duty in the armoury?
"ensign walsh and two of my men. they'll side with us, but hayes posted two maco there."
take the shuttlepod back to enterprise.
"what about you, sir?"
you heard me.
hold it. sorry.
that's going to leave a bruise.
all right? you're with me.
"yes, sir."
"well, we won't get to the bridge this way."
captain!
"captain, it's trip!"
you shouldn't have weapons in here.
go ahead.
"major, corporal chang's been found unconscious in t'pol's quarters."
where's t'pol?
"not here, sir."
"hayes to the armoury. armoury, respond."
stand down!
"you intend to shoot me, lieutenant?"
tell them to stand down.
the captain relieved you of duty. both of you.
we don't want anyone injured. put down your weapons.
"until the captain says otherwise, i give the orders on this bridge."
go back to the ship.
you have to come with us.
captain!
shush. it's all right.
contact the captain.
belay that.
"i gave you a direct order, ensign."
"i'm sorry, major."
"it's over, major. take him to his quarters."
"aye, sir."
it's commander tucker.
put him through. go ahead.
we've got the captain. what's going on up there?
the bridge is secure.
tell phlox to get the imaging chamber ready. we've got a patient for him.
"acting captain's starlog, supplemental. we've resumed our course for azati prime. major hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty. doctor phlox believes he has found an explanation for the captain's behaviour."
where is he?
"in his quarters, resting. do you recall when the captain was attacked by one of the eggs?"
it sprayed something in his face.
"i thought it was a defence reflex, but it was actually something far more sophisticated. the substance contained a unique neurochemical. it infiltrated the captain's synaptic pathways, causing him to reverse imprint on the baby insectoids. it's the opposite of what happens when a young animal bonds with its mother."
are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things?
"well, more likely a caretaker. of course, the captain didn't realise this on a conscious level. eventually he became obsessed with protecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else."
including our mission.
"i'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind."
he'll be awake in a few hours. he should be fully recovered by then.
i want you and your men to return to duty.
"yes, ma'am."
not the sort of thing they trained us for at west point.
i imagine not.
"you could have come to me, explained the situation."
we couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the captain.
i probably would have.
yeah.
come in.
"i didn't mean to wake you, sir."
"it's all right, i was getting up anyway."
how are you feeling?
"oh, i've been better. are you sure you had that pistol set to stun?"
"captain. i hope you understand, if there'd been any other way"
"you were protecting our mission, trip. i would have done the same thing."
"still, i never thought i'd find myself pointing a weapon at you, no matter what the circumstances."
"let's put this behind us, okay?"
"yes, sir."
what's our status?
we just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
the hatchlings?
phlox says there's nineteen of them running around down there. chances are they'll survive until the next xindi ship comes along.
it's time we got back on the road. i want you at your post. we're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard. i'll be on the bridge.
aren't you supposed to get some rest?
i've had plenty.
"i'm sorry, sir, but the doctor was insistent."
"okay. i guess i don't want another mutiny on my hands. tell travis to set a course for azati prime, maximum warp."
"right away, sir."
one quarter impulse.
": there appears to be considerable activity around two of the inner planets. numerous ships, all xindi."
i'm picking up a large array of satellites. they're generating a detection grid.
degra mentioned a security net.
seems like we've come to the right place.
"the planetoid we passed on the way in, put us on the other side of it."
"aye, sir."
a convoy of ships is approaching the detection grid.
let's see them.
magnify the lead ship. show me the warp signature. degra.
"it may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a weapon, particularly one designed to destroy an entire planet, but recall the words of enarchis written some fifty years into the great diaspora. without a world of our own we are but children lost in the wilderness. one day we'll emerge from this wilderness, and our work here will ensure that we'll never be lost again. to a new era for all xindi."
"degra, it is good to see you again."
welcome.
when can we get underway?
momentarily. patience.
patience is for the dead.
you've accomplished a great deal in a very short time.
we owe you our gratitude.
it's too early to speak of accomplishments. i'll reserve my gratitude for when the humans have been annihilated.
i've analysed every link in the grid. i can't find a single weakness.
the grid is extremely sensitive. we'd be detected the instant we passed through.
we could try disabling it.
"it utilises thousands of satellites. if one of them goes out of commission, it fills the gap."
what about the insectoid shuttle?
make like one of the locals?
"we could fly in, try to locate where the weapon's being completed."
their shuttle might be able to get through the grid without raising suspicion.
"captain, we're not exactly experts at piloting that thing."
it's going to take at least a couple of hours to get up to speed.
take them. i want to launch as soon as we can.
i think i've found reverse.
"great, but unless we plan to fly in ass first we'd better figure out how to make it go forward."
can't argue with that.
let's cycle through these console settings again. try the port actuator.
closed.
commander tucker is going to need time to install the translation matrix.
if commander tucker wants to speak insectoid i have to get this right first.
"believe it or not, that was have a nice day, or it's equivalent."
"just get in there, find this thing, scan it and get out. remember, whatever information you gather won't do us any good unless you bring it back."
we'll keep that in mind.
good luck.
"thank you, sir."
"thanks, captain."
trouble?
it's like steering an asteroid miner with a bad axis coil.
their flightpath is somewhat erratic.
open a channel. trip?
sorry!
no problem. i'll send you the bill.
i think i'm getting a feel for her.
sensors are up and running. let's get this show on the road.
keep a sensor lock for as long as you can.
"five hundred metres, two hundred. here we go."
they're passing through the grid.
"we're in. xindi patrol ship, coming up from behind. they're hailing us."
doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood.
"hoshi, don't fail us now."
your presence inside the detection grid is unauthorised. explain.
we had a slight navigational malfunction that threw us off course. it's been corrected.
rendezvous with your carrier ship immediately.
understood.
the detection grid is creating too much interference. i've lost them.
we're being scanned.
where's it coming from?
i'm not picking up any vessels in the vicinity.
from the moon's surface. a small monitoring station. the moon's rotation brought it into scanning range.
let's see it. malcolm.
i'm reading three xindi biosigns.
have they sent out a transmission?
not yet.
what are they waiting for?
probably for the moon's rotation to bring them back into communication range.
how long?
four hours.
target the facility.
lock.
sir.
we can't risk it. fire.
"i'm still getting trace kemocite readings, but not enough to indicate a large-scale weapon."
there's not much land down there.
"and what land there is doesn't have any life on it. take us down, travis, closer to the surface. adjust twenty degrees starboard."
see something?
i think so.
you did say that most of this thing's power was routed to structural integrity.
"and you said we could probably fly it inside a gas giant. hell, it's only water."
structural integrity's holding.
take us deeper. negative z axis ten degrees.
"are you getting those scans, sir?"
there's a lot of activity on the right lower hemisphere. i want to have a look inside.
the captain said get in and get out.
that's exactly what we're going to do.
"aye, aye."
it's definitely in the final phases of construction. most of the work that's going on seems maintenance related.
i've gone over the scans you brought back. that's the explosive matrix. if we can get close enough we can set off a chain reaction that will blow this thing to high heaven.
the initial explosion would need to be of considerable yield.
a couple of photonic torpedoes should do the trick.
there's room in the shuttle.
we're talking about a one-way trip.
i should be the one to go.
forget it.
i'm the only one who can pilot that shuttle.
i practiced on those controls. i can get her in.
but i've actually done it.
"captain, you want a senior officer on this, don't you?"
i'll be flying the mission.
captain?
how soon can you get it ready?
a couple of hours to get the torpedoes in place.
get started. meet me in the launch bay in thirty minutes. i'm going to need some flying lessons.
aye sir.
"welcome aboard, captain."
daniels. where am i?
"you're on enterprise. enterprise j to be exact, a distant relative of your ship. we're four hundred years in the future."
i'm going to assume you brought me here for a good reason.
"look out there. it extends fifty thousand light years in all directions, and it is growing."
i've seen it before.
"i know, in the expanse."
"you know about the alien we found, the test subject?"
he belongs to the same race that built the spheres. they're altering this space to make it habitable for their species. it's a prelude to invasion.
we came to the same conclusion.
"it's getting harder and harder to surprise you, captain.  i've brought you to a monumental moment in history, the battle of procyon five, where the federation engaged the sphere builders."
the federation? you've mentioned them before.
"vulcans, andorians, ithenites, klingons. dozens of species, including humans, all unified in a powerful alliance. sphere builders."
"the federation wins the battle, they drive the enemy back into their trans-dimensional realm. if the federation had lost, the sphere builders would have spread throughout the galaxy. they would have wiped out everything. this species has technology which allows them to examine alternate timelines. they've seen this future and they want to change the outcome, so they contacted the xindi and convinced them that humanity was a dangerous threat."
they want the xindi to destroy us.
"without humanity, the federation will never exist. you have to make the xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy. in fact, it's humanity that will protect them from the sphere builders when this battle is won. contact them. make peace."
they're about to deploy their weapon.
i know.
i can't let that happen.
if you destroy their weapon they will only build another. you are the only one who can convince them of what i have told you. it is crucial to history that you do not sacrifice yourself.
"my concern is with preventing the deaths of billions of people. if that's a problem for history, then history will have to suffer."
send someone else.
i won't do that!
"captain, you have to believe me. you are making a catastrophic mistake."
you've made your share of mistakes.
this isn't one of them.
send me back. send me back now!
take this.
it's xindi. a family medal that belongs to one of the crewmen on this ship. there are xindi serving aboard enterprise j.
why are you giving this to me?
in case you change your mind.
i won't.
i'll have this quantum dated.
we both know it's from the future.
what do you intend to do?
i'm going ahead with the mission. you don't think i should.
he said you're the only one who can end the conflict with the xindi. you can't do that if you're dead.
that's if you accept daniels' version of the future.
he's in a position to know.
i thought you were the sceptical one when it came to time travel.
our recent visit to detroit has tempered my scepticism. you should reconsider your decision.
"what am i supposed to do? fly a shuttle into the system and knock on the door, tell the xindi we want to talk? the weapon is too close to being launched. if the situation were different maybe i'd consider it, but i can't."
i don't want you to die. it's not necessary.
i wish that were true.
i want four ships to accompany the weapon.
we'll have to generate an extremely large vortex to accommodate that many vessels.
"even after earth is destroyed, there will be residual presence in the system. i intend to hunt down and eradicate every refugee caravan, every colony, every last outpost they have."
a vortex of that size will be very unstable. you could lose one or more vessels.
see that we don't.
a message for you.
go ahead.
"commander, we've lost contact with one of the lunar outposts."
how long ago?
two hours.
send a patrol. we will resume this when i return.
"someone once said that dealing with reptilians is like bargaining with the sun. you make no progress, and you come away burned."
it's not him.
the last time i saw you like this was when you delivered the first weapon.
that one only killed seven million. this one will destroy an entire world.
better their world than ours.
"that's what i keep telling myself, but the reality is that a good number of the dead will be innocents, and children."
it's difficult when you have children of your own.
"what we do is for them, for our children's future. remember that."
i wonder how they'll remember us.
i know these controls aren't exactly intuitive.
i think they were built for someone with compound eyes.
"try again. good, you're starting to think like an insectoid."
i'll take that as a compliment.
can i ask you something?
go ahead.
you're the least expendable man on enterprise. why are you doing this?
"an hour ago i gave the command to kill three xindi in cold blood. a month ago i had phlox create a living being in order to use some of it's tissue, then i watched him put it to death."
sounds like you're saying this is some sort of penance.
i'm saying i won't order anyone else to die.
"i hate to add to this menagerie of yours, doc."
nonsense. what's one more mouth to feed?
just don't harvest any part of him.
i doubt that would be necessary.
do me a favour. slip him a piece of cheese every now and then.
certainly.
"i've always been much better at avoiding farewells than giving them, so i'm not even going to try, but i'm going to ask all of you to think back to the day when this ship was first launched. we were explorers then. when all this is over, when earth is safe, i want you to get back to that job. there are four hundred billion stars in our galaxy. we've only explored a tiny fraction. you have a lot of work to do. of all the captains who will sit in this chair, i can't imaging any of them being more proud than i am right now."
archer to enterprise. i'm heading in.
"four hundred metres, two hundred. he's passing through the grid. he's in."
"give 'em hell, captain."
i'll be in the ready room.
"unauthorised vessel, power down immediately."
come in.
still nothing.
i'm aware of that.
"it's been over two hours. he should have reached the weapon by now. travis and i got there in twenty five minutes, and we didn't know where to look. do you think it's possible our sensors could have missed the explosion?"
doubtful.
"whatever you're doing, can't it wait?"
for what?
right now your place is on the bridge.
i'll be notified if my presence is needed.
"no matter what happens to the xindi weapon, the captain isn't coming back. you're in command now. the crew needs to know you're on top of things and it doesn't help if you're holed up in here."
i don't need any leadership advice.
i'm just trying to help. this isn't easy for any of us. t'pol?
dismissed.
dismissed?
get out.
answer the question.
repeat the question.
how many earth vessels have entered the expanse?
"i wish i could help you, but my superiors keep me in the dark about these things."
is this a pre-emptive strike?
i thought that was your specialty.
you don't want to know my specialty.
let me guess. stinking up the room?
i had no idea that humans were so resilient. it's not a trait found in most primate species.
including the xindi?
there's a reason reptilians are called upon when force must be applied. it was a reptilian who piloted the weapon that attacked your world.
friend of yours?
he was from my regiment. i selected him myself.
you must be very proud.
"his name will go down in history. it will be spoken with reverence, a testament to the superiority of the cold-blooded."
"i'll bet you didn't know this, but at one time most of my world was ruled by reptiles."
i wasn't aware of that.
"a comet hit, around sixty five million years ago, caused a mass extinction. most of the reptiles died out. mammals became the dominant species."
how unfortunate.
"still, the reptiles might have come out on top if it hadn't been for a slight disadvantage."
and what was that?
they had brains the size of a walnut. that's very small. apparently it's a constant in the universe.
earth vessels. how many?
"the reptiles didn't all die out. some evolved into snakes, alligators, turtles. as a matter of fact one of my favourite restaurants in san francisco makes the most wonderful turtle soup. you should try it sometime if you're ever in the area."
you want me to kill you?
i'm just making conversation. relaying a few interesting facts about the world you're trying to destroy.
i'll reciprocate with an interesting fact of my own. we know exactly where your ship is.
is that so?
"when we lost contact with our lunar outpost, we scanned the vicinity and discovered it hiding. unless you tell me exactly what i want to know i'll dispatch a squadron right now. no more conversation? i hope you had a chance to say goodbye to your crew."
"all right, but i'll only talk to degra."
degra?
alone.
i don't know who that is.
he's building your weapon. ring a bell now?
what makes you think degra would be interested in talking to you?
"just tell him the name of his third child, trenia."
degra has only two children.
prove me wrong. tell him.
"sensors would have easily detected an explosion of that magnitude, even underwater."
i say we go in. get as close as we can and try to take out the weapon.
agreed.
this system is heavily guarded. our chances for reaching the weapon are non-existent.
we can't just sit here.
what do you propose we do?
there's still a chance the captain may succeed.
"the longer we wait here, the greater the likelihood we'll be spotted."
"if we don't hear from the captain in one hour, i'll pilot a shuttlepod into the system."
and do what?
attempt a diplomatic solution.
you've got to be kidding.
you can't possibly believe that has any chance of success.
"the odds aren't promising, but the fact that i'm vulcan may help me establish a dialogue."
you'll just be captured or killed.
"perhaps, but at the moment i don't see an alternate course of action."
hello again.
how do you know me?
long story.
repeat what you told him.
the name of your third child is trenia.
"leave me alone with him, and take him as well."
three months into the pregnancy your wife contracted anaprolean fever. you lost the child. you were going to name it trenia.
i've never told that to anyone.
"you told it to me. you also talked about the weapon you designed, the one that killed seven million people. when you watched the telemetry come in you wondered how many of those seven million were children."
who are you?
it doesn't matter who i am or how i know all this. what's important is that you listen to what i have to say.
continue.
your reason for building this weapon is based on a lie.
what lie would that be?
that at some point in the future humans are going to destroy your species.
that is not a lie!
you know about the spheres.
of course.
"they were constructed by trans-dimensional beings. their purpose is to reconfigure the expanse to make it habitable for their species. that's what destroys the xindi, not humanity."
i've studied the spheres. there is no evidence to support what you're saying.
i've seen it happen. i've been to the future. four hundred years into the future.
you expect me to believe that?
there's an artefact in my right pocket. take it. go ahead.
an initiation medal.
have it quantum dated. the results will back me up.
you could have gotten it anywhere.
"listen to me, you son of a bitch. it wasn't any easier for me to swallow this than it is for you, but you'd better understand something. if you destroy earth, you won't just be eliminating my species, you'll be eliminating your own."
the quantum dating confirms it. it's from the future.
that doesn't prove the human's telling the truth.
it also means she's been dealing with the reptilians secretly.
archer told you this?
"he said he saw reptilians on earth, in a place called detroit, over a hundred years in the past."
the past.
so now he's a time traveller!
"according to the human, they were developing a bioweapon."
the council prohibited that.
"he spoke of it in great detail. if the reptilians wanted to keep their actions a secret, the past would be a good place to do it."
how would they get to the past?
she may have taken them.
we have to investigate this.
"and quickly. the weapon's been moved to a safe location, but it's nearly ready to be deployed."
the council must be informed.
"reptilians sit on the council, or have you forgotten. if they did go behind our backs we shouldn't reveal what we've learned. not yet."
what about the aquatics?
we can inform them in secret.
all of this collusion is dangerous. the council is fracturing. we can't forget who the real enemy is.
we may not know who the real enemy is.
what happens if you fail? are we supposed to just keep sending people in until there's no one left?
that's hardly a viable option. we only have one more shuttlepod.
you're missing my point.
"i don't think you're doing this to make peace, i think you want to try and save the captain."
you 're wrong.
why do i get the feeling you haven't thought this through?
you have made your objection clear. now return to the bridge.
i'm not just going to sit still and watch you fly off and die.
i gave you an order.
t'pol.
let go of me!
i won't let you do this.
"i said, let go!"
what the hell's wrong with you?
bridge to t'pol.
go ahead.
there's no need to go to the xindi. it appears they're coming to us.
"four xindi vessels, closing fast."
hail them.
no response.
they're charging weapons.
what exactly are you proposing?
that we trust each other.
"you were captured behind the controls of a ship armed with explosives, and you're asking for our trust?"
you're building a weapon that could destroy my world. i had to try and stop you.
"and now that your mission's failed, you want to negotiate."
just consider what i said.
you maintain that by destroying your world we'll be ensuring our own annihilation.
that's right.
because it's humankind that ultimately saves the xindi from these sphere builders.
we're both fighting the wrong enemy.
i'm afraid it'll take more than this antique to convince us.
quantum dating has produced inaccurate results before.
"do you believe these results are inaccurate? let me speak to this council of yours, present my case."
some members of the council would sooner execute you than listen.
then help me change their minds.
you haven't changed ours.
"i've made an impression, or you wouldn't still be here."
we've lost hull plating.
i still don't have helm control.
t'pol to engineering.
"engineering, report."
that last hit took out the starboard nacelle. we're dead in the water. bridge! bridge!
comm.'s down.
get it back.
restrain him.
we're not finished.
you've had enough time.
has he revealed the location of his forces?
we've been discussing other matters.
there are no other matters. take them back to their ship.
we're not going anywhere. you can't threaten us.
return to your ship.
what about him?
"he's going to a detention centre for more questioning. if there are any survivors from his ship, they'll join him."
survivors?
your ship's under attack.
you agreed to hold off.
we grew tired of waiting.
call off your vessels.
i don't answer to you.
i'll assemble the council.
"by the time you do, the earth ship will be dust."
"we've got hull breaches on c, d and e."
close them off.
the bulkheads aren't responding. we're venting atmosphere.
get him to sickbay!
"yes, sir."
"tucker to the bridge. if you can hear me, i've got coolant leaks all over the place. we're evacuating. everybody out!"
"another breach on c deck, e deck's depressurising. we can't take much more of this."
"they've ceased firing. they're moving off, back into the system."
"ensign, get us out of here."
thrusters are down. i don't think we're going anywhere.
you had no right to recall my ships.
and you had no authorisation to launch an attack.
the humans should have been destroyed the moment they were detected.
the council doesn't agree.
you're permitting an enemy vessel to remain in orbit near a military installation!
their ship is critically damaged. they no longer pose a threat.
"thanks to an attack that you opposed. at the very least, we should board their vessel and take them prisoner."
it is being considered.
"on the subject of prisoners, the council wants archer for further interrogation."
we're not finished with him.
you've questioned him long enough.
he hasn't provided us with the necessary information.
perhaps the council will have more success. you're ordered to release him immediately.
very well.
we've arranged for his transport.
we can deliver him.
he's already been severely beaten under your care.
he is the commander of an enemy vessel.
we need archer in good condition.
"if he can't answer questions, we can't interrogate him."
he will not be harmed any further. you have my assurances.
that isn't good enough.
meaning?
it wouldn't be the first of your assurances that fell short.
the council has agreed that the aquatics will transport the prisoner. they've sent a ship. get him ready.
"the comm. system's still down. we don't have a complete casualty list yet. so far the news isn't good. five people are confirmed dead, a dozen wounded. most of the hull breaches have been contained with emergency bulkheads."
what about cargo bay two?
i don't know. there's no way to get to it. a large portion of e deck is still decompressed.
weapons?
"the aft torpedo launcher's working, but that's about it. i really don't know what's holding us together, but let's hope it doesn't give out."
commander.
the primary warp coil's fried. it has to be rebuilt from scratch.
how long?
"a couple of weeks, if we had the parts. we don't. as it stands now, warp drive's out of the question."
impulse?
"i'll have to inspect the hull around the exhaust manifolds, see the damage first-hand."
make it a priority.
we've had a lot of injuries down here. it could speed things up if you assign me some extra help.
engineering isn't the safest place to be right now.
indeed. we've already lost one captain today.
where are you taking me?
emergency power's back online. we'll have phase cannons in about an hour.
i'd like you to begin repairs on e deck.
i'll have to pull people from other areas.
there are engineering components in cargo bay two. they're crucial to commander tucker's repairs.
aye.
there's a vessel approaching.
it's xindi.
aft torpedoes.
targeting.
the viewscreen?
still offline.
it appears to be a one-man vessel. no armaments.
biosigns?
one.
bring it in.
here.
no internal injuries. numerous contusions consistent with blunt trauma.
how many have we lost?
fourteen. three are unaccounted for.
don't waste time on me.
"it's good to see you again, captain."
damage report.  we'll have impulse power in six hours.
aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase cannon are online.
have hoshi and travis start analysing that pod.
its configuration suggests it's aquatic.
i was aboard one of their ships. that's the last thing i remember.
do you have any idea why they released you?
i think i may have gotten through to one of them. degra.
thanks. are you all right?
i'm fine. i should help lieutenant reed with his repairs.
they went to a lot of trouble to let you go. do you really think they'll attack us again?
they're not exactly unified. the reptilians came after us on their own. they might decide to finish what they started.
"we've run out of moons to hide behind, but there is a cometary dust cloud not too far off."
t'pol?
the diamagnetic field should shield us from long range scans.
how far away is it?
engineering to the bridge. we just picked up a surge in the eps grid on a deck.
thanks for the warning. how far?
"at present speed, about three days."
set a course.
aye sir.
"instead of hiding, shouldn't we be looking for the weapon?"
our sensors are still offline.
let's focus on getting ourselves operational. we can't mount a search with a ship coming down on our heads.
i thought insectoid was tough.
almost sounds like music.
my mother always wanted me to take piano lessons. i should have listened to her.
it's never too late. you can start when we get home. we're getting home.
what makes you think we can trust this guy?
who?
"degra. he seems like the last person who'd come around to our side. i mean, he designed the weapon."
"he may not be on our side, but i get the feeling he's starting to question his."
"well, let's hope you're right. i think we're ready to fire this up.  maybe not."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
there's an unidentified vessel approaching. they're asking for our assistance.
any details?
just that they've taken heavy damage.
join the club.
how long till they get here?
twelve minutes.
set a rendezvous course. maybe we can help each other.
"they have minimal weapons, all powered down."
i'm detecting numerous spatial anomalies in the area.
can you get us through them?
i believe so.
hail them. this is captain archer. we're responding to your distress call.
"thank you for coming, but be aware. this region contains dangerous spatial distortions."
we've run into them before.
they've damaged our engines and life support. we would appreciate whatever assistance you can give us.
we'll see what we can do.
what brings you to this system?
curiosity. we're studying the red giant. it's the first one we've had the opportunity to explore. we weren't prepared for these spatial anomalies as you call them. seems you weren't either.
"actually, this is all the result of combat."
combat?
have you heard of a species called the xindi?
no. we're new to this region of space.
let's talk about your ship. we know a way to insulate against the anomalies. there's a substance called trellium-d.
i've heard of it. it's extremely rare.
i have sixty kilos sitting in my cargo bay.
perhaps we can work out some sort of trade.
that's what i had in mind.
"given the condition of my vessel, i don't know what we can offer you."
our warp engine is badly damaged.
"we could probably spare a few plasma injectors, maybe some antimatter."
i was thinking more along the lines of a warp coil.
i'm afraid that's one thing we can't spare.
maybe we can make it worth your while. we have certain technology that you'd probably find useful.
"without a warp coil, the journey back to our system would take three years. we're not equipped for a voyage of that length."
"the xindi have already wiped out seven million of my people. now they're building a weapon to destroy our entire world. i have to stop them. without warp drive, i won't succeed."
"i sympathise, captain. i will help you in any other way, but i won't jeopardize the lives of my crew. i'm sorry."
"the escape pod can manoeuvre underwater. aside from that, nothing out of the ordinary."
"i've gone through the databanks. just your standard navigational operational files, but i did find one document. an engineer asking his supervisors for additional parts. here's a translation."
"the names of these supervisors. piral, jaina, trenia."
the names of degra's children.
i discovered a set of coordinates embedded in the document.
it's not a star system.
"there was another embedded number. a stardate, three days from now."
how far away are the coordinates?
four light years. we'll need at least warp three to make it in time. it's unlikely that degra will wait beyond three days.
"he's all yours. he was the perfect house guest, as usual. you'll be happy to know that i discharged ensign ansara this morning, and corporal o'malley will be returning to duty this afternoon. captain?"
it's hard to imagine that we'll ever get this ship back to the way it was.
"it's a simple matter of repairs. well, perhaps not that simple. somehow, i don't think it's the damage to enterprise that's troubling you."
how long have you been a doctor?
nearly forty years.
"and in all that time, did you ever do anything you thought was unethical?"
twice. why?
"i'm about to step over a line, a line i thought i would never cross. and given the nature of our mission, it probably won't be the last."
probably not. may i ask what you're planning to do?
there could be more casualties.
i'll be ready.
put together an armed boarding party.
"who are we boarding, sir?"
the alien ship we docked with.
i don't understand.
"we need their warp coil. they won't give it to us, so we're going to have to take it."
captain.
get your men together!
where are the other members of the council?
we didn't want them here.
why?
we've learned something about the reptilians that concerns us.
there's distrust amongst you.
you can help alleviate it.
continue.
we were told the reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon.
who told you this?
"we've also learned that they were building this bioweapon in the past, on earth."
"as far as we're aware, reptilians don't possess the technology for time travel."
you want to know if they had my help.
did they?
"yes. after you prohibited them from constructing the bioweapon, the reptilians and the insectoids were prepared to withdraw from the council. i assisted them so the council would remain unified."
you helped them to circumvent our authority.
i protected your authority by keeping the council intact.
what happened to the bioweapon?
"it was never completed, and the three reptilians were never found."
you can't locate them.
there are limits to what we can do in your realm.
it seems you can do more than we thought. is it true your species built the spheres?
"what makes you think you can subject me to this interrogation? if it weren't for my assistance, your species would be facing destruction."
we're grateful for the help that you've given us.
"then prove it. focus on the task at hand. the weapon is nearly complete. if you permit yourselves to become distracted, you'll fail to destroy your real enemy. the enemy of all xindi. don't summon me again unless every member of the council is present. i won't help fuel your internal bickering."
you don't believe her.
do you?
why should we take archer's word over hers?
because archer offered something she hasn't. proof.
"under normal circumstances they'd be no match for us, but we've sustained a lot more damage than they have. this could be risky."
one lucky shot to our starboard nacelle
let's make sure they don't get any lucky shots.
why don't we just transport their warp coil to enterprise?
"it's tied into their injector system. if we use the transporter, we'd destroy their engines. i've got to get in there, decouple it by hand."
how long?
"ten minutes, give or take. can't tell for sure until i see it."
"if they fight back, ten minutes could be a very long time."
perhaps we should reconsider negotiation.
"we can't risk tipping them off. we have to take them by surprise. that'll reduce the losses on both sides. we'll disable their ship as quickly as we can, beam over, extract the warp coil and get out, hopefully without any casualties. set a course."
can i have a word with you?
not right now.
"if i had another option, i'd take it."
we are no different than the marauders who attacked us when we entered the expanse.
we're a lot different.
by stealing their warp coil we could be condemning them to death.
"we're going to leave them a supply of trellium, along with some extra food. i'm not saying it'll be easy for them, but they'll stand a decent chance of making it home."
you're forgetting that we're in a dangerous region of space. our assault could cripple their ability to defend themselves.
not if we do it right.
and what if something goes wrong?
we can debate this all day. i've made my decision.
we can't save humanity without holding on to what makes us human. those were your words to me.
"i'm no happier doing this than you are, but we're not going to make a habit of it."
"once you rationalise the first mis-step, it's easy to fall into a pattern of behaviour."
i'm not rationalising anything. i know full well what i'm doing.
i can't justify this course of action.
we don't have a choice.
i won't let you do it!
"we've had our share of disagreements, but you've never taken it out on my desk before."
i apologise.
what's happening to you?
it's been a difficult few days. i haven't had the time to meditate.
maybe you should find the time.
i didn't mean what i said.
"i'm glad to hear it. i'll be leading the boarding party. there's no margin for error. if we don't do this right, people are going to die. we need you on the bridge."
understood.
doctor.
"yes, this will just take a moment."
what is it?
there's a good deal of residual trellium in your bloodstream. how long have you been doing this?
three months.
i need to know precisely what has been happening.
"when i was exposed to trellium aboard the seleya, it affected me in a way that i wasn't prepared for."
"as i recall, you were homicidal and paranoid."
"the initial effects were overwhelming, but as they began to wear off i discovered i was able to access certain emotions. i wanted more. i began to experiment by ingesting small amounts of trellium. i devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream."
you must have known it was dangerous. trellium exposure is deadly to vulcans. it eats away at the neural pathways.
"i thought, in small amounts, it would be safe. at first, i was able to control the new emotions. my interactions with the crew improved."
"commander tucker, for example. when did you realise you were becoming addicted?"
"two days ago. the damage to e deck made it impossible to access the cargo bay. i began experiencing agitation, anxiety, withdrawal symptoms."
you're not experiencing them now.
i was able to retrieve the trellium. i was almost killed in the process.
"this will help stabilise your synaptic pathways, but the withdrawal symptoms will return in a few days. it's going to take time. it won't be easy."
i understand.
archer to t'pol.
go ahead.
we're approaching the vessel. report to the bridge.
i'm on my way.
you should remain here for observation.
the captain needs me. i have to go.
i expect you to report back here at the first sign of trouble.
are you going to discuss this with the captain?
this is between you and your doctor.
good luck.
you have the bridge.
stand by weapons.
"run another test. if it doesn't hold, we'll have to bypass the entire assembly.  what is it?"
"sir, there's a vessel approaching. it's the earth ship."
have you contacted them?
they're not responding.
they're still hailing us.
two hundred kilometres.
target their propulsion systems.
aye.
fire.
their warp drive's offline. they're charging weapons.
bridge to transporter.
they're firing.
energise.
that's the access port.
stun grenade.  go!
their weapons are at fifty percent.
"we have another hull breach, on e deck."
our port thrusters are offline.
we have to take out their weapons!
we can't leave them defenceless.
"if we want to get through this in one piece, we may have no choice."
the captain's orders.
clear.
cover.  archer.
captain.
we've hit a little snag.
they're targeting our starboard nacelle.
evasive manoeuvres. t'pol to the captain.
go ahead.
we're taking heavy damage.
there's a forcefield around the warp coil.
trip's trying to disable it.
try it now.
archer to enterprise.
go ahead.
parson's been hit. lock onto her comm. signal and
beam her out of here.
lieutenant.
we're venting atmosphere on c deck. t'pol!
adjust phase cannons to a narrow confinement beam. target this power juncture.
got it.
fire!
right there.
archer.
commander tucker's aboard. we have it.
stand by to beam us out. fall back.
"what you can't have, you take by force?"
we've beamed three containers of trellium into your cargo hold as compensation. there's also food and supplies.
you're stranding us three years from home. why are you doing this?
because i have no choice. energise.
i'm not sure why i asked you to come see me.
perhaps you just needed some company.
perhaps.
how do you feel?
"i thought that without the trellium i would no longer have difficulty suppressing my emotions, but that's not true."
it's not surprising that there are residual effects. they're probably temporary.
and if they're not?
then you'll learn to cope with them.
i'm not certain i'll be able to. i'm
afraid?
vulcans don't experience fear.
you sought these emotions. don't expect them to vanish overnight. patience.
a few tweaks and it fit right in.
what's our top speed.
three point two. that should get us to the rendezvous point with time to spare.
you did the right thing.
"it seems the longer we're out here, the more i have to keep saying that to myself."
those people'll be okay. they'll get home.
captain to the bridge.
go ahead.
prepare to go to maximum warp.
aye sir.
"we're in bad shape, i can't deny that, but we're still in one piece. enterprise is a tough            ship. she took more than anyone could ask her to and then some, and so have all of you. i wanted to say            thank you. i only wish i could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost. like you, they understood how            important our mission is and they accepted the risks. we came into the expanse not knowing what we'd find,            with no one to rely on but ourselves, but we're going to succeed, to accomplish our mission, for everyone            on earth who's relying on us, and for the eighteen."
we managed to get into sections six and seven on c deck. we found taylor and kamata.
that accounts for everyone.
what's our status on weapons?
mister reed has both forward phase cannons back online in addition to the aft torpedo launchers.            hull plating is up to eighty percent.
that'll have to do.
"we could wait, hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs."
degra's message was clear. we're to meet him ten hours from now.
and i don't intend to be late.
maybe that's what he's counting on. lure us into an ambush while we're still licking            our wounds.
i've made my decision. we have a lot of work to do. i suggest we get to it.
aye sir.
"commander. crewman taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?"
"she was an eps control specialist, a damn good one."
i'd like you to write a letter to her family.
she worked on rostov's team. i can ask him.
i asked you.
i'm barely holding the ship together. i don't have time to sit down to and write a letter.
it doesn't have to be long. her family deserves to know what happened to her.
understood.
you're busy. i'll come back.
have a seat. i'll have to use a hand scanner. the imaging chamber is still offline.            commander tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here. he said the armoury was            a higher priority. we'll see how low a priority i am the next time he burns his fingers on a            plasma conduit.  you've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?
none.
i'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system. hardly worth mentioning.            that's good news. what is it?
these emotions have grown more difficult to control. my usual techniques for suppressing them            haven't been effective.
"on earth, there is a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing a magical creature called a            genie from the bottle. once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in."
are you saying these emotions may never subside?
you used trellium for three months. it caused significant damage to your neural pathways. you            may have to learn to live with these emotions.
"we're approaching the coordinates, captain. right on schedule."
"no ships out there, sir."
hoshi.
scanning all frequencies. nothing so far.
maybe they're running late?
tactical alert!
it's a spatial anomaly. we've entered a dense field.
tucker to the bridge.
this is not the best time for this.
"stand by, trip."
reports of injuries on b deck.
"no one's out there, sir."
get us out of here.
"aye, sir."
captain.
we're receiving a transmission. it's degra. he's telling us to follow him.
"stay with him, travis."
"aye, sir."
they're hailing us.
i see you found my message. we have a great deal to discuss            and i don't have much time. come aboard my ship.
if we'd left you with the reptilians they would have killed you.
degra arranged for the aquatics to return you to your ship.
then you also called off the attack on enterprise?
the reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.
you've taken a big risk.
"if you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake."
everything i've told you is true.
"forgive me, but the council will need more than your word. perhaps            you can demonstrate your ability to time travel?"
"that might be a bit difficult, but if you come aboard my ship i can give you            all the proof you want."
very well.
but there are some things i want to know first.
such as?
when will your weapon be launched?
the precise date hasn't been determined yet.
weeks? days?
that's up to the council.
"i'm trying to help you, but i need to know my world isn't being destroyed            while i'm doing it."
the weapon won't be launched for several days. show us your proof and we'll            do what we can to stop it.
what'd you get?
pepperoni pizza.
"don't worry, you can pick the pepperoni off."
damage reports?
"no, the captain wants me to write a letter to crewman taylor's family."
i'm sure they'll appreciate that.
their daughter's dead. do you really think they'll care what i have to say?
when was the last time you slept?
i don't know. not since the attack.
that was two days ago.
"all right then, two days."
go to your quarters. get some sleep.
"believe me, i'd love to."
i could order you.
"i don't have time. we're full of holes. the only thing keeping us            flying is a stolen warp coil, and now i've got to write this letter.  what the hell?"
tucker to engineering. shut down the auxiliary coolant line between sections twelve            and fourteen on e deck.
aye sir.
"tucker to sickbay. medical emergency on e deck, section twelve."
"on my way, commander."
reactor pressure's holding. good thing i wasn't taking a nap.
damron.
a friend of yours?
"a colleague, of sorts."
"they're the ones we found on earth, in the past."
and this is the result of your finding them?
they were about to release a bioweapon that would have decimated the population.
reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species. damron and his            team disappeared shortly after the council rejected his proposal.
apparently he decided to go ahead without your council's approval.
"but fortunately, you were able to stop him, by travelling back through time."
"i already told you. we had help, just like they did."
this proves nothing. how do we know he didn't capture them in the present.
you need more evidence.
"they had this with them. we destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample            of it in stasis."
"this appears to be xindi technology, but i'd like to have our engineers confirm it."
"have them come aboard, perform whatever test they'd like."
"this proves nothing except the reptilians disobeyed the council, which comes            as no great surprise. but you also claim that we've been misled by transdimensional aliens.            where is your evidence of that?"
come with me.
there's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket. that's why it ruptured.
i ran a pressure test.
"tell it to the man lying in sickbay! test them again, all of them."
"aye, sir."
commander.
"i'm a little busy, doc."
so it seems. i understand you haven't slept since the attack.
t'pol tattling on me now?
perhaps she's worried about you.
"well, i appreciate that, but i'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and            baling wire."
has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?
"your concern is duly noted, doc, but i've got to get back to work."
i don't believe so.
come again?
i'm relieving you of duty. you will go to your quarters and not return to your post before oh five            hundred tomorrow.
six hours?
please don't make me involve security.
archer to doctor phlox.
"yes, captain."
i need you in sickbay.
"i'll be right there. well, commander?"
i can give you two hours.
i believe the number was six.
if i'm gone longer than three there may not be a ship here when i get back.
four. not a minute less.
done. and remind me never to buy a car from you. captain's waiting for you.
i'm aware of that.
"well, goodnight then."
we found him adrift. do you recognise his species?
we've met one of them.
what caused his death?
some kind of cellular degeneration. it started the moment he was taken off his ship.
perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.
i believe our universe was toxic to him. his species evolved in a different dimension with            a different set of physical laws. he simply couldn't exist here.
"that's why his species built the spheres, to make our space more compatible for themselves."
i believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding.
"and if they are, you're saying the expanse will no longer be compatible for us."
or any of us.
"we're destined to form an alliance to stop them, but if you destroy earth that'll            never happen. you'll be condemning your own race to extinction."
"trouble sleeping, sir?"
taylor! you were killed. this whole section decompressed. did you find a sealed compartment?
no.
"then how?  you're dead, and i'm dreaming."
the letter. how's it going?
i got as far as 'i regret to inform you.'
"that's a little dry, sir."
you're not real. you don't have to call me sir.
"so what's the problem? the letter doesn't have to be long, the captain told you that.            you can't think of anything."
i wish it was that simple.
i served on enterprise for three years. you pulled me off the saratoga to be on your            team. captain brody was pretty angry at you.
i'd forgot about that.
you told me i'd make a fine chief engineer someday.
you will. you would have.
"then tell my parents that. tell them about the practical jokes rostov used to play, or that            one time when i found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed?            tell them how hard i worked. tell them how much you liked me. why can't you look at me? just            remember me. is that asking so much?"
yes.
why?
why?
these tests only confirm the equipment belonged to the reptilians.
there's also evidence of chronometric distortion. time travel.
the readings could have been fabricated.
you're determined not to trust him.
"no more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says. now, i admit            archer's evidence is intriguing, but we barely know this human. our contact from the future            has helped us many times. she brought this council together."
and you've never wondered if she might have an agenda of her own?
"i am not a fool, degra. all i'm saying is that it'll take a little more than a            few chronometric distortions to turn the council against her."
captain archer is expecting me.
more evidence?
he claims to know a great deal about the spheres.
"degra, i know you've had doubts about building the weapon. don't let them cloud            your judgment."
we've been working to reconstruct our database.
"the pounding your ships gave us didn't help much. try it now. i'm going to            reset the optical subprocessors. that might clear it up. when we slipped through your detection            grid, we got a look at the weapon you're building. an impressive piece of engineering. hell, it'd take            at least a thousand starships like enterprise to blow up an entire planet. you know, i'd like to            see the telemetry from the probe you launched against earth."
increase the data resolution.
"i assume you were watching the attack, calculating the blast yields. boy, you must            have been pretty damn excited. i mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through florida.            that's the name of one of the places you destroyed. florida."
commander.
"did you actually see the cities burning? the houses, the people being           vaporised? i had a sister there."
commander!
how are the repairs coming.
"just need a few more minutes, captain."
why don't you join me in my ready room until they're finished.
let's stick to the job at hand.
"aye, sir."
the captain is trying to gain degra's trust.
it's one of the warp plasma conduits.
it must have ruptured when our sensors were offline.
perhaps my crew can help.
we'll handle it.
we'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.
"the flow regulators are damaged. there are manual cut-offs here and here, but            we can only access it from outside."
that's very close to the fire.
"we don't have a choice.  if we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor."
get going.
i could use a hand.
"that'd be me, sir."
open that panel and i'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.
where's the other valve?
over there.
"i need to open the emergency bypass ports first, and you can't close            your valve until i release the pressure from the secondary lines."
"commander, i have a problem."
i think the heat's warped the metal. the panel won't open.
use your plasma torch. i'll be there in a minute. i'm releasing the interlocks            on the first port.
this is going to take a while.
"careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, malcolm."
the manifold pressure is increasing. we have less than six minutes before the            fire reaches the reactor shielding.
archer to trip.
you've got less than six minutes.
understood.
"you okay, malcolm?"
almost there.
"captain, the temperature in lieutenant reed's suit is over forty four degrees."
he's too close to the fire. his ev suit can't compensate.
malcolm
get back to the airlock.
"i'm almost finished, captain."
that's an order.
"get inside, malcolm. i can wrap it up.             i'm opening the primary bypass port. two more to go and we're in business."
forty six degrees.
malcolm.
"i'm sorry sir, you're breaking up."
"get inside, malcolm. i can finish."
there's no time. do what you have to do so i can shut this down.
a few more seconds. i'm purging the last port.
the forward valve is closed.
"okay, malcolm, clockwise ninety degrees."
"nice work, malcolm. malcolm?"
malcolm! tucker to doctor phlox.
meet us in the airlock.
we need to bring his body temperature down. let's get him to sickbay.
i hope he'll be alright.
what's one more dead human to you?
trip.
"he had no problem killing seven million of us, but seven million and one is more            than you can stomach?"
that's enough.
i guess even xindi have their limits.
i said that's enough!
"aye, sir."
we've determined there are fifty nine of them.
"seventy eight, at our last count."
seventy eight?
we've had more time to study them than you.
i apologise for mister tucker.
"i never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what i'd done. at the time,            i thought the attack was necessary to save my people."
"i know. believe it or not, we've had this conversation before."
"that's right. our escape from prison together. the reptilians are correct about            one thing, captain. you have an impressive facility for deception."
erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust.
probably not.  they are all connected by a            subspace energy grid. unfortunately our data on the spheres' interiors is extremely            limited.
maybe i can help.
how did you get this?
the first sphere we came across was damaged. there was a breach in the outer shell.
we've never been able to gain access to one. these scans are remarkably detailed for a            military vessel.
enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.
"if we're successful, it will be again."
"computer, begin recording. dear mister and mrs. taylor, i regret to inform you that            your daughter was killed in the line of duty. she was a fine engineer, and she died performing            her duties. computer, stop recording. delete that. computer, start again. dear mister and mrs. taylor. as            jane's commanding officer, it's with deepest regret that i inform you of her death. she was a            diligent engineer, very hard-working."
tactical alert. all hands to stations.
report.
we've detected a ship. they've just passed through the cloaking barrier.
on screen.
reptilians.
did you invite anyone else?
we masked our warp trail. i don't know how they found us.
where is degra?
he's involved in sensitive negotiations.
with the humans? i supposed the council authorised these           negotiations?
"no one authorised the development of a bioweapon, but that didn't deter your            colleagues from creating one."
undock from the human vessel immediately.
he intends to seize the human vessel. he'll destroy both our            ships if we don't comply.
stand by.
degra.
"i said, stand by."
we don't stand a chance against them. not in the shape we're in.
what kind of weapons do you have?
you expect me to attack a reptilian warship?
"if we work together, we might be able to disable them."
they're charging weapons.
are you familiar with the design of that ship?
i did some work on their power systems.
"then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons."
their ship is heavily armoured.
at least we'd stand a chance.
those reptilians are xindi. you're asking me to attack my own people.
proceed to our starboard docking port.
i want your word that my crew won't be punished.
you'll all be dealt with as the council sees fit.
he's nearly reached the reptilians.
he's knocked out their shield generators.
fire.
evasive manoeuvres. keep            firing. target their weapons.
their weapons are down. degra was spot on. he knew exactly where to hit them.
open a channel to degra.
"sir, he's charging weapons!"
the reptilian ship has been destroyed.
"captain, degra's hailing us."
they would have contacted the council and exposed our alliance.            i had no choice.
crewman rostov said i'd find you here.
repair crews are starting tomorrow. thought i'd try and get them some power.            these assemblies are all fused together. i've spent the last hour trying to isolate            the damaged relays.
you might find this useful. portable power cells.
courtesy of our new xindi friends? damn neighbourly of them.
is there anything i can help you with?
"not unless you can resurrect the dead. crewman taylor had a real knack for this            kind of thing. but taylor's not here, is she, and neither is crewman kamata, or ensign marcel            or a dozen others. so forgive me if i don't want the damn power cells!  we found taylor over there,            outside her quarters. she was probably trying to get to her station. if she'd made it a few more metres            i wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter. 'cause every time i start i hear myself saying, what a fine            young woman she was, how smart and full of potential. and i realise that i'm not thinking            about taylor at all. i'm thinking about elizabeth. there's so many people dead. i tried not            to see her any differently than the other seven million, so i've spent the last nine months            trying to pretend she was just another victim. but she's my sister, t'pol. my baby sister.             i envy you vulcans."
"you think that the loss of a colleague or friend doesn't affect us? it does. but if we give in            to those emotions, they overwhelm us. you're the ones to be envied."
"you need to speak to the council. with the evidence you've shown me, they'll have no            choice but to take us seriously."
even the reptilians?
"i'm more concerned about the aquatics. they can be somewhat enigmatic, but if we can            sway them we'll have the majority on our side.  these are the coordinates of the council chamber."
this is nearly a dozen light years away. it'll take us weeks to get there.
"there's a shorter route, a subspace corridor. it's located in a nebula less than half            a light year from here. that will show your helmsman how to get through it. i'll meet you at the            far end in three days."
will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?
i'll do everything i can to delay it. use caution when you enter the nebula. a hostile            species is known to prey on ships that approach it.
thanks for the warning.
see you in three days.
three days.
"computer, begin recording. mister and mrs. taylor, by the time you get this, starfleet            will have already told you about jane. since i worked so closely with her, i wanted to add            my personal condolences. i have to confess, i've been putting off writing this for a while. i            convinced myself that my duties on enterprise took precedence. but the truth is i didn't want            to face the fact that someone so young, with so much promise, could just be gone. but i'm            facing it now, and i find myself thinking how important she was to me. she was a great engineer,            and she was my friend. she won't be forgotten."
"goodbye, elizabeth."
come in. the probe?
we couldn't stop it from entering the vortex. it's on it's way to earth.
seven million people.
everything is happening as it did before.
then you have no choice. you must find jonathan archer.
come in.
i'm sorry about to bother you. i'm having a little trouble falling asleep. i think my insomnia 's come back.
you're here for neuro-pressure.
it's been weeks since our last session. we've all been under a lot of stress lately. i thought it might do us both some good.
i think we should discontinue these treatments.
why?
you've become quite skilled with the postures i've shown you.
you told me it takes years to master neuro-pressure. i'm not that quick a study.
i've taught you all i can.
"look, truth is i'm sleeping fine. i ain't come for neuro-pressure, i came because i'm worried about you."
worried?
"you've been keeping to yourself a lot lately, even more than usual. you spend every free moment in your quarters, you even asked chef to bring your meals here."
the mess hall's heavily damaged. where do you suggest i eat?
"come on, you've got to admit you've been avoiding me ever since the two of us, you know, when we"
had sexual relations.
that's real romantic when you put it that way.
"i told you, what happened was an exploration, not the prelude to an intimate relationship."
i never said i wanted a relationship.
neither did i.
"you helped me get through a rough patch, and i'm grateful. i just stopped by to see if i could return the favour."
"i appreciate your concern, but i'm fine."
degra said these kovaalans have only one or two ships inside the nebula.
it would appear that his information is out of date. there are at least half a dozen ships.
"according to degra, they're not very tolerant of trespassers. how close are they to the corridor?"
within sixty thousand kilometres.
we'll ionise the hull. that should mask our approach for a while.
"i suggest we enter here, above this layer of metreon gas. it should reflect our engine signature, create multiple sensor ghosts, false readings. if we're lucky they won't know which one to fire at."
you gave them the coordinates? they could launch an attack against the council!
archer's ship was heavily damaged. they wouldn't stand a chance against one of our cruisers.
there may be other human ships in the expanse.
those readings were never confirmed.
this discussion is pointless. you won't be allowed to bring archer before the council.
then we won't ask their permission.
he'll be killed the moment he steps into the council chamber.
they have to listen. his allegations are too important to simply dismiss.
do you believe archer's being truthful?
"i don't think he's told us everything, but i can't explain the evidence that we saw."
the humans could have manufactured this evidence. they'd do anything to save their planet.
"if archer is telling the truth, then all the council's efforts will have been for nothing."
reptilians patrol this side of the corridor. they'll destroy the human vessel as soon as it comes through.
i've already considered that. we can protect them.
what makes you think the reptilians won't fire on us?
tactical alert. take us in.
"aye, sir."
a ship is dropping out of warp.
can you identify it?
this can't be right.
t'pol?
"it's starfleet, nx class."
are you sure it's not a sensor reflection?
we haven't entered the nebula yet.
"whoever they are, they're on an intercept course."
we're within visual range.
"must be the nx02, colombia."
it's still under construction.
i don't think that's colombia.
we're being hailed.
"captain archer, you must reverse course immediately."
who are you?
there's no time to explain. alter your heading.
"come about, ensign. would you tell me what the hell is going on?"
your weapons won't be necessary.
i'd like some answers first.
"i'm lorian, commander of enterprise. karyn archer, my first officer."
we should find a place to talk. perhaps the conference room? you'll want t'pol to join us.
"you can't take your ship into the subspace corridor. if you do, you'll be thrown back in time a hundred and seventeen years."
how would you know that?
because it's already happened. we're here to make certain that history doesn't repeat itself.
the kovaalans attacked enterprise as soon as it entered the nebula.
phase cannons are offline.
"torpedoes, full spread. how long until we reach the corridor?"
eighteen seconds.
all plating's gone.
we're losing speed.
hold your course.
"the trip through the corridor took only a few seconds, but it didn't take long before your crew realised something was wrong."
no sign of pursuit.
where are we?
we've travelled eleven point six light years.
degra?
nothing on long range sensors.
"captain, the stars. they're not where they're supposed to be."
are you sure we're at the right co-ordinates?
yes.
enterprise was in the right place
"but it was over a hundred years early. we're not entirely sure why this happened, but we have a theory. we think your impulse wake destabilised the corridor, causing it to shift in time."
"why didn't you, didn't we, go back through it?"
t'pol eventually determined that ships can only travel through this corridor in one direction.
i'll notify the crew. let travis know we'll be getting underway.
what course should we set?
"even if we found a way out of the expanse, we can't go back to earth. we'd be contaminating our own culture, our own history."
cochran's warp flight won't happen for another twenty six years.
maybe there's a way we can use this to our advantage.
how?
"we know the date when earth is attacked by the first xindi probe. we may be able to figure out a way to warn them, or even prevent the attack."
the probe won't be deployed for more than a hundred years.
your crew realised it would be their descendants
"who'd have to complete this mission. it was only a matter of time before the first child was born. enterprise became a generational ship. you showed your children how to operate and maintain it's systems, and they did the same for their children."
you've been flying around the expanse for over a century?
that's unlikely. enterprise doesn't have fuel or provisions for such a long journey.
"you've hardly changed, mother."
i beg your pardon?
"you made alliances with other species, traded technology for food and supplies. you even acquired a few alien crew members. we did our best to carry out the mission you gave us, captain."
to destroy the first xindi probe. but you failed.
"we had years to prepare, but in the end we were only one starship. our weapons were no match for the xindi. we couldn't stop the first attack, but we can help you stop the second. we can make certain you reach the rendezvous with degra this time."
you said we couldn't travel through the corridor.
you won't need to. we've encountered dozens of species. some of them shared their propulsion technology with us.
we got these schematics from haridan traders. we can use them to modify your injector assembly. you'll be able to travel at warp six point nine for brief intervals.
the hull wasn't designed for that speed.
we'll show you how to reinforce structural integrity. you'll be able to reach degra in less than two days.
you've made these modifications on your own ship?
our plasma injectors are too old. they can't handle the stress. but your injectors are practically new. you're still not convinced.
"you've got to admit, it's a lot to accept."
we don't have a lot of time. you need to start these modifications.
i'm not comfortable doing that just yet.
perhaps we should go to sickbay. phlox can confirm our identity.
"they are who they claim to be. most of the young woman's ancestors were human, but there are also chromosomes from three species i've never seen before. these genetic markers belong to you, captain. she would appear to be your great grand-daughter. i've compared your genetic profile with lorian's. these base pair sequences could only have come from you."
these chromosomes are human.
that's correct. they came from his father.
that's impossible. vulcans and humans have never been able to reproduce.
"according to lorian, i discovered, or rather i will discover, a method of successfully combining human and vulcan genomes."
who's the father?
commander tucker.
"it's the strangest thing. i look at you and i see my father. right here, around the eyes. now the ears, those are your mothers. wait a minute, you smiled."
i wasn't raised with the same inhibitions most vulcans have. my human side has allowed me to find a balance between emotion and logic. i've even been known to tell a joke on occasion. would you hand me the coil spanner? i learned almost everything i know by studying your engineering logs.
pretty dry reading. i hope i gave you some hands-on training as well.
i'm sure you would have. you should reinitialise the start-up routine before going to warp six.
there's something you're not telling me.
you died when i was fourteen.
what happened?
i'm not sure we should be discussing your future.
it couldn't have been easy growing up without the old man around. sorry i wasn't there.
you were a good father. it's strange being able to tell you that.
maybe you could tell me more about your mother. how the two of us got together.
she never told me. mother rarely talked about you. i think it was too painful. she cared for you a great deal.
doesn't seem like we're talking about the same t'pol.
your relationship was somewhat contentious. but you were always affectionate towards each other.
i just can't see myself married to her. i suppose if we were marooned on a desert island.
we should finish up with these injectors.
we've doubled the efficiency of our atmosphere processors. we can give you those specs too.
thanks. starfleet will be glad to hear enterprise was built to last.
thanks.
wasn't that boy denobulan?
many of our crew are descendants of phlox. he and amanda had nine children.
you're not entirely human yourself.
my great grandmother was ikaaran.
was that?
your wife. her name was esilia. you rescued her ship from an anomaly field.
"you know, finding your ship explains a few things. when the xindi took me prisoner they asked me one question over and over. they wanted to know how many ships starfleet had in the expanse."
i'm sure they've picked us up on their sensors more than once.
i thought we were going to the bridge.
there's someone who'd like to see you first.
"hello, jonathan."
t'pol.
it's good to see you.
living with humans for so long has changed you. they didn't tell me you were still aboard.
"you mean, still alive. you look well. how's trip?"
"he's fine. if you'd like, i'll have him come by and say hello."
that might be awkward.
there's so much i want to ask you. i don't know where to start.
i wish we had time to get reacquainted.
you must give this to your science officer. she'll know what it means.
"two, a boy and a girl. toru and yoshiko."
who's the father?
i don't know. it was probably in their database but i didn't look it up.
why not? you've got to be curious.
"some things are better left a mystery. how about you, did you get married?"
corporal mackenzie.
a maco? how well do you know her?
we talked after a training session once.
yeah? you should ask her out.
is this taken?
please.
"so, lieutenant, who'd you end up with? on the other enterprise. did you get married, have kids?"
"no. actually, i didn't. apparently the reed family line came to a rather unceremonious end. you'd think on a ship quite this size i'd have been able to find someone, but."
women only make up a third of the crew. there were bound to be a few bachelors left over.
"yeah, and it would appear i'm going to be one of them."
i'm on duty in a few minutes.
"me too. see you later, sir."
this seat's available.
she thinks that lorian's plan won't work. t'pol found a discrepancy in his calculations. if we exceed warp five point six the injectors could start to overload. we'd be destroyed.
have you shown that to trip?
he agrees with the assessment.
"we'll have to contact degra, tell him we won't be able to make the rendezvous."
there is an alternative. the subspace corridor.
we'll be thrown back in time.
not necessarily. t'pol spent many years examining their sensor logs from the incident. she believes it's possible to reconfigure our impulse manifolds. it should prevent the corridor from destabilising.
how long will it take?
about twelve hours.
you should have told me. my ship could be destroyed.
there's only a twenty two percent chance of an overload.
i'd call that a damn big risk.
there's no alternative. you'll be thrown into the past if you try to use the corridor.
i've got two t'pols who disagree with you.
"the kovaalans will attack enterprise the moment it enters the nebula. if they damage your manifolds, the corridor will destabilise again."
it's our best option.
you have to listen to me.
this is my mission and my decision.
saving earth is my mission as much as yours.
i didn't come over here for a debate. i've already given the order. trip's short-handed in engineering. if you could spare a few people he'd get the work done faster.
you're the captain.
you shouldn't have spoken to archer.
he had a right to know the risks. why didn't you tell him?
if they use that corridor their mission will fail. earth will be destroyed.
you're allowing your human side to get the better of you.
you know nothing about being human.
i know that for them guilt can be a powerful motivator. don't let it cloud your judgment.
"maybe you'd be a little more concerned if vulcan was in danger, and not earth."
we'll meet with degra. i'll speak to the xindi council.
but degra's not expecting us.
archer's following the same course of action he did before. he's not going to be at the rendezvous.
but the plan could work.
we can't just sit here and hope he succeeds. billions of lives are at stake.
"how are we supposed to reach degra? we can't sustain warp six, our injectors are too old."
we're going to use the injectors from archer's ship.
do you expect him to simply give them to us?
no.
you're going to steal them? their warp drive will be disabled.
my father's a resourceful engineer. he'll be able to fabricate new injectors.
you're asking me to betray jonathan archer.
"i know this won't be easy, but we've had to make difficult choices before. our parents and grandparents lived and died aboard this ship to ensure that someday we would be able to stop the xindi. this is our time. if earth is going to survive, we have to act."
have you spent any time talking to lorian?
not really.
you should. he seems like a good kid.
he's hardly a kid. he's more than a hundred years old.
"only in the expanse could i have a son who's nearly three times my age. who would have thought you and me, huh? lorian says we're going to be married in a traditional vulcan ceremony. it's going to take me weeks to learn to pronounce the vows. you know where we're going to have our honeymoon? cargo bay three. he says i'll fill it up with sand that we dug up from a passing asteroid. i'm even supposed to  i'm even supposed to manufacture a palm tree."
it's ridiculous to assume those events are going to happen. hand me the flux coupler.
aren't you at all curious about how you and i are supposed to end up together?
the fact that our counterparts married doesn't mean that we'll do the same.
you're afraid to admit that under the right circumstances you could have feelings for me. maybe you have them already.
i should have known this was a mistake.
what?
exploring human sexuality with you. you're obviously unable to have a physical relationship without developing an emotional attachment.
"you know, all the other women on board must have been taken, because i can't imagine any other reason why i would have married someone as stubborn as you. i'll go help rostov with the port manifold. you seem to have everything under control."
doctor?
"captain.  their sickbay is in poor shape, and they're short on critical medical supplies. so, with your permission?"
whatever we can spare.
"i can't believe this. my rigellian parrot is still alive. i knew they had long lifespans, but"
you mentioned something about inoculations.
"oh, yes. eight members of their crew are suffering from low-grade nubilian fever. i'd like to vaccinate everyone on both ships. their physician, and i use that term generously, is very inexperienced. and i'd like some time to give him a refresher course in viral propagation."
do what you can.
"it's remarkable, isn't it? discovering an extended family that you never knew existed. did you know that i have nearly thirty living descendants on that ship? i look forward to introducing them to my wives on denobula."
"i suppose when this mission is over, most of their crew will want to return to earth."
"from what i've gathered, your great grand-daughter would be more at home on the bridge of a starship."
we seem to be cut from the same cloth.
perhaps starfleet will consider allowing children on board starships one day. admiral forrest did let you bring porthos.
i can imagine the look on the admiral's face when he sees two enterprises pulling into spacedock. keep me updated.
"injectors are still online. greer,"
how much longer?
it's taking more time than we thought to reroute the plasma.
stand by.
i want those starboard modules recalibrated first.
hold your fire.
what the hell are you doing?
greer to lorian.
the flow's been diverted.
get back to the ship.  go.
we won't be able to go to warp without those injectors!
archer gave me no other option.
take some advice from your old man. you don't want to do this.
he'll alert the others.
i'm sorry.
what's wrong?
warp engines just went offline. our plasma injectors are disengaged.
"archer to engineering. trip, respond. send a security team."
they've undocked.
hail them.
no response.
they're preparing to go to warp.
disable their engines.
they're targeting our nacelles.
take us to warp.
i can't. they've knocked out the starboard power couplings.
"get us out of here, full impulse. return fire."
hull plating at sixty one percent.
they're making a run for it.
stay with them.
they have the same complement of weapons as we do.
we would appear to be evenly matched.
"get down to the transporter, and stand by."
"bring us in low, underneath them. target their hull plating relays."
we've lost hull plating.
t'pol?
i can't establish a lock.
we need to get closer.
you heard her.
we've lost power on c deck.
weapons are gone.
two thousand metres.
t'pol!
"sir, our weapons are losing power. archer's using the transporter. they've taken one of our eps manifolds."
now lock onto their primary relays. they're on
"c deck, junction twelve."
acknowledged.
we're losing main power.
this is captain archer. looks like we've got some things that belong to each other.
why don't we call a truce and return our respective property.
"sir, they still have one torpedo in the forward tube. it's locked onto our starboard engine."
i know you've got your finger on the trigger.
"if you fire that torpedo, you're going to hurt a lot of people over here."
"lorian,"
answer me.
we can't do this.
there's too much at stake.
"these people are family. i'm not going to let you kill them. captain, it's over."
stand down weapons. tell archer i want to talk.
you were lucky. phlox says the injuries on both ships were minor. you almost crippled us. my mission would have been over.
"your mission is over, captain. you just won't accept it. i took the only logical course of action."
attacking your ancestors doesn't sound very logical to me.
you wouldn't understand. you can't. you don't know what it's like living with the responsibility. millions of people are dead because of me.
i'm sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe.
"i could have destroyed it. years ago, i swore to my captain on his deathbed i'd save those seven million lives. you were the man i made that promise to. i devoted my life to that mission. we knew the co-ordinates of the launch platform, the exact minute the weapon was going to be deployed. but our plan didn't work. i had one last chance. use enterprise itself, set a collision course with the probe. but i hesitated, my emotions took over. i couldn't give an order that would kill my crew. by the time i realised my mistake it was too late, the probe was gone. i won't let my emotions get in the way again. i will not let earth be destroyed."
"i could keep you locked up in here, but that wouldn't do either of us any good. all that matters is what we're going to do next. whether you agree with it or not, i'm taking my ship into that corridor. and i'll stand a much better chance of completing this mission, our mission, if we work together."
come in.
am i disturbing you?
not at all. please. tea?
chamomile?
of course.
we had trouble with your modifications. we were only able to reduce our particle wake by eighty six percent. the corridor could destabilise again.
if you place an isomagnetic collector here it should absorb any residual particles.
i'm not familiar with that type of device.
something we picked up from the ikaarans.
i should be able to find the schematics. are you feeling better?
what do you mean?
your trellium addiction. have the symptoms diminished?
"to a degree, but i haven't fully recovered."
"you'll never fully recover. the emotions you've accessed will be with you the rest of your life. ah, here we are. don't forget your tea. you're going to have to learn to embrace them, live with them as i have. there's someone on your ship who can help."
phlox has already given me a neural suppressant.
"i don't mean phlox. trip can be an outlet for these feelings if you'll trust him. the emotions he stirred in me were powerful and frightening. i tried to push him away. if enterprise hadn't been stranded in the past it's possible i never would have married trip, but i can't imagine what my life would have been like without him."
what do you suggest i do?
"there's a human expression, follow your heart."
what if my heart doesn't know what it wants?
"it will, in time. it will."
weapons are standing by.
take us in. are the signatures being reflected?
i'm reading multiple images.
how long until we reach the corridor.
six minutes.
they've detected us. three ships are on an intercept course.
return fire.
the nebula's interfering with our targeting scanners. we'll have to wait until they get closer.
they don't seem to be having the same problem.
aft plating's at forty two percent.
malcolm!
"just a few more seconds, sir. we have a lock."
archer to lorian. now!
the lead ship's been disabled. the other two are falling back.
"well done, captain."
they must have been surprised when your reflection turned and attacked.
"sir, we're losing speed."
tucker to the bridge.
go ahead.
the last torpedo took out the primary drive coil.
i've got to shut down the port engine.
"understood. lorian, it looks like we're not going to be able to"
keep up with you.
the aliens are regrouping. four ships.
"bring us a hundred metres off archer's bow. power the tractor emitters. captain, tell your crew to brace themselves."
we're increasing speed. they've engaged a tractor beam.
thanks for the lift. we'll see you on the other side.
"sir, the kovaalans will be in weapons range in less than twenty seconds."
"the aliens are closing. twelve thousand metres, ten thousand."
target their weapons.
hull plating's holding.
what about archer?
their aft plating's almost gone.
see if we can get the alien's attention. torpedoes. full spread.
we've lost aft plating.
forty five seconds to the corridor.
weapons are down.
they're targeting archer's reactor.
"disengage the tractor beam. new course, one eight zero mark zero."
we'll keep them off your back. your momentum will carry you into the corridor.
we'll follow as soon as we can. tell my parents that i'll see them soon.
twelve seconds to the corridor.
direct hit. the pylons are starting to buckle.
reserve power to hull plating.
hull integrity's failing.
forward launchers are gone.
divert everything to the phase cannons. continue firing.
no sign of pursuit.
where are we?
we've travelled eleven point six light years.
are we still in the right century?
the stars are where they're supposed to be.
what about lorian?
"no sign of him yet, sir."
one ship against four.
it's unlikely they survived.
"lorian has years of command experience. something tells me we shouldn't write him off yet. i suppose there's another possibility. since we weren't thrown into the past, maybe history somehow corrected itself."
"are you suggesting that the other enterprise never existed? if you're right, then why would we remember them?"
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
"could you come out here, sir?"
a ship's dropping out of warp.
it's degra. he's hailing us.
put him up.
"captain, you're early."
we've been successful. the xindi weapon is days away from completion.
the timelines don't support that assessment.
what have you seen?
the number of lines with favourable outcomes has diminished. there is now an increased chance the earth ship will prevent the weapon from being launched.
not necessarily. timelines are sensitive. they're prone to temporary fluctuations.
this is no fluctuation. this is a trajectory away from our desired outcome.
see that you take definitive actions to correct this. the weapon must be launched. earth must be destroyed.
i'm not detecting any trellium in your system. how are you feeling?
the emotions are still difficult to control.
meditation isn't helping?
"somewhat, but i'm still experiencing frequent"
you okay?
just a mild headache.
i thought vulcans didn't get headaches.
i'm needed in the command centre.
you notice anything strange about the way she's been acting?
there isn't anyone on the ship who hasn't been affected by recent events. what can i do for you?
i think i pulled a muscle.
pain's pretty bad.
have a seat.
we've been running double shifts in engineering. captain's in hell of a rush to get to this damned council.
he believes he can get the xindi to reconsider their attack on earth. we owe him a little faith.
"oh, i have faith in the captain, but not in the people he's trying to convince."
degra seems to be a reasonable man.
reasonable? i don't think many people back in my home town would go along with that.
thanks doc.
the spheres are controlled by a network of artificial intelligence. this section houses the redundant memory core. it should contain a significant amount of information.
we're hoping that'll include data on the sphere builders.
that could help us with the council.
our present course will take us close to another sphere.
i'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. they'll join up with us later.
how do you plan to get inside it?
we're pretty sure we've found a way in. you've mentioned the xindi have been studying the spheres for decades.
we're interested in any information you have on the construction of their outer shells.
i'll send over whatever's in my database.
sir.
i've been reviewing service transcripts. you've got over a thousand hours in an ev suit.
i did six months on the janus loop.
are you interested in running this mission with us?
"i'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir."
get prepped. the janus. that includes ev combat training.
"yes, sir. are we expecting a fire fight?"
don't know what to expect.
"when it's finished compiling, send it to enterprise."
it's not too late.
dismissed. dismissed!
not everyone has forgotten what we have done for your people.
what do you want?
you've turned away from us. come back.
i can't.
i hear it in your voice. you have betrayed everything you believe in and now you're in turmoil.
i don't regret what i'm doing.
at one time or another you must have asked yourself why we've protected the xindi for so long.
many of us have wondered that.
"it's because we can see a future where the xindi are no longer fragmented, no longer struggling for existence. you are destined to become a great civilisation, and now it's all in jeopardy because of you."
no.
"you created a device that will prevent a devastating attack. your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come, and instead you have chosen the role of betrayer."
how i'm remembered isn't for you to decide.
what have we done to lose your faith?
you never deserved my faith.
"the sphere builders have lied to the xindi. they've manipulated us for decades. i see that. perhaps the arboreals will, and the others."
we have the evidence to back it up.
"the evidence may not be enough. the sphere builders saved the xindi from extinction. when our home world was destroyed they began appearing to the survivors. they'd guide them to habitable planets, show them the location of valuable resources. they're practically worshipped. we call them the guardians."
it's no wonder you had a hard time accepting this.
i was brought up to revere them. i taught my own children to give thanks to them at the end of each day. that is what we're facing.
i've stood before a klingon tribunal. i can handle a tough room.
"the klingons weren't determined to destroy your world. but the evidence is strong, perhaps it will be enough. we'll face the council together. i may take my seat at the council table, but i'll be at your side no matter what happens."
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we've picked up several xindi vessels. they're closing on our position.
"humanoids, arboreals and aquatics. they're with us. when we reach the council's location we'll need their protection."
certain members have more influence than others.
anything you can tell me about them. i need to know what i'm up against.
"you know jannar, the arboreal. he's fair-minded, a scientist, he'll listen to the facts. i count him as a friend. unfortunately the other members are somewhat more complicated. the aquatics for instance. kiaphet amman'sor is a member of the ibix dynasty, a very wealthy, very powerful family. her opinions carry considerable weight when she arrives at them. there's a saying. it's easier to count the stars in the sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision. as for the insectoids, well, their names grow longer the older they get, so they become a little difficult to pronounce. in many ways insectoids are the opposite of the aquatics."
they're quick to take sides. we've run into them.
"which brings us to the reptilians, and commander dolim. there's a story about him. i don't know if it's true, i'd like to believe it isn't. his daughter gave birth to a son. he had a deformity in his right arm, not life-threatening but enough to preclude his ever joining the military. commander dolim had his own grandson poisoned."
from what i've seen that's not hard to believe.
"as i said, it may be just a story, but as a father it's always in the back of my mind whenever i have dealings with him."
enter. what is it?
we've located debris. it's from the ship we sent to find degra.
where?
"seven light years from here, within the cloaking barrier of a sphere."
i want to know how it was destroyed. begin an analysis.
it's underway. preliminary findings suggest they were attacked.
yes.
"commander, there are six vessels approaching. one is the earth ship."
contact the lead ship.
this is degra.
degra. i was just thinking of you. how many
prisoners have you taken?
we're escorting enterprise to the council.
for what purpose?
power down your weapons
and withdraw.
what makes you think i would let you bring an enemy ship into a security zone?
power down your weapons now.
i don't take orders from you.
they've launched a torpedo.
what!
three hundred metres off the port bow.
you would fire on a xindi vessel?
we're prepared to destroy your vessel if necessary.
they're locking weapons.
prepare to return fire!
you're outnumbered and outgunned. there's no need for this. i assure
you the earth ship poses no danger.
i'll see you in the council chamber.
i look forward to it.
"five seconds, three, two."
rcs inverter.
shut it down.
damage?
nothing we need to worry about sir.
adjust heading oh two six mark three.
i'd breathe a whole lot easier if you had a couple of macos watching your back.
don't worry. keep my chair warm.
good luck.
how's your insectoid these days?
it depends on which dialect. there are sixty seven.
is that all?
aquatics respect boldness and confidence. they view hushed tones with suspicion.
i'll make sure i project.
not too loudly. the insectoids interpret raised voices as a sign of hostility.
when aquatics use the past tense they switch to sonar.
you should see it in a moment.
we're still two kilometres up.
the only way in is through the air. these cloud layers are present throughout the year. it's perfectly concealed.
avians.
it's beautiful.
the sixth xindi race. this was built centuries before they became extinct. according to our archaeologists it's over four thousand years old.
kind of feels like being called to the principal's office.
i was never called to the principal's office.
i was once.
move aside.
what for?
when we're done here.
"you've brought humans into this chamber, degra. explain yourself, if you expect them to leave here alive."
i'm fully prepared to explain my actions. there's no cause for threats.
agreed. we've reviewed the data you sent. we're prepared to listen to what you have to say.
"you killed seven million of my people. i want to be honest with you, i don't much like standing here."
we did what we felt was necessary.
i know. you've been told that at some time in the future my world is going to destroy yours. that's a lie.
"he said, the guardians have never lied to us."
"the guardians built the spheres. they're reconfiguring the expanse, preparing it for colonisation."
"you reek of desperation. you would say anything to save your world, as evidenced by this manufactured data."
it's the truth. the data is accurate. anyone with an objective eye will come to the same conclusion.
you have no idea what the truth is. your sympathy for these humans has corrupted your judgment.
my judgment is perfectly sound.
were you using sound judgment when you attacked my ship?
you were trying to prevent us from reaching this council.
i was protecting this council!
this is not relevant. we're here to discuss the human's claims.
agreed. we need to return to the subject at hand.
"i am trying to save my world, but it's not just earth that's in danger. if you wipe out mankind you'll be destroying yourself."
i refuse to listen to any more of this.
earth is going to lead a battle that defeats the sphere builders. they know this. that's why they manipulated you into attacking us.
enough! i demand the immediate seizure of the earth ship.
any vessel that attacks enterprise will be fired upon.
you will not defy this council.
we haven't arrived at a decision yet.
and we never will as long as we listen to this human's lies. if this council will not defend it's people then it has no reason to exist.
wait.
you don't want to know.
hold this position. the exhaust vent.
where?
"set a course, oh three one mark four."
i don't see an exhaust vent.
you sure about this?
half thrusters.
t'pol!
hold your course.
i'm telling you!
hold your course.
some kind of hologram?
exactly.
you could have warned us ahead of time.
proceed along this conduit.
aye.
sixty degrees starboard. eighty degrees z axis. we should prepare for eva.
let's break out the suits.
we've had difficult sessions before. in the days following the founding of this council
this is different. the council is on the verge of tearing itself apart.
you underestimate us.
we were all in the same room. you saw what happened.
we knew it wasn't going to be easy.
we are never going to convince the reptilians or the insectoids.
then we'll focus on the aquatics.
"the aquatics weigh every argument in excruciating detail. for a long time, they were against building the weapon."
what changed their minds?
the guardians addressed the council. they presented what they claimed was a visual record taken from the future.
it showed mankind destroying our new homeworld.
that convinced the aquatics.
it was powerful evidence.
the avians. once they darkened the skies of xindus with their numbers. we formed the council to prevent other xindis from sharing their fate.
your council just might have the opposite effect.
perhaps not. there might be a way to convince them. i'll require the services of your ship's doctor.
the council is preparing to betray it's own people.
archer has achieved nothing.
"he has succeeded in raising doubts about us. the arboreals, humanoids and aquatics are considering what he had to say. he should never have been allowed before the council."
i couldn't prevent it.
and now they may decide against launching the weapon.
the weapon will be deployed.
"for that to happen, three of the xindi species must agree."
if we can prove to them that your people didn't build the spheres.
"prove to them, or you?"
my lieutenant simply wants to know that there's a way to persuade the council.
persuasion is no longer a viable option. you must act with the insectoids. secure the weapon.
the weapon's well guarded. the casualties on both sides would be heavy. we'd be risking civil war.
"a temporary schism cannot be avoided, but eventually reptilians will preside over a stronger unified xindi empire. we will guarantee reptilian dominance if humankind is eradicated."
understood.
if you ever question the guardians again your skin will adorn the bow of this ship.
"yes, this will be very helpful."
i'll have it sent over immediately. i've never heard of this procedure.
it was developed by the aquatics. they have an innate distrust of the spoken word. they respond more strongly to visual stimuli.
you need me for something?
the transport pod that carried this alien?
it's in the cargo bay.
there are some modifications that need to be made to it.
the captain would like you to assist me with the work.
lucky me.
your captain thinks there's no one better to make these modifications.
i agree.
do me a favour. don't try to get on my good side.
i understand you and i will always be enemies.
you got that right.
"i can't change what happened to your sister or any of the seven million but i'm risking my life, i'm risking the lives of my family, i've killed members of my own species, all because i'm trying to save both our worlds."
this way.
picking up a very powerful energy signature.
we're approaching the memory core.
it's fifteen metres ahead.
it's practically gift-wrapped.
i'm detecting some kind of movement.
can you pin-point it?
there's too much interference. i don't know where it is
but it's close.
i suggest we work fast.
come in.
"we've completed the work. mister tucker was extremely co-operative. i know it isn't easy for him, working with me."
"degra, when i was on the future enterprise four hundred years from now, there were xindi aboard. humans and xindi were serving together in the federation. that's a future worth fighting for."
passing notes.
sir?
i got sent to the principal's office for passing a note in class. it was to katy bentley. i was inviting her to a party a friend of mine was throwing.
what'd she say?
"funny thing. she'd already turned me down, but after i got in trouble."
some women can't resist the bad boys.
after much deliberation we've agreed to listen to this new evidence you wish to present.
proceed.
"the sphere builders, the beings you call the guardians, are the same species."
have you manufactured more data to support this claim?
a few weeks ago we came across an alien. he was adrift in what we believe was a transdimensional disturbance. the alien was inside a pod which was constructed of the same combination of alloys that make up the outer shell of the spheres. he was a sphere builder.
you've already presented this information.
not all of it. energise.
your data states that this alien disintegrated when it came into contact with our universe.
he did.
what you're seeing is a biometric hologram. it's the same technology used to train our physicians. it was constructed from medical data collected by enterprise's medical doctor.
how do we know the data used to create this phantom wasn't falsified.
humans don't have the technology to produce a fabrication of this detail.
"tell me, is this one of the guardians?"
the physical resemblance is hard to deny.
it is a guardian.  we are not deceived by this illusion. restore the dignity of our council. expel the humans from this chamber.
we are open to hearing more.
so are we.
[translating aquatic) we agree.
"please, continue."
reed to shuttlepod one. anything?
no sir.
"whatever it was, it's stopped moving. got something! it's heading in your direction."
moving fast.
i don't see anything.
where is it?
give me a position.
it's coming down from the upper
left quadrant.
are you sure?
damn sure.
"it's seventy metres away. fifty metres, thirty, fifteen!"
i see it.
hawkins!
go! go!
five more headed this way. move!
i still can't pin down the problem with the converter. i think it's an energy drain somewhere. we're far from one hundred percent.
there's been a development.
dismissed.
we have the three votes we need.
"the reptilians have agreed to postpone the launch of the weapon. they'll need more convincing before they solidify their position, but this is a significant step. that future you spoke of. perhaps this is where it begins."
"question. those portable power cells you left us. we're having a little trouble getting them in synch. think you can stick around for a few minutes, give us a hand?"
of course.
we'll be in my ready room.
"listen, about all those things i've been saying. i just want to tell you i know you went out on a limb."
if i had suffered your loss i'd feel the same way. shall we get to work?
it's over here.
come in. i wasn't expecting you.
there are some things we need to discuss.  i've never liked this place.
i've always found it to be peaceful.
it's too exposed. reptilians prefer to be near the ground. and then there's the stench.
stench?
of failure. of a race that failed to survive.
i was surprised by your decision to postpone the launch.
it seemed like the right thing to do.
i hope the other members will come to the same conclusion.
they'll fall into line. i have always believed that all xindi long for unification. it's in our blood.
i agree.
the earth ship.
i'm assisting them with their engine repairs.
they've found quite an ally in you. a pity you haven't extended the same friendship to your fellow xindi.
what do you mean?
we recovered a sensor encoder from our missing scout ship. it was in the cloaking barrier of a sphere. we were able to extract the final scans it took before they were destroyed by you.
i don't know what you're talking about.
the evidence is irrefutable. we have an image of your ship firing. don't try to deny what you did.
they left me no choice.
and you've left me no choice.
"the crew of that ship are the last xindi you'll ever betray. when the humans have been eliminated, when the council has been replaced by reptilian rule, i am going to find your wife and children and do the same to them. your traitorous bloodline will end at the tip of my blade."
trouble sleeping?
it's weird. with things finally looking up you'd think i'd finally be able to get some shut-eye. there's a section of the mess hall up and running. in the mood for a snack?
certainly.
"i guess you heard, the captain pulled it off. the xindi postponed the weapon launch."
you make that sound like bad news.
"ever since the attack on earth, all i've thought about is getting back at whoever was responsible."
now we are making peace with them.
"i've gotten used to the anger. it's going to be like, i don't know, losing an old friend."
you have other friends.
is it my imagination or are you losing weight?
"ah, i was hoping someone might notice."
"yeah, i'm not the only one. hoshi commented on it last week."
"well, i'm pleased to see that my efforts are yielding results."
what's your secret?
a denaxian tape-worm.
it attaches itself to the lower intestinal tract and absorbs nutrients.
"hold on, hold on. you have a worm inside you?"
it's perfectly harmless. i hardly notice it at all.
how are you going to get it out?
i insert a standard v probe into my
"no, no, no, no, no. never mind."
"well, it's a simple procedure."
"i'm sure it is, doc. i just don't want to lose my appetite."
"degra's dead. he was found in his quarters about an hour ago. he'd been murdered, stabbed."
who did this?
"the reptilians have called an emergency meeting of the council. i believe their recent turnabout was nothing more than a ruse to keep us off guard. they're planning something, i'm certain of it. your ship's in danger."
keep me appraised.
archer to the bridge.
bridge.
go to tactical alert.
it was that last run through the cloaking barrier. the coil assembly's been damaged.
reduce speed. hold at half impulse.
lieutenant?
"i'm all right. i'm fine. maybe that's the problem. maybe we're getting a bit too comfortable with losing people. twenty three men and women. on any given mission the limits of acceptable casualties is twenty percent. so says traditional military doctrine. well, we've crossed that margin."
there's a vulcan axiom. the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. corporal hawkins understood that.
that doesn't make his death any more acceptable.
"no, but it makes it honourable."
you admit killing him.
with pride. he was a traitor.
he was a member of this council.
degra destroyed a reptilian ship. twenty two crewmen died. i only regret not doing it sooner.
you're going to regret a lot more than that.
why did you call this meeting?
you have a decision to make. we've taken control of the weapon. we're going to launch it.
and you accuse degra of being a traitor!
we are acting on behalf of all xindi.
"either you stand with us, or you stand against us."
"that's not a choice, it's an ultimatum."
call it what you will.
we won't submit to intimidation.
neither will we.
none of us will.
then we withdraw from this council.
think about what you are doing. this alliance has lasted for decades.
it's lasted too long. you've become complacent.
the weapon cannot be launched without three of the codes. you only have two.
do you really believe we haven't considered that?
"i can give you three point four with a little coaxing, but some of the relays are still fried. we're in no shape for combat."
that hasn't stopped us in the past.
you sure they're coming after us?
count on it.
i can't believe i actually feel bad about degra. twenty four hours ago i would have been celebrating.
a lot can happen in a day.
bridge to captain archer.
archer.
five insectoid ships are descending toward the surface.
report.
the weapon's been launched from beneath the surface. the insectoid ships are in formation around it.
pursuit course.
we're being hailed.
the reptilians and insectoids have seized control of the weapon.
we're tracking it.
i've ordered all available ships to intercept.
we're right behind you.
i hope there's something in there you can use.
most definitely.
there's a large group of ships leaving the system. one of them is enterprise. i'm detecting weapons fire.
stay with it. keep firing.
it's the shuttlepod.
"tell them to stay put, and we'll come back for them when we can."
open a channel to degra's ship. we're moving in on the weapon.
concentrate your fire on the primary generators.
six metres below the aft thrusters.
forget the others. target enterprise.
get the female.
hoshi!
they're disabled.
the female?
generators at maximum power.
take us into the vortex.
"we've lost them, sir."
why am i here? what do you want?
"we were impressed with your linguistic abilities. aquatic is difficult to master. i've heard it spoken my entire life but still, it doesn't come easily to me."
maybe you should have applied yourself more.
we have some encoded data we need translated.
i'm not a cryptologist.
i have confidence in your abilities.
"that's very flattering, but you'll have to manage on your own."
"if you refuse, we'll have no further use for you. get her ready for the procedure."
she's surprisingly strong-willed for a primate.
we'll see how defiant she is after our surgeons have finished with her. we'll have the launch codes soon enough.
we need to access the data from this. meet me in the command centre in half an hour. i'll assist you.
what have we missed?
the teptilians took the weapon.
have they launched it?
"we don't know. the captain's on his way to the surface, he wants to figure out our next move. and they took hoshi. she's gone."
who?
"reptilians, insectoids, we don't know. they transported her off the bridge."
where's corporal hawkins?
"the sphere had an automated defence mechanism. he was killed. i'm sorry, major."
i'm sure you did everything you could. i'd appreciate a full report.
where are they?
we're trying to determine their location. it's difficult to track them inside a vortex.
for all you know they could be heading to earth.
they can't deploy the weapon. not yet.
each of the five species has a set of commands to initiate the arming sequence. three of them are needed to activate the weapon.
they only have two. we obviously don't intent to give them ours.
what about the aquatics?
"their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seem determined not to take sides."
it's more likely the reptilians and insectoids will attempt to bypass the command codes themselves.
and that will take time.
they've abducted my communications officer. up until now i didn't know why.
you believe they'll use her to decrypt the arming sequence?
she'll never co-operate.
she may not have a choice.
this could be a command subroutine.
and it could be a letter to santa claus. i wouldn't mind having hoshi here right now.
we'll have to make do without her.
i just hope she's okay.
"we're here to analyse this data, not speculate on ensign sato's fate."
you okay?
"i'm fond of hoshi as well, but we can't allow her situation to become a distraction."
any luck?
"there's a great deal of data to analyse, but we've made some progress. we know the spheres are connected by a subspace energy grid, but four of them appear to be integral to that connection."
closest one's here. we've designated it sphere forty one.
integral how?
"i believe they act as control spheres, allowing the network to operate in concert."
"if we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid?"
maybe. it also might have no effect. we just don't have enough information yet.
keep at it.
"aye, sir."
"co-operate and this won't be necessary. wait. after the injection, the parasites will invade your neocortex. once they begin reconfiguring your synaptic pathways you'll me much more compliant. before your primate brain is too badly damaged to understand, i want to thank you for helping us destroy your world."
"if they'd stayed in the vortex, we wouldn't have found them."
they're less than four light years from here.
why have they stopped? they could have been half way to earth by now.
they're attempting to arm the weapon. the propulsion system has to be offline to do it.
how quickly can we get there?
that wouldn't be wise. they've been joined by at least a dozen vessels.
you have nearly as many ships.
you may have noticed that reptilians and insectoids are more belligerent than we are. their ships are armed accordingly.
we're no match for them.
"we've been out-gunned before, sir. we did not come all this way to give up without a fight."
would the aquatics be a match for them?
"their ships are extremely powerful, but they've seen your evidence. they're not convinced."
that was before the reptilians murdered degra and stole the weapon. we're looking at civil war. can they afford to sit back and do nothing? let me talk to them.
now isn't the time to dissolve the council.
so we should leave our fate in the hands of the reptilians and the insectoids?
i disagree. the evidence the humans provided can't be ignored.
i didn't quite catch that last part.
"they have agreed to meet with us, but don't expect much, captain."
how long do they plan to keep us waiting.
you have to deal with the aquatics on their terms.
they're extremely deliberate in everything they do.
you all right?
my species doesn't like the water.
they're here.
thank you for seeing me. i'm afraid my communications officer was abducted by the reptilians.
"that is regrettable, but her presence is no longer necessary. we've had time to study your language."
then i'll get to the point. we need your help.
we made our position clear. the evidence is intriguing but far from conclusive.
we require more time to evaluate it.
and if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime?
the reptilians and the insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on their own.
that may not be true.
"i believe they took my officer to help them decipher a third launch code. after all your deliberations, you may find a decision's been made without you."
this changes nothing.
just because the reptilians choose to act rashly does not mean we will do the same.
so you'd rather sit back and do nothing
captain.
while they condemn all five of your species to extinction.
you may return to your ship. you'll be informed of our decision.
"one last question. have these guardians told you where you'll establish your new home world? the ones humans are destined to destroy? is it here, in the expanse? in case you haven't noticed, the spheres are turning it into a transdimensional wasteland. none of you will be able to survive."
you say the guardians have helped you. have they ever tried to disable the spheres? because we've found a way.
help me save my people and i can help you save yours.
report.
she's penetrated the first layer of encryption. nothing further.
you understand what we want you to do?
i'm to bypass the aquatic encryption protocols.
and you realise we need this done quickly.
i'm not familiar with these cyphers. i'm trying.
are you?
she's more resistant than i imagined. prepare her for another procedure.
you would sacrifice yourself to stop us. don't worry. you won't have to live with your guilt for long.
commander. i can't access the arming matrix. she's added a layer of encryption!
you were ordered to watch her.
a deflector pulse might disrupt the subspace links.
it wouldn't generate enough power.
we could tie the impulse reactors directly into the array.
"sure, if you want to rupture every eps conduit on the ship."
the captain told the aquatics we could disable these spheres.
and i'm trying not to make a liar out of him.
really.
what do you mean by that?
you've dismissed all of my proposals.
"when you come up with one that doesn't involve blowing ourselves up, i'll be a little more enthusiastic."
or you might surprise me with an idea of your own.
"maybe you haven't had time to meditate, i don't know, but whatever's going on with you lately, i've had about enough. i'll work on this in engineering. call me if you have any more brilliant ideas."
"commander, trip! everything that's happened recently has caused me to become slightly emotional."
i've noticed.
i apologise.
forget about it.
"i wish i could. it may take some time before i regain my control. it will be difficult to do, especially on my own."
this hasn't been easy for any of us.
"you know how much i appreciate what you did for me. when this is all over, if you want to talk, i'm all ears. why don't we take another crack at this."
the council has disbanded. the weapon is under our control.
excellent. deploy it immediately.
as soon as we decrypt the third launch code. we've encountered some difficulties.
"the longer you delay, the more likely the time lines will shift against you."
then perhaps you can provide more of your valuable assistance. help us get the code.
that's not possible.
"it should be a simple matter to peer into the past, extract the necessary data."
we only detect large fluctuations in the timescape. the fine details are obscured.
"really? you've seen more than enough detail to learn how to meddle in our affairs, to turn the xindi species against each other."
everything we've done has been to protect the xindi.
"then finish what you've started, if it's within your power."
the time lines are in constant flux. many of them favour the primates and the arboreals. some even favour the humans. unless that's the outcome you desire i suggest you find a way to launch the weapon.
this appears to be some kind of interspatial manifold on the surface of sphere forty one.
what they use to connect the spheres.
that's what we're thinking. t'pol's figured out a way to target it with a deflector pulse.
well done.
we haven't exactly got all the details worked out yet.
then you'd better keep at it. if the aquatics decide to help us they might want to hear those details.
captain. i hope you didn't make them any promises.
we'll keep working.
please do.
any word?
it's only been three hours. the council once needed to resolve a simple logistical matter. it took the aquatics six days to agree to attend the meeting.
i'm surprised you were ever able to get anything done.
on the contrary. their prudence was usually the only thing that kept the council from dissolving into chaos. that's why degra had them build the weapon. he didn't want the reptilians and insectoids to have too much control.
"that's actually something i wanted to discuss with you. if we're successful, and we destroy the weapon"
"what's to prevent us from building another one? i knew degra for many years. he could be difficult, uncompromising. we argued often. for instance, when he insisted that we meet with you. but when degra spoke only a fool would ignore him. he believed there was a future between your people and ours. when this is over, i intend to see if he was right."
"captain archer, please report to the bridge."
report.
"six vessels approaching, sir. all aquatic."
that was remarkably fast.
open a channel to the lead ship.
we've considered your proposal.
and?
we will help you intercept the weapon.
thank you.
we expect you to honour our agreement.
you will attempt to disable the spheres.
how do these developments affect the time line?
"it's difficult to say. they continue to fluctuate. however, most now indicate the humans will prevail."
then the time has come for us to intervene.
is there another problem?
quite the opposite.
the third launch code.
we have complete access.
it appears the primate was useful after all. take her back to her cell. initiate the pre-arming protocols. inform me when the weapon is ready for launch.
have you assembled your boarding party?
ready to deploy on your command.
i wish i was leading it myself.
"your place is on the bridge, sir."
"no offence, major. it's just that ensign sato is a friend. here's my report on corporal hawkins."
thank you. would you like to go over my rescue plan?
"first, i'd like to know if we have a problem."
sir?
if you blame me for the corporal's death.
"permission to speak freely? i've never liked putting my people under someone else's command. you're senior tactical officer, but they're my team. i can't help but think that if i'd been there things might have turned out differently."
i did everything i could. things happened very fast.
i understand.
"i'm not finished. hawkins may well have been a maco, but he was my responsibility out there."
"when we first came aboard enterprise, we definitely felt like outsiders."
"if i contributed to that, i apologise."
"my point is, none of us feel that way anymore. we're all part of the same crew, no matter which uniform we wear. don't worry about ensign sato. we'll bring her home."
i'd almost forgotten what chef can do with a steak. i hope the crew forgives me for not patching up the galley sooner.
"i've heard no complaints, except from chef of course."
"when this is all over, i plan on having a little chat with the starfleet quartermaster about what they put in those ration packs."
"when this is all over, i won't be complaining about the food. i'll just be happy to get back to our original mission."
"hope you plan on swinging by earth first. i told the engineering team i'd buy them a few rounds at the 602 club. you're both invited, of course."
i wouldn't miss it.
what about you?
you may buy me a drink if you wish.
"i meant, what are your plans for the future? it's been a long time since you've been to vulcan."
the high command would be lucky to get you back.
"there are some colleagues i'd enjoy seeing again, but i've considered formalising my service with starfleet."
"i may be able to pull some strings, get you out of basic training."
can you imagine the look of soval's face when he sees her in a starfleet uniform? please let me be there.
i said i was considering it.
bridge to the captain.
go ahead.
we're approaching the co-ordinates.
tactical alert. i'm on my way.
activate the reactor.
"yes, lieutenant."
"commander dolim,"
the final arming sequence has begun.
excellent. inform me when you are ready. i'll be in my thermal chamber.
what is it?
a vortex is opening.
where?
"bearing two seven nine, range four thousand kilometres. were you expecting reinforcements?"
no.
arboreals.
send a patrol to intercept them.
"more vortexes are opening. fourteen, eighteen ships. aquatics. six ships approaching the weapon."
target them. have commander kolo's squadron maintain position.
"they're moving to intercept, but they're keeping a substantial force around the weapon."
feel like taking them on?
"give me the word, sir."
this is captain archer. cut us loose.
sir. the humans.
"steady, travis."
they're breaking off.
have all ships concentrate their fire on the weapon.
we're in range.
fire.
they're targeting the primary generators.
continue the arming sequence.
minor damage to the starboard nacelle. we're still in the fight.
bring us around for another pass.
target the earth vessel.
"we can't, sir. the aquatics are protecting them."
"captain, i've located ensign sato. she's on board one of the reptilian vessels."
can you get a transporter lock?
she's somewhere on the first three decks. i can't pinpoint her exact location.
send major hayes and his team.
"aye, sir."
we've lost eight vessels. we've only disabled two of theirs. we're no match for the aquatics.
lieutenant.
we must deploy the weapon now.
we need another five minutes.
in another five minutes it will be destroyed
and you along with it.
"ensign. ensign! hayes to enterprise. enterprise, respond. we should get back to the beam-in point."
the reptilians are under attack.
"if we don't act, the weapon will be destroyed."
the timelines now indicate that is the likely outcome.
proceed.
"captain, there's a massive anomaly forming near the weapon. two more."
"keep us clear of them, travis."
we'll have to pull back.
"do what you can, but keep us in firing range."
"aye, sir."
captain archer.
go ahead.
the anomalies are creating a barrier between us and the weapon.
we can't get through.
hayes to enterprise.
go ahead.
we've got sato.
archer to tucker. lock onto major hayes.
"i wish i could, sir. the last anomaly knocked the transporter offline. tell them to stand by."
archer to hayes. we've got a malfunction. can you hold your position?
affirmative.
the intruders are trapped on level seven.
and the anomalies?
they've disabled three of the aquatic ships.
the guardians will not let us fail.
tucker to hayes.
go ahead.
"i'm ready to get you out, but i can only transport two"
at a time. i'm going to have to reset the buffer.
take her. lock on kelly and sato.
ready for two more.
you two are next.
i could use a change of scenery.
"stand by, major."
commander dolim.
what's your status?
we've completed the arming sequence.
captain. the power readings from the weapon are increasing.
they're preparing to launch.
"get us close, travis."
what about the anomalies?
"i said, take us in."
"aye, sir."
"ready to launch on your order, commander."
open a vortex. set a course for earth.
they're gone.
doctor?
i told him i was ready for duty.
i'm afraid he's a bit of a mother hen.
how's ensign sato?
her biosigns are stable.
thank you for bringing her home.
all in a days work. use mckenzie.
what?
she knows the team. rely on her.
no more of that talk. that's an order.
"cardio-stimulator. step away, please."
increase by point two joules.
how long before it reaches earth?
ten hours.
could an aquatic ship reach it in time?
doubtful. they have powerful weapons but their speed is limited.
degra's ship is considerably faster.
what are we waiting for?
the ship isn't well-armed. it would be useless against the weapon.
"we might be able to get a team on board, disable it from the inside."
the reptilians will have soldiers stationed aboard the weapon.
we'll deal with them when we get there.
"captain, the aquatics joined us only because you promised to neutralise the spheres. they expect you to fulfil that promise."
"the future of our people is at stake, as well."
are you ready?
i believe so. we have a plan to disable sphere forty one.
"if we're right, it should disrupt the entire network."
"then as soon as we undock, set a course for sphere forty one."
"at ease. i've just come from sickbay, where the doctor assures me that sergeant kemper and ensign sato will make full recoveries. unfortunately, major hayes' injuries were more severe. he didn't survive. i'm sorry. we've got less than ten hours before this weapon reaches earth. the captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it. i don't imagine the reptilians will make this easy for us, but that's why you're here. that's why major hayes picked each one of you for this mission. because he knew you'd get the job done. i need three volunteers.  woods, ramira, forbes. assemble your gear. meet me at the starboard airlock in ten minutes."
how is she?
stable. the xindi parasites were no match for my osmotic eel.
i need to talk to her.
she's undergone a severe neural trauma.
she's been inside the weapon. i have to know what she saw.
it should be safe to revive her in two hours. no less.
all right. have her taken aboard degra's ship right away.
she's in no condition to be moved!
"i don't have any choice, doctor."
you could kill her.
i want her on that ship in twenty minutes.
she'll need another cortical treatment. at least let me come with you.
there's a medical bay aboard degra's ship. show lieutenant reed how to do it.
he's not a doctor.
"phlox, you're needed here."
the insectoids.
the anomalies worked to our advantage.
we were fortunate.
it was more than good fortune. the human claims the guardians control the spheres.
he also started a civil war between our species.
the human didn't kill degra. you did.
degra was a traitor.
i'm no longer certain of that.
then it's a good thing we already have your launch codes.
lock weapons on their ship.
sir?
i won't risk any more interference. fire.
malcolm. hang on. bring me back a piece of that weapon. a souvenir.
"with pleasure. all set, sir."
"when we're finished, we'll meet you at the rendezvous coordinates."
"we'll be there. captain, good luck."
i expect you to keep him in line.
i'll do my best.
if they had made us the dominant species before the wars our homeworld would still exist.
and our avian brothers would still fill the skies.
"we should be grateful that the guardians have finally come to their senses. once earth is destroyed, the reptilians will take their rightful place at the head of a new xindi empire."
"they're nearly three hours ahead of us, but this vessel is faster. we're closing the gap."
it may be faster but it's not well-armed. how many ships are escorting the weapon?
i can't tell.
the only way we're going to be able to destroy this thing is from the inside. any luck?
all of degra's schematics are encrypted.
we're going to need hoshi to help us.
she's in no condition to come up here.
"i wish i had a choice, malcolm."
"sir, she's barely conscious."
can you transfer that to a padd? something portable?
the favourable timelines continue to diminish.
they should be increasing. the weapon has almost reached it's target.
but the earth ship is on course for our primary sphere. accelerate the transformation around that sphere. they mustn't be allowed to intervene.
report.
"we've realigned the main power grid. it should increase the deflector pulse threefold, maybe four, but it's going to fry just about every system on board."
be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours.
i don't think you heard what i just said. we try this and the ship's going to come apart at the seams.
"two hours, mister tucker."
the captain told the xindi we'd try to knock these things out. he didn't say anything about demolishing enterprise in the process.
has it occurred to you what's going to happen if captain archer fails? if earth is destroyed?
every day.
"good. then you've already come to the conclusion that without humanity there's no one to combat these sphere builders. their expanse will continue to grow, encompassing one system after another, including vulcan. your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy. two hours."
i think we've got a problem.
what is it?
sphere forty one.
are you certain these are the coordinates?
"yep. there shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger."
have you analysed it?
"could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter than we've ever seen them."
they're transforming the space around that sphere. not unlike the disturbance where we found that trans-dimensional being. they obviously expected us.
if we're going to disable the network we'll need to get within a kilometre of the surface.
"if the ship were to enter that disturbance, the entire crew would be dead within minutes. i could synthesise a neuraleptic compound that would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes. i'm afraid there's nothing i can do to prevent epidermal decay."
twelve minutes won't be enough.
"perhaps i can extend it, but not by much. i encourage you and mister tucker to encourage alternatives. there must be something you can do to abbreviate your plan."
any luck? ensign?
i'm not feeling very well. do you think you can get phlox to come down here?
"we're on degra's ship, hoshi. phlox isn't here."
i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be doing.
the schematics for the weapon. degra encrypted them before he was killed. you've been trying to decipher them.
i gave them the third code. they wouldn't have been able to arm the weapon if i hadn't given them the third code.
"you were drugged, hoshi. you had no choice."
i did. i should have fought harder.
"you need to finish what you're doing. you're almost there. we're going to board the weapon, try to overload the power systems, but we can't do that until we can read these schematics."
i tried to jump but i wasn't fast enough.
you need to finish this.
you've got the three codes so why don't you just kill me? didn't you say you're going to kill me?
you've got to pull yourself together just for a little while longer. you need to complete the decryption. everything hinges on it. do you understand?
i understand.
"when we exit the vortex, how close will we be?"
approximately two million kilometres from earth.
two million!
"if we had all five codes we could begin the firing sequence immediately, but with three we'll need additional time. we'd be vulnerable if we dropped into normal space any closer to the target."
do what ever it takes to fire the weapon as quickly as possible.
"you wanted to see me, sir?"
"i think i've found a way to boost the deflector pulse without tearing the ship apart, but it's going to mean transferring all impulse power to the array."
when?
as soon as we reach the sphere.
sir.
"sorry, travis. you're going to have to get us to the manifold on thrusters only."
"that's tying my hands, commander, especially with the ticking clock."
"you can do it. look over these schematics, familiarise yourself with the features of the sphere."
"we won't be able to transport directly onto the control platform, it's too heavily shielded. we'll have to beam in and out no deeper than this peripheral framework."
what if you need to board the weapon before your crewman completes her decryptions?
i'm taking her with me.
"sir, she's hardly in any shape"
"she's been there, malcolm. that's where she deciphered that third launch code."
she was drugged. there's no reason to believe that she'll remember anything.
she's coming with me. i want you and your team to beam in right before we do. secure the closest route to the platform.
i'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework. you'll be in charge of helping hoshi.
"and you, sir?"
"i've no plans of dying on that weapon, malcolm. i'm going to see what else she's come up with."
"this is a very important day, jonathan."
i don't have time for this.
"it'll only take a minute. you see the fellow in the blue jacket, near the left hand of the dais? that's you, a little more than seven years from now. you and the others are about to make history. do you remember i told you about a federation?"
what about it?
"i work with some people who are going to be pretty angry with me for telling you this, but you're going to be an integral part of forming that federation. you're down there, right now, with vulcans, andorians and tellarites, getting ready to sign the charter. the membership is going to grow. dozen, eventually hundreds of species. a united federation of planets."
i have a team preparing to board the weapon. i've got other things to think about right now.
let reed or one of the others go to the control platform.
what are you talking about?
"it's too great a risk. if you're killed, none of this will happen. at least, not the way it's supposed to happen."
then it'll happen some other way. who's to say whether it'll be better or worse?
it's essential you be a part of this.
where are we? what planet?
earth.
seems to me it's just as essential that earth be around for this too.
lieutenant reed can work with sato.  they are not crucial to the future of mankind. you are.
"my mission is to save earth, not your federation."
you can't ignore your place in history.
my place is on that control platform. now get me the hell back to degra's ship.
"and if it's not too much of an inconvenience, i'd appreciate it if you'd contact my first wife's third husband, groznik. tell him that he's welcome to keep the aldebaran drum set i loaned him. oh, they have a child named indaura, a sweet little girl, she must be eight or nine by now. well, i would like to leave her my botanical library. she always had a flair for plants. computer, pause recording. everything's ready here."
commander tucker has completed his modifications to the deflector. i apologise if i interrupted you.
"oh no, don't be silly. i was simply dictating a letter to my colleague, doctor lucas. he offered to make sure my affairs were in order in the event that, er, well, you know."
"i have always found it distracting to think of death, especially when entering a dangerous situation."
"hope for the best, prepare for the worst. i don't know about vulcans, but denobulans take great pleasure in bequeathing their belongings to far-flung relatives."
we're not dead yet.
bridge to t'pol.
go ahead.
we're approaching the co-ordinates.
"take us out of warp. hope for the best, doctor."
it's grown. it's a hundred thousand kilometres deeper than when we first detected it.
i've enhanced the neuraleptic compound as much as i can. i strongly advise we remain in the disturbance no longer than fifteen minutes.
"are you ready to release the compound? then proceed. stand by to charge the deflector. set a course, ensign."
what have you guys figured out?
"we've got to disable the reactor at a specific point during the inversion sequence, but we don't know the sequence. if it's not done in the right order, internal safeguards will kick in and it'll be impossible to create an overload."
"i've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. your friend degra didn't make this easy."
i wish i could tell you to take your time.
the first time you came to visit me in brazil.
it didn't stop raining for a week.
"i had a bug then, too. a tropical bacterium not a reptilian parasite. i was sick as a dog but i wanted to make a good impression."
when we get back home i'll see to it you get some r+r in norway or canada. someplace where there's not a tropical bug in sight.
or reptiles.
or reptiles. keep at it. i'll get these to the bridge.
we've gotten close enough to isolate their signatures.
the insectoid ship is no longer with them.
why would they leave the vortex?
we have no idea. all we know is that the weapon is being escorted by a single reptilian vessel. dolim's.
at least we'll only have one ship to contend with.
here we go.
doctor?
fifteen minutes and counting.
any sign of the sphere?
it's too soon.
hold your course.
degra's vessel is less than twenty minutes behind us.
"lieutenant, we're about to drop into normal space."
stand by to initiate the firing sequence.
we're ready.
are you detecting any earth vessels near the co-ordinates?
"no vessels, but there is one small orbital station. unarmed."
let me see earth.
enlarge. it's a shame. all that water. the aquatics would feel at home here.
i've got it.
how far?
twenty thousand kilometres.
thirteen minutes left.
"as soon as we make visual contact, go to thrusters. set a heading to latitude fifteen degrees north. deflector?"
standing by.
they're eight hundred thousand kilometres ahead.
get your team ready to go.
aye sir.
dolim's changing course. they're heading for a space station.
are we in visual range?  yosemite three.
a military installation?
a research post. usually thirty to forty civilians aboard. hail them on this frequency.
the weapon's emitting disruption waves. i can't get anything through.
fifteen degrees north.
"drop to two thousand metres. track starboard, eighty two mark zero."
aye.
"doc, there's something weird happening to my skin."
me too.
it was expected. try not to scratch it. eleven minutes remaining.
the guardian said that once earth is gone we're to destroy all human colonies. i see no reason not to begin with this station. target. fire when ready.
they're heading back towards the weapon.
ten degrees port. slow to thirty kph. i'm transferring the target point to the deflector array.
got it.
begin.
fish in a barrel.
less than ten minutes to go.
what the hell's going on? power just fell ten percent.
i'm picking up explosions on e deck.
bridge to engineering. report.
i'm losing the beam.
there are nine alien lifesigns aboard. they appear to be transdimensional beings.
how's that possible?
"this disturbance we're in, it's obviously been altered enough to sustain them."
who's on degra's ship?
"eight primates, three arboreals and seven humans."
have their weapons been upgraded?
"no, sir."
pathetic. prepare to intercept.
they're arming their torpedoes.
sir.
how's hoshi doing?
she's holding up. she and the maco's are at the transporter device.
"remember, no heroics. just get us in and then keep them off your ass."
there's another vessel approaching at high warp. they're asking for you.
"you're not using your head, pinkskin. that ship you're on is no match for the reptilian."
"i'm busy, shran. what are you doing here?"
you should be impressed we managed to track you through the vortex. i anticipated that you'd need some help.
corporal kelly to the bridge.
go ahead.
our weapons are passing right through them.
"you've got to stop this. if i don't get full power back this is going to take three, four minutes longer than we've got."
"we can't afford three or four minutes. corporal kelly, listen to me very closely. modulate your weapons to a rotating frequency of thirty two point six teracycles."
doctor.
"our transdimensional friend, the one we found in the pod, i had quite a few hours to study his physiology. let's hope my memory serves me well."
"i'll be right in front of you, gentlemen."
keep a low profile.
we're matching speed.
you said there were no human vessels in the vicinity.
they're not human.
destroy them both.
that third torpedo almost got you. be careful! prepare to come about to port.
stay below me.
we'll need to get within a kilometre of the weapon.
just stay below me.
"let's fight back this time, shall we. bring the forward cannons online."
go!
and tell archer we're not even any more. he owes me!
it's coming back. tell them to keep doing what they're doing.
walker to the bridge.
go ahead.
we've secured engineering but i don't think we've seen the last of them.
"it's time for you to work your magic, mister tucker. within five minutes, everyone on this ship is going to start dying."
no pressure.
"okay, bring up the inversion sequence."
start with the third one from the left.
got it.
the second from the right.
hoshi?
i'm all right. the first one on the left is next.
"commander, sensors show the humans are no longer aboard degra's vessel."
these ships are drawing us away from the weapon. get us back!
what's going on?
ignore it commander. you've got less than two minutes.
got it. two to go.
hoshi?
reed to archer.
go ahead.
"i'm pretty sure that was the last one, sir."
good work. now get back here.
t'pol. t'pol!
all right. take us to full impulse. get us out of here.
"wait a minute, i'm almost there."
"you don't have a minute, commander!"
give me ten seconds. i'm telling you i've got it.
"that's it, times up."
it sure is.
"now, mister mayweather."
the network is being destroyed.
looks like we're getting out of this soup faster than we thought.
"without the spheres, their transformed space must be collapsing in on itself."
"which one, hoshi?"
number four. the fourth one from the left.
are you sure?
"yes, yes. number five is the last one after you disable the reactor."
"but if we knock the reactor out, won't that be enough?"
"we didn't come here to disable this weapon, we're here to destroy it. give me the charges."
"i'll take care of it, sir."
i want the four of you to get to the outer framework. beam back to degra's ship.
"as chief tactical officer, sir"
"this isn't open for debate, lieutenant."
"don't worry, i'll be right behind you."
what have you done!
one reptilian transported to the weapon.
let's make sure he has nowhere to go back to. they have no shielding on their starboard engines. target all weapons.
can you get a lock on him?
not yet.
your captain is too deep within the weapon.
"acting captain's starlog, february 14th, 2152. we're holding position at the coordinates where we were told to meet degra's vessel. so far there's been no word from them."
long range sensors are detecting no evidence of the spheres.
none of them?
none. and all the spatial anomalies within our scanning range have vanished.
what about the thermobaric cloud barrier?
"i can only detect a small section from our location, but it appears to be dissipating."
looks like we kept our end of the bargain.
it would appear that the expanse is returning to normal space.
we should have heard something by now. what if they failed? earth could be
be patient.
my skin's healing faster than yours. i guess you vulcans aren't so tough after all.
doctor phlox says we should all be back to normal within two to three days.
i'm only kidding. you look nice like this. kind of like an old oil painting.
i'm not old. i will only be sixty six years old on my next birthday.
i can't believe you told me that.
you accused me of looking old.
that's not what i mean. i've been trying to get you to tell me your age since we left spacedock. why now?
"to vulcans, certain information is considered intimate."
intimate?
bridge to t'pol.
go ahead.
a vortex just opened. it's degra's ship.
this is enterprise. please repeat.
"captain, did you stop the weapon?  captain?"
set an intercept course.
it's done.
done?
captain archer destroyed the weapon.
where is he? is he okay?
"captain didn't make it, trip."
"what do you mean, he didn't make it."
the weapon exploded before he could transport to degra's ship.
come in.  thank you.
the aquatic vessel should have you home in less than a day.
"i was pleased to hear that the council has agreed to reconvene,"
it was difficult for the insectoids to ignore recent events.
and the reptilians?
they'll join us eventually. they have no choice but to accept that the guardians' promises were empty. your captain's sacrifice will not be forgotten. safe journey.
thank you.
"it's all right. all right, it won't be much longer. i promise."
is something wrong?
"i think they sense that we're travelling in an unusual manner. in the belly of the beast, so to speak."
there are no windows here. how would they know we're inside the aquatic vessel?
i don't have the slightest idea. i doubt i'll get much peace and quiet around here until we're flying under our own power.
it will only be a few more hours.
is there something i can do for you?
my skin hasn't fully healed yet.
"oh, you're doing fine. vulcan's are obviously more sensitive to the effects of mysterious realms."
i guess we're not so tough after all.
excuse me?
is there anything i'll need to treat this?
only time. how's morale?
it isn't easy for a crew to lose it's captain.
i suppose we'll all need time to heal.
will he be all right?
"after a while. he's lost his best friend, but it's just a matter of time. he'll be fine again."
did you hear that? the doctor say's you'll be fine. it's just a matter of time.
distance?
eight hundred thousand kilometres.
"set a course, ensign."
you should be in your quarters.
"with all due respect to phlox, i wouldn't miss this for the world."
mind if we take a look?
prettiest sight i ever saw. it's all in one piece.
the captain would be proud.
open a channel to starfleet headquarters.
strange.
what?
they're not responding.
you'd think they'd be waiting with bated breath.
try another frequency.
i'm not picking up the orbital platforms.
the reptilians destroyed yosemite station.
it's not just yosemite. there's nothing coming from any of them.
i've rotated through all the frequencies.
contact the lunar one colony.
i already tried.
prepare a shuttlepod. i want you and ensign mayweather to get down to san francisco. find out what's wrong.
looks pretty normal to me.
then why the hell doesn't anyone want to talk to us? land at the pad behind the command centre.
finally. we've got three vessels approaching.
it's about time. this is commander charles tucker of the starship enterprise. you guys gave us quite a  what the hell?
sir.
where is he?
follow me. he was brought in yesterday. he's been badly burned.  do you recognise the uniform?
this is commander charles tucker of the starship enterprise.
what the hell are you people doing?
those are p-51s. i've seen them at air shows.
i don't think this is an air show.
are they breaking off? maybe we should follow them.
try to find a landing port. set us down.
starboard injector.
get us out of here!
"rita hayworth. veronica lake. betty grable. americans are good at making movies. they're not so good at fighting. some day, i will go to hollywood and i will meet betty grable. maybe you will introduce me, huh? what do you think?"
she's not your type.
"you know, in hollywood movies, americans always win. too bad for you, you're not in a movie."
insurgents!
keep driving! move! move!
"as to the youth of all the britons, i say, you cannot stop. there is no halting-place at this point. we have now reached a point in the journey where there can be no pause. we must go on. it must be world anarchy or world order."
that was winston churchill. i picked that up half an hour ago.
"well, it's true then. we're over two hundred years in the past."
"i've also intercepted several military dispatches and their radio programme, something called the shadow."
we should run a complete diagnostic. start with the sensor array.
this isn't a damn sensor glitch. we just pulled three fifty calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull. and spare us the official vulcan position about time travel. we are two hundred years in the past. face it.
"the first step to getting back is ascertaining how we got here. as soon as the diagnostic is complete, run a scan for any anomalies in the area."
right away.
maybe we're here for a reason. maybe this wasn't an accident.
"for the moment, we can't rule out any possibilities."
"the germans believe there are five thousand resistance fighters operating throughout the region. they're becoming better organized, increasing their attacks. we lost four men in the assault."
"you should have chosen a safer route, and you should have personally overseen the transfer."
we were in the midst of a crucial weapons test. he was just an american prisoner.
he was more than that. this communication device he was carrying. it's from the future.
a temporal agent?
"double the security details at all the entrances to the compound. if they have located us, it won't be long before they strike."
how could they have possibly found us?
"if the prisoner hadn't escaped, we might know the answer to that question. you know what i expect of you."
the prisoner will be recovered.
come in.
"you got a second? i wanted to say, i was way out of line earlier. you have enough to worry about without me flying off the handle."
your reaction was understandable.
i was just all set to get home. i wasn't expecting to be in the middle of another situation.
none of us were. i was also looking forward to going home. i thought perhaps i would return to vulcan. it's been some time since i was there.
sounds nice. i was gonna lay on a different beach every week for two months. the only thing to figure out was whether to start in tahiti or in cancun. the captain would always try to put the best light on the worst situation. i wonder what he'd say to this one.
"i think he'd be hard-pressed to find any positive aspects. but he would try, nevertheless.  come in."
i've been going over those military dispatches that hoshi picked up. some of them don't make sense. they mention recent battles in virginia and ohio. there weren't any battles fought there in world war ii. the nazis never got to north america. something's very wrong down there.
"it's chicken liver, your favourite. with grated cheddar. no, i can't say i blame you. i don't have much of an appetite myself. perhaps a denobulan lullaby will improve your mood? on the other hand, my singing would often drive my children to tears. maybe what you need is a nice, thick steak. i'll see what chef has on the menu. be right back."
"hey, hey, it's okay, it's all right. i'm a friend just cleaning you up a little. war's a dirty business. but you're lucky. bullet just missed the bone."
where am i?
"you're in my apartment, what's left of it. i'm alicia travers."
jonathan archer.
pleased to meet you. what's the last thing you remember?
"i was in a truck with a couple of german soldiers. there was an explosion, someone started shooting at us. i got away."
"you sure did. and your ss friends, they're dead, which is how i like them. you're my first bona fide pow. i usually fix up guys in the resistance.  easy. easy, easy, easy, sailor. you don't want to start bleeding again."
sailor?
that patch on your shirt says enterprise. you must have made it off before it sank. how'd you wind up all the way over here?
i've been asking myself the same question.  what year is this?
it's 1944.
world war two.
"i haven't heard it called that before, but that's as good a description as any. used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for coloureds. as you can see, it's gone downhill."
where are we?
we in brooklyn. new york city?
the weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to the energy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells. each pulse can destroy a tank.
very impressive. when can we expect deployment?
i can't give you a specific timetable. there are still some problems to be addressed.
such as?
"portability. the weapons require considerable power. in my century, there are energy cells the size of a coin. in this century, it's somewhat more difficult."
what are these?
requisition forms. i require additional supplies.
"eighty six metric tons of aluminum plating, a hundred and seventy tons of carbon steel. we can't keep diverting vital materials from war production!"
we are inside the home of a former american president. it seems to me your war effort is going well enough.
"that could change, very quickly. intelligence suggests the americans are preparing a counterattack. our front lines are dangerously thin, supply routes are under constant attack from resistance fighters. a forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of breaking through. on top of this, there've been setbacks in africa, and the russians are attempting to retake moscow. though no one has expressed this to the fuhrer, there is widespread belief that germany has advanced too far, too quickly."
"all the more reason to accede to my request. the weapons i'm preparing will make you immune from any counterattack, anywhere in the world, and i'm not just referring to plasma rifles. imagine a plague targeting non-aryans. no need for extermination camps. just a few grams of a pathogen introduced into the water supply."
you make promises. all we ever see are films!
"there's far too much at stake for us to argue. we have far too much in common. we both embrace the ideals of purity and perfection, and we both face enemies that would destroy us. now is not the time to end an association that is vital to our mutual survival."
no one has proposed ending anything.
then i'll expect delivery by the end of the week.
"portions of daniels' body have aged at a dramatic rate. in some areas, the tissue is over a hundred years old. yet, other sections have been reduced to an almost foetal stage."
do you have any theories as to what caused this?
"it's not any kind of infectious organism, at least, nothing that shows up on my medical scanner."
will he survive?
"frankly, with his amount of cellular chaos, i'm surprised he's still alive. i doubt he'll live more than 24 hours."
he very well could be responsible for our being here. he could also be the only hope of getting back to our own time. it is imperative that i speak with him.
vic's been arrested.
when?
a few hours ago.
"the gestapo's clearing out entire buildings, shooting people on the street. they're looking for you. the germans are offering ten thousand dollars for information leading to your capture. why?"
can't tell you.
"look, you son of a bitch, my friend is probably being tortured right now. i want to know why."
it's classified.
i won't tell anyone.
sal!
"shut up! you got three seconds. one, two, three."
"come on, sal. take it easy. take it easy. come on, now. easy, easy."
all i can tell you is we're on the same side.
"damn military. you cut and run, you leave us at the mercy of these nazi bastards."
i didn't cut and run.
"oh, yeah, yeah, i forgot. it was an orderly retreat."
"vic might break. if he talks, it won't be safe here."
we've been through this.
alicia.
this is my home. i'm not leaving.
we're going to see if we can find out any more information about vic.
"he's conscious, but i don't know for how long."
where's captain archer?
captain archer is dead. he was on the xindi weapon when it exploded. are you responsible for sending us back in time?  why?
"the temporal cold war has become an all-out conflict. temporal agents, dozens of them stationed throughout the timeline. they've been given orders to change history."
for what purpose?
each faction is trying to wipe the others out. it's a fight for dominance.
daniels. the events of this period don't correspond with recorded history. germany has launched a successful invasion of the united states.
different incursions are causing paradoxes. turbulence in the time stream. i almost didn't make it back.
how do we return to our century?
you can't. it doesn't exist. not the way you know it. neither does mine. it's all gone. you have to stop him
stop who? daniels. stop who?
"we're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen mile radius of the ambush. we haven't found the prisoner, but we have taken in several members of the resistance. they're being interrogated. there's one that i suspect took part in the ambush."
we're picking up scans from a ship in orbit. it's from the same time period as the device we found on the escaped prisoner. this resistance member you're interrogating.
yes?
bring him to me.
not bad.
where is your husband now?
"he's in the pacific, on a destroyer. i hear the war isn't going any better over there. don't be expecting a second course."
it's not bad.
"you're a rotten liar. all the good stuff goes to the germans. i still can't believe it. you know, that they're actually here. i'll never forget the day i saw that first german tank rolling up flatbush. all the people streaming across the brooklyn bridge, trying to get out of manhattan. the president on the radio, vowing to persevere, right before the government evacuated washington.  right on time."
my old flame
billie holiday.
good to know there's something that your remember.
i can't even think of his name.
"germans outlawed coloured music. some of the neighbours pass a phonograph from house to house every night, so the germans can't find it. just another way of telling 'em off."
for i haven't met a gent so magnificent.
"alicia, i'm going to ask you something. it's going to sound a little strange."
what else is new?
"i've met so many men, some who sent me up to the skies."
"when i was in a german medical tent, one of the soldiers who came in to see me wasn't like the other ones. he had grey skin, red eyes. he wasn't human. this isn't the first time you've heard something like this."
"sal mentioned some stories once, but i didn't believe them."
they may be more than stories. i need to track down this soldier i saw. it's very important. would you contact sal?
"eps conduit's fried. get to engineering, and pull a fresh one out of the injector assembly."
"yes, commander."
walsh?
commander.
silik. you son of a bitch.
climb in.
you brought us here.
no.
then who did?
what's happening is beyond your comprehension. get in the shuttlepod. i would rather not have to discharge this weapon.
bay one is depressurising. someone's launching a shuttlepod.
hail them.
i'm picking up one life sign aboard. it's suliban.
phase-cannons.
"if this nazi wasn't a human, what was he, then?"
i don't know.
just tell sal i want to talk to him.
all right.
"here, it's hamburger. germans are cutting the meat ration again. it's gonna be worth its weight in gold."
"thanks, carmine."
watch yourselves.
used to be we'd get meat on wednesdays and fridays. then it was just wednesdays.
"nazis blame the resistance, say we're disrupting the food shipment."
makes the germans feel like heroes.
yeah.
fighting to feed the people.
look.
no eye contact.
why do you walk with her?
why not?
do you like negroes?
we don't want any trouble.
"shut up, bitch. do we make you angry?"
you could say that.
"when we send her back to africa, you can go along. you can run through the jungles together."
"like i said, neighbourhood's gone downhill."
"before he lost consciousness, daniels told me there was someone we had to stop."
at least now we know who he was talking about.
can you get a fix on the shuttlepod?
"he disabled the transponder. however, we are picking up trace plasma signatures, probably from the damage. i think i can get us within three kilometres of where it went down."
that will have to suffice.
"thing i can't understand, why'd he go to the trouble of saving my life? he pulled me out of the launch bay before he depressurised it."
another item on our list of things to ponder.
curfew starts in an hour. we got to move fast.
"yeah, sometimes the germans don't wait for curfew."
can't get used to all this skulking around.
i know what you mean. we used to own this neighbourhood.
"yeah, tell him what you guys did before the war."
nothing to tell. we were delegates for the construction workers union.
right. the loan-sharkinq was just a part-time job.
we helped people get out of financial difficulty. since when is that a crime?
when they didn't pay you back on time. that's where the crime part came in.
"come on, let's go."
this guy's a welsher and a drunk. i wouldn't put too much stock into what comes out of his mouth.
i'll keep that in mind.
i'm only doing this because alicia asked. don't forget that.
what's this all about?
"i want you to tell him what you told me, about your customer."
who are you?
just shut up and tell him.
i can't talk and shut up at the same time.
talk!
"the man comes to me for information. sometimes he asks about the resistance, sometimes he asks about the gestapo. he's keeping tabs on both sides. me? i don't know squat, so i make stuff up. he pays good."
what's he look like?
"he always wears a hat. stays in the shadows. i caught a glimpse of him once. he ain't like nobody i ever seen, that's for sure. it's the red eyes i can't forget."
i want to talk to him.
forget it. that ain't part of the deal.
sal.
"what you owe me, take twenty percent off."
"damn, sal."
what? i'm a generous guy.
i don't know...
"hey, you think the germans are tough? get me in a bad mood."
artillery.
hard to believe we're only a few kilometres from new york city.
it's hard to believe this is earth.
plasma signature. that way.
could be the last cuban in the city.
no thanks.
you don't know what you're missing.
i got a pretty good idea.
"i read in a magazine once the germans were doing medical experiments on people. well, maybe that's what you saw, one of their experiments."
i hadn't considered it.
"a lot of weird stories floating around. the germans working on new weapons, guns that shoot light instead of bullets. turn people into dust. it all sounds like one of those stories that guy, orson welles, dreamed up."
rat. orson welles. war of the worlds. my engineer played it for me once.
how'd he do that?
a friend at a radio station made a recording.
"you know all those people who panicked? i was one of them. i fell for the whole thing. i called my sister in jersey, i told her the martians were coming. she broker her ankle racing for the car. it cost me a fortune in medical bills. sometimes i wish the martians had come."
i'm sure you would have given them a run for their money.
"we're keeping the germans busy, more and more of us every day. irish gangs, dockworkers, coloureds, even broads. some of these women, they can shoot the fleas off a tick. when the war's over, i got half a mind to put them on the payroll."
here.  it's loaded.
you.
throw the gun down.
you're not following directions. that's how people get hurt.
you'd better take her advice.
what do you want?
holy mother of
tucker to enterprise.
t'pol.
we found it.
no sign of silik.
what's the shuttlepod's condition?
i'll need some more time before i'll know if it'll fly.
you ever see anything like that before?
maybe he's wearing some kind of mask.
that's no mask.
who are you? answer me.
i have nothing to say to you.
how about if we pulled out your tongue?
you're not what i expected. temporal agents are usually more informed.
what in the hell is a temporal agent?
you wouldn't understand.
"listen, you freak."
why are you changing history? you're helping the germans win the war. why?
because it suits us.
how does this suit you?
"sal, no! damn it!"
it's better than he deserves.
get your hands off him!
"you want answers, don't you?"
not like that.
"just say the word, sal. i'll take him out right here."
the hell with it.
"i don't know how long i can hold them off. you better talk to me. now, who are you? what are you doing here?"
we're trapped. the germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home.
you said i was a temporal agent.
we know you're from the future. we detected your ship in orbit.
my ship.
it has the same markings that were on your uniform.
i need to contact them. can i do it with this?
we better get out of here.
the conduit. where's it being built?
you find it.
come on. come on!
"you won't stop us. when we get back, you'll never have existed."
eps system's completely fused. it could take a week.
i'm picking up movement in the area. looks like several vehicles.
commander.
i heard. moving to plan b. what about silik?
we gotta find him.
we will. one problem at a time.
"jesus, he looked like some kind of demon."
his blood wasn't even red.
"was that my imagination, or did he say something about being from the future?"
he meant him.
archer to enterprise.
"you want any more of our help, you're gonna tell us what's going on. what was that back there?"
that was an extraterrestrial.
a martian?
i don't know what planet he was from.
"well, where are you from?"
upstate new york.
fellas. a lot of people out past curfew.
i don't like the looks of this.
we gotta get out of here.
move.
sal!  get out of here!
"enterprise, come in. enterprise."
what are you doing?
enterprise!
"whoever you're calling, they're not going to get here in time."
charges are set.
it's done.
i've lost them.
the explosion may have disrupted their comm. signal.
i'm picking up another signal. it's faint.
let's hear it.
"captain archer to enterprise. come in. enterprise, come in."
captain?
your transmission is very weak. do you read me?
t'pol. two to transport.
leave your weapons on the ground and stand up slowly.
we have a great deal to talk about.
it'll have to wait.
you're all right. you're on my ship.
how did we get here?
it's kind of complicated.
promise you won't do that again.
i promise.
captain!
welcome home.
"we're not quite home yet, but it's good to be back. i guess i have some catching up to do. status?"
several vehicles converged on the area moments before the shuttlepod exploded.
keep searching. this is one of the aliens' communicators. take it apart. figure out how to monitor their transmissions.
"it's nice to see you again, captain."
i hope it's the last time you'll have to look after porthos.
"it was a pleasure, as always."
is he awake?
he doesn't have much time.
jonathan.
who are they?
"the most dangerous faction of the cold war. they're led by vosk, a fanatic violently opposed to the temporal accords."
stay with me. stay with me.
"we almost captured him, but he developed a form of stealth time travel. he escaped into the past. we eventually located him, but it was too late. he returned to my century. he and his people defeated us and launched this war that's destroying all of time. i've sent you to this point because it's here that vosk can be stopped. if you succeed, the war will never happen. the timeline will be restored."
one of his people told me they were building a conduit.
"vosk's time travel device had a drawback. it was a one-way trip. he needed to construct the conduit to get home, but he was forced to use technology from this time period. the machine would have to be enormous. find it. destroy it. he must not succeed. stop him."
"your colleague has managed to evade us. i assure you, whatever i want to know, you'll tell me gratefully.  i'll be supervising another test. notify me when they're ready for questioning."
we just pulled three fifty calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull. we are two hundred years in the past.
insurgents!
"your colleague has managed to evade us. i assure you, whatever i want to know, you'll tell me."
where are we?
we in brooklyn.
the weapons i'm preparing will make you immune from any counterattack anywhere in the world.
the germans were offering ten thousand dollars for information leading to your capture. why?
all i can tell you is we're on the same side.
holy mother of
we're trapped. the germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home.
"i've sent you to this point because it's here that vosk can be stopped. if you succeed, the timeline will be restored."
one of these people told me they were building a conduit.
find it. destroy it. he must not succeed. stop him.
"and now, the conclusion."
"news on parade! america and germany together in the fight for freedom. in his first visit to the home of the brave, the german chancellor received a warm welcome from the big apple! he greeted enthusiastic crowds in times square and took in the view from the top of the empire state building. watch that first step! later, the fuhrer paid a call to lady liberty, where he was given the keys to the city! the whirlwind tour was capped off by a four-hour speech to city leaders, where the fuhrer outlined his vision for a prosperous alliance between germany and america. vowing to root out the parasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and to liberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers, together, we will put americans back to work. two great nations marching side by side toward a bold future!"
our intelligence sources are convinced that the american counterattack will be launched within days. it's no longer a rumour. it's fact.
i assume you're taking the necessary steps.
what is that?
"an intelligence briefing. according to this, your squadron performed flawlessly in recent field tests."
you've been spying on us.
we're protecting our interests.
i suppose i would've done the same. tell your fuhrer he'll receive the squadron when i deem it ready for deployment.
this says it is ready for deployment.
"with all due respect, your intelligence is flawed."
we are tired of your stalling!
and i am tired of your threats.
you and your men have taken an oath to defend germany!
we take that oath seriously.
do you?
you've made certain promises to me as well.
we've provided everything you've asked for. you'll not receive a single truckload of additional supplies till you fulfill your part of the agreement.
"general, you might consider what would happen if my weapons were to fall into the hands of the allies. imagine berlin obliterated by plasma cannons."
i should have you arrested for treason.
"you are a fool. you think we're equals because i allow you to participate in this struggle. you fight to control nations. we dominate entire worlds. we extend our will across time. if your race were to endure for a million years, you couldn't begin to approach what we've accomplished. the next time you feel the urge to threaten me, remember this: i can erase you from history as if you never existed."
she was around my age.
twenty six.
ensign o'malley. how'd she die?
in a battle with a hostile species.
there's still war in the future?
"on earth, between human beings, war has been eliminated. but the galaxy's a big place, with thousands of species. not all of them have the same values we have."
"spaceships. people from other planets. people from the future? it's all a little too much for alicia travers from bensonhurst. besides, i'm afraid of heights."
i can send you anywhere in the world. to a place that isn't occupied by the germans.
"seem to be fewer and fewer of those places every day. i want to go home, to my neighbourhood. there are a lot of people in trouble down there, and i'm not going to just turn my back on them. but you knew i was going to say that, didn't you?"
"i had a feeling. two of my men are missing. they could be hiding out, they might've been taken prisoner. they could be dead."
"we've got eyes on every street corner. i can, i can put a word out. archer, with this ship, with all this power, you can help us. you can help us stop those bastards."
i know.
"then do it. start with berlin. wipe that damn place off the map, and don't stop until you kill every last one of them, because what they"
we're going to stop them. that's one of the reasons we're here. but we're going to do it another way.
okay. i guess you know what you're doing. are you going to start by sending me down with that dissolver thing?
shuttlepods are damaged. the transporter is all we have.
"archer, you promised me i wouldn't have to go through that again."
i'm going to have to break that promise.
"okay. how does that thing work, anyway? on second thought, i'd rather not know."
begin the test sequence.
"based on the interrogations, i believe the prisoners are not temporal agents."
i've arrived at the same conclusion. their technology suggests they're from a period too early for time travel.
they don't even seem to know how they got to this century. it's curious.
"still, i refuse to believe their presence here is an accident."
there's a power surge in one of the power modules.
run a complete systems scan. isolate the fault. our time is running out. the germans are becoming impatient.
why not give them what they want?
i don't trust these people. i never have. i'm not about to furnish them with weapons that could be used against us. return the prisoners to their holding cell. see that they get medical attention. go.
bring the doctor immediately.
i think i've pinpointed where the timeline changed. someone assassinated lenin in 1916.
who took his place?
"no one. so without lenin, the bolsheviks never gained power. russia didn't become communist, and germany never considered it a threat."
hitler was able to concentrate on the west.
"after france, belgium and the netherlands fell. hitler quickly took england and then the eastern united states."
but vosk and his men arrived on earth recently. a few years ago.
then they couldn't have been responsible for the changes that took place in 1916.
the police never captured lenin's assassin. some bystanders claimed that the killer vanished into thin air.
daniels said that different factions in the temporal war are changing history throughout the timeline. maybe this assassin was working for one of them.
but i thought we were here to prevent vosk from starting the temporal war.
chicken or the egg.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
i'm receiving a transmission. it's vosk.
this is captain archer.
"your voice sounds familiar, captain. have we met?"
what do you want?
i believe i have two of your men.
are they all right?
i think it would be mutually beneficial to discuss this face to face.
we can bring you aboard.
i was thinking of a more neutral location. there's a remote area outside the city.
that's not what i'd consider neutral.
you have scanners.
examine the area before coming down. i'll have three men with me. and your crewmen.
"a few hours ago, you tried to kill me."
the situation has changed.
"i'm sending you the coordinates. if you're interested, meet me in one hour."
got 'em.
"it's good to see you again, captain."
where are my men?
captain! i don't believe it. how can you be
are you all right?
we weren't exactly treated like royalty.
i apologise for the aggressiveness of our questioning.
aggressive?
we were operating under a false impression.
we're okay.
get back to the ship.
wait a minute. you're coming with us.
trip.  beam them up.
"you have your men, captain. now it's your turn to reciprocate."
how?
i wish to discuss something with you.
go on.
a species with your level of technology doesn't possess the capability for time travel.
we had a little help.
as i suspected. what do you know about me?
"i know that you're trapped here, and that you're trying to get back to the twenty ninth century. i also know you've made a deal with the germans. they're giving you supplies, helping you build a time machine."
i see i was both right and wrong about you. you're not a temporal agent. but you're here to do their bidding.
"if you carry out your mission, if you make it back to the twenty ninth century, you will ignite a war that will devastate the timeline."
"you've only heard one side of the story, captain. the temporal agents who sent you here are a tyrannical sect imposing their will on countless cultures throughout history."
"they manipulate the time line to serve their own needs. if you've ever dealt with them, then you know they do much more than watch history unfold. they interfere with events. they have an agenda."
so do you.
"at least i don't hide my intentions. it's true, i don't agree with the temporal accords. i believe that time travel is a technology no different than your warp drive, to be utilized for the benefit of all species. societies, cultures can be improved through careful manipulation of historical events."
who decides what improvements are needed?
"i won't be drawn into a philosophical discussion. there's one simple reason why you should help me, captain."
and what's that?
i can send you back to your century.
history's been changed. the century i left will be completely different.
"once i've defeated the temporal agents, i'll reverse the damage done to your timeline. your history will return to the way it was. i'm severely limited by twentieth century earth technology. the resources aboard your ship will greatly accelerate my task. go back. reunite with your crewmen, and consider what i have said."
how are they doing?
a few cuts and bruises.
what happened after we beamed up? you make some kind of deal?
he thinks we're considering it.
are we?
captain.
what'd you see down there?
"we were in some huge building, like a factory. they're constructing something big. the germans are helping him."
"i overheard them talking. they mentioned something about a temporal conduit. i know it sounds crazy, but i think it's a time machine."
"daniels sent us here to stop them from completing it. problem is, it's protected by some kind of energy shield."
who dressed this?
nicky giorgio. what do you want? he's a mechanic.
he should stick to cars. at least it doesn't look infected.
could have been worse. could have ended up like sal.
it's a miracle you got away.
guess you should know.
what's that supposed to mean?
"i heard a rumour. when the soldiers cornered you and archer, you two disappeared into thin air, like ghosts."
that's crazy
"that's what i said. but then again, i didn't believe in nazi martians, you know, not until i saw one myself."
want to tell me what this is?
you went through my jacket?!
i was looking for a cigarette. what is it?
it's a radio.
"i never seen a radio like this. it looks like that thing archer took off that martian guy, or whatever he was."
archer gave this to me so that i could talk to him.
"talk to him? where is he? alicia, you've been like a little sister to us. you're going to start keeping secrets now?"
"where's my engineer? silik. this disk you were carrying. it contains schematics of vosk's facility. this is what you came here for, isn't it?"
you persist in asking questions you know i will not answer.
"i'll try answering them myself, then. your benefactor wants to do more than just project his image into the past. he wants the technology to travel into the past. somehow, he found out that daniels was sending enterprise here, so you were ordered to hitch a ride. your mission was to break into vosk's compound and steal this."
"tell me, how was i planning to send that to the future?"
maybe that's why you came back aboard. maybe you need enterprise.
"an impressive display, captain."
i'm glad you're not disappointed.
though i'm not implying you're correct in any of your assumptions.
of course not.
but you don't have the answer you're seeking. the whereabouts of your missing crewman.
"i think you left him somewhere inside vosk's compound. and for your sake, he'd better be alive."
"you've changed, captain."
and not at all for the better.
"a large amount of data has been stolen from our computer system, captain."
we found trace amounts of bioresidue. the thief is from your time period.
he's suliban. he's aboard my ship. he's a stowaway.
we've encountered his faction before. i want to speak with him.
i can't allow that.
and i suppose you aren't examining the technology he stole from us.
i reserve that right.
and i reserve the right to destroy you.
"i have a plasma-cannon aimed at your ship, captain."
and i have phase-cannons aimed at your facility.
i want an answer to my proposal.
the answer is no.
return fire.
their shields are still holding.
travis.
they're moving out of range.
we needed them.
we'll complete our objective with the resources at hand. resume your work.
engines took a serious hit. weapons are down.
get to work on repairs.  keep looking over those schematics. find a way to disable the shields protecting that compound.
i'm getting my crewman back. you're going to help me get inside the facility.
and then? are you going to destroy it?
yes.
"i don't care about your crewman, captain, but i don't want vosk to succeed any more than you do. i'll help you. there is one problem. i use my genetic enhancements to get inside the building. your presence will negate that advantage."
we'll work around it.
you should be able to deactivate the shields from this console. here's the procedure. the data from the disk was extremely helpful.
you're welcome.
"when the shields are down, give us ten minutes, then destroy the facility."
our targeting array is offline. we're in need of commander tucker's skills.
"do what you can. move in close, and fire point-blank if you have to."
understood. good luck.
"three american divisions have crossed the ohio river. two more are advancing from the south toward washington. by direct order from the fuhrer, the squadron is to be transferred immediately to luftwaffe regional command. i am to personally oversee the deployment."
weapons of this complexity require extensive training to operate.
we'll discuss the particulars once you've fulfilled your obligation.
six hours.
why the delay?
the planes must be readied for transport.
six hours.
we're leaving tonight. begin preparations.
"each time we open a conduit, it collapses within seconds."
human leaders often speak of destiny. the conduit will hold.
"how do i look? better? from my dealings with you and your crew, i'd come to believe that your race was inherently unaggressive."
we've come a long way in a short time.
"one thing is clear. when necessary, humans are fully capable of reverting to old methods. the way you handled that xindi threat was extremely effective. no doubt it's the reason why daniels chose you to stop vosk."
"speaking of vosk, seems to me that you both have a common enemy, daniels. why hadn't you decided to work together?"
one doesn't join forces with vosk.
he's found some partners here.
"they're only a means to an end. to him and his followers, other species exist only to serve their needs."
sounds like you and vosk have some history.
"his faction once tried to eradicate the suliban. they travelled into our past, altered it to prevent our species from attaining sentience."
then how is it that you're here?
he was stopped by the temporal agents.
are you saying you owe daniels' people your lives?
"they still oppose us, they're still our enemy. that will never change."
what the hell do you want?
i'm looking for alicia travers.
who's asking?
my name's archer.
still hunting martians?
you just missed billie holiday.
what are we going after this time? the loch ness monster?
i'm picking up a surge of radio chatter. orders coming in german and english.
there's heavy bombing. most of it in eastern pennsylvania and southern virginia. it could be an allied attack.
could it pose a danger to the captain?
the closest fighting is a hundred kilometres south of new york city. incredible.
what's our repair status?
engines are at thirty six percent. manoeuvring thrusters are offline.
weapons?
the targeting array's fried. we'll be shooting in the dark.
what's so important about this facility?
they're building weapons there. extremely powerful weapons.
"what i hear, you have some pretty powerful weapons yourself. i made her tell me everything. not that i believe all of it."
do we really need these people?
"what do you mean, these people?"
i don't see how they can be of any use to us.
i'll tell you how i can be of use to you. how about i start removing your teeth with my knuckles?
all right.
are you threatening me?
"hey, give the man a prize."
why would you do that?
i'm going to kill this guy.
"hey, i haven't signed off on this yet. sal went along with you, and look what it got him. if i'm gonna lose any more people, there'd better be a good reason."
"look, you know what, carmine? i'm gonna make this real easy for you. i'm gonna help him. all you have to do is decide whether or not you're gonna help me."
"our greatest scientist once said, every moment we live, we are moving through time. we've earned the right to chose which direction. the mastery of time has allowed us to perfect ourselves. to reach our full potential as a people and to vanquish those who oppose us. there's just one last enemy to deal with. soon, history will belong to us. we will stretch out our hands and mold it according to our will. not even the gods of our ancestors could have imagined such power. my brothers, we are going home."
what a way to spend a saturday night.
it only opens from the inside.
there's too many of 'em! come on!
it's nice to see you.
insurgents. we don't know how many.
a fortuitous development. let the germans deal with them. continue with the preparations.
we're in. we're making our way to the console.
our targeting array is still down.
we're going to have to drop out of orbit to get close enough.
understood.
have you located commander tucker?
"not yet. it's second on my list, believe me."
take cover.
"they're activating the conduit. work fast, captain."
he did it.
take us in.
aye.
we're in an extremely precarious position.
i hadn't noticed.
it might help if i had a weapon.
"sorry, only one to go around."
silik.
the earth ship has entered the atmosphere.
activate the plasma weapon.
we can't spare the power.
then deploy the squadron. destroy them.
no! the squadron's going to the front.
execute my order.
i am taking command of this facility. you are relieved.
"i'm sorry, general, but i'm afraid i have to end our alliance."
archer to enterprise. archer to enterprise.
they're in the atmosphere. ionisation. the signal can't penetrate.
we'll get you out of here.
"i think not. you've proven a worthy opponent, captain. i would've preferred to die fighting you, but i suppose i can settle for this."
trip.
hold it right there.
it's me.
"shut up. drop the disguise, silik, or i'll blow your ugly head off."
"if you do, you'll probably regret it."
captain?
"good to see you, commander."
you're alive?
as long as you don't pull that trigger.
i can't believe it.
the building's about to blow up.
gotcha.
this way.
distance?
one hundred kilometres. targeting scanner still can't get a lock. i'm going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. switching to visual scanners.
slow us down. two hundred kph.
"nicky, cover them."
you got to pull your people out.
"oh, i'm having too much fun."
"in a few seconds, this entire area is going to be bombed."
planes? start falling back! we got to get the hell out of here!
i guess we have to say good-bye all over again. it's harder the second time.
i can't argue with that.
"i want my neighbourhood back, the way it was. and my husband, i want him home. fix all that, okay?"
i'll try. thank you.
yeah.
"hey, you're welcome."
"german dive-bombers. stukas. nothing too much to worry about. however, they were fitted with sirens to frighten the enemy during an attack. they fire seven point nine millimetre rounds."
mister reed.
we're too far away. i still can't see it.
it appears that bullets and sirens aren't all they have.
photonic torpedoes.
it's holding!
i'm reading a powerful energy surge inside the facility.
malcolm.
one more kilometre.
destiny.
i can see it.
take it out.
no!
"it's quite a sight. the timeline's resetting itself. you did it. vosk is dead. he didn't make it back. all of the damage he caused, it never happened."
and you're here to give me a pat on the back.
in a way.
"well, i don't want it. i want you to leave me and my crew alone. we're done with you and your damn temporal cold war."
it's coming to an end because of what you did. you have no idea how many lives you've saved.
i'll take your word for it. just send us home.
"it's almost ready. good-bye, jonathan. captain. it's been a privilege."
everyone all right?
captain.
we're in the right place. let's find out if we're in the right time. hoshi?
"multiple signals. lunar one colony, orbital platform, san francisco. they're all calling in."
i'm picking up vessels approaching. dozens of them.
do they look friendly?
"well done, jonathan."
"thank you, admiral."
"i've been told that people are calling us heroes. when it comes to my crew, you won't get any argument from me. but i think it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't with us. the twenty seven crewmen who didn't make it back. without their sacrifice, i wouldn't be standing here right now. none of us would. but i'm sure i speak on behalf of my entire crew when i say it's good to be home."
excuse me.
scotch.
the bar's reserved for regular customers. galactic heroes have to sit at a table.
"i heard about your promotion. congratulations, captain."
thank you.
cheers.
cheers. so what was it like in the expanse?
"you'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? i wouldn't want to spoil any surprises. besides, i've got more important questions. seen any good movies while i was gone?"
"another world war iii epic. it swept all the awards. but you haven't missed much. earth's been holding its breath for the past year, wondering if the xindi were going to come back and finish the job. on the bright side, there've been more weddings and births than ever before."
i don't see a ring.
i'm married to starfleet. just like you.
come in.
"well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes to last a year."
you wanted something?
"i told the captain i wanted to stay aboard and supervise the refit, but he suggested i take a break. more like an order, actually. problem is, i'm not sure where to go. lizzie's gone, my home town doesn't exist anymore. guess this is my home now."
you could come with me.
to vulcan?
the transport leaves at eleven hundred hours.
where would i stay?
there's a guest room in my mother's home.
"oh, your mom's house, huh? what does she know about me? about us?"
i've never mentioned you.
so you'd introduce me as?
commander charles tucker the third. you've told the captain that you don't get to see as many alien cultures as you'd like. you've never been to vulcan.
"eleven hundred hours, huh? i'd better start packing."
we've tied these stations directly in the primary eps junction.
i hope you don't mind if i steal some of these improvements.
i won't say anything if you do me a small favour. my senior officer candidates. i'd like to get your opinion. you've served with a few of them.
you might want to talk to someone about installing a lumbar support. you're going to spend a lot of hours in that chair.
we've improved hull polarisation by twelve percent. we'll be able to hang in a firefight a little longer.
"ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase cannons."
upgrades you recommended. what is it?
i had an argument once with captain jefferies. he was one of the designers of the nx-class.
i'm aware of that.
"i told him i didn't want to be in command of a warship trying to make first contact with new species. jefferies was right. we needed those weapons, and a hell of a lot more."
the asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. we think the vulcans entered the field in order to mine it.
trellium?
it's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. ships in the expanse used it to insulate their hulls.
"your log reflects that when you boarded the seleya you found the crew in a delusional, violent state."
they attacked us the minute we docked. the trellium had a toxic effect on the vulcans. it damaged their neural pathways. they lost the ability to suppress their emotions.
"according to your log, the entire crew of the seleya was killed when you triggered a reactor breach."
the breach was an accident. we were trying to disable their power grid.
"as far as i can determine, you didn't try to save a single vulcan crewman."
there was no point. they were too far gone.
"is that your medical opinion, captain?"
phlox made that determination.
our specialists have examined the data you sent back. it's far from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible.
there was nothing we could do for them.
t'pol was exposed to the trellium. she recovered.
i couldn't help them!
"there's no need to get emotional, captain. you spent several hours in the ship's auxiliary control room. in that time, did you try to access the internal sensors, or download the computer database?"
no.
"so in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard the seleya."
what the hell does that mean?
"because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete picture of the events that led to the ship's destruction."
i just told you exactly what led to the ship's destruction.
captain.
i'm not going to sit here and be accused of murdering those people.
"no one is accusing you of anything, captain."
maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been a little more helpful.
i beg your pardon?
you did everything you could to sabotage our mission. i got more help from the andorians than i ever got from the high command.
"that's enough, captain."
this planet would be a cloud of dust right now if we'd listened to you.
that's enough!
how can you be taking his side?
i am not taking anyone's side. you were out of line.
they don't lift a finger to help us and now i have to justify myself to that son of a bitch?
"the debriefing's on hold, indefinitely. i want you to take some time off to clear your head."
"with all due respect, admiral, i don't need a vacation."
"that's an order, captain!"
lieutenant. if you wouldn't mind.
"not exactly travelling light, are you?"
"thank you. why leave the comforts of home, when you can take it all with you?"
okay. i trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on the surface.
what do you mean?
i'm surprised you haven't heard. an andorian and two rigelians were attacked.
attacked? why?
apparently the xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia. it's hard to believe in this day and age. i'm told the vulcans are staying behind the walls of their compound.
"well, i'm not going to let a few isolated incidents disrupt my vacation plans. i lived on earth for many years before coming aboard enterprise."
"i don't think this is the same planet you remember, doctor. people are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is."
"i appreciate your concern, but i'll be fine. would you?"
thank you.
mind if i ask what you're doing here?
you know better than to go climbing without a partner.
"what about that volcano we saw on the way down, mount tar'ana?"
tar'hana.
it still active?
"there are frequent eruptions. we can schedule a tour of the crater, if you're interested."
"volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains. i'm not sure where to start. so, this is where you grew up. it's not like i imagined."
meaning?
"well, it's beautiful."
vulcans appreciate beauty.
"well, i had no doubt about that. you always were a snazzy dresser."
"commander tucker, i suggest"
you didn't tell me you were bringing a guest.
"mother, you're home."
obviously. it's agreeable to see you. you appear well.
"i'm charles tucker. pleased to meet you, ma'am."
why is he here?
commander tucker is my colleague. he wanted to visit vulcan.
this is the first time you've brought a colleague home with you.
you both must be very tired after your journey.
the guest room is on the south end of the house.
it's not yet midday. why aren't you at the science academy?
i'm no longer an instructor there. i wrote you a letter. didn't starfleet transmit it to your ship?
we had communication difficulties in the expanse.
i don't know why you're surprised. this was planned years ago. there's more to life than one's profession. perhaps you'll learn that one day. it seems that i'm not the only one who knew you were coming. you received this yesterday.
it's from koss.
did you believe he had forgotten you? you're going to respond.
i have nothing to say to koss.
he's your fiancé.
former fiancé.
that is a matter for debate. it would be wise for you to speak with him.
"you probably don't want to hear this, but i got a call from my brother yesterday. they renamed my old high school after you. how many is that, two, three dozen?"
i'm not counting.
that's just north america. i don't think zefram cochrane has that many schools named after him.
"so, did you get a chance to look 'em over?"
look what over?
my senior officer candidates. any suggestions for tactical?
"you may want to find someone with more field experience, a maco."
i'm not sure how i feel about a military officer on the bridge.
"if i were you, i'd talk to general casey about assigning an entire squad."
things have changed since enterprise left spacedock. you'll spend a lot of your time boldly going into battle.
don't you think you're being a little cynical?
did you read my reports?
"yes, captain, i did."
hey.
mountain lion. tracks are a few days old.
good thing i have you to protect me.
come in.
good morning.
what time is it?
oh four hundred.
you're kidding.
"we have to prepare the morning meal. as guests, it's expected of us."
the nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year.
i've had ample time to attend to them.
it sounds as if you're not enjoying retirement.
you still haven't told me the reason for your visit.
i didn't know one was necessary.
i thought perhaps you'd decided to rejoin the high command.
"i've been offered a commission with starfleet. if i accept, it could be several years before i'm able to return home."
the gespar isn't fresh. my stasis unit needs to be replaced.
"well, i'd be happy to take a look at it. if i can recalibrate a warp reactor, i ought to be able to handle a kitchen appliance."
my daughter's always been fascinated by alien worlds. she was all too eager to finish her schooling and leave vulcan.
"as i recall, you encouraged me to leave."
"a mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. at some point, they're supposed to return. i'm told that on earth a human child chooses their own path in life. they put their own wishes ahead of their family's."
that's true for the most part.
"you've learned much from them, haven't you?"
a starfleet posting is no less important than one with the high command. i'm sure father would have approved.
your father believed that our work should enrich vulcan society.
earth is supposed to be our ally.
what's happened to you?
we shouldn't argue in front of a guest.
"well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say. unfortunately, we can't actually give tours of the ship. if that policy ever changes, you two will be the first to know."
you had to wear that jacket.
do you think i wore this jacket to attract attention?
how's your drink?
"delicious, thank you."
because i'd heard someplace your people didn't like alcohol.
you may be thinking of vulcans.
"you know, you're right. i get your species mixed up all the time."
is there something we can help you with?
i'm just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable. sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us.
i'm quite comfortable.
"because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous for some reason, the vulcan consulate's on the other side of the bridge. i'll bet there's someplace there where someone like yourself could get a nice, refreshing beverage."
": well, perhaps we should be on our way?"
"we're not going anywhere, doctor."
"if your friend wants to go, you should let him go."
you're not chasing anyone out of here.
you starfleet people are the real problem. you fly all around space telling every species you meet where to find earth. did it ever occur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do?
"sir, why don't you just go back to the bar?"
"excuse me, admiral. i don't take orders from you."
you heard him. step away from the table.
"gentlemen, please!"
doctor?
i just want to thank you for letting me stay here.
expressing gratitude is an earth custom.
t'pol says thank you all the time.
i've noticed.
t'pol's lucky. it's nice to have a place to go home to.
i know that you are romantically involved with my daughter. there's no logic in denying it. how long have you been attracted to her?
i knew we had some kind of chemistry the first time we got into an argument. i never had fun arguing with anyone before. i got the impression t'pol wasn't going to say anything to you.
she didn't. i'm her mother. you've repaired it?
the field generator just needed a little adjustment. as good as new.
"if you have the time, perhaps you could repair my food synthesiser."
would you mind?
koss?
i need to speak with t'pol.
i want to hear about your life aboard the human ship. you must have many fascinating stories.
why are you here?
the answer should be obvious.
you've received my letters. you know i'm not interested in marriage.
"the decision isn't ours alone. my parents believe in the old traditions. for them, a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed."
you have the option of choosing another mate.
i don't want another mate.
you should be aware i've been ill recently.
ill?
"it could take some time for me to recover, assuming it's even possible."
i can help. my father's a man of influence. i knows the finest doctors in the province. i intend to go through with this.
what if i declare the kal-if-fee?
is that what you want? a fight to the death? perhaps your human friend would make a suitable challenger.
you find this amusing.
no. call a challenger if you wish. i'll do whatever's necessary.
it's best if you leave.
i may be able to help your mother.
what do you mean?
my father could have her reinstated.
she retired.
she was asked to resign.
why?
"i've said more than i should. if we were to marry, you'd only have to live on vulcan for one year. you could resume your career with starfleet after that."
"is that what you want, an absent wife?"
i'd want you to be happy.
you should go.
how about that?
what?
just to the left of polaris. we found our first m-class planet around that star.
"maybe humans will go back someday, build a colony?"
"i doubt it. the air was filled with a psychotropic compound. after breathing it for a few hours, my senior officers nearly killed each other. maybe the vulcans were right. maybe we weren't ready."
not ready? how long were we supposed to wait?
look what it's gotten us. we almost lost earth.
enterprise saved earth.
"if we weren't out there stirring up trouble, seven million people might still be alive."
you weren't stirring up trouble. you were exploring.
i'm not sure there's much of a difference.
so what do you suggest? put our starships in mothballs?
"no, we need them. but look at the vulcans. they're not explorers. they keep their ships close to home. you never know who's going to come calling."
that's not the mission either one of us signed up for.
"well, maybe you'll feel differently after you've delivered a few dozen eulogies."
it's difficult to meditate with you standing there.
this retirement wasn't your choice.
that's not entirely accurate. i chose to retire rather than face dismissal. i was under investigation by the security ministry. they claimed i had taken restricted data from the academy archives.
did you?
no.
i don't understand.
their accusations were fabricated. i was told that if i left the academy they would end the inquiry.
why would the ministry do this? because of me. they blamed me for the incident at p'jem.
"after the monastery was destroyed, the first minister was dismissed. you've made many enemies here."
"they couldn't reach me on enterprise, so they punished you. it's criminal. how could you let them do this?"
"you've changed. your emotions were always close to the surface, but you managed to suppress them. it's because of this commander tucker, isn't it? he's the reason why you refuse to bond with koss. do you really believe that a human and a vulcan can have a future together? imagine the shame your children would endure, assuming that the two of you could have children."
that wouldn't be your concern.
you all right?
i'm not even sure what all right means anymore.
want to talk about it? there's an old code among climbers. anything that happens on the mountain stays there.
you want to know why i'm out here? i figured this is the last place i'd run into anyone who'd want to shake my hand or take my picture or tell me i'm an inspiration to their children. if they knew what i'd done.
you did what any captain would have done.
does that include torture? or marooning a ship full of innocent people? because i don't remember reading those chapters in the handbook.
"where are you going, jon? are you going to go climbing in the middle of the night?"
why not?
it'd be a shame if you lost your footing. it's a long way down. but at least you wouldn't have to deal with these feelings anymore.
are you telling me i have some kind of a death wish?
you tell me.
what was that?
"something i haven't done in a while. whatever you lost, maybe i could help you find it."
"you know, if we have time when we get back to earth, i'd like to show you some sights, return the favour. everything okay?"
there's something i need to tell you. i've decided to marry koss.
marry him?
"if i join his family, my mother will regain her position at the academy. his father is a senior minister with a great deal of influence."
i don't get it. are they forcing you to do this?
the decision was mine. my mother resigned because of my actions.
"you told me three years ago you didn't even love this guy. so you're just going to leave starfleet, move back to vulcan?"
i've been negotiating with koss's family.
negotiating?
"they've agreed we won't have to reside together, not right away. i'll remain on enterprise for the time being."
that's real generous of them.
"trip, i have to do this for many reasons."
and how am i supposed to take this?
i'm sorry.
you're sorry. you brought me sixteen light years just to watch you get married to someone you barely know.
we should have brought a camera.
you remember that planet i told you about? there was a mountain range on the southern continent. the view was almost as amazing as this.
"that's a good day's climb we've got ahead of us. we can reach the summit by nightfall, but we should get moving."
i think the view is fine from here. i'm glad you tagged along.
"you know, there's still something i'm not quite clear about."
what's that?
why did we stop seeing each other?
"well, i was your superior officer. it wasn't appropriate."
you're not my superior anymore.  i wonder if starfleet would approve? the captains of the only two warp five ships?
you're forgetting the climber's code.
"so, what's the verdict? am i going to live?"
your parasite count is almost negligible. this should dispose of the rest of them.
i hope you're going to make it tonight.
hmm?
madame chang's. don't tell me that you forgot.
my osmotic eel is under the weather. i should stay aboard until she's feeling better.
"wait. no, you've been talking about the egg-drop soup at this place for as long as i've known you."
i'm sure you and ensign mayweather will enjoy it.
i spoke with travis. what happened to you the other night?
"oh, you must mean the, er . nothing more than an instinctive defensive response."
so you're going to stay aboard the ship because of some loudmouth in a bar?
my presence could provoke another incident. someone could get hurt.
this isn't the way to deal with prejudice. the best thing is to show your face and remind people that there are aliens who don't want to blow up the planet.
"i can't blame those men for the way they reacted. earth has survived a horrific attack. it will take time for the trauma to heal. besides, i have friends to keep me company. now, if it's not too much trouble?"
i'll bring you some take-out.
"the details of this debriefing will remain classified, as ordered by the command council."
if there are no further questions?
ambassador. i want to apologise for what i said to you the other day. i was out of line.
"yes, you were."
i'm glad we can finally agree on something.
"captain. your actions, while being morally questionable, were necessary. i opposed your appointment as captain of enterprise, but it's obvious now that i was wrong. t'pol has told me that the expanse would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including vulcan. you've done a great service for both our worlds."
thank you.
come in.
koss and his family are waiting.
i'll be there as soon as i can. know any good tailors?
these clothes belonged to my husband. they fit you well.
aren't you bothered by the fact that t'pol doesn't even care for this guy?
"she's fulfilling her family obligation. i met my husband only once before we were joined. in time, we developed a deep connection to each other."
"yeah. well, maybe she'd rather make a connection with someone else."
have you informed t'pol?
informed her of what?
"you're in love with her. vulcans may not express their emotions, but we are sensitive to them."
"i don't think i knew it until we were standing over that lava field and she told me she was going to marry koss. that's when it hit me. i was going to lose her. i wanted to tell her right there, but i couldn't."
there's still time.
i thought you didn't approve.
"i may not condone your relationship, but it's important for her to have all the facts."
"if i say anything, t'pol might call off the wedding. or worse, not call it off. she's got enough pressure on her as it is. i don't want to make things any more complicated."
you look amazing.
i'm grateful that you're here.
wouldn't miss it for the world.
it's time.
what ye are about to witness comes down from the time of the beginning without change. this is the vulcan heart. this is the vulcan soul. this is our way.
"a transport shuttle, no armaments."
their engines are down. life support failing.
crew?
"two biosigns, human."
tractor beam. send a squad to the docking port.
"move! walk, human!"
contact the high council. inform them of the prisoners. request instructions.
"commander, disruptor fire near the brig."
qi'yah!
you have a visitor.
i'm busy.
"stand up, doctor."
arms.
jonathan archer. what brings you here? they're naming the prison after you?
i need to ask you some questions.
i'm kind of in the middle of something.
it won't take long.
well. i suppose it's not every day one gets to speak to the man who saved the planet. please.  i apologise for the clutter. i'm not allowed traditional recording devices.
you programmed a padd to unlock every security door in the building.
"i was particularly proud of that. i made it all the way to sausalito. on the rare occasion i get stuck on a problem, i find a vigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head.  go ahead. they're dna sequences. that one is for a modification of the human t-cell. it would render sharat syndrome a thing of the past. that one increases the visual spectrum by five percent. of course, none of this will ever be tested. they clear out my room every few months. i'm told it all gets vaporised."
why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever use?
"how can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology that would enhance ability, relieve suffering?"
genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering.
"so did splitting the atom, yet the first ships to colonise the solar system were nuclear-powered. but you're not here to discuss that."
someone attacked a klingon bird of prey. the entire crew was massacred. the ship is missing.
i read the reports. i understand the klingons are quite annoyed. looks like you might've saved earth for nothing.
whoever's responsible jettisoned the klingon crew into space. dna was recovered from the bodies.
let me guess. human?
not quite.
i see.
they were augments. their genetically-enhanced dna matched embryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago. stolen by you.
"soong used to work at cold station 12, a top secret medical research station."
isn't that where starfleet keeps a stockpile of infectious diseases?
along with genetically-engineered embryos left over from the eugenics wars. it's been kept from the public for obvious reasons.
i remember soong's trial. he wouldn't say what he did with the embryos he stole.
"now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the trialus system and raised them. they were around ten years old when he was captured, a decade ago."
so there could be a bunch of augments from the eugenics wars running around loose.
not a pretty thought.
what would they want with a klingon bird of prey?
we don't know. neither does soong. at least he claims he doesn't. but he does think he can convince them to surrender without a fight.
you're bringing him along.
there's also the fact that he spent time in the borderland.
the borderland?
the area where the klingon ship was attacked.
it's a volatile region between the klingon empire and the orion syndicate. it attracts the most dangerous elements from both.
sorry i asked.
the klingons have threatened to retaliate with everything they've got. we're the fastest ship and the most experienced crew. we have to find the augments and bring them back. it's the only way to avert a war. we launch in six hours.
we've mastered their engine controls.
"wing-mounted disruptor cannons, photon torpedo launchers. this ship's an arsenal."
we're finally free.
a fine ship.
i thought you'd be pleased.
"i didn't sanction this attack. if you'd failed, they would've come after all of us."
i didn't fail.
their government knows what we did. they have ships hunting for us right now.
they won't find us. it was time for us to leave this godforsaken planet.
"that was my decision, not yours! you've forgotten who i am? have you?!"
"no, raakin."
say it.
you are our leader.
don't ever make me ask you again. notify me when the rest of our supplies are onboard. we're leaving orbit.
"permission to come aboard, sir?"
"this is my science officer, t'pol."
no need for an introduction. i admire your people very much. we share a similar view of humanity.
what view is that?
that it could stand some improvement.
"i believe that's true of most species, if not all."
"my tactical officer, lieutenant reed."
doctor.
"i've heard of you, but i don't recognise your face. you're not getting your fair share of publicity."
i think i've had all i can stand.
we've prepared some quarters. you'll be under guard at all times. if you should decide you need to clear your head.
we're on a starship soon to be at high warp. where exactly would i go?
it's this way.
"if i could examine the dna samples the klingons recovered, i could tell you something about the current state of the augments."
i'll have the information sent to your quarters.
"a laboratory would be preferable, your sickbay. doctor phlox's reputation rivals my own, before i was imprisoned, of course. i'd enjoy trading notes with him."
i'll consider it.
"so, how was the honeymoon?"
honeymoon?
you were on vulcan another two weeks after i left. i figured
"it comes with everything but its own protein resequencer. for that, i'll need another day."
i like it.
we don't have time to go over all the details. just try not to hit that button.
we're cleared for launch.
here we are again.
wouldn't have it any other way. travis.
i just received an intelligence report. a klingon warship was spotted near proxima colony. admiral forrest thinks they could be conducting reconnaissance for a future strike. i wanted to keep you up to date.
my government is trying to work out a diplomatic solution. there's still a chance they'll be successful.
small chance. one other thing.
"it's your first official day of duty, commander t'pol. a present. it's from the early twentieth century. should help keep you pointed in the right direction."
i'm glad you're with us.
"thank you, captain."
malik. he was the rebellious one. reminded me of myself when i was his age. i came to think of them as my own children.
it must've been difficult for you to leave them behind.
i knew they'd survive.
this is extremely sophisticated work for twentieth century earth.
"well, i made some modifications of my own."
really? what kind of modifications?
i prefer to let my work speak for itself.
i think it already has.
i didn't realise you shared humanity's reactionary attitude toward this field of medicine.
"on the contrary, we've used genetic engineering on denobula for over two centuries, to generally positive effect."
but you don't approve of what i've done.
"you tried to redesign your species. the first time that was attempted on earth, the result was thirty million deaths."
we can't let past mistakes hold us back.
it's your responsibility as a scientist to learn from past mistakes.
"well, what makes you think i haven't?"
i can read.
two vessels are coming up behind us.
orion interceptors.
interesting way of saying hello. hoshi?
no response.
we're getting hammered down here!
keep firing.
i'm picking up an energy surge from one of the interceptors.
a weapon?
no.
tucker to the bridge. two of my people just disappeared.
the interceptors have jumped to warp. they're gone.
"they took nine people, including t'pol."
there never used to be orions in this area. they must've expanded their range of operations. it's a shame. i really liked your science officer.
how do i get them back?
it's not going to be easy.
that's not what i asked you.
they've most likely been taken to a processing station. the nearest one's on verex three.
archer to bridge.
reed.
"set a course for verex three, best possible speed."
"yes, sir."
what'll happen to them there?
"they'll be ushered into their new profession, as slaves. these stations are heavily guarded. only legitimate traders are permitted to enter."
i have the feeling you've found your way in.
"i had to establish a relationship with the orions. they helped me acquire certain goods and equipment i needed to survive. i can get you inside, but i can't get your people out."
one step at a time.
raakin is taking us to another system where we can live out our lives in peace. but i'm sure he's already told you that.
he doesn't tell me everything.
this isn't what our father would've wanted. he didn't raise us to run away and hide.
"well, what do you propose?"
you could try to convince raakin to reconsider.
"he only wants one thing from me, and it isn't advice."
it doesn't suit you.
what?
playing the victim. you chose raakin. you wanted the strongest for yourself.
i still do. what is it you want?
there's plenty of time for that.
"you are now the property of the orion syndicate. break the rules, and you will suffer. follow the rules, and you will suffer less. take her."
ensign.
commander!
are you all right?
"this thing, it hurts."
don't touch it. have you seen anyone else from the ship?
just you. where are we?
an orion slave market.
slave market?
the orions traffic in forced labour. we're being processed for auction.
"this can't be happening. they're going to come for us, right? the ship?"
ensign.
the captain's going to get us out of here!
ensign. i don't know your name.
pierce. jeffrey pierce. i just signed on.
"jeffrey, enterprise will come. it may take some time. we should try to stay together until they get here."
transmit your identification code.
soong hasn't used this code in years.
give it time.
you're cleared to proceed.
phlox. transponder. it has a range of ten kilometres.
"you wander off more than a step or two, we bring you right back here."
"you don't like me, do you, commander tucker?"
"no, i don't."
you probably blame me for what's happened to your vulcan friend.
that's enough.
your crew could use a sense of humour.
"make the engines a priority. when it's time to leave, i have a feeling we're going to need all the speed we can get."
"i've read every transcript of every mission. i thought i was prepared, that i knew what to expect. boy, was i wrong."
"if you wish, i can teach you how to minimise your anxiety."
"yeah, i'd like that. i'd like that a lot."
leave her alone!
"ensign, don't!"
you're doing well.
three million six! not even my last wife sold for that much.
stand up. bring that woman.
over here.
at least we know four of your people are still here. doesn't seem to be much demand for humans.
those devices on their necks.
"neurolytic restraints. ingenious, really. they induce convulsive seizures in disobedient slaves. if a slave attempts to leave the premises."
so if we try to beam them out?
"wouldn't recommend it, not if you want them alive."
they sell their own people?
"only the women. orion females are known for their extreme appetites, their innate skills."
come on.
t'pol. you all right?
how many were taken?
"nine. we've located five, so far. we're working on a way to try and"
she's sold. buyers are over there.
"we made a wrong turn. thank you so much, though. thank you for your help. really, thank you. let's go."
"he argues with every command i give, defies me in front of the others."
"some of them agree with what he did, taking this ship."
they've forgotten how we've stayed alive all these years. my resolve was what kept us from starving to death on that rock.
they believe it's malik who liberated us from that rock.
you agree with them.
how can you say that?
i hear it in your voice.
malik's doing more than arguing with your commands. he's plotting against you. he wants to take your place.
how do you know that?
"he told me. malik's always wanted me. i knew he was planning something, so i let him think i wanted him as well. he said that you're weak, that you're making all of us weak, that you're betraying father's principles, that if father were here, he'd choose malik to lead us."
i will betray father's principles. i'm going to kill my own brother.
"if you don't sell as a slave, i will sell you as food."
"oh, that's barely enough to cover the expense of processing you."
archer to enterprise.
tucker here.
"we've located everyone, including t'pol. i'm going to need six kilos of tritanium cobalt."
nine.
make that nine.
that's half our supply.
i'll explain later. just get it ready.
"yes, sir."
they normally remove the restraint after a sale. we used the extra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leave it on him.
why can't we just buy the rest of our people?
t'pol's already been sold. we don't have time to try and buy them all.
we're almost there. try to hold still.
what kind of people are these?
"i'd say they're not unlike some of your ancestors, judging from your accent."
"well, if i remember my history, these augments you love so much had plenty of slaves."
they were more like subjects.
oh. they were just treated like slaves.
t'pol could be shipped out any second. work fast.
i told him everything. he thinks you're planning an attack against him.
is he going to move against me?
see for yourself. is this the move you expected?
"it's between us. i saved your life once when we were children, pulled you from the river when you fell in."
i remember.
"now, ten years later, you're plotting against me."
i'm the strongest and the smartest.
doesn't look that way from here. you would never have trapped me like this.
but i have.
"i'm sorry, raakin."
it's between us.
"saul, jaya, listen to me."
"they only listen to me now. there was a time when i looked up to you, when i called you my brother."
i am your brother.
"when you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of us, and when that happened, you ceased to exist."
which makes this an act of mercy. get rid of him.
don't. not for him.
we're sending the code now.
got it.
outside. outside!
the restraints are off!
slaves are loose! slaves are loose!
"trip, start beaming them, five at a time."
"sorry, captain. i hope you find your people. thanks for the ride."
you've got spirit. i might just keep you for myself.
i'm not for sale.
"trip, have you got everyone?"
you and soong are the only ones left.
soong got away.
locate him and beam him up.
"soong's transponder signal, it's dead."
can you scan for his biosign?
"we're trying, but there's too many people down there."
help me. don't let them take me.
"trip, two to beam up."
you knew exactly where the orions were operating. you knew they'd abduct members of my crew. maybe you were even hoping they'd get you.
there was an outside chance.
"you were determined to escape, no matter who got hurt."
no one was injured.
nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery. two of them may have permanent physical damage because of the restraints.
i didn't take this action lightly.
is that supposed to justify what you did?
"i'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me to place you and your crew in jeopardy. i respect you, captain."
then tell me how to find the augments. you know where they're going.
they didn't steal a klingon ship to go sightseeing.
they're dangerous.
"they're the future. they're stronger, smarter, free from sickness, with life spans twice as long as our own. you, more than anyone, should appreciate what this means."
why me?
your father suffered from clarke's disease. his final years were marked with extreme pain.
my father has nothing to do with this.
"he didn't need to suffer. genetic engineering could've cured him. those who want to suppress my augments are the same ones who condemned your father to death. turn the ship around, captain. go home. leave them alone."
"i'm going to find them, doctor, whether you help me or not."
you're supposed to be resting.
doctor phlox says i can resume my duties this afternoon.
i'm glad they got that thing off with no problem.
"there's a slight ringing in my left ear, but it should dissipate over time."
"good. well, i'll let you get back to that."
"vulcans don't have honeymoons. after the ceremony, i went to mount seleya to meditate alone."
"it's none of my business, anyway."
"orion interceptors, two of them. coming up fast."
they're hailing us.
this is captain archer of the starship
you've stolen our property!
they were members of my crew. you kidnapped them.
"disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your weapons."
that isn't going to happen.  malcolm.
they're targeting our nacelles.
we're dropping out of warp.
torpedoes.
there's another ship.
the second orion is veering off. they're retreating.
the klingons are requesting to dock.
i know he's on this ship. we received his signal.
"when he tried to escape, i saw him access a console."
you were expecting us. where is he?
in the brig.
in a prison cell? i want to speak with him.
i can't allow that.
we saved your ship.
my ship wouldn't have been in danger if we hadn't come looking for you.
what is it you want with us?
my orders are to take you back to earth.
earth considers my father a criminal. why? because he brought us to life. you want to take us back to a world that opposes our very existence.
you attacked a klingon vessel. they're threatening war.
"that's not our problem. we don't care what happens to you. humanity is no longer relevant. to quote one of your philosophers, nietzsche, mankind is something to be surpassed."
you think he was talking about you?
i'm about to attack you.
"you see? even with a warning, you're not fast enough."
let him go.
let him go.
i'll tear out his throat. lower your weapons. now.
persis.
i've broken their security code. we're ready.
i'll kill him.
persis.
persis?  i can't believe it.
"father, here's malik."
malik.
i knew we'd see each other again. i'm proud of you. of all of you.
"soong, listen to me."
"there's nothing to say, captain."
what should we do with them?
let them go.
but they'll just come after us.
"their ship's disabled. by the time it's repaired, we'll be far away. it's been a pleasure, captain. take my advice. go home and start learning how to speak klingon."
"there were times back on earth when i doubted myself, my work. but seeing you all, i know that everything i've fought for was worth it. we're going to build a new world. but we can't begin that task just yet. thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born. let's go get them."
"some claim humanity rose up against the augments. others say the augments began fighting among themselves. whoever started it, the war devastated earth. millions perished. and when it was over people like you were feared. humans will always fear you. they fear your power, your intellect. they fear you because you're everything they want to be, but can't be. which is why i brought you here, where it's safe. i've raised you like my own. you call me father. but i'm only watching over you. you belong to the future, and someday you will fulfill humanity's promise."
malik.
are there others like us?
"many others, waiting, asleep. and someday, it'll be your duty to wake them, set them free."
we'll have to reach this sublevel. security personnel are located here and here.
a direct hit to this power conduit would demolish their life support systems. all we'd have to do is wait a couple of hours.
no.
but we could walk in unopposed.
we're not going there to take lives.
but what if they don't give us a choice?
no one is to be killed. is that understood?  malik?
"yes. understood, father."
protein resequencer. water purifier.
everything you'd need to keep a small colony of humans alive. looks like this place doubled as a classroom.
imagine having soong as your teacher.
"with that and their screwed up genes, it's no wonder they turned out the way they did."
trip?
interfaces. they look a lot like the ones we have in our sickbay. i'd say they took medical equipment with them.
i need to know exactly what kind. it's important.
i'll see what i can find out.
we'll check out the rest of this place.
i'll be damned.
hold it!
captain!
leave me alone.
we're not going to hurt you.
get out of my way.
we just want to talk. malcolm.
see? we're friends.
who are you?
i'm captain jonathan archer. we're from earth.
"this was raakin's. i gave it to him when he was five. he was a good student. he loved astronomy. we'd sit at night, and i'd point out the stars. he could name every one. where's your brother, malik?"
i don't know what you've been told.
no one will say anything. i only know he's not here.
he's dead.
tell me what happened.
he turned his back on your word. he didn't want to liberate the others.
what happened to him?
"i killed him. we were arguing. he pulled out a knife. i drew mine, he came at me. the next thing i remember there was blood everywhere.  it was an accident. i tried to save him, i tried."
he was your brother!
"i'm sorry. father. i didn't mean to hurt him, i'm sorry."
"malik, it's my fault. i left you alone."
no.
i should have stayed with you. you were just children.
"no, father."
"shh. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry, malik. i'm sorry."
"he's dehydrated, suffering from slight malnutrition, but otherwise, he's in good condition."
"for an augment, he didn't put up much of a fight."
"he isn't an augment. he's an anomaly. his dna is similar to the others, but not identical. he was born with none of their enhanced abilities."
how's the jaw?
it hurts.
"i'm sorry about that, but you didn't give me much choice. i told you my name."
"my real name's udar, but my brothers and sisters call me smike."
that's an unusual nickname.
it's from nicholas nickleby.
his handicapped friend. is that why you were left behind? because you're different?
i would've slowed them down.
udar.
smike.
"i need to find out where they went, the others."
i'm not telling you anything.
i'm trying to help them.
"you're from earth. you don't want to help them, you want to kill them."
that's not true.
i won't betray my brothers and sisters.
your brothers and sisters are in danger. they attacked a klingon ship. if the klingons find them before we do.
"then more klingons will die. you'll never stop them, captain. no one will."
tucker to captain archer.
"go ahead, trip."
the missing equipment? they were incubators.
artificial wombs.
he's different than i remember.
how?
the man who raised us would never risk our lives to protect a human.
he knows the station. he used to work there. he knows what he's doing.
we'll find out.
you shouldn't doubt him.
why not?
he's our father.
he's human.
he's not like other humans.
i used to believe that.
"you were leading us before, and now he is. you can't accept that."
why shouldn't i lead? augments should be led by augments.
i won't listen to this.
let me go.
don't be angry with me. i'm just thinking out loud.
i don't like what you're thinking.
then i'll stop. stay with me.
i think soong is headed to cold station twelve.
isn't that where he used to work?
it's a medical facility run by starfleet and the denobulans. highly virulent diseases are stockpiled there for research purposes.
it's the embryos from the eugenics wars that soong's after.
i thought soong stole the embryos.
"he took nineteen, but there are over eighteen hundred more."
that's why he took the incubators with him.
why weren't these embryos destroyed after the war?
"at the time, it was too controversial. earth's governments couldn't decide how to handle the issue, so they put them into cold storage. i just got off with admiral forrest. we've been authorised to use whatever force necessary to stop soong. i need all the speed you can give me."
you'll have it.
"this is cargo ship corsair. repeat, medical emergency. situation is critical."
"corsair, this is barzai, a denobulan medical ship. what's the nature of your emergency?"
reactor leak. ten crewmen exposed to delta radiation.
i have a fix. i'm about six minutes away from you.
"barzai, stand down and prepare to be boarded."
how's the patient?
he's doing fine. ready to be discharged.
good. i just reviewed the crew manifest for c-12. one of the names is doctor jeremy lucas. he's senior medical director.
"in his last correspondence, he mentioned he was being transferred. he didn't say where."
i thought you should know.
"i appreciate it. captain, i spent a few months at c-12 myself. i know the security protocols, i'm familiar with the technology. i'd like to be included in the landing party."
consider it done.
thank you.
phlox tells me he's ready to free up this biobed.
so i've been told.
"if you've had enough sickbay food, i'd like you to join me in the captain's mess."
do i have a choice?
no. see you in an hour.
"cold station twelve, this is medical ship barzai, transmitting security code."
"barzai, we are currently on heightened alert. slow to one-quarter impulse and transmit security code."
transmitting.
code confirmed. you're clear to proceed.
why are you flying a denobulan shuttle?
why not?
you aren't denobulan.
that's true.
we don't have enough masks.
you don't need masks.
doctor lucas.
i asked you never to bother me when i'm watching a viropathic cytolysis.
our defence protocols just came on.
did you contact security?
i can't reach them. the comm.'s down.
the system's been taken offline.
doctor.
what the hell? ?
phlox tells me you'd been living on your own for quite a while.
i left the camp about a year ago.
you must be pretty resourceful to survive by yourself out there.
it wasn't that hard.
"didn't look like a very friendly planet. when you get back to earth, you should consider going to school."
school?
you've got a lot of catching up to do.
how can i go to school if i'm in prison?
what makes you think you're going to prison?
i'm an augment.
i don't know what you've been told about earth. you're not going to be punished.
that's not what my father said.
soong is not your father.
what do you mean?
your biological father was miklos karlovassi. he was a geophysicist.
how do you know that?
"we got the information from soong's computer. your mother's name was irina. she was an athlete, decathlon. won a silver medal in the olympics. we've got a lot of historical data on both your parents. you're welcome to look at it."
coffee.
i'm approaching a new sleep cycle.
when does your hibernation begin?
"not for another few weeks, but i would like to increase my body mass by at least ten percent. to tell you the truth, i'm not very hungry."
you're worried about doctor lucas?
we've been friends a very long time.
"we're getting there as fast as we can, phlox."
you might be interested to know smike's become quite the student of earth history. he's been reading up on the eugenics wars.
i doubt soong gave him the whole story.
i'm quite familiar with the subject myself. human intellect and human instinct were out of sync. so many people were killed.
the official number was thirty million. some historians say it was closer to thirty five.
i can understand why earth banned genetic engineering.
what do you know about clarke's syndrome?
it's a degenerative brain disorder that afflicts humans.
my father died of it when i was twelve.
i'm sorry.
"he had frequent pain, hallucinations, he talked to people who weren't there. often couldn't recognise me or my mother. the last two years of his life"
and you were thinking if genetic engineering had been permitted
maybe soong has a point.
i've had time to examine his work more closely. i'm forced to admit some of it is extremely inventive. he's really quite brilliant. it's a shame such a man has to remain incarcerated.
"he broke the law. that's why he was in prison. and that's why i'm going to make sure he goes back. denobula perfected genetic engineering a long time ago, but you never came close to destroying yourselves."
perhaps we were simply fortunate.
or maybe your instincts had caught up with your intellect. food's getting cold.
i don't have the code.
"when i was senior medical director, i had access to those embryos."
they changed the policy after what you did. the access code can only be obtained through starfleet command.
he's lying.
i'm telling the truth.
do the lights in your office flicker every now and then?
every two hours. drives me crazy.
"faulty power relay. you wouldn't believe how many times i asked them to fix it. ten years later, they still haven't done a thing. put him with the others."
father.
i believe him.
tell me.
"it's a hexadecimal password. i'm creating an algorithm to compute the possible combinations, a few hundred thousand of them. it may take a few minutes."
i can't believe i held you back in math.
a ship's entering the system.
range twenty million kilometers.
any sign of the bird-of-prey?
none. it could be hiding behind any one of the larger asteroids.
we're being hailed.
put it up.
captain. i wish i could say it's been a long time.
"this only ends one way, doctor."
"i think you've underestimated the variables, about eleven of them."
no one will be harmed if you leave this system immediately.
i'm betting you're not a cold-blooded killer.
turn your ship around. now.
i want proof that the hostages are unharmed. let me speak to lucas.
go ahead.
we're all right. no one's been hurt.
that's about to change. you're still approaching this station.
do you have any idea what a klingon disruptor will do to a human skull at this range?
you're going to leave me with an awful mess to clean up.
doctor.
conversation's over. he dies.
all stop.
now turn around.
bring us about.
that's a good captain.
there's another layer of encryption. it appears to be on a quantum level.
how long?
"longer than i thought, maybe a lot longer."
keep working.
"he lied. doctor lucas, about the embryos. station access log."
get him in here.
"i've modulated the transporter frequency to match the station's containment field. if you register at all on their sensors, it'll look like a field echo."
do you really think i can help?
"if i didn't, i wouldn't have asked you to come along."
captain. we're nearly out of transporter range.
energise.
"malik. malik! i want to put an end to this, doctor."
so do i.
we know you can get to the embryos. you accessed the stasis chamber just last week.
that's a mistake in the log.
"i implore you. give us what we came for, and we'll leave you in peace."
what's that?
that language is unbecoming of a man of science.
father.
some men are braver with their own lives than they are with the lives of others.
bring in one of his colleagues.
"no, not here. in there."
there are thousands of pathogens stored here. some kill within minutes.
no.
"the longer we're in this facility, the greater the chance that more ships will come and they might not back down like enterprise."
it isn't necessary.
it's the only way to make him talk. is one human being worth all our lives and everything you've worked for?
"if that's what it takes to stun them, what have you got to do to kill them?"
are you familiar with symbalene blood burn? the vascular lining literally boils away.
you son of a bitch.
"actually, mother was a chemist."
you can't do this.
"believe me, i don't want to, but i'm out of options, doctor. the code! this is on your conscience, then, not mine."
life support runs through this relay.
how long before they run out of air in the control hub?
"half an hour. they should start feeling the effects within ten, fifteen minutes."
we're not talking about normal human beings here.
even an augment needs oxygen.
"his temperature's rising quickly. blood pressure's approaching critical. there's still time, doctor."
"just say the word, i'll release the antipathogen."
there's fluctuation in the life support relay on level four.
go.
"right about now, his extremities feel like they're on fire. but it's the capillaries, starting to burst. watch."
please! let me out!
"i'm asking you, one doctor to another. stop this."
i can't.
is it worth this man's life?
i have orders.
i can save him! how can you let this happen?
how can you?
tell me the code! the code!
go to hell!
release the antipathogen.
father?
do it!
no!
that should do it.
smike?
"doctor phlox missed something when he examined me, captain. i do have one enhanced ability. i can hear like they do. they're coming."
"he's wrong, captain. we're already here."
there was a spike. then the signal was gone.
sounds like what happens when a communicator goes down.
to prevent us from getting a transporter fix.
they've been captured.
it's a logical conclusion.
we have to make sure.
agreed.
jeremy.
phlox. what are you doing here?
don't move.
it's good to see you again.
am i going to spend the rest of my life trying to get rid of you?
you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
udar?
father.
"how is this  they told me you were dead, that you were sick."
they lied to you.
it was raakin's order.
what was?
banishment.
why?
he wasn't strong enough.
you all went along with this?
why are you so surprised? whenever a group of people start believing they're better than everyone else the results are always the same.
i don't need a history lesson from you.
you need it from someone.
it's enterprise.
we have your people. i asked you not to interfere.
"now,"
t'pol! execute your orders!
end transmission. bring up the data file.
"enterprise. enterprise, come in."
they cut us off.
what are these orders?
to initiate the station's self-destruct sequence.
"in a few seconds, this place will be dust."
"you'd kill us all, rather than let the embryos be born."
"it wasn't my idea. the orders came from starfleet, but after seeing this i can't say i disagree."
we were defending our right to exist.
you've already killed over twenty five people. your existence has a pretty high price.
it could get higher.
the sequence is coming up.
t'pol?
proceed.
transmitting. ten seconds to auto-destruct.
it's some kind of feedback pulse. it's the signal we sent. it's being amplified a thousand percent. comm.'s dead.
the station's still there. it's safe to say we're going to need another plan.
we'll destroy it ourselves.
that thing's buried inside an asteroid.
"it's not the preferred solution, but it's all we have. load photonic torpedoes. mister mayweather?"
course set.
take us in.
looks like this place isn't turning to dust. sorry to disappoint you.
"they're friends. i heard them talking.  is this true, doctor? let's find out."
no!
leave him alone!
malik.
"you'll tell us what we want to hear, or you'll watch him die, too."
five thousand kilometres.
lock weapons.
starboard nacelle.
return fire.
stop. stop!
no. no. i'll give it to you. don't kill him! i'll give it to you!
input the code.
the stasis chamber is opening. it worked.
get him out of there.
you come with us.
i'm going to stay.
"i understand. i hope you have a long, happy life."
"you too, father."
"they fire, then move off."
they're trying to draw us away from the station.
"a few more like that, we're going to be a part of this asteroid field."
hold your course. target the facility.
they're beautiful.
"i came here so many times just to look at them. i remember where each of you was kept. you were there right next to saul. persis, yavar. it was so hard to choose nineteen out of so many."
father?
i never thought i'd see this sight again.
we have to hurry.
telurian plague. i like the sound of that.
what are you doing?
identifying the most dangerous pathogens.
you're taking them with us.
"can't hurt to have a little insurance. they've been transferred to the stasis modules. take two people with you, load them onto the shuttle."
get them in the containment cell.
i wasn't sure how i'd justify killing you. now you've given me the perfect excuse.
whatever i can do to help.
"hold onto that. you're a competent fighter, but that isn't good enough."
"i wish i had time to continue our little match. i'm enjoying it. but this will be almost as satisfying. five minutes after we leave, every stasis field in this station will shut down, releasing hundreds of pathogens. i wonder which one will kill you first."
stick around and find out.
"i like you, captain. i can't allow my brother to die in such a way. this will be much less painful."
smike.
they're launching a shuttle.
the bird-of-prey's moving to intercept.
who's on the shuttle?
augments and one human.
soong. fire torpedoes.
they've launched a torpedo.
maximum thrusters.
four minutes to containment breach. there's no way to stop it from here.
somewhere else?
the primary junction.
where is it?
containment breach in forty seconds.
he's almost there.
i'm at the primary junction!
you have to divert the secondary relays.
the panel to the left.
i see them.
twenty seconds.
he's isolated this room. the pathogens can't reach us.
what about the captain?
"the ventilation grid is going to carry the pathogens through the rest of the station, including the central core."
how long do i have?
less than a minute.
archer to t'pol
go ahead.
can you get
a transporter lock on me?
there's too much interference from the core.
you'll have to get farther away.
arm the phase-cannons. target exterior hatch
j nine.
"captain, the core will decompress."
that's the idea. stand by on the transporter. you'll only have a few seconds.
acknowledged.
warning. pathogens detected in the central core.
t'pol!
we're ready.
fire!
"commander, do you have him?"
"yeah, we need a medic down here."
we've crossed into klingon space.
where's enterprise?
they're holding position.
archer's not foolish enough to follow us.
we won't be seeing archer again.
what are you saying?
he's dead.
no one was to be killed without my express order!
"i had no choice. he attacked us, tried to escape."
"if you disobey me again, i'll lock you in the targ pit. you won't see the light of day for a month. do i make myself clear?"
"yes, father."
what's our speed?
holding at warp three point eight.
not fast enough. the port inducer assembly's been damaged. go to engineering and repair it.
i'm not an engineer.
"you're a bright boy, malik. i'm sure you'll figure it out."
"first officer's log, supplemental. we've evacuated the away team and all personnel from the station. the captain shows no sign of infection. he's recovering in sickbay."
they crossed the klingon border approximately two hours ago.
soong's not even bothering to cover his tracks.
he knows the klingons will intercept us if we follow him. they have half a dozen patrols in the area.
is there something we can do to keep us from showing up on their sensors?
i could paint a bird-of-prey on the hull.
perhaps we could fake a klingon warp signature.
"i'd have to reconfigure the coil assembly. it would take a few hours, but it should be doable."
what's the status of c-12?
doctor lucas and his team would like to return and begin decontamination procedures.
that's quite a mess they've got to clean up.
he estimates it will take more than a year.
"once we're safely through klingon space, we'll set a course for these coordinates. the klingons call it klach d'kel brakt. i call it the briar patch. it's a little catchier, don't you think?"
briar patch?
you should have read more of the books i left for you. the region is flooded with radiation from supernova remnants. the klingons have never mapped it. there are signs of at least two habitable planets inside the briar patch. it's unlikely anyone will find us.
this is your plan? to hide again?
the embryos need to mature in a safe environment.
starfleet isn't going to give up so easily. they'll send other ships. this gas cloud won't protect us.
all right. what course would you set?
i'm not certain. but i know that running away isn't the answer. are you familiar with the name botany bay?
it's a penal colony on the shores of australia.
"it's also the name of a pre-warp vessel launched at the end of the great wars. the ship carried many of our brethren, including khan noonien singh."
botany bay is a myth. there's no evidence it ever existed.
all records of the launch were destroyed. they didn't want to be followed.
"even if you're right, the ship was lost, never to be heard from again."
"that's exactly my point. khan was a great leader, but he made one fatal mistake. he ran from his enemies rather than face them. we've spent our entire lives running and hiding. when are we going to make a stand?"
the matter is not open for debate. alter our heading. set a course one eight four mark three. we're going to the briar patch. i'll be in my lab.
i wasn't aware the doctor discharged you.
he didn't. what's our status?
holding position near the klingon border.
bridge to engineering.
are we ready?
"understood. tactical alert. take us in, travis. warp four."
"come in, malik."
you asked for me?
you have to stop challenging my authority in front of the others.
can't a son disagree with his father? i thought we were family.
i'm willing to overlook the things you've done. but you have to trust that what i'm doing is best for all of us. you used to have faith in me.
i was a child. i didn't know any better.
i know it wasn't easy after i left.
how are the embryos?
i'll be ready to incubate the first of them in a few hours.
you're manipulating its dna.
"these base-pairs sequences regulate the neurotransmitter levels in their brain. if i can modify them, aggression and violent behaviour will be removed."
you're changing its personality.
i'm correcting a defect in its genome. genetic engineering was in its infancy when you were created. they weren't able to repair all the mistakes.
did you fix these mistakes in the rest of us?
i didn't know how until recently.
what right do you have to tamper with their genome?
trust me. i know what i'm doing.
you don't know that this is a defect. maybe this is the way our creators wanted us to be.
"father, you're needed on the bridge."
there's a ship approaching at high warp.
have you identified it?
it appears to be klingon.
let's see them.
this ship has minimal aft weapons.
increase speed.
arm torpedoes. open a channel. this is captain archer.
drop out of warp or we'll disable you.
he sounds pretty confident for a dead man. aft torpedoes. target their propulsion systems.
forward plating's holding.
return fire.
aft shields at fifty percent
we should engage them.
they outgun us three to one.
father!
the denobulan pilot. put her aboard the shuttle. go!
scan for any planets along our flight path.
their warp field's fluctuating.
concentrate all fire on their engines.
they've altered course. they're heading for a planetary system.
we've reached the coordinates.
take us out of warp.
they're moving into a low orbit.
they're opening their shuttlebay doors.
hold your fire. magnify.
bio-signs on the shuttle?
one. denobulan.
can you get a transporter lock?
the atmosphere is too dense.
we're being hailed. it's soong.
murdering hostages is turning into a new hobby for you.
no one's been
"killed, captain. that ship is caught between two thermal layers. it should be relatively safe for four or five hours. enough time for you to mount a rescue mission."
"this isn't over, doctor."
"good-bye, captain."
he's gone to warp.
disconnect that circuit before you power the relay. you might damage it.
warp trail's been dispersed. enterprise won't be able to follow us.
excellent work.
there's something else we need.  father! i need to speak with you.
what is it?
we've underestimated them. starfleet isn't going to stop until they find us.
"and what do you suggest we do, turn ourselves in?"
"before we left c-12, i beamed aboard two dozen canisters of biogenic agents."
you did what?!
we can modify a torpedo to carry the pathogens.
a single torpedo would never make it through their hull plating.
"i wasn't talking about the enterprise. we use it against the klingons. the qu'vat colony is less than four light-years away. if we detonate the torpedo inside the upper atmosphere, it'll scatter the pathogen across the entire planet. every organism on the surface will be dead within days. when the high council hears that humans have decimated their colony, they'll launch a counterstrike. the klingons will keep starfleet busy for years."
what you're proposing is mass murder.
there is no other choice. how long will it be before starfleet turns to the klingons for help in finding us? this is the only way to guarantee our survival.
go back to the bridge.
what happened to you in prison? you're not the man who raised us. the man who was willing to do whatever was necessary.
return to your station.
target the directional array on grid four five nine. how are your parents?
"they're fine. they moved into a new house in mississippi. it's not like the old place in panama city, but it's pretty nice. why do you ask?"
"you haven't spoken of them recently. in fact, you've said very little since i returned from vulcan."
there hasn't been a lot of time to catch up.
you also haven't joined us at the captain's table since we left earth.
what are you trying to say?
you've been avoiding me.
"well, maybe i have. but you got to admit, it's a little awkward. i mean, you're married. i know you did it to help your mother, but it's going to take me a little time to adjust."
i'm still adjusting to it myself.
"this is going to sound strange, but as tough as it was watching you go through with the ceremony, i was proud of you for what you did. yeah, i guess it's probably for the best."
what do you mean?
come on. it's not like we would have made an ideal couple. a vulcan and a human? romeo and juliet probably stood a better chance.
subspace distortion. zero point four light years.
there's no sign of a warp trail.
they might have concealed their engine emissions.
engineering to bridge.
go ahead.
"i think we've found him, captain."
you don't sound a hundred percent sure.
it's the best we've got.
"send the coordinates to mister mayweather. lay in a pursuit course, maximum warp."
"i don't have a lot of time. the aft launcher's still offline, and father wants me to"
you won't have to answer to him any longer. i'm taking command.
you can't.
"i've already spoken with everyone on the bridge. they're behind me, but i need to know where you stand. you helped me before."
that was different. this is our father.
"he may have raised us, but that doesn't make him our father. he'll never be one of us."
don't do this to him.
"he's given me no choice. i have a plan to protect us from starfleet and the klingons, and he won't even consider it. you know what he's doing with the embryos? he's altering their genome. making them weak and docile, like ordinary humans."
that's not true.
"go to his lab, talk to him yourself. i know how much he means to you. i have feelings for him, too. he'll be treated with respect. you have my word. are you with me?"
"father, please come with us."
persis? four of you to subdue me?
the crew is united behind me.
is that so? there's no time for this. you all have work to do.
don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
"and if i refuse, are you going to kill me?"
no one else has to die.
what about the millions you plan to kill with that bioweapon?
"please, father. there's no other way."
lock him in his quarters.
"a klingon battle cruiser, point three light years away. they're on an intercept course."
archer to engineering.
is there a problem with the camouflage?
not that i can see.
our klingon warp signature's holding steady.
they'll be in visual range in less than two minutes.
universal translator. did you update the database?
it's been programmed with seven klingon dialects.
"let's hope this guy speaks one of them. open a channel. attention, cruiser. if you come any closer to my ship, you'll be fired upon."
who is this?
my name isn't your concern.
you've entered restricted space. drop out of warp and prepare for inspection.
the last time i checked this was still klingon territory.
"no ship is allowed to pass through this system without authorisation, on the orders of governor klag."
i don't take orders from a mere governor. we're on important business for the high council.
what sort of business?
that matter is classified.
i'm not detecting a council transponder signal. perhaps you forgot to activate it.
you expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship in the area know that we have the chancellor on board?
chancellor m'rek is on your ship?
he had important negotiations with the orions. we're taking him back to kronos.
"the orions.  i've heard rumours of his negotiations with their females. tell me, is it true what they say about them?"
"if i were you, i wouldn't be making allegations about chancellor m'rek over an unsecure channel."
i meant no insult.
"i'm sure you didn't. it would be best if you made no mention of this to your superiors, or you might find yourself commanding a garbage scow."
understood. we're honoured to have the chancellor in our system. qapla'.
qapla'.
they're altering course.
don't tell me it's visiting hour.
"i'm sorry, father. if i didn't go along with him, he would've killed me."
"you did the right thing. if he deploys that weapon, he'll be confirming everything they've said about augments for the last hundred and fifty years. they'll destroy all of you. you have to help me stop him. we can sabotage the engines or the torpedo launchers."
"no, we'll never get to them. malik's posted guards at every vital system."
you have to get me off the ship.
i've disabled the internal sensors. it should be some time before anyone notices one of the escape pods is missing.
"be careful, he might suspect you."
what is it?
an automated beacon. it's very faint. it could be a distress signal.
can you get a fix on it?
captain. what took you so long?
you have to alter your
you have to alter your course.
is that so?
my children. the augments are planning to attack a klingon colony.
what were you doing in that escape pod?
"what do you think? i was waiting for you. you're the only one who can stop them! i didn't come back because i missed our lively debates. please, please, you have to do as i ask."
your story doesn't sound very plausible. i think we were getting close to finding your augments. you may have put yourself into that escape pod to throw us off.
you're not serious.
"you've made it clear you'll do anything for them. lie, murder, maybe even sacrifice yourself."
"if the klingons retaliate against earth, it'll make the xindi incident look like a lovers' quarrel. archer: what do you care what happens to earth? you believe your children are the future of humanity."
"captain. captain, contact c-12! three hundred kilograms of biotoxins are missing from their inventory."
doctor lucas already told me about the missing toxins.
malik stole them without my knowledge. he's going to use them on the colony. you saw what he did on the station. you know what he's capable of.
you didn't know? you had to see him murder someone in front of you.
"what do you want me to say? that you were right about them, and i was wrong? maybe things would have been different if i'd been there for them, if starfleet hadn't locked me away."
none of that would have mattered in the end. it's in their nature. they were engineered to be this way. superior ability breeds superior ambition. one of their creators wrote that. he was murdered by an augment.
work with soong. he'll show you how to scan for their warp trail. i want to intercept them before they reach the colony.
he may be leading us into a trap.
i believe him.
that planet's over three light years away. we're going to have to push the engines pretty hard to get there in time.
is that a problem?
"at that speed, our phony warp signature might not fool the klingons."
do what you have to do.
you've been quiet.
soong didn't get off this ship without help. the sensor grid wasn't damaged in the attack. someone took it offline to cover his escape.
maybe he disabled it.
he would've needed the security codes. i never gave them to him.
"if father didn't do it, then who?"
can you think of anyone?
lokesh didn't seem that enthusiastic about your plan to attack the klingons.
"he's been in the weapons bay for a day and a half, modifying the torpedo. maybe i should torture him, just to make sure. what do you think? only four of us have the codes. of those four, you and i are the only ones who weren't on the bridge when soong escaped."
you think i did it.
your heart's beating faster. perhaps it's trying to tell me something.
are you going to use that on me?
if i have to.
you shouldn't have done that.
i'll miss you.
how long can we sustain warp five?
"as long as the captain wants it. or until we blow up, whichever comes first."
adjust the scanning frequency fifteen megahertz.  sorry about that business with the orions. hope you weren't permanently injured.
why don't you stay focused on what you're doing?
someone's a little protective of commander t'pol.
i just don't like you very much.
is that them?
"it is a ship, but it's not the bird-of-prey. captain archer to the bridge."
it's a klingon vessel. they're on an intercept course.
it's a lot bigger than the last one. this one's a d5 class battle cruiser.
how long until we're in visual range?
two minutes.
"same as before, hoshi."
they're hailing us.
"earth vessel, surrender and prepare to be boarded!"
aft plating is failing.
"hail them again.  if we don't reach the colony before that bird-of-prey, millions of your people will be killed."
i am not detecting any other ships. perhaps you plan to attack the colony!
"captain, if i may.  captain archer and his crew are honourable people. let them continue on their way."
i tried.
we may be able to surprise them with a torpedo if we drop to impulse.
"i wouldn't recommend that, captain. their sensors are far superior. they'll detect it."
they're targeting our reactor.
power down weapons. stand by to deploy the grappler. take us out of warp.
they've dropped to impulse.
malcolm?
"two more seconds, captain."
"on my mark, travis."
they're closing. they're extending their docking port.
malcolm?
"ready, sir."
full impulse.
they're targeting the grappler.
hold your speed.
the shearing force is approaching critical.
we're losing the grappler.
hold your speed.
they can't create a warp field. they're disabled.
"resume course for the colony, maximum speed."
"there are three population centres. two here, and another on the northern continent."
we'll detonate the torpedo over the southern hemisphere. that'll ensure the maximum number of casualties. what's the weapon's status?
"we've modified the warhead, but we need to test the guidance protocols before we can"
there's a ship on an intercept course.
the enterprise. increase to maximum speed. load the torpedo. stand by to fire as soon as we drop out of warp.
but the guidance protocols?
do as i say!
they've detected us. they're accelerating.
"stay with them, travis."
tucker to bridge.
"if we go any faster, the nacelles are going to fly off the pylons."
long until we're in weapons range?
"two minutes, but the bird-of-prey will reach the colony in seventy three seconds."
trip.
i heard. i'll give you what i can.
how much longer?
guidance is still offline. we'll need to get closer.
take us into low orbit.
they're preparing to fire.
travis.
another fifteen seconds.
take us out of warp as close as you can.
weapons are standing by.
ten seconds.
torpedo's ready.
fire.
they've launched the weapon. it will reach the atmosphere in twelve seconds.
malcolm.
hard about.
"a direct hit to the armoury. we've lost hull plating, torpedo launchers."
what about phase-cannons?
"the aft cannon's online, just barely."
lock onto their bridge.
"no, no, no!"
"stand aside, doctor!"
their bridge is protected with dispersive armour. your weapons will never penetrate it. target your cannons here.
behind their sensor array.
what good will that do?
their main plasma junction's located there. a direct hit would disable their entire power grid. trust me.
do what he says. fire when ready.
they're disabled.
are they still alive?
i'm reading twelve biosigns.
"captain, there's a power surge in their reactor."
he's overloading his dilithium matrix. he'll destroy their ship.
let me talk to him.
"malik. malik, it's father."
don't do this. some of your brothers and sisters are still alive.
would you rather they go to prison with you?
the embryos.
there's no place for us on earth or anywhere else.
better to die here.
"please, please, please!"
i'll see you soon.
malik!
sir.
i'll contact starfleet on your behalf. let them know that you helped us.
"i can't believe they're gone. all of them. uh, we're heading the wrong way."
you're not going to the brig. i'm taking you to crew quarters.
you're alive.
"you betrayed us all! goodbye, father."
"you could at least let me finish my work, before you take it away and destroy it."
"no one's destroyed anything. it's being stored in a secure location. maybe someday, we'll figure out how to use it to benefit humanity."
i wouldn't count on it.
i've been thinking. perfecting humanity may not be possible. cybernetics. artificial lifeforms.
"good-bye, doctor."
i doubt i'll finish the work myself. might take a generation or two.
surak.
"admiral, the high command will tell you its decision at the proper time."
"after all we've been through, i'd rather hear the good news from you."
the high command hasn't included me in their discussions.
they're not telling their own ambassador to earth what they're planning? welcome to the club.
"admiral, i know you find our reluctance to share technology and discoveries restrictive."
i can think of a few stronger words than that.
"we don't know what to do about humans. of all the species we've made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. you have the arrogance of andorians, the stubborn pride of tellarites. one moment, you're as driven by your emotions as klingons, and the next, you confound us by suddenly embracing logic."
i'm sure those qualities are found in every species.
not in such confusing abundance.
ambassador. are vulcans afraid of humans? why?
because there is one species you remind us of.
vulcans.
"we had our wars, admiral, just as humans did. our planet was devastated, our civilisation nearly destroyed. logic saved us. but it took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and travel to the stars. you humans did the same in less than a century. there are those on the high command who wonder what humans would achieve in the century to come, and they don't like the answer."
we're not the klingons. we only want to be your partners. to do what the nations of earth have learned to do. to work together in common cause.
"unfortunately, the future of relations between our worlds is not mine to control."
captain!
here!
that's another game. twenty one to two.
"time to switch sides again, doctor."
certainly. this is a most enjoyable sport. reminiscent of octran fertility contests.
"captain, i've just spoken with starfleet command."
"except we're fully clothed, which is probably for the best."
"i'm sorry to keep you from your family, but i'm going to need you on the investigation full-time."
that's where i prefer to be.
your mother and husband will understand?
"my mother hasn't responded to my communiqués. it's not unusual for her to become lost in her work. as for my husband, our arrangement remains unchanged."
"captain jonathan archer, i regret we meet under such tragic circumstances."
i'd like to introduce administrator v'las.
administrator. i wasn't told to expect the head of the high command.
"captain archer, all of vulcan grieves with you today."
"twelve vulcans died in the blast, ambassador."
"to that end, this is stel, chief investigator of our security directorate."
"captain, we now have suspects."
andorians? why would they attack our embassy?
to create conflict between earth and vulcan.
they do consider us allies who stand against them.
"so far, we've done our best to remain neutral, and the andorians know that. they have nothing to gain by attacking us."
you have other suspects?
syrrannites.
i've never heard of that species.
"actually, they're a small group of vulcans. they follow a corrupted form of surak's teachings."
surak i've heard of. he's the father of vulcan logic.
"even after eighteen hundred years, we consider him the most important vulcan who ever lived."
so why would these syrrannites want to attack our embassy? it's hardly an act of logic.
"they've been vocal about their opposition to government, but always peaceful."
"over the past year their leader, a dissident named syrran, has become a dangerous zealot."
"captain, i trust you to keep this matter confidential. we don't share it lightly. but recently, on our world, there have been instances of violence against non-vulcans. though we have no conclusive proof, there are signs that syrrannites might be responsible."
is there any evidence connecting syrrannites to the bombing?
your embassy is officially considered to be on earth soil. we've preserved the site for you to investigate.
"if evidence is there, the chief investigator and i feel confident you'll find it."
i intend to.
"lieutenant, here's the junction room."
schematics say the secondary security bank's right in there.
still in one piece.
there's a weak power signature under this mess.
"it's probably an emergency light running on batteries. well, there's something here. some kind of surveillance recorder."
lieutenant.
"the timer might be broken, but that bomb's armed. don't move. the slightest vibration might set it off. reed to enterprise. i need an emergency transporter lock. two to beam up on my mark."
acknowledged.
why not beam the bomb out of here?
"if there's a gravity switch, it'll detonate in the matter stream."
enterprise to reed. the transporter's locked. do you need assistance?
"negative, enterprise. stand by."
i'm going to attempt to scan it.
attempt?
"yeah. if i had designed that bomb, i'd rig it to go off the instant a sensor beam made contact. look on the bright side. if it detonates, we'll never know. steady. there's vulcan dna on these controls. so much for blaming andorians. boosting scan resolution."
that can't be good.
"oh, damn. enterprise, mark. enterprise!"
"according to the vulcan genome registry, the dna on the bomb's controls was left by this woman. t'pau."
"since you had her dna on record, does that mean she's been arrested before?"
the registry records dna from all vulcans at birth.
do you know anything about her?
t'pau is a well-known syrrannite.
all right. we've got a solid start. now we need to find her.
"captain, t'pau is vulcan. the security directorate will take charge of the investigation."
of course. vulcan sovereignty. lieutenant reed and commander t'pol will work with you.
their assistance isn't required.
chief investigator. forty three people died in the bombing. twelve vulcans and thirty one humans. we want her as much as you do.
this is now a vulcan security operation. we'll inform ambassador soval of any developments that concern you.
his death is a loss to both our worlds.
"if you're lost, ambassador, i can direct you to your shuttle."
he saved my life in the explosion. he could have saved himself.
he always put the mission first.
"the last time we spoke, he was anticipating the prospect of joint missions. humans and vulcans working together."
"we have to make that possible, despite the high command."
it makes no sense to think the syrrannites are responsible for this outrage.
we have dna evidence.
"recheck everything, captain, question everything, and don't let them keep you on enterprise. the answers you need are on vulcan, and however far you have to take this investigation, you have my support."
enter.
it is agreeable to see you.
what is the purpose of your visit?
does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife?
your message was cryptic.
by necessity. the syrrannite threat has brought new security measures into effect. private communications are no longer private.
you have something to tell me that the authorities shouldn't hear?
"something to give you. your mother asked me to deliver it personally. she told me that it's been in your family for generations, and now it's your turn to care for it."
why didn't she give this to me herself?
the new security conditions. they've forced your mother into hiding to avoid arrest.
my mother?
she's a syrrannite.
a syrrannite? and she never told you?
what's important is that she's disappeared like the others facing unjustified arrest.
like t'pau.
"no, there's a difference. my mother wants me to find her."
it's called an idic.
looks old.
it's been modified.
this is a desert called the forge. the route's the one surak supposedly followed.
eighteen hundred years ago?
"syrrannites follow the same path today, seeking enlightenment."
and you think your mother is somewhere along that path?
"she told koss this was a family heirloom, but i've never seen it before."
"she didn't want koss to know about the map. with any luck, we can use this to find your mother, and t'pau."
"captain, have you seen the reports on this place? it's a hellhole."
it's a vulcan desert. i expect it'll be hot.
"it's got electrical sandstorms. geomagnetic instabilities so bad, technology won't work. so, no communicators, no scanners, no phase-pistols. we can't even beam you into it. you're going to have to walk in."
"i'll be careful. you've got enterprise. you and malcolm keep the investigation going up here, and whatever the vulcans tell you, believe the opposite."
present company excepted. ambassador.
"captain, commander. this shows the gaps in our satellite surveillance, when beam-ins can't be detected."
i'm thinking we're not exactly cleared to have this.
"have what, commander? all i see is a starfleet data module."
"right. captain, what if something goes wrong down there?"
it already has. energise.
"this site is called gateway, where surak supposedly began his journey into the forge."
you keep saying supposedly. you don't believe surak did the things they said he did?
"he brought logic to vulcan, in an age we call the time of awakening, but his writings from that period no longer exist."
there must be some record of it.
"over the centuries, his followers made copies of his teachings."
"let me guess. with the originals lost, whatever's left is open to interpretation."
you find this amusing?
i find it familiar. we should get moving.
i thought technology didn't work here.
"the dampening field only extends a few hundred metres above the ground. patrol craft can fly over it, but their sensors can't see us."
no wonder the syrrannites like it here.
we're being stalked.
what the hell was that?
sehlat. run.
higher ground. higher. they won't climb.
how long before it starts to lose interest in us?
"days, at least. they're very persistent creatures. when i was a child, i had one as a pet."
you had one of those?
"domesticated. they were smaller, slightly."
how slightly?
you have porthos.
porthos doesn't try and eat me when i'm late with his dinner.
vulcan children are never late with their sehlat's dinner.
i can believe that.
the captain asked me to re-examine the dna from the bomb to see if anyone else might have handled it.
you say you found an anomaly.
"in these chromosomal fragments. here, and here."
what kind of anomaly?
"these are telomeres. a genetic clock, if you will. each time a cell divides, they grow shorter."
sure. that's how you tell how old someone is from a cell sample.
"though t'pau's current age is thirty two standard years, her dna recovered from the bomb has an age of only a few months."
they used the dna they sampled when she was registered as a baby.
precisely. the evidence implicating t'pau is false.
captain archer's gone after the wrong person.
and there's no way to get word to him.
"doc, take a look at this."
it's the recording malcolm recovered from the embassy.
"according to the security log, this is when t'pau's biometric signature was recorded."
undoubtedly another fabrication.
"but look, the guard recognised whoever it was. and that guard is your patient."
corporal askwith?
he could be our only chance to identify who really planted the bomb.
he's in a coma. his cranial injuries are substantial. i don't expect him to recover.
"there must be a stimulant you can inject him with, something to bring him around just for a few minutes."
there's only so much damage a human body can withstand.
"i don't care about his body, doc. we need what's in his mind."
sounds like that klingon opera hoshi made us listen to.
the path is safe again.
that's quite a trick.
you're a human.
jonathan archer.
travelling with a vulcan.
t'pol.
curious.
may we ask your name?
arev.
that means desert wind.
does it? why are you here?
we could ask you the same thing.
i follow the path of surak in meditation and study. and you?
i'm on a pilgrimage to study surak and logic. t'pol is my teacher.
i welcome you to walk with me.  but this is no place for your kind. turn back.
"if it's all the same, i'll walk with you, too."
this desert's called the forge for a reason. it will test you and destroy you.
"the plain of blood. some say surak crossed this expanse when the hot blood of battle still flowed green. but with logic, he cooled it."
"captain, the reflected heat is too hot for you."
i'll stick to the sand-covered parts wherever i can.
i won't need water for several more days.
you'd better protect your eyes from the glare.
my inner eyelids will protect my vision. my species evolved on this planet.
how long have you tried to understand vulcan logic?
ever since i met t'pol.
"very well, student of surak. who said, logic is the cement of our civilisation with which we ascend from chaos using reason as our guide?"
i'm new at this. you tell me.
something more basic then. what's kiri-kin-tha's first law of metaphysics?
i'm familiar with newton's first law of motion. i imagine they're pretty much the same.
you haven't been truthful about your presence here.
have you?
vulcans do not lie.
i've dealt with the high command. vulcans can lie and cheat with the best of them.
the high command does not follow surak's true path. no wonder you humans are their allies.
"from the questions he asked you, i believe he is a syrrannite. and it's obvious that he doesn't trust us enough to take us to the others."
"that only leaves one option. we have to tell him what he wants to know, the truth."
it may be too late for that. sand-fire!
this man's our only witness.
"he's comatose, brain-damaged, and he's human. a mind-meld is dangerous under the best of conditions, but under these"
"look, i know phlox says there aren't a lot of vulcans who can do this sort of thing, but you've got to know someone who could at least try."
those who do have the ability won't risk their careers by publicly attempting what you suggest.
most vulcans see melding as deviant behaviour.
what's that got to do with it?
"evidence will solve this crime, not mind-melds."
what evidence? the dna on the bomb was planted.
you can prove that?
i can.
"ambassador, i don't know what kind of pull it takes to mess with dna records on vulcan, but i think we're looking at a deliberate attempt to hide the truth."
you're suggesting a conspiracy.
one that cost forty three innocent lives.
aren't they worth a little risk?
the needs of the many. i can perform the meld.
captain.
over here!
help me with this. the sand-fire can still reach us.
i know this. how did you get this medallion?
from my mother.
t'les.
you're a syrrannite.
the daughter of t'les serves on a human starship.
when did you talk with her? is she safe?
you're the human responsible for the destruction of the monastery at p'jem.
is that going to be a problem?
the high command defiled p'jem when they used it to spy on andoria. you exposed their hypocrisy.
you seem to know a lot about us. i'm guessing that means you know why we're here.
"your mother is safe with the others, at the t'kareth sanctuary. it's not far. i'll guide you both there when the storm has passed."
i don't know if this has ever been attempted with a human before.
my mind to your mind. our minds are one. our thoughts are joined. yes.
"i see what you see. the embassy. i'm at my station. at your station. so many new people arriving for the summit. i don't recognise them all, but some i know. a package. that's all right. i don't need to see it. go right through. who are you? who?"
ambassador. what'd you see?
how long do these sand-fire storms usually last?
"a day. perhaps two. i've never seen one this strong. but we're safe here, and we're in no hurry."
maybe we should be.
the high command believes the syrrannites are responsible for bombing the earth embassy.
that's not our way.
they seem to think that it is. that you and your leader believe in a corrupted version of surak's teachings.
did your mother tell you the story?
of the idic?
"infinite diversity in infinite combination. words that are a mere shadow of its true meaning.  surak tells us that the story of the idic has no end. but it begins here, at mount seleya."
surak died on mount seleya.
"his body, yes, but his katra was spirited away before the last battle against those who marched beneath the raptor's wings. those who wanted to return to the savage ways."
what's a katra?
"syrrannites claim it's the essence of a vulcan mind. that it can be transferred from the body before death, then stored in some manner."
"some say surak's katra was found, and now is carried by a syrrannite so all those who meld with him may touch surak's mind."
syrrannite's conduct mind-melding?
surak tells us it is the heritage of every vulcan. even those who don't believe in the practise.
a witness?
the guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we found in the rubble.
"the syrrannite woman, t'pau."
no. it was you.
i would like to interrogate this witness myself.
you're not getting anywhere near him.
perhaps i could speak with the guard.
i'm afraid he's in no condition to be questioned. he's in a coma.
yet he provided an eyewitness account.
we accessed his memories through a mind-meld.
telepathic evidence is inadmissible.
it's not evidence at all! you allowed this distasteful act to take place?
i performed it.
soval. you've shamed vulcan and yourself. the law leaves me no recourse. you'll be summoned to appear before the high command to account for your actions. commander. doctor.
"at one time, the high command was only responsible for the exploration of space. but that's changed."
i've been told vulcans have never been explorers.
i think you've been told many things about us that aren't true.
reseal the entrance!
t'pol!
"easy, easy, easy."
listen. the storm is gaining strength.
arev.
you must carry it to sanctuary.
carry what?
tuluk to vokau.
you can't go back.
"i'm not a fool, commander. v'las was involved with the attack on your embassy. he's responsible for blaming it on the syrrannites."
then why turn yourself over to him?
it's the only chance i'll have to reach the rest of the high command.
"what if they're all in on it?  if you really want humans and vulcans to work together someday, you might start thinking about trusting us."
right.
arev.
are you injured?
i'm fine. he said something in vulcan. vokau.
remember. remember what?
i think he punched me. the storm's over?
the patrol craft are flying again. they sound like they're closing in on this location.
he said we weren't far from the t'kareth sanctuary. we should keep moving.
after we bury him.
"they're following a grid search pattern. no sensors, but they can still make visual contact. we have to find cover before the sun comes up. that way."
there's nothing there.
that's where the syrrannites are.
how do you know?
i'm good for a few more days.
"captain, you're not vulcan."
right.
it's almost dawn. we need to find someplace to hide.
no. over here.
that won't help us.
don't resist.
what do you mean?
"before we announce our decision, is there anything you wish to say?"
my actions were taken in the best interest of vulcan and the high command.
keeping secrets from us is in our best interest?
"had i revealed my abilities as a melder, my years of service would not have been possible."
your accomplishments have been noteworthy.
they don't justify deception.
deception has never been a stranger to this room.
i caution you.
one of our own members was responsible for bombing the earth embassy. an act we tried to blame on the syrrannites.
that assessment was correct. our investigation of stel has revealed he's a syrrannite.
i find that difficult to accept.
"numerous documents were discovered in his home. the evidence is irrefutable. syrrannites were responsible, and they'll be dealt with accordingly. regarding the matter at hand, your position is terminated immediately. you're to surrender all classified materials to the security directorate before leaving. i remind you that your loyalty oath is still in effect. a violation of that oath"
i'm aware of the penalty.
good. is there anything else you'd like to say?
"there's a great deal that needs to be said, excellency, but no one's willing to listen."
who are you?
captain of the earth vessel. and you must be t'pol. you are a long way from enterprise.
i'm here to find the person who bombed the earth embassy. her name is t'pau. and she looks a hell of a lot like you.
i am t'pau.
"you murdered my friend, along with forty other people."
i had nothing to do with the destruction of your embassy.
the evidence says you did.
i haven't left this desert for two years. what does that tell you about your evidence?
it tells me that you're lying!
you have a lot to learn about syrrannites.
you have a lot to learn about humans. we don't sit back and do nothing while our people are attacked.
"no, you traverse vast wastelands based on false information. what did you plan to do when you found me, place me under arrest?"
something like that.
it seems everything i've heard about your species is accurate.
mother.
i'm pleased to see that you're all right.
we have a great deal to talk about.
agreed.
you told them where to find us.
yes.
is there anyone else with you?
no.
"to have crossed the forge by yourselves, with the sand-fire storms this time of year"
we met a syrrannite. he helped us find shelter.
who was this person?
his name was arev.
he was struck down by an electrical charge.
he didn't make it.
he's dead? are you certain his name was arev?
that's what he told us.
his true name was syrran. he was our leader.
"captain, are you all right?"
"i'm okay. right before arev died, he grabbed me. he put his hand on my forehead. i felt something inside my head."
do you think he was trying to meld with you?
"i don't know. but ever since, i haven't been myself."
you put us all in danger. what if they'd been followed?
i only wanted her to know i was safe.
you could've accomplished that without revealing our location.
i can't change what i've done. she doesn't deserve imprisonment. i want her released.
not until we've confirmed their story.
my daughter wouldn't lie.
"she's not merely your daughter. she's a member of starfleet, and starfleet is allied with the high command. they'll both remain where they are until i'm satisfied they can be trusted. search patrols are flying day and night."
they're the least of our worries now.
"if syrran is dead, then everything we've worked for is lost."
i can't believe they threw you out. just because you helped us?
there's got to be some way you can fight this.
"who the hell put him in charge, anyway?"
our society rewards merit. v'las has demonstrated a singular talent for governing.
what are you going to do now?
you're referring to my career? i haven't given it much thought. there's something more important we need to discuss. have you made contact with t'pol or your captain?
we can't reach them and they can't reach us.
v'las is determined to wipe out the syrrannites. he's particularly intent on destroying their encampment in the forge.
where the captain and t'pol are headed.
they may be in grave danger.
you must have questions for me.
i can't understand how you could join these people.
"i've been growing disillusioned with vulcan society for some time. when i was forced to resign from the academy, i began seriously to question my beliefs."
and this is where you came for answers?
"syrrannites believe that vulcans have strayed from the teachings of surak. considering what the high command has done in recent years, the listening station at p'jem, the suppression of dissent, our position isn't so hard to accept."
you could have told me all this when i came to visit.
the high command was just beginning to hunt down suspected syrrannites. i was afraid i would be next. i wanted to keep you out of it. i know your marriage to koss was for my sake. to help me regain my post.
"i don't want your apologies, mother. i want you to come back with me."
i can't do that.
"when you gave me that map, you knew i'd try to find you."
i thought that if you could see what we were trying to accomplish
that i'd understand? that i'd join you?
"i held out that hope, yes. it's possible i was being foolish."
extremely.
war is taking its toll. vulcan is tearing itself apart.
who are you?
"you know who i am, captain. so much death. hard to believe this will become known as the time of awakening."
that was eighteen hundred years ago. this doesn't feel like a dream.
you're seeing the past through my eyes.
syrran did something to me before he died.
"he chose you. you don't trust vulcans, captain. and, given your experiences with them, i can't say i blame you. the culture you've come to know isn't the one i helped to create. my people have strayed, and someone must restore them to the path."
you've got the wrong man.
"sorry, captain. there's an earth expression, we're stuck with each other. don't fight what's been given to you. open your mind and your heart and the way will become clear."
captain. captain?
we've pinpointed their location near the northeastern border of the forge.
how accurate is this information?
it's based on data collected by search patrols. they've been conducting missions for several days. we're going to bombard the camp with photonic weapons.
our goal isn't to exterminate these people.
our goal is to maintain order.
they're in the deep desert. what possible harm could they do us?
they've already destroyed an embassy.
"eventually, they're going to have to leave the forge, and when they do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life."
"it's very likely that syrran himself is inside the compound. with one decisive thrust, we can cripple this insurgency, perhaps end it. we can't let an opportunity like this pass us by."
a surgical strike could minimize the loss of life.
the geomagnetic anomalies make a precision attack impossible. this is the only way. we'll begin preparations immediately.
"this man, did he tell you his name?"
he seemed to think i knew who he was.
did you?
it was surak.
we believe you.
syrran possessed the katra of surak.
katras are nothing more than a myth.
"i used to think that, until i learned to open up my mind to other possibilities."
"if syrran knew he was close to death, he would have tried to transfer the katra to someone else."
i was near him when he died.
there is only one way to be certain. i have to meld with you.
i've had my fill of mind-melds.
"the prospect doesn't appeal to me, either. i've never melded with a human before. your unchecked emotions will no doubt prove distasteful. however, i ask your indulgence."
my mind to your mind. my thoughts to your thoughts. our minds are merging.
our minds are one.
we're in the desert. there's a storm. we find refuge in a cave. sand-lightning. our minds are not alone. there's someone else here with us. i sense his presence.
t'pau?
he has the katra.
we can trigger a malfunction in this satellite's imaging node. it'll take six minutes for the central processor to correct the error.
that should be enough time to slip through the net. won't they wonder what caused the glitch?
errors occur frequently near the forge. it shouldn't raise suspicion.
mind if i ask you something? why are you doing this? i never got the impression you cared that much about humans. seems like you were always finding something new to complain about.
"i lived on earth for more than thirty years, commander. in that time, i developed an affinity for your world and its people."
you did a pretty good job of hiding it.
thank you.
launch bay to commander tucker.
"go ahead, travis."
we should be ready within the hour.
: what about helm control?
"i've rigged up a stick-and-rudder system. it'll get us where we want to go,"
but i can't promise a smooth ride.
just don't tell malcolm about that part until you're underway.
"centuries ago, a set of katric arks were discovered at the p'jem monastery."
katric arks?
"polycrystalline vessels, allegedly used by ancient vulcans to preserve katras. they were scanned, analyzed. one of the scientists even attempted to meld with them. they found nothing to indicate the presence of a katra."
the vulcan science academy was just as sceptical about time travel.
do you really believe you possess the living spirit of surak inside you? a man who died eighteen hundred years ago?
not when you put it like that.
there is a logical explanation.
i'm listening.
syrran melded with you before he died. what you're experiencing is the residue of his thoughts.
so i'm suffering from a mind-meld hangover?
"i wouldn't characterise it quite that way, but essentially."
it feels like more than that.
you have no basis for comparison. you've never undergone a mind-meld before.
"seeing surak is only a part of it. i could swear i've been here before, in this sanctuary. it's like coming back to the house you grew up in."
syrran spent a great deal of time here.
"let's say you're right, and it was just a mind-meld. he still put something in my head. and i want it taken out."
that may not be possible.
what can we do for you?
where is your captain?
he's indisposed at the moment. can i help you?
the investigation of the embassy bombing is nearly complete.
you have a suspect.
the evidence against him and the syrrannites is compelling. there's no longer any need for your presence here.
"if it's all the same to you, we'd like to stick around."
we'd prefer you didn't. this is an internal matter. we'll keep starfleet apprised if there are any subsequent developments.
excellency.
"again, you have my deepest sympathy for your loss."
all of vulcan grieves with you.
"with all respect, we aren't leaving. not until we know exactly what happened."
i've also contacted admiral gardner. i'm sure you'll be hearing from him soon. a pleasant journey.
son of a bitch hung up on us.
should i try to get him back?
no one here has ever performed this ritual.
i've studied it for some time. i believe i can conduct it successfully.
"you'd not only be placing surak's katra in jeopardy, you could kill archer."
the risks are acceptable.
i doubt surak would agree.
what alternative would you suggest? that we follow this human?
i believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding your judgment.
you question my logic?
"syrran chose to place the katra in archer. he must have had his reasons, even if we don't understand them."
the reason is obvious. he was dying. your daughter couldn't reach him in time. he had to choose archer.
"that may be, but we do have a choice. now, for the sake of everyone involved, i ask you to reconsider."
i've made my decision. i'll perform the procedure in one hour.
and if archer dies?
i won't sacrifice our future to protect the life of one human.
"you know, i'm the one with a vulcan ghost in his head, depending on who you believe. but i don't feel half as bad as you look."
i'm considering our options.
at least we know your mother's okay.
she's joined a violent cult. she's not okay.
i don't think these people had anything to do with the embassy.
you sound convinced.
let's just say it's more than a gut feeling.
we've come to a decision. the katra must be removed.
i can't argue with that.
"there's a procedure, a ritual. it will transfer the katra to another person."
it's not without risk.
"vulcan neurology is exceptionally resilient, but a human's"
the shock to your nervous system will be severe. it could kill you.
you must decline.
we're not offering a choice.
you'd do this by force?
"we'd prefer that you undertake the ritual willingly. it will stand a better chance of success. however, if force is required, we won't hesitate to use it."
let's get started.
captain.
it's my call.
admiral gardner followed the vulcan line straight down the middle. he wants us out of here yesterday.
did you tell him about the captain and t'pol?
i left that part out.
enterprise was supposed to leave orbit an hour ago. v'las is not a patient man.
there's not a whole lot he can do about it.
"hell of a job, travis."
"thank you, sir."
just find them and bring them back. no sightseeing along the way.
understood.
we've got a recon satellite to jam.
enterprise hasn't left orbit. they're maintaining a stationary position above the forge.
keep monitoring them.
"yes, excellency."
we can't proceed with the operation while the earth ship is there.
you're concerned about witnesses.
gardner gave them an order to leave. i heard the transmission.
so we're now monitoring their communications?
they wouldn't disobey an order without a reason. i intend to find out what it is.
"passed down through the ages, the katra of surak, father of all we hold true, lives on in this man. let it now live on in me."
surak.
"good to see you again, captain. my appearance must be quite disconcerting. i apologise."
radiation sickness?
"we're paying a heavy price for our foolishness. logic has not won this day, but this day won't last forever. logic is at the heart of every vulcan. even as the ashes fall, my people are discovering a new way. you can accomplish what syrran could not."
but syrran
"was a vulcan, and you're human. which means you are untouched by a culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction. we cannot let what happened to the vulcans of my time take place again. find what my people have lost. find the kir'shara."
captain.
i failed. surak chooses to remain where he is.
the satellite's been disabled. you've got six minutes to get through.
"travis, it's all yours."
probably should've skipped breakfast this morning.
they're through.
these thermals are only going to get stronger.
that was no thermal.
"the plasma-cannons are still working, but i can't say the same for the targeting sensors."
we must be getting close to the geomagnetic field.
it doesn't seem to be affecting them.
they must have better shielding.
i'll have to aim manually. can you get us on their tail?
how are they still below us?
we've lost part of the starboard wing.
we have to abort.
i think i can get us down.
you won't be able to get us back up.
thrusters are offline. we'll have to fire the chemical rockets. hang on.
"they've been fired on. they took damage, but they're heading back to enterprise."
i guess six minutes wasn't enough.
they must've been monitoring us.
three ships closing on our position. we're being hailed. it's administrator v'las.
why did you launch a shuttlepod?
why the hell did you fire on it?
you had no authorisation. answer the question.
we're looking for our captain.
archer's on the surface?
"he's in the forge, searching for the syrrannites."
you were ordered to leave orbit.
i advised them to stay.
i assume you assisted in disabling the security satellite.
i gave them the code.
"commander tucker, you're to break orbit immediately."
we're not leaving without the captain.
"you will leave immediately, or i'll order my ships to open fire."
how is he?
"his breathing has stabilised, but his fever is still high."
he agreed to the ritual.
"if he hadn't, you would have forced him. you claim that surak's teachings have been corrupted by the high command, but you're no different."
there is a profound difference.
you deceive yourself.
t'pol.
"i shouldn't have come here looking for you, and i don't want anything more to do with you."
if that's your wish.
how long have i been out?
more than three hours.
i feel like i just pulled my head out of a plasma relay.
you should rest.
the kir'shara.
what do you know about it?
"it was important to surak, and it's in there."
what's a kir'shara?
an artefact. syrran led us here to find it.
if he knows where it is.
telescopes have sighted three vulcan cruisers in orbit over the forge.
the high command knows we're here. we should evacuate immediately.
give the order.
i can find it.
that one missed us by twenty metres.
tactical alert. polarise hull plating. how many warning shots do vulcans usually fire?
none.
v'las.
"i'm running out of patience, commander."
we've been over this. our captain and first officer are down there.
we'll make sure they're returned to you. break orbit. now.
you really think he'll do it?
v'las will do what whatever it takes to accomplish his goal.
vulcan and earth have been allies for a hundred years.
"syrrannites must have seen our ships by now. if they evacuate into the forge, they'll be extremely hard to track. we can't wait any longer. drive enterprise from orbit. use all necessary force."
"yes, excellency."
"phase-cannons, return fire."
the vulcan ships are firing on enterprise.
we could be next. take charge of the evacuation. we'll meet you on the forge as soon as we can.
you can't stay here.
i've spent two years searching for the artefact. if there's a chance of finding it.
t'pol?
i'm staying.
go.
re-route emergency power to phase-cannons.
hull breach on c deck. they're reporting casualties. v'las is hailing. audio only.
put him through.
"you're hopelessly outgunned, weapons are offline, engines failing. don't force me to destroy your ship."
he's right. we should withdraw. our deaths won't help captain archer or t'pol.
get us the hell out of here.
the moment enterprise is beyond scanner range begin bombardment of the compound.
"yes, excellency."
"t'klaas. he was a student of surak, one of the first kolinahr masters."
"there's no inscription, nothing to indicate his bloodline. how do you know his name?"
we're getting close.
they've begun their assault.
it's here.
i had my doubts whether it really existed.
let's go. this way.
report.
geomagnetic interference. we can't get a target lock.
blanket the area.
the sanctuary has been destroyed.
comb the desert. make sure there are no survivors.
affirmative.
you're presiding over a massacre.
we are eliminating a threat.
are you all right?
i'm fine.
we should keep moving.
captain.
i was afraid you were still inside.
it's all right. we found the kir'shara.
"you have always struggled so with your emotions. i came here, i did all this to help you."
i don't understand.
you will.
mother.
"i've always been so proud of you, my t'pol."
mother.
i understand we suffered casualties.
"injuries, two of them serious."
i share your concern about captain archer and t'pol.
they've been in tough jams before.
the syrrannites believe violence to be antithetical to surak's teachings.
so they're pacifists.
"v'las considers that a dangerous mindset, particularly now."
what do you mean?
the high command is planning to attack andoria.
"wait, wait. vulcan and andoria signed a peace treaty two years ago. captain archer helped negotiate it."
"vulcan intelligence claims the andorians are developing a weapon, possibly based on xindi technology."
you don't believe it.
i suspect v'las is using the claim to advance an agenda. he's persuaded the high command to launch a preemptive strike.
he's going to start an interstellar war.
"one that could devastate andoria and vulcan and eventually involve other worlds, including earth."
set a course for andoria.
andoria?
maximum warp.
the andorians have deployed most of their fleet in defensive positions around paan mokar.
we gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. why would they move their forces there?
they believe we're preparing to retake it. we've been using unmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system.
why weren't we informed of this?
"it's possible that andorian agents have penetrated the high command. it's necessary to limit access to this information. our forces are actually stationed here, preparing to launch an invasion of andoria."
there are members of the council who are not convinced an invasion is necessary at this time.
we know they have the xindi technology. you've all seen the data.
data can be falsified.
we received this sensor telemetry two days ago. it was recorded by the andorian ship that stole the xindi prototype.
do you have evidence of this?
"they didn't steal the prototype because they were merely curious. i'm certain of one thing. sooner or later, the andorians will make use of this technology. is it logical for us to wait for that day?"
we've sent word to the syrrannites in the mountains. they'll care for the wounded.
how far to the capital?
two days.
we need to get back to enterprise. tell starfleet what we've learned about the embassy bombing.
we have a more important mission. we've to get this to the capital.
i don't understand.
"the kir'shara contains surak's original writings. it's the only surviving record of his true teachings. it would have an enormous impact on the high command, and all of vulcan."
i've got two teams working on it. both launchers should be online in a few hours.
anything else?
"permission to speak freely? admiral gardner ordered us to return to earth, yet we've set a course for andorian territory."
we are going back. we're just taking a small detour first.
have you told starfleet you're planning to warn the andorians?
no.
have you any idea what the admiral will do when he finds out?
i'll save you a seat at my court-martial. is there anything else?
"the vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike. if we alert the andorians, we will be betraying our closest ally."
"i'm trying to prevent a war, malcolm. a war that earth could get draw into."
"with all due respect, sir, we shouldn't get involved."
we're already involved.  come in.
"that'll be all, lieutenant."
sir?
dismissed.
"you asked for me, commander?"
i've been thinking. there's no guarantee the imperial guard's going to believe us. we've got no evidence your people are planning this attack. but there is one andorian who might trust us. at least he does some of the time.
commander shran.
"problem is, i have no idea how to find him."
i may be able to help.
good.
lieutenant reed appeared unsettled.
some of the crew are wondering if i'm doing the right thing. can't say i blame them. i'm not so sure myself.
i have no doubt captain archer would pursue this same course of action.
that's what i keep telling myself.
enterprise will be scanning for us at the transport coordinates. one of us should go there.
it's too dangerous. we're staying together.
taking the artefact to the high command will accomplish nothing.
it might be the only thing that can stop the war.
what war?
between vulcan and andoria.
we settled our dispute with the andorians nearly two years ago.
v'las was just stalling for time. he's been preparing a large-scale attack ever since.
where did you get this information?
where do you think?
"assuming for the moment you possess surak's katra, he's been dead for centuries. how could he be aware of plans for a war?"
some of syrran's memories must have been transferred in the meld.
captain.
you think i've lost my mind?
i'm not certain your mind is the one making these decisions. we should return to the ship. t'pau can take the artefact to the capital.
i was chosen for this.
chosen? interesting choice of words.
"if i were in your shoes, i'd be just as sceptical. i'm not possessed, and i'm not delusional. there are forces at work on your world right now, trying to undo everything surak taught your people. if we fail, vulcan will be consumed by them. that's why have to get this thing to the capital. and i'm going to need all three of us to try and find"
archer! don't move.
gallicite deposits. are you in possession of anything metallic?
just this.
thanks for the warning.
our patrol has returned. they captured eight syrrannites from the sanctuary.
was syrran among them?
"no. he is dead. the syrrannites say that there were three other survivors, including a human."
archer.
they say that he is carrying the kir'shara.
the kir'shara never existed.
"there are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hidden in the forge. the syrrannites claim that they are following the true path of surak. if the kir'shara is real, it could prove them right."
"it doesn't exist! you've been listening to syrrannite propaganda. that will be all, minister."
"sublieutenant, order major talok to find the remaining syrrannites. we're dealing with radical insurgents. they're to be eradicated. do i make myself clear?"
open a channel.
to who?
the nebula. this is ambassador soval. i've come on an urgent mission. i must speak with commander shran. the high command has decrypted your security protocols. we're well aware that your task force has been hiding in this nebula.
maybe your information's out of date.
he's in there.
this is commander tucker of enterprise. we've got some information you're going to want to hear.
sir.
we're being hailed.
"commander tucker, you have a poor choice of friends."
an invasion?
that's correct.
we keep a very close eye on your fleet. we would know if the high command were preparing to attack.
"v'las has been assembling ships near regulus, beyond the range of your listening stations."
"your leaders may be fools, but they're not suicidal. they know we will respond."
they were told you're adapting xindi weaponry and that you're planning to use it against vulcan.
that's absurd! captain archer destroyed the xindi prototype before we could examine it.
that fact was conveniently omitted.
"you people are so used to lying, you don't even tell the truth to each other. how do i know you weren't sent here as a diversion?"
you don't.
do you have any idea what will happen when the imperial guard retaliates? it will be a disaster for both our worlds.
which is why you must convince them to intercept our fleet.
you're betraying your own people by telling me this.
i'm aware of that.
why are you doing it?
"the high command is counting on the element of surprise. if they meet resistance, i believe v'las will be forced to call off the invasion."
when does this invasion begin?
soon.
"that's the best you can give me, soon?"
yes.
"do you believe him, pinkskin?"
i wouldn't be here if i didn't.
i'll need to consult with my superiors.
i suggest you do it fast.
that's the fourth patrol today. there's an extensive security grid around the capital. it's unlikely we'll get past it.
we'll find a way. surak will help us. you don't believe in the katra?
it's irrelevant what i believe. the captain could be permanently injured if we don't get him to a doctor soon.
"he doesn't need a physician, he needs a priest. one experienced with katras."
it's irrational that we're following someone in his state of mind. what if he dies before we can get help? i apologise. my mother's death has affected me more than i realised.
"it was a great loss. we disagreed frequently, but i valued her counsel. i could allow you to experience what she shared with me."
you melded with her? i cannot meld.
i would initiate it.
that's not what i mean. i was forced to participate in a meld several years ago. i was infected with a neural disease.
pa'nar syndrome. do you still suffer from it?
there's no cure.
another lie perpetrated by the high command. pa'nar has been known since surak's time. it's caused by melders who have been improperly trained. one with great experience can correct the neurological imbalance.
is there something you can do?
my mind to your mind. my thoughts to your thoughts. our minds are merging. our minds are one.
bridge to commander shran.
this is shran.
we've isolated the vulcan's bio-signature. he's alone.
you're certain enterprise won't detect the transport?
all they'll see is a brief energy surge. they'll think it came from the nebula. commander?
energise when ready.
"yes, sir."
"welcome aboard, ambassador."
"if you're expecting me to plead for mercy, you'll be waiting a long time."
i simply want to know your fleet's actual location.
i've already given it to you.
then consider this our way of confirming what you've told us. you didn't expect the imperial guard to mobilise its entire fleet based on nothing more than the word of one loyal vulcan diplomat?
we spent weeks arguing over details in our treaty negotiations. did i ever mislead you?
no.
you must know that torture is rarely effective against vulcans. our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain.
our security division has had a great deal of experience extracting information from vulcan operatives. this machine doesn't cause physical discomfort. it uses a neuro-synaptic field to lower your emotional threshold.
how do you feel? i've seen vulcans who were broken by this device. they were never the same again. i have no desire to see that happen to you. where is your fleet?!
i told you. our ships are assembling near regulus.
release me!
i can't. not until i'm certain you've told us the truth.
then i suggest you increase the setting and get this over with.
what is it?
the ambassador seems to be missing.
he's not in his quarters or anywhere on d deck.
"tucker to soval. ambassador, please respond. internal sensors. scan for his biosigns."
he's not on board.
scan the andorian ships.
there's a vulcan signature on their lead ship.
go to tactical alert. open a channel. this is commander tucker. we know ambassador soval's aboard your ship. i want to speak with him now.
"sir, the andorians are moving toward the nebula."
target shran's ship. disable the engines.
navigation just went offline.
"it's the particle flux in the nebula, it's overloading the sensors."
i've lost them.
can we compensate for the flux?
it'll take a few hours. you have the bridge.
"captain, you need to rest."
"thanks, but i'll be fine."
"the atmosphere is thinner than you're used to. if you don't stop soon, you'll collapse."
"if you need a break, t'pol, you should say so."
i'm going to scout ahead.
have you had any more conversations with surak?
not in a couple of hours.
something's amusing?
of all the people who could've carried this katra.
i doubt you were syrran's first choice.
"ever since the meld, i've felt more centred. it's hard to explain. my whole life, i've never really understood vulcans. why they work so hard to suppress their emotions. now it all seems to make sense. next thing you know, i'll be taking up meditation."
you might find it beneficial.
"after we get back, maybe you'll want to take a closer look at the syrrannites' philosophy."
why?
it was important to your mother. there might be something to it.
there are many groups who claim to follow the true path of surak. i find no evidence that this one's any different.
i would've thought you'd be more sympathetic to their cause. you never seemed too happy with the status quo around here.
"i may have had disagreements with the high command, but that doesn't mean i'm going to join a radical faction."
"you signed up with starfleet. a lot of vulcans i've met consider us a radical faction. as a scientist, i just thought you might want to keep an open mind."
this has nothing to do with science!
am i interrupting?
no.
let me out of here!
i can't. i'm sorry. not yet.
i'll tear the antennae from your skull!
"if this interrogation continues, your suppression system could be permanently damaged. tell me what i want to know!"
"aren't you enjoying this, commander? have you imagined having me in this chair many times?"
"that's not far from the truth. but after our rather lengthy peace talks, i came to trust you."
then trust me now!
you would never betray your people!
i'm trying to save them!
where is your fleet?!
do you know the story of nirak?
what?
"he was a soldier who lived a long time ago. he was standing watch over the gates of the city of gol and he saw a cloud on the horizon moving toward him. he thought it was a sandstorm, so he told no one. it was an army. they destroyed the city, but they let nirak live. his name now means fool in our language, just as yours will in andorian!"
"give the kir'shara to us. you won't be injured. this isn't your world, human."
archer!
surrender and you won't be harmed.
i'm not leaving her.
what the hell were you doing?
protecting the kir'shara.
where are they taking the kir'shara?
mount seleya.
why?
because the artefact contains surak's original writings. only the priests on seleya can translate them.
if you are deceiving me
i am a syrrannite. we don't lie.
i need to rest.
"if you're attempting to delay us, it won't work. we'll find your friends.  you've changed. i served under you during the tomed mission. you don't remember me."
that's a very long time ago.
you were a fine officer then. why did you betray us? they must have offered you something. or perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs in embassies?
we weren't responsible.
two of my men were killed in the embassy explosion.
you have been misled. syrrannites are peaceful.
i have spared your life because you were once my superior. your companions won't be so fortunate.
bridge to commander shran.
what is it?
the general is asking for an update on the interrogation.
tell him i'll contact him when i'm ready.
acknowledged.
you find this amusing?
"ordinarily, i wouldn't, but because of this device"
there are three higher settings on that panel. if i use them
"you're afraid to injure me. if i were you, i'd leave that detail out of your report to the general."
where is your fleet?
i was a fool to think you'd listen. perhaps the high command was right. we'll be better off when andoria falls.
report!
it's the starfleet ship.
direct hit to their shield generator.
see if you can get a lock on soval.
should we return fire?
are you going to make enemies of the humans as well?
"lieutenant, order our ships out of the nebula."
commander?
and tell enterprise we'll be returning the ambassador shortly.
understood.
get that thing off of him.
they're heading east. away from the capital. she's with them. where are you going?
"to find my science officer. and i don't want to hear any lectures about the needs of the many. i get enough of that crap from, from t'pol."
"there's no logic to your plan. we have no weapons. if they take the kir'shara from you, they'll destroy it."
i'm going to find her.
how is he?
you've got a lot of nerve pretending you give a damn.
i did what was necessary. soval would understand.
he should be fine in another day or so.
"he risked his life coming here, and you paid him back by scrambling his neurons."
he's not the only one taking a risk. i just spoke with the imperial guard. they're re-deploying our forces.
now you believe him. what changed your mind?
"a lesser man would've told me what i wanted to hear, even if it wasn't true. there's been too much suspicion, too many lies, on both sides. our fleet will intercept the vulcans at these coordinates. my superiors believe it may be helpful if enterprise were to join us."
sehlat.
"my first officer, where is she? what have you done with her?"
she's been taken to the high command.
your technique has improved.
"welcome home, subcommander."
i no longer hold that rank.
"well, you may have joined starfleet, but you're still vulcan. and subject to our laws. there are few crimes still punishable by execution, but treason is one of them."
what is it?
seven alien ships have taken position outside the andorian system. they are directly in the path of our fleet.
"are you sure this is wise? if the vulcans find us here, they might think we're siding with the andorians. there's no guarantee they won't fire on us."
"sir, i'm reading a massive subspace distortion."
hoshi?
it's the vulcans. they'll be here in two hours. he's hailing us again.
on screen.
our sensors show twelve vulcan cruisers approaching.
when will the rest of your fleet get here?
they won't arrive in time. we're on our own.
i'm still not clear how the kir'shara's gonna stop a war.
v'las can't govern without approval from the council. the existence of the kir'shara will persuade them to reconsider their support.
i don't suppose they'll let us just walk into the high command.
"we can transport in, but we'll need access codes."
i know someone who might have them.
the vulcans are powering weapons. the andorians are doing the same.
"travis, put us between both fleets. if the vulcans want to start a war, they're going to have to get through us first."
it's shran.
"commander, what do you think you're doing?"
in case you hadn't noticed they outnumber us two to one.
get back in formation!
i'm trying to buy us some time!
the andorians have more ships on the way.
they won't arrive for several hours.
"you told us this strike would be a surprise. that there would be minimal casualties on both sides. the andorians are armed with standard particle cannons. there is no evidence of xindi technology. administrator, we have to call off this attack."
our forces are committed. we can't turn back.
we're being hailed by the starfleet ship.
"this is commander tucker. sorry to spoil your surprise, but the andorians know what you're planning."
i suggest you turn your ships around now.
this doesn't concern starfleet.
leave the area immediately.
i can't do that. the andorians helped us when earth was under attack. we're just here to return the favour.
"if you side with the andorians, you'll be fired upon."
"i've already sent word to admiral gardner. if enterprise is destroyed, starfleet's going to know who is responsible."
order our ships to engage the enemy fleet.
"administrator, i can't allow this."
sublieutenant.
"if you attempt to interfere again, i'll have you arrested."
"the vulcans, they're locking weapons."
on us?
"no, just the andorians."
stand by phase-cannons. don't fire until i give the order.
we're in the crossfire.
hard about! get us out of their weapons range!
one of the andorian ships is in trouble. their reactor's been hit.
a vulcan cruiser's heading towards them.
see if you can get their attention.
the earth vessel's opened fire on one of our ships.
destroy them.
the cruiser's breaking off its attack.
we're being targeted.
evasive starboard. full impulse. malcolm!
we're not making a dent in their shields.
shran's hailing.
tell archer that's two he owes me.
contact security.
stay where you are.
we need to have a talk.
"administrator, it is agreeable to see you again."
"this woman is an anarchist, captain. whatever she's told you isn't the truth."
t'pau didn't bomb our embassy. you did.
the evidence is conclusive.
"evidence your people gave us. the bombing was an excuse to round up the syrrannites, make certain they'd never find this."
is that?
the kir'shara's a myth!
hull plating's gone.
torpedoes!
the launchers aren't responding.
where the hell is shran?
the vulcans are keeping him busy. looks like we really are on our own.
holographic trickery. this proves nothing.
the artefact must be examined in detail.
no.
quantum dating will confirm that it's from the time of surak.
you can't trust her! she'd do anything to spread her deviant beliefs. you've spent years trying to subvert me.
the kir'shara will show us our true path.
they'd kill us all if they had the chance! it must be destroyed.
this is minister kuvak. get me the fleet commander immediately.
i've lost helm control.
hull breach on g deck. we're venting atmosphere.
"the vulcan ships, they're withdrawing."
we're being hailed. it's the high command.
"trip, is everything all right?"
"more or less. what's going on, captain?"
there've been a few changes here. get back to vulcan as soon as you can.
enter. captain archer asked me to express his gratitude. he wouldn't have succeeded without your transporter codes.
the captain told me you were in danger. i wouldn't have been a very good husband if i didn't help.
i'm not certain when i'll be able to return. i'm aware that i promised your family that we would eventually live together.
that's not why i've come. i'm releasing you from our marriage. i know you only bonded with me to help your mother. she's gone now. there's no reason for us to continue.
you don't have to do this.
i know.
koss.
"goodbye, t'pol."
the katra is with me now.
"how do you feel, captain?"
like a giant weight's been lifted.
word has already spread of the discovery. it may take years to translate all of the writings.
"the people of vulcan are in your debt. peace, and long life."
"you may be witnessing the start of a new era, not only for vulcan, but for earth as well."
you'll no longer have us looking over your shoulder. it's time for earth to stand on its own.
we're ready.
you've failed. decades of work have been lost.
am i to be blamed for your incompetence?
archer should've been killed.
you brought the humans into this. i must leave vulcan. my position here has been compromised.
what about me?
not now. your disappearance would cause suspicion. this is simply a minor delay. the reunification of our people is only a matter of time.
"i admit it. i've got a few butterflies. okay, more than a few."
you haven't stopped talking about this for a week.
"well, it's different for you. you grew up with the man. when i was seven, my mom bought me a book about him. emory erickson, father of the transporter. i made her read it to me every night for a month. that book is the reason i became an engineer."
did i ever tell you about meeting zefram cochrane?
"yeah, only about fifty times."
then you know i understand how you feel.
you want a mirror?
"you've got a mean streak in you, you know that?"
"nothing seems to be missing,"
"hello, emory."
"jonathan, look at you. i always suspected you'd be famous, just didn't think that you'd be more famous than me."
jon.
good to see you.
"oh, we have a lot of catching up to do."
do it later. i want a tour of this place.
"my chief engineer, commander charles tucker."
it's an honour.
guess you and i'll be spending some time together.
i'm looking forward to it.
danica. trip.
"i hope you don't mind that i'm borrowing your ship, captain."
as long as you return it in good condition.
"don't know if i can promise that. when this test is over, enterprise and all of starfleet could be obsolete."
sounds like you're trying to put me out of a job.
feel like some company? we haven't talked much since vulcan. how are you holding up?
i've been fine.
i've been seeing you by yourself a lot.
i'm reading the kir'shara.
how is it?
interesting.
interesting?
extremely.
"look, i know what you're going through. losing a family member, it's the toughest thing there is."
i see no point in discussing it. it's in the past.
your mother died a week ago.
talking won't change that.
it may change the way you feel about it.
i don't feel anything about it.
"you can tell yourself that,"
it's the truth.
"you know, when lizzie died, there were times i wanted to just close up, retreat inside myself,"
"trip, i appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's not necessary."
"you're fine? well, if you ever do want to talk, let me know. i'll see you."
"sub-quantum teleportation. you step on to a transporter on earth, a few seconds later, you're on vulcan."
that's over sixteen light years.
"that's just for starters. theoretically, there's no limit to the distance. one of the things we're here to test. you tell me, with that kind of technology who'd have any use for a starship?"
maybe you will put me out of a job.
"dad,"
"well, i wouldn't worry too much. it's going to take decades to work out all the bugs. but when we do, starfleet's gonna look a hell of a lot different. that's if it exists at all."
you can see he hasn't changed.
i remember you and my father having similar discussions.
"he believed the future was in the warp drive, i believed in the transporter pad. i miss those talks. i miss him. to henry,"
"the vulcan science academy has been studying sub-quantum transporting for some time, with little result."
"i've been trying to get my hands on some of that research for years. in hindsight, it's probably just as well that i couldn't. might've sent me down the wrong path."
it's hard to imagine. beaming someone that far.
"all breakthroughs are hard to imagine before they happen. when i developed the transporter, most people simply couldn't grasp it. some still can't."
"i have to confess, given a choice, i'd much rather use a good old-fashioned shuttlepod."
i'll never forget the protests when the transporter was first approved for bio-matter.
"oh, god. here we go."
"people said it was unsafe, that it caused brain cancer, psychosis, and even sleep disorders. and then there was all that metaphysical chatter about whether or not the person who arrived after the transport was the same person who left, and not some weird copy."
which would make all of us copies.
"i had to fight all of that nonsense, and i'm not going to tell you there weren't costs. i'm living proof of that, but i won. mankind is better off. makes everything i've fought for worthwhile."
here's to a successful experiment.
those early days were pretty terrifying. i'm lucky to be alive.
is it true you're the first person to go through?
i wasn't about to let anyone else do it.
you must've been scared.
"terrified. that original transporter took a full minute and a half to cycle through. felt like a year. you could actually feel yourself being taken apart and put back together. when i materialised, first thing i did was lose my lunch. second thing i did was get stone drunk. trick i learned from zefram cochrane. now there was a man who knew the benefits of a little liquid courage. what is it?"
"well, you're going to need more juice than i thought."
not more than enterprise can spare.
"well, we'll have to draw direct from the warp reactor. may even have to shut down a few systems."
you'll be able to leave the lights on.
"yeah. if i could get a look at your power converter, it might help me out."
"i'll tell you what. when i'm done with this, i'll install the converter. see if i can't make life easier on you."
"well, thanks, but when it comes to modifying our systems, i prefer to do things myself. can i get a look at it?"
i said i'd install the converter.
"and i said, no, thanks."
"i wish i had time to debate the finer points of engineering protocol, but as you can see i'm extremely busy. and i realise this is your ship and i'm only a guest, but let me remind you that starfleet has granted me complete access to your systems. if you hadn't noticed, i'm more than capable of handling a little power upgrade. hand me that, will you?"
"that's the main reactor and those are the plasma feeds, right?"
you know the ship like a member of the crew.
i've read just about everything i could find on her. i probably could describe every one of your missions.
still wonder why you haven't signed on.
i think you know the answer.
your father seems like he can take care of himself. he sure hasn't lost any of his edge.
can't argue with that.
"so, why are you still on earth?"
he needs me. he still hasn't gotten over quinn.
it's been fourteen years.
fifteen.
"he lost a son. if you leave, he'll lose a daughter."
"if this test goes well, it'll be a new start for him. give him something to look forward to. he won't spend all of his time thinking about the past."
and if the test doesn't go well?
i don't know.
we both grew up with fathers who could be pretty demanding.
that's an understatement.
maybe you should start thinking more about yourself. i know. it's hard taking advice from someone who used to chase you around the backyard with a plastic laser pistol.
"yeah, but it's good advice, jonathan. i just wish i could follow it."
how was your tour?
i enjoyed it.
i can always tell when you're upset. you do this like you're in a hurry.
don't you think there's something to be upset about?
we're here. that's reason enough to be optimistic.
we're lying to them.
we have no choice.
we could talk to jon. he might be able to help us.
no. he wouldn't understand. we can't say anything to him. we can't trust anyone.
it's jon.
he's a starfleet captain. his first duty is to his ship.
you talk about him like he's an enemy.
"he's not an enemy. but he's not on our side, either. believe me."
it's from over there.
no.
i'll take up. you take down.
it could be a form of spatial distortion.
can you pinpoint it?
f deck. near the armoury.
sickbay! crewman down in the armoury!
"he suffered massive cellular disruption, as if he'd been subjected to intense delta radiation."
did other crewmen see anything?
the lights were malfunctioning.
"this anomaly you detected, you think it was somehow responsible?"
"it showed up at the same time, in the same location. can't have been a coincidence."
"i sympathise, believe me. during the initial tests for the transporter, some brave men and women were lost. not a day goes by that i don't think about them. how can i help?"
you've spent a great deal of time in this region of space.
i never encountered anything like this.
are you sure?
"there's a reason this is called the barrens, captain. there's nothing out here."
something out here killed one of my crewmen.
i wish i had an explanation for you.
what is it?
time for my treatment. dani? sorry.  can we continue this later?
of course.
calm down.
you never said that anything like this would happen.
i didn't know this would happen.
"dad, a man is dead, and we're responsible. i'm not going to go along with this anymore."
"listen to me,"
"no, no. we've got to tell them the truth!"
"dani, you're condemning him to death."
i'm condemning him? how do you know he isn't already dead?
he's alive.
"dad, jonathan's practically family. he and quinn were best friends."
i know. i know that.
"we can't do this to him, to his crew."
we're almost ready for our first test.
someone else could die before then.
"the odds of that happening again are extremely small. no one's going to die. i just need a couple of days. we owe him that much, dani."
i wonder what he would have to say about all this. about what we're doing.
"when we're done, you can ask him."
routing power.  ready.
help me up.
sir?
"give me a hand, please."
this part i like doing myself. energising.
the probe materialised at the target coordinates.
looks like it arrived in good condition.
"captain, we're receiving telemetry."
"we're already getting back data. congratulations, emory."
forty thousand kilometres. nothings ever gone that far.
it's a start.
it's going to take a few hours to gather all the telemetry. let's celebrate in mess hall. my treat.
i like to monitor the data as it comes in. i'm sort of obsessive that way.
"well, then let me bring something back for you. help pass the time between data streams."
"no, thanks."
it's been a long day. you must be starving.
you go ahead. i'll join you later.
you sure you don't want a second pair of eyes?
"one pair will do. and no offence, commander, but i work much better when i'm not being distracted."
you know where to find me.
come in.
"something's wrong. most of the work emory had me do, tapping into the warp reactor for extra power, re-routing the plasma flow. it wasn't necessary for the test."
what are you saying?
remember when the lights dimmed?
yeah.
"well, he channeled that energy into a feedback loop. it wasn't going into the beam."
maybe he needs the power for another phase of the experiment.
"well, from what i can tell, his sub-quantum version should use less energy than a regular transporter. that's one of the reasons it's so brilliant. either he was keeping me busy, making sure i was looking the other way, or this sub-quantum thing is a smoke screen for something else. something he hasn't told us about. i wouldn't have picked up on any of it if you hadn't asked me to take a closer look."
"when i asked emory about the anomaly that killed burrows, he claimed he'd never heard of anything like it."
not true?
something very similar appeared on emory's research ship five years ago. t'pol dug up the report from starfleet's data banks. a crew member saw it. said it seemed to be alive.
bridge to captain archer.
go ahead.
we're picking up another one.
"it's on c deck, section five."
on my way.
it's fluctuating.
what's your best guess?
i've lost it.
take section three. take section four. don't let it touch you.
this way. it should be here.
"it's highly unstable, surrounded by a subspace field."
you're fortunate you didn't have more prolonged contact.
can you put that down for thirty seconds?
i took visual readings.
can you slow it down?
hold it. enhance. a little more.
who is it?
it's quinn. emory's son.
that's incredible. he hasn't aged a day.
emory?
i'm not here to test a new transporter. i'm here to bring back my son.
what are you talking about?
"we were conducting first trials. my greatest achievement. quinn wanted to be the first to go through. he was a lot like his old man. a lot like you. i lost his signal and couldn't get it back. truth is, the sub-quantum transporter is a fundamentally flawed concept. it'll never work. not now, not a thousand years from now. i suppose i knew that at the time."
you let him go through with the test?
"i was a relatively young man who had created something that changed starfleet. after an achievement of that magnitude, there was nowhere to go but down. my life became just one long struggle to recapture past glory."
i'm not talking about you. i'm talking about quinn.
i wasn't thinking of the consequences.
you said you came here to get him back?
"this region, the barrens, is actually a subspace node, a bubble of curved space-time. it's why there are no stars. quinn's transporter signal is trapped here. at certain intervals, there are fluctuations in the node that cause the signal to reappear. if we can lock onto it at one of those intervals we can save him."
you could've told me all of this before.
starfleet would never have authorised the mission. i had to create an excuse.
a member of my crew is dead.
"i didn't know that the manifestations would be dangerous, believe me."
you want me to believe you?
i want you to help me. quinn was like a brother to you.
you were like my second father. you should've trusted me.
all i need is one more scan. i can bring him back.
is that the truth?
i'm not lying.
you've been lying to me since you came aboard.
"i had no choice! i'm sorry. please help me, jonathan. help me save my son. please."
"i want you both to work with emory, give him whatever help he needs. what is it, trip?"
i can't believe i'm hearing this. we've already lost one man.
it won't happen again. we'll alert the crew to the danger.
"if they'd been alerted twenty four hours ago, burrows might be alive."
we don't fully understand the nature of these manifestations. they could pose other dangers.
i know there's a risk. we're talking one more day. that's all emory needs.
what he claims he needs.
i believe him.
because he's a friend of the family?
that's not why i'm doing this.
why are you doing this?
"quinn's signal is getting weaker, trip. it's been decaying for the past fifteen years. emory says if we don't do something now, we'll never get him back in one piece. we have a responsibility to help."
what about emory's responsibility? he lied to get us out here.
i'm aware of that. but we're here. we can't just turn the ship around and leave a man to die. you have your orders. i suggest you get started.
we're still getting a spike in the array. i could swap out the emitter coils with something from engineering. might even out a bit.
sounds good.
i'll get on it.
i know you don't approve of what i've done.
you need my approval?
i'm disappointed that you think less of me.
you liked me better when i worshipped your shadow?
yes. it's an honest answer.
i'd think you'd be out of practice.
you may want to reserve judgment on my actions until you've lost a son.
"i have lost someone close, and i'd do almost anything to get her back. except put other people in danger."
quinn and i used to argue all the time. wasn't until i lost him that i realised that those arguments were some of the happiest moments of my life.
i'll be in engineering.
can i come in? hey there. you must be porthos. i've heard a lot about you.  he's got a lot of personality.
and an appetite to match.
i wanted to say that i'm sorry. i should've come to you earlier. i feel responsible. you lost a crewman.
we can't change what's happened. maybe some good can come out of it.
you think we can get him back?
i think that it's possible. that's enough reason for me to try.
"i wonder what it must be like for him, you know? is he in pain? is he conscious? if he is, does he think that we've forgotten about him? quinn was everything to my father. to both of us. getting him back is all that we've thought about for the past fifteen years."
"let's hope when this is over, you'll have something else to think about."
the power conversion tables. some of these modifications should help.
thanks.
is there anything else?
"no, i think we're pretty much there.  i'm trying to decide what to show for movie night."
movie night?
"yeah, i thought i'd fire up the old tradition. you in the mood for a horror film or a musical?"
i don't think i'll have the time for either.
"you can't spend every second of your life studying that, whatever it's called."
kir'shara.
you got to take a break eventually.
eventually.
"i don't get you, t'pol. i thought you joined starfleet so you could interact a little more with humans. but it seems to me that ever since we left spacedock, you spend all your free time cooped up in your room reading that bible of yours."
i may have found new priorities.
what's that supposed to mean?
i'm needed on the bridge.
t'pol to captain archer.
archer.
"i picked up something that was in your area, but i've lost it."
keep monitoring.
he's here.
jonathan. there.
quinn? quinn?
it knocked out an eps junction. repair's going to take a couple of hours.
will it affect the transporter?
no. i can't believe you're still going through with this.
we're not going to have this argument again.
that thing barely missed a stack of torpedoes. if it had jumped two feet to the left we wouldn't be here to talk about it. we should concentrate on repairing the ship so we can get out of here.
if we beam quinn aboard there won't be any more of these manifestations.
how the hell do you know?
trip.
you're putting your personal feelings before the safety of this ship.
and you are this close to insubordination.
insubordination?
"i've made a decision. it's the right decision, and the discussion is over. can you accept that? now go do your job."
"yes, sir."
i got what i needed. you should be able to get a good lock when he reappears.
when will that be?
just over three hours. how's your ship?
we're ready.
you saved my life
forget it.
"you didn't deserve any of this, jonathan. i'm sorry this became your problem."
let's make it worthwhile. let's get quinn back.
i'm scared.
i don't blame you.
i've waited so long for this moment. planned for it. what if something goes wrong? what if i fail?
"on the day before i entered flight training, i asked my father pretty much the same thing."
what did he say?
don't fail.
henry never was a poet.
he didn't need to be.
any moment now.
t'pol.
nothing.
captain.
go ahead.
"b deck, section eight."
confinement beam. widest possible spread.
way ahead of you. got a lock on something. pattern's good
let me.
energising.
we need more power.
that's all we got.
it's working.
quinn.
no. no.
complete the transport sequence.
i don't have a strong enough signal.
recalibrate the confinement beam.
that won't help get us a lock.
just do it.
i'm reading massive cellular deterioration.
that's not possible.
"he's losing cohesion. if he materialises, he'll die in seconds."
i can reverse the damage by cross-phasing the stream.
the transporter can't do that.
i built the damn thing!
i'm losing his vital signs.
"emory,"
get away from me. tie in the secondary buffers.
there's not enough time.
dad.
i can hold the pattern. just do it!
"dad, let him go."
no!
there's nothing you can do for him.
i can't let him go. i can't!
"emory, you can't save him."
"i'm sorry, quinn."
"oh, quinn."
dad? what's wrong?
"quinn, please forgive me, please."
what is it? what?
come in.
"i couldn't leave him like that. it's better to be alive or dead, not somewhere in between."
"if it means anything, my guess is quinn would feel the same way."
i came here to bring my son home. i suppose i accomplished my goal.
i've been in contact with starfleet.
i imagine they're not too happy with all of this.
i'm sure they'll take your achievements into consideration.
i perpetrated a fraud to obtain the use of your ship. a member of your crew is dead. there's no way i'm going to avoid the consequences. there's one good thing to come out of this. dani won't have to worry about taking care of me anymore. i managed to let go of one of my children. now i guess it's time for me to let go of the other one.
i always thought she should be out here.
maybe they'll put me somewhere where i'll be useful. get a chance to teach.
you'd probably be good at it.
i wouldn't be boring. why settle for making myself miserable when i can spread the misery around to an entire class of students?
your neurolytic enzymes are at the same level they were a week ago. no sign of pa'nar syndrome.
it's still difficult for me to accept.
"you were diagnosed with an incurable disease. now it's gone. it's a big adjustment. from what i've been reading, similar diagnoses are taking place all over vulcan. people with pa'nar are coming forward. it's no longer a stigma."
the kir'shara is having an enormous impact.
it's clearly had an impact on you. you seem more certain of yourself.
i've never felt less certain.
you're re-examining your core beliefs. something most people never do.
do you have a moment?
sure. something tells me you're not here to talk about movie night.
i'm going through something that's very complicated.
i know.
"i'm learning, it seems for the first time what it truly means to be vulcan."
"well, maybe you can fill me in."
not until i understand it myself. i don't think there'll be time for
what do you want me to say?
that you understand.
i do. it's not like i didn't know this was coming.  at least my warp engines still need me.
safe journey.
"and you, jonathan. commander."
an honour working with you. some suggestions. this might boost your transporter range a few hundred kilometres.
couldn't resist.
i'll check it out.
say good-bye to porthos.
good luck.
maybe i'll see you around.
you'll win in eight moves.
you're really starting to get a feel for the game.
"thirty two pieces, sixty four squares. it's not as if it's difficult. the total number of possible outcomes is limited."
ten to the one hundred twenty third power.
"that's what i mean. chess is so predictable, i'm surprised anyone bothers to play it."
their average life span's only about a hundred years. with no time to play all the possible games.
what a waste.
careful. no emotional involvement.
i know the rules. observation without interference.
you'll win in five moves.
i'm the ship's champion. i win all the tournaments.
how do you think they'll react to what's on this planet?
"well, that's what we're here to find out, but in my experience, all physical species are alike. i don't expect humans will be any different."
do you think our hosts will die tonight?
"it's possible. for some of the species that have come here, i've seen the whole crew die. for others, only a few."
but somebody always dies.
always.
your move.
i can't wait to get back.
"two days ago, you couldn't wait to get off the ship."
sifting through a klingon garbage dump. not my idea of exploring strange new worlds.
"getting tired of exploration, ensign? all the planets starting to look alike?"
"not a chance, sir."
i didn't think so.  i feel like i'm still breathing dirt. shuttlepod one to enterprise.
welcome back. how did your treasure hunt turn out?
"well, nothing worth bringing home. the klingons must've been here years ago. all they left was an old power cell and a bunch of empty ration packs."
and a latrine.
yeah. a long hot shower's looking pretty good. shuttlepod one out.
commander? what's wrong?!
take over.
got to dock.
shuttlepod one to enterprise.
i have a medical emergency. commander tucker's collapsed.
can you bring the shuttlepod in?
"yes, sir. at least in simulations."
"slow and steady, ensign. i'll see you in decon."
understood.
call phlox.
"trip, how you feeling?"
like i've been gut-punched by a tellarite.
"doctor, should we start with the bio-gel?"
not until we know what we're dealing with. three other landing parties returned from the surface with no ill effects.
"we need to check out the shuttlepod, too. see if any of its environmental systems were at fault."
"i can do that, captain. i should've thought of that myself."
"stay where you are, trip. phlox needs blood samples."
here's the medkits.
"hoshi, what is it?"
"before commander tucker passed out, he started coughing."
are you feeling any other symptoms?
i'm going to guess that's a yes.
i'll prepare anti-nausea medication. you get me those blood samples as soon as you can.
anything?
"whatever's afflicting them, it's not showing up on the standard scans."
doesn't sound good.
it's not.
i studied your report on how the klingons reacted to the infection.
their response was typical for a species at their level of development.
the klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on his ship.
your point?
captain archer did.
captain archer's done nothing different from the klingons. the launch bay and decon chamber are completely isolated from the rest of the ship.
so it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard.
"precisely. humans don't want to interact with dying crew mates any more than klingons did. if it was left to me, i'd stop our observations immediately. we have nothing more to learn from humans."
"oh, i don't know. they're showing concern for each other. the cardassians did that when they were here, didn't they?"
"ah, but in the end they killed their infected crew, just as the klingons did. the only difference is the time it took to reach that decision."
maybe the humans will surprise us.
"i've been observing aliens for eight hundred years. i've yet to be surprised. still, we should follow protocol. start questioning the infected crew. i'll check in with the doctor."
"okay, this is for nausea, muscle pain, and a cough suppressant."
i'm not coughing anymore. neither are you. maybe we're getting better.
"well, doctor's orders"
"commander, hoshi. just wanted to say hi."
"we're a little busy right now, travis."
can you tell me what's in the hypospray?
something for our symptoms.
yeah. phlox doesn't know what's wrong with us yet.
have either of you faced serious illness before?
aren't you supposed to be on duty?
i was curious to know how you'd compare this experience with other illnesses you might've contracted.
"travis, we really need to get some sleep."
i only have a few more questions.
thanks for stopping by.
but
lieutenant reed. something i can do for you?
headache.
of course. just a moment.
are these are the blood tests for commander tucker and ensign sato?
that's correct.
i'm not detecting any vascular involvement.
"your headache. not a bad one, i take it?"
"no, not yet. although it feels like it could get worse. preventive measure. a lot to do today."
mild analgesic it is.
"doctor, i'm curious to know how you think these tests will help you develop an effective treatment."
so am i.
"i mean, are you approaching this strictly on a symptomatic level, or do you believe there's any similarity to other conditions you've seen in the past?"
"lieutenant, i believe i can put your mind at ease. if your colleagues have returned with a contagious illness, there is no way it can spread to the rest of the ship. we are all quite safe."
"i'm not worried about that, no. i'm interested in the methodology"
"out, out, out! i have a lot to do as well."
you ever see the andromeda strain?
strain of what?
"no, it's a movie. mid-twentieth century."
"let me guess. doctor andromeda builds a monster, and it kills him in the end."
it's about an extraterrestrial disease.
all your movies are the same. i can't keep the stories straight.
this reminds me of my dorm room at starfleet training. got into a lot of trouble at old stc.
i got kicked out.
"well, you can't stop there."
"in my second month, i had a difference of opinion with the company commander. i broke his arm."
can i ask why?
poker.
you broke his arm playing cards?
"he tried to shut down a game i was running for some of the recruits, and a couple of the training staff."
hold on. you ran a floating poker game at stc?
"the way the regulations are worded, gambling was an honour violation only if it took place during duty hours. so i ran the game on weekends. one night my c.c. showed up, tried to sweep all the chips off the table, and i. well, i have a black belt in aikido. i think he was just upset that i hadn't invited him to play."
what happened?
i got a bad conduct discharge.
how the hell did you end up on enterprise?
"starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed to make an example out of me. they let me back in on probation, and here i am."
the closest classification it matches is a virus. highly contagious. silicon-based.
this is an m class planet. all life forms down there should be carbon-based.
"i can only surmise the virus was brought here. perhaps by a meteorite, which could explain why only one of our landing parties encountered it."
is there a treatment?
there's no record of anything like it in the denobulan database.
then it's up to you.
"i'll do all i can, captain, but at the rate the pathogen is reproducing, commander tucker and ensign sato have less than five hours to live."
the doctor identified the pathogen.
that happens thirty seven percent of the time.
but no one's made the decision to abandon the infected crew members.
then this'll likely be one of the times when everyone dies.
"travis, if that's you again."
it's me.
"next time i ask to go on a landing party, talk me out of it, okay?"
you're usually too stubborn to be talked out of anything. but i'll do my best. how's hoshi?
"sleeping. whatever phlox gave us, at least it's helping with the pain."
phlox identified what's causing all the trouble. a silicon-based virus.
i don't suppose he's on his way over here with the cure.
he's working on it. so is t'pol.
"so, there is no cure."
not yet.
i'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline.
"if you mean how much time do you have, it's too early for that kind of talk. your own immune system could knock this thing out."
"i remember exobiology 101, captain. humans are carbon-based. our immune system can't fight silicon."
don't you give up on me.
there are still a bunch of planets out there we haven't seen.
get some rest.
we're looking for signs of elevated intelligence in the species we observe.
"rational intelligence, yes. which archer has not demonstrated. the longer the infected crew remain on board, the greater the risk that quarantine will fail."
i'm sure captain archer knows exactly what the risk is. maybe it's not as important to him as standing by his crew.
it's just as probable that he hasn't realised how hopeless the situation is.
there's a way to be sure.
"we chose the helmsman and the armory officer for good reason. they're both stationed on the bridge, yet neither plays a critical role in a medical emergency."
which is why we should inhabit the doctor and the science officer. archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. we could witness that as it happens.
"the more people we inhabit, the greater the chance that we will inadvertently interfere."
"the more people we inhabit, the more we'll be able to observe."
how many languages can you speak?
"that's not how it works. there are a lot of common patterns. i'm just good at hearing them, that's all."
"good? you're a genius. the way you can pick up an alien language you've never heard before and start spouting it back to them? i got to tell you, i've always been jealous you can do that."
i wish i could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocket knife.
it's a bit more complicated than that. sometimes.
"seriously. engineering, building things. have you always been good at that?"
"when i was a kid, not so good at building. but i was a terror when it came to taking things apart. my folks used to put all our kitchen appliances on the highest shelves. one thanksgiving, i have no idea what i was thinking, but i removed every screw from this big dining room table we had. it was so old, the wood sort of stuck together, so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down. i spent the next month in my room."
how old were you?
"oh, twenty four, twenty five."
how long have they been there?
we didn't see you there.
we didn't want to interrupt you.
how's the research coming?
we're waiting on new test results.
we thought we'd see how you two were progressing.
you're the ones with the medical scanners.
we were more interested in discussing your state of mind.
"look, if you really want to know how we feel, we'd be a lot better knowing you two were back in sickbay working on the cure for this."
of course. we're going there now.
commander. ensign.
they both came to see us. maybe that means they're almost finished.
"yeah, unless there's nothing more they can do."
"they're very brave, the way they're facing death."
their courage isn't at question. their intelligence is.
you want the humans to fail.
"this isn't a competition. either a species' intelligence is developed enough for first contact, or it isn't."
perhaps we should consider other qualities in making our decision.
this is the measure we have used for ten thousand years. it's not our responsibility to change it.
then whose responsibility is it?
"there. if phlox is right about the virus coming here on a meteorite, that crater might be the source of it. which means the klingons at this campsite must have been infected, too. set up a priority channel to starfleet command. we need to find out which klingon ship explored this world, and whether or not they developed a cure."
"right away, sir."
those are the new test results my host is waiting for.
we should leave these creatures to their work undisturbed.
the helmsman and the armoury officer are back on the bridge.
the altered immune receptors weren't effective.
this could indicate the virus is sensitive to ionizing radiation.
"at levels that would be fatal to humans, but it's a start."
i'll prepare new samples for testing.
"hoshi. hoshi, wake up."
i was back in brazil. the shuttle was coming to take me to enterprise.
that's where we are.
captain archer needed me early. i didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my students.
you'll see them again.
"i've heard from starfleet. they're working through diplomatic channels to contact the klingons, but it might not be necessary. this spectrograph identifies a klingon alloy."
that's the signature of standard hull plating.
i found it here.
you've detected a debris cloud in orbit.
it's what's left of a klingon shuttlecraft. their response to an infected landing party. the commander killed his own shuttle crew.
"they didn't even plead for mercy. i mean, they wouldn't, would they? being klingon."
"captain, does knowing what the klingons did help us at all?"
at least we know we don't have to bother asking them if they have a cure.
"but if they had developed one, you'd ask them for it, right?"
on bended knee.
yo se que estoy atrasada. enterprise no se va hasta manana. solo necesito cinco minutos.
"hoshi, we're in quarantine for a reason."
"i have no idea what you're saying, but you can't break the lockout code."
math is just another language.
quarantine breach on d deck. the decon chamber has been unsealed.
someone's overriding the safety interlocks.
shut down all power to d deck. i want those doors sealed.
"hoshi, you have to stop. that's an airlock. you open those doors, we die."
haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya.
"hoshi, come on."
i need to tell them while there's still time.
the captain won't let us down.
trip to whoever's out there. we're back.
"commander, i want you to set your hypospray for three units of sonambutril."
that could drop a horse.
we can't risk hoshi wandering off again. especially since it seems she can override every security safeguard on enterprise.
"yeah, she's full of surprises today."
"sweet dreams, houdini."
anything else?
"it's your turn, trip."
"come on, captain."
"commander, the virus is incompatible with carbon-based life. it's attacking your bodies in ways i can't predict."
"you think i'm going to wander off, too? start opening the wrong doors?"
not if you're sedated.
"sorry, trip."
commander.
i'm just wondering if either one of us will ever wake up again.
you should lie down right away.
i won't argue with that.
how close are you to stopping this?
t'pol and i have isolated a specific frequency of radiation that disrupts the silicon matrix of the virus.
sounds promising.
"unfortunately, the dosage required would be lethal."
there's got to be some kind of a trade-off. a way to produce enough radiation to slow down the virus without killing the patient.
that's what i'm working on.
work faster.
we can stop what this virus is doing to them.
that's not why we're here.
"we came to observe their response to the unexpected, not to watch them suffer."
this is not the place to be having this discussion.
i know where we can talk undisturbed.
the sensations in this host are different from the others. i'm experiencing physical pain.
so am i.
why should any species have to endure this weakness?
because the desire to overcome it will spur them to move beyond the limitations of the physical world.
maybe that isn't true for all species.
it was true for us.
you can't be awake.
not with that much sonambutril.
our ancestors were physical beings.
"well, what worked for us might not work for everyone. humans have different qualities."
nothing i haven't seen before.
what do you have against this species?
what disturbs me most about the humans is their capacity for violence.
extraordinary.
klingons embrace violence. the humans try to avoid it.
"humans say they avoid it, but their words don't match."
we're being observed.
"captain, t'pol. i was just coming to see you. these are brainwave readings of commander tucker and ensign sato."
what is the significance?
the patterns aren't human.
did you know they had this capability?
he must have used denobulan technology.
i see. are you responsible for what happened to my patients?
we had nothing to do with it.
we come here only to study how physical species react to the unknown. you can help by telling us how you detected our presence. that happens in less than two percent of our missions.
commander tucker and ensign sato were sedated. they shouldn't have been able to stand and talk.
"it's been so long since we had physical form, we weren't able to distinguish sleep from sedation."
we'll remember next time.
is there anything you can do to help my patients?
we're here to observe. we can't interfere.
you're interfering with me!
our subjects are human. you're denobulan. you were inhabited a few hours ago. an intriguing experience.
i have no recollection of that.
memories are simple to adjust.
you're going to adjust mine again? so i won't remember a word of this encounter.
or what you observed in the decon chamber.
"if you have that ability, you must be able to help my patients."
we could.
"but we won't. thank you for your help, doctor."
no wonder you erase memories. your behaviour is appalling.
"according to what i read on the doctor's medical padd, he's learned how to stop the infection."
i've seen seven other species develop the radiation cure. but never in time.
did we make first contact with any of them?
of course not. expending resources to attempt an impossible task is not a sign of intelligence. the captain and science officer have decisions to make. we need to return to our original hosts.
"for the radiation to destroy the virus without killing the patient, it must be precisely focused. the emitters in the decon chamber aren't suitable, but the bio-scanner in sickbay is."
"to move them from decon to sickbay, we'll need to expand the quarantined area."
that won't be a problem. we're going to make this work.
ensign sato's condition is deteriorating. we need to hurry.
engaging quarantine.
reed to bridge.
i confirm a positive seal.
environmental systems are isolated.
entering the quarantine zone.
"she's going into oligemic shock. captain, she's dying."
get her on the bioscan bed.
she's stopped breathing.
someone always dies.
hoshi. phlox!
what are you doing?!
this equipment's not designed for ev gloves.
i'll be your hands.
"no, captain, no!"
"right now, enterprise needs a doctor more than it needs a captain."
attach the leads twenty centimetres apart.
i don't understand.
"in eight hundred years, no one's ever done that before?"
no. not once they know it's hopeless.
you need to inject
"forty units of trinephedrine into her heart. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. that can't go deep enough."
"old-fashioned, but effective. angle it slightly more to the right. now, in one quick motion, insert it three centimetres."
press the activator. clear.
"come on, hoshi."
three hundred millijoules. captain.
again!
"three hundred and forty. she's gone. captain, help me with commander tucker."
how many have to die before you'll admit humans are different? we need to stop this.
"i will not depart from protocol. the incident isn't over. when the first death occurs on the ship, there's a sixty eight percent chance the rest of the crew will become infected."
what more will that teach us about them?
all this would have happened whether we were here or not. we are not responsible.
maybe we should be.
we need to move him into the scanner.
"it didn't work. i'm sorry, captain."
"not your fault, doctor."
"there's nothing more i can do for commander tucker, but you've still got a few hours. there has to be something else i can try."
you should continue your work on the bridge. less chance of something going wrong with your suit.
i won't give up.
you know where to find me.
archer to t'pol.
"t'pol here, captain."
i take it you've been watching.
i have.
then you know you're in command?
"yes, captain."
i would like to think you'll stay in command. don't let admiral gardner sneak in someone over your head.
i'll do my best.
i know you will. i need to look after trip now.
we'll talk again. we'll talk again.
"captain, if commander tucker becomes conscious."
i'll let you know right away. archer out.
"i have such respect for you, captain archer."
trip?
not exactly. i'm an organian. a nonphysical life-form.
trip is my host.
what did you do to him?
nothing. we never interfere in the natural development of other species. we only observe.
did you know about the silicon virus?
that's why we come here. to see how different species react when they encounter it.
"you knew about the virus that killed two members of my crew, and you didn't warn us?"
"i wanted to, but it's not up to me."
you're breaking every rule we have.
because they don't apply to this species.
that is not our decision to make.
if we don't challenge the rules
i don't care about your rules. tell me what happens to trip and hoshi when you're finished with their bodies.
we have to leave them as they are.
dead? i understand why you won't get involved with a species' natural development. i've faced that decision myself. it isn't an easy one to make.
then we agree.
"no, we don't. our encounter with the virus was an accident. one that you could have prevented."
then how would we ever learn about you?
ask us. talk to us. just like you're doing now.
talking is a limited form of communication for us. we're much more advanced than humans.
"not from where i'm standing. maybe you've evolved into beings with abilities i can't comprehend, but you've paid a hell of a price. you've lost compassion and empathy. things that give life meaning. and if that's what it takes to be advanced, i don't want any part of it."
"we're leaving now, captain. you won't remember a thing about our presence. and in three hours, you'll die as well."
no. we have the power to save them all.
are you defying me?
"i'm defying the entire protocol. what archer has done today, his act of compassion, you've never witnessed that before."
"in time, we'll study other humans."
"there's another way. experience compassion for yourself. you want to know what it means to be human, you need to do more than observe."
archer to the bridge.
t'pol. go ahead.
you wanted to know when trip was awake.
yes.
"well, you'd better get down here because he's talking up a storm, and so is hoshi."
"captain, hoshi's"
"you too, phlox. maybe one of you can tell me what the hell just happened."
"you're all completely free of the virus. it has to have been a delayed reaction to commander tucker's radiation treatment, but how it spilled over to you and hoshi, i have no explanation."
"obviously, the pathogen's behaviour is more unpredictable than we assumed."
"i'm sure someone at starfleet medical will figure it out. but for now, we're going to leave a warning beacon in orbit here and make sure what happened to us never happens to anyone again."
you realise the consequences of what we've done. we will never be able to observe another species encounter this virus.
"good. i'm looking forward to making my first report. after ten thousand years, the rules need to change."
these humans have not been a good influence on you. i would not encourage further encounters.
i don't think we can avoid them. i'm going to recommend that we start preparations for an official first contact mission.
"indeed. at the rate they're progressing, that'd barely give us five thousand years to prepare."
then we'd better get started.
"bridge to engineering. engineering, respond!"
this is the warship kumari calling imperial command. we've been attacked by a tellarite vessel. primary systems have failed! request immediate
alert. warp containment breach in two minutes.
tellarite swine! they will pay for this. this is shran. all crew to the escape pods! abandon ship.
"the food on this ship isn't fit for animals! that mangy pet of yours would probably taste better. you can either take me home or find a new chef, it's that simple. oh, something else. i want new quarters."
is that so.
"for one thing, my room is too small. there are plasma conduits running across the ceiling. it's noisy, it keeps me up all night."
maybe you'd sleep better in the cargo bay.
what did you say to me?
"this is a starship, not a luxury liner. if you're not satisfied with the accommodations, we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod. maybe you'll have better luck with whoever picks you up. and if you don't like chef's food, don't eat it. from the looks of things, you should probably skip the dessert table while you're at it."
that was a nice touch.
i can't believe i'm supposed to speak to their ambassador like that.
tellarites always have a litany of complaints. it's how they start arguments with people they've just met.
even if they have nothing to complain about?
"in that case, they'll just insult you. whatever they say, you have to respond in kind. otherwise, they'll take offense."
a species that actually thrives on arguing. they probably make good politicians. thanks for the dry run.
sir. i wasn't kidding about porthos.
you think he's mangy?
"no, but you might want to keep him out of sight. tellarites consider canines something of a delicacy."
everything ready for our guests?
"well, just about. but my people are working triple shifts trying to finish that mud bath they wanted."
mud bath?
"apparently the ambassador likes a good soak in the morning. something i don't understand. these tellarites have warp ships, so why do we have to take them to the conference?"
babel's on the far side of andorian space. they won't allow tellarite ships to pass through their territory.
now we're a shuttle service. when are we going to get back to exploring?
this trade dispute is a little more urgent. it could turn into a shooting war if the conference fails.
you people are even uglier than i remember. captain jonathan archer. welcome aboard.
ambassador gral.
i'm told this ship is the pride of starfleet. i find it small and unimpressive.
funny. i was about to say the same thing about you.
you may show us to our quarters. it's far too cold in here.
we're expected to stay on this ship for five days?
"so he says, 'well, i'm not really a pilot.' ah, you don't get it."
warm enough?
the ambassador requested the temperature be increased.
again?
"you know, i like these people more than i thought i would. they don't hold anything back. it's refreshing, speaking your mind for a change."
you don't feel free to speak your mind with the rest of us?
"no, you know what i mean."
no. maybe you'd like to explain it to me. why don't you change your uniform before you stink up the place.
"ah, practicing your tellarite. i get it."
when in rome.
i beg your pardon?
forget it.
the ambassador wants to speak with you.
what a surprise.
have we crossed into andorian space?
a few minutes ago.
"the last time i was here, i was on the command deck of one of our cruisers, driving those blue demons back into their territory. the andorians came to your aid during the xindi crisis."
they helped save my planet.
so why should we trust humans to mediate this dispute? you owe them your lives.
earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do. that isn't going to happen if we choose sides.
your people have no experience in interstellar affairs.
it doesn't seem that you have a lot of other options.
your chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble.
i'm told these are authentic tellarite dishes.
"if i'd wanted to eat like this, i would've stayed at home. i was expecting to sample earth cuisine on this journey."
i'll have him whip something up.
captain archer to the bridge.
we've picked up a message on an andorian channel.
kumari calling imperial command. been attacked. primary systems have failed. request immediate.
that's it.
they have no ships within range.
how long to intercept them at maximum warp?
two hours.
alter course. contact babel. let them know we're going to be delayed.
"judging by the debris pattern, i'd say their reactor breached."
i'm detecting significant quantities of duranium alloy. this was most likely an andorian combat vessel.
escape pods. multiple biosigns.
bring them into the launch bay. tell phlox to stand by for casualties.
this would be easier if you'd take a few steps back.
i hope you've studied andorian physiology.
how many of my crew did you rescue?
nineteen.
our complement was eighty six.
your distress call said you were attacked.
"tellarites! we were escorting our ambassador to the trade conference when they dropped out of warp. the ambassador's ship was destroyed in seconds. tellarites crippled us with their next shot. i've never seen one of their vessels manoeuvre like this one. while those barbarians have been talking peace, they've obviously been improving their warships."
why would the tellarites agree to let earth mediate your dispute if they were planning this strike?
perhaps you should ask them. i suggest you scan for our data recorder. it'll contain the sensor logs of the attack.
"we seem to keep running into each other, captain. it's fortunate enterprise was close by."
it's not a coincidence. we're carrying the tellarite delegation.
they're aboard this ship?
these aren't the people who attacked you.
they may know who did.
shran!
you're on my ship.
you better keep them away from us or there will be bloodshed.
i've analysed these hull fragments. the damage is consistent with tellarite particle cannons.
what about the black box?
"the memory core was damaged, but i was able to reconstruct the last few seconds of sensor data."
"tellarites. set course for andoria, best speed."
these accusations are absurd. we had nothing to do with this alleged attack.
the andorian sensor logs. look them over yourself.
logs can be fabricated.
you saw the debris field.
"for all we know, they destroyed the ship themselves. andorian technology is more advanced than ours. one of our cruisers wouldn't stand a chance against two of theirs!"
i want you to speak to your people. find out what you can.
i am not comfortable with so many andorians aboard. contact your superiors. have them transferred to another vessel.
let's get something straight. you're just a passenger on my ship. i give the orders.
where are you taking them?
back to andoria.
you can't. they'll arrest us. they'll hold us responsible for this incident.
"if you're innocent, i'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
to the kumari.
"from what i saw, she was a fine ship with a good crew."
"i was in command for twelve years. first ship of her class. most of the crew i served with even longer. they were more than colleagues. i knew their spouses, their children. i'm grateful talas survived. if i'd lost her"
i didn't realise there was something going on between the two of you.
"it's a recent development. in the past, i never would've considered a relationship with someone under my command."
what changed?
andorian women are far more aggressive than earth females. she made an overture. i had a choice. charge her with assaulting a superior or mate with her.
i hope you made the right decision.
"i regret that you're drawn into another of our conflicts, captain."
i seem to have a knack for it.
i doubt that war can be avoided this time. when that sensor data is seen by imperial command.
"it doesn't make sense. why agree to a conference, then attack your ambassador?"
tellarites don't think like you or i do. they've been provoking us for months. we've lost six freighters along the border. we know they're responsible.
tellarites claim they've lost ships of their own.
you'd accept their word over ours?
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
there's a ship on an intercept course. it's andorian.
you expecting company?
hail them.
they're not responding.
i'm reading a power buildup. they're opening fire.
what the hell are they doing?
our warp field's destabilising. we're dropping to impulse.
call them off.
let me talk to them. this is commander shran of the imperial guard. call off your attack!
my crew is aboard this ship. do you hear me? abort your attack!
"phase cannons, return fire!"
no damage.
we need to get through their shields. how? they're going to kill all of us if you don't do something.
i need to access your targeting array.
these are the coordinates to their shield generator.
fire when ready.
direct hit.
their shields are still at maximum.
impossible.
shran!
our dorsal plating's almost gone.
starboard thrusters are down.
"torpedoes, maximum yield."
they're moving off.
there's a fluctuation in their power grid.
good work.
"that wasn't my doing, sir. i didn't target their power grid."
"your government asked us to be a part of a conference, and now you're attacking us!"
"this makes perfect sense, captain. they sent a distress call to lure you into a trap."
we have no argument with starfleet.
your people tried to destroy this ship!
"captain, i assure you, what happened does not represent the will or intent of my government."
are you implying the imperial guard's been disloyal?
i don't have to imply anything. the facts speak for themselves.
that may not have been an andorian ship.
what?
its shield matrix had a completely different configuration.
what is that supposed to prove?
"several of our warships have been reported missing over the years. the tellarites could have taken one of them, enhanced its systems."
"he's suffering from paranoia, captain."
i'm not paranoid. your people are trying to kill us!
i've had enough of your lies!
"that's enough! you want to fight, i'll throw both of you in the brig. you can tear each other to pieces."
what happened?
"archer claims to be impartial, but it's obvious he's inclined to believe the andorians. we may have made a mistake in trusting these humans."
they've posted soldiers outside our quarters. we're prisoners on this ship. have you stopped to consider archer may be conspiring with the andorians?
t'pol's found something you're going to want to see.
we retrieved this from your ship's data recorder. this is the power signature of the vessel that destroyed the kumari. this signature belongs to the andorian ship that attacked enterprise.
they're identical.
that can't be correct.
examine the data yourself.
your sensors are unsophisticated. there's been a mistake.
we've confirmed the data.
what are you suggesting? that these two vessels are actually the same ship?
"i don't know what i'm suggesting, but we need to keep our minds open."
the tellarites have violated every accord we've made with them. they can't be trusted. your desire for a peaceful resolution is blinding you from the truth!
"commander, perhaps"
i've heard enough from you! vulcans are expert liars. perhaps your people are behind this.
you're speaking to my first officer.
tucker to the bridge.
go ahead.
warp engines will be online in ten minutes. we'll have hull plating back within an hour.
keep me updated.
we've located the warp trail of the ship that attacked us. we're going to follow it.
some of my crew are in serious condition. they need attention from our physicians.
"it'll take four days to get to andoria. by then, that ship'll be long gone."
something wrong with your meal?
just not hungry. do you think we're moving too fast?
commander tucker believes it's safe to maintain this warp factor.
"that's not what i meant. earth's got a lot riding on the outcome of these talks, but i'm not sure we knew what we were getting into. these people have been feuding for over a century. maybe we should've let your government handle this."
"although our relations have improved recently, it's clear the andorians don't trust us."
"aside from breathing oxygen, it doesn't seem to me that andorians and tellarites have a hell of a lot in common."
the same has been said about humans and vulcans.
hoshi tells me you got a transmission from vulcan this morning.
it was a personal message. it was from koss. our marriage has been officially dissolved.
i'm sorry to hear that.
you have nothing to apologise for.
bridge to captain archer.
archer.
"i believe we've found the andorian ship, sir."
we're on our way.
report.
i have been unable to locate the malfunction.
then i suggest you double your efforts. this is enemy territory. we can't remain here any longer without
there's a vessel approaching.
show me.
you said you found the andorians.
"i don't understand it, sir. the warp trail ends right here."
their primary systems are offline.
hail them.
no response.
biosigns are indeterminate.
magnify. any idea what the spikes are?
they appear to be subspace transceivers.
why would they need so many?
their hull is also lined with multi-spectral emitters.
for what purpose?
i prefer not to speculate.
find out who these people are. take a team of macos with you.
their life support's offline.
bring trip along. see if he can get it working.
"you two, start down there."
"yes, lieutenant."
this whole section's depressurized.
let's hope the rest of this ship isn't as cramped.
i can't read anything through these bulkheads.
stay alert.
the propulsion matrix still isn't functioning.
how much longer?
the repairs are underway.
prepare to overload the core.
what?
"if we can't repair the matrix in time, i'll do whatever is necessary to keep it away from starfleet."
tucker to enterprise.
go ahead.
we haven't run into any welcoming parties yet. we've found a computer interface
but there's no power over here. i'm going to need t'pol's help to bring it online.
uplink your scanner.
what's happening?
i didn't do anything.
sir.
evasive maneuvers. get our people back.
"captain, we're ready to come home whenever you are!"
they've reinforced their hull plating.
we can only transport one at a time.
take carender and myers first!
one of the macos is aboard.  they've hit our eps couplings.
switch to auxiliary.  target their weapons only.
we're losing hull plating.
transporter's offline.
did we get everyone?
just the macos.
t'pol.
the primary phase coil is fused. it'll take several hours to repair it.
"decompression on c deck, section three."
we have to withdraw.
archer to trip.
we've lost the transporter.
understood.
sit tight until we come back for you.
"we'll be fine, sir."
"get us out of here, travis. maximum warp."
they're retreating.
pursuit course.
trip!
you're down to eight minutes.
thanks. we're not going to get very far only sharing your supply.
i'll try to get their life support online.
"right. with our luck, they probably breathe fluorine."
warp four point nine.
they're still closing.
warp five.
they've matched our speed.
let's see what those new injectors can do
five point oh two. point oh four. five point oh six.
they're falling behind.
the injector's stabilised. we're holding speed.
maintain your heading.
you're going to wear out the deck plating. commander.
gral knows more about these attacks than he's admitting. how can archer be so blind.
we have no choice but to let him deal with the situation.
"i'm not going to entrust the security of andoria to the pinkskins or anyone else. we trusted the tellarites once. we won't make that mistake again. with the appropriate persuasion, gral will talk."
i doubt archer's capable of a thorough interrogation.
then i'll have to question him myself.
there are guards outside our quarters. we don't even know what deck the ambassador's on.
can you bypass their security protocols?
any luck?
i can't find anything that even looks like an atmosphere recycler. i'm starting to wonder if this ship even has life support.
they must have atmosphere on their bridge.
"well, let's hope they don't mind sharing."
the starfleet ship has moved out of sensor range.
the humans have seen too much. we can't allow them to escape.
this vessel is a prototype. i told you it wasn't ready for combat.
find them!
come in.
i analysed the data commander tucker sent back. the ship doesn't appear to be tellarite or andorian.
do we have any idea who built it?
there's a remote possibility. its power matrix utilises boridium cells. we encountered a similar technology more than two years ago.
the romulan minefield. but the power cells on those mines were much larger and more primitive.
i did say it was a remote possibility.
"if this is a romulan ship, why would they be stirring up trouble so far from home?"
they have been known to act aggressively against species they see as a threat.
"we've never threatened them. as far as i know, neither have the andorians or tellarites. maybe they're afraid of something else. the species in this region have a history of not getting along. this conference could've been the first step in changing that."
you believe they fear an alliance?
the conference has been postponed indefinitely. it doesn't sound like there's going to be an alliance any time soon. anything from trip?
we're still too far away to detect a comm. signal.
"well, keep me updated."
another access tube?
i'm starting to wonder if this ship even has a bridge.
yeah.
"your air's down to twenty six minutes, malcolm."
perhaps it's on one of the lower levels. there's no rule that says the bridge has to be at the top of the ship.
you see these data conduits? chances are they converge on the bridge.
so i understand our first officer's no longer married.
yeah?
"well, i was wondering what your intentions were."
"well, who are you, her father?"
no. simply curious.
malcolm! we've got something.
what is it?
a maneuvering thruster.
perhaps they'll be kind enough to give us the specs.
it's chemically fuelled. liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
we could refill our tanks.
can i help you?
i was hoping we could talk. i doubt you're aware of this. how could you be?
andorian women are permitted one final conquest before their wedding. i've never had relations with a member of your species. i was hoping you'd indulge me.
go back to your quarters.
you won't even consider it?
what is it?
there's a problem with one of the liquid fuel tanks.
another malfunction?
no. the starboard transfer valve has been opened manually.
activate internal sensors.
how are you holding up?
a little light-headed.
that's nothing new. i should've known better.
about what?
getting involved with a fellow officer. there's nothing going on between us anymore if you're interested.
that's not why i asked.
"well, you said she had an awfully nice bum."
this is true.
pure oxygen. be my guest.
thanks.
: hold. magnify that image. humans.
if they make their way to the bridge.
are the inertial stabilisers offline?
they are.
evasive manoeuvres.
magnetise your boots.
we mustn't be
what is this?
i want to know why my ship was attacked. and then you're going to answer for your crimes against my people.
what did you find?
we've discovered the function of the emitters on their hull.
they're holographic projectors. it's a camouflage system. they can use it to mimic the appearance of almost any ship.
malcolm analysed the andorian debris. he said that ship was destroyed by tellarite weapons.
their disruptor utilises triphasic emitters. they can simulate different kinds of weapons.
the one thing they couldn't mask is their power signature. that's why they
security to captain archer.
go ahead.
"there's weapons fire on g deck, outside the tellarites' quarters."
on my way. get the macos down there. seal off g deck.
we know your government's behind the disappearance of our freighters.
we had nothing to do with that!
"you may have been able to convince archer, but i'm not so gullible. i don't know a lot about starfleet weapons, but i believe this setting will bore right through that thick hide of yours. the truth. now!"
"stay out of this, pinkskin."
"shran, listen to me. the ship that attacked you wasn't tellarite."
i was there!
i can prove it was someone else.
you're both being set up. your ship was attacked because someone didn't want this conference to go forward.
who?
"i'm asking you, one captain to another. look at the evidence before you do something you're going to regret."
get phlox down here.
how bad?
it's only superficial. you'll be fine.
the bridge should be through there.
they've entered the bridge.
they won't last much longer.
it'll have to wait. we're approaching our next target.
stabilise the drone for battle. activating the holographic skin.
use this configuration.
you still in one piece?
feel that? we're dropping out of warp.
target acquired.
engage visual sensors.
the rigelians are hailing us.
answer them.
we're firing at someone.
"well, brace yourself. whoever it is, they'll be sure to fire back."
the drone is taking damage.
give the rigelians time to send their distress call. now destroy them.
it was a heavily-armed scoutship with a crew of seventeen. there were no survivors.
why does starfleet think this is connected to the other incidents?
rigelians transmitted a visual record of the ship that attacked them.
"i'm told their trade commission is demanding compensation, and my arrest. whoever's behind these attacks, they're trying to do more than provoke a war between andorians and tellarites. this is an attempt to destabilise the entire region. we need to find the marauder before it attacks again."
i've found a way to detect their warp signature. and travis designed a sensor grid that should extend our range.
how many ships will it take to make this work?
only one hundred and twenty eight.
there's just one way we can get that many ships to help us.
talas.
have you come to take me home?
i think this denobulan doctor is secretly in love with you. he wants to keep you to himself.
you said my wound was superficial.
"you were only grazed, but the phase pistol was set to kill."
that tellarite pig.
is there any other kind?
i've seen what phase-pulse infection can do to andorians.
"you're going to be fine. we'll be home soon, the two of us."
don't let me die unavenged.
i won't.
i'm sorry. she needs to rest.
see what i mean? he can't get enough of you. i'm jealous.
doctor.
how is she?
lucky to be alive.
i have a proposal.
"if it involves killing tellarites, i'm all for it."
"your ship is adrift in enemy space, damaged and defenceless, because of a single rigelian scoutship? is that what you want me to report to the senate?"
the drone has taken damage before. it's designed to self-repair.
if our enemies find it.
"that's the point of this project. no prisoners to capture, no bodies to recover. these drone ships can never be traced back to us."
this prototype's a modified warbird. the vulcans would identify it the moment they inspected the propulsion matrix.
the vulcans won't get anywhere near it.
"don't underestimate our distant brothers. bring your ship home. i'll tell the senate that your test has been a success. otherwise, they'll make someone pay for this failure."
"and i promise you, it won't be me. jolan tru, admiral."
come in.
"admiral gardner just called. he's sending every ship available, but at top speed it'll take weeks for most of them to get here."
what about columbia?
she's stuck in dry dock. engine trouble. did you get through to your people?
minister t'pau is dispatching twenty three vessels.
that's all?
the high command has been disbanded. many of our ships no longer have full crew compliments.
t'pau could have picked a better time to clean house.
andorian and tellarite fleet deployments?
"i'm thinking of asking them to join us. without more ships, our sensor net's going to have a gaping hole. the marauder could fly right through it, and we'd never know."
"have you discussed this with commander shran, or ambassador gral?"
not yet.
"even if both sides were to agree, which seems unlikely, their deployments would have to be co-ordinated, a command hierarchy established."
an andorian captain might have a problem taking orders from a tellarite?
precisely.
"there's one species that's on friendly terms with both of them. humans. enterprise could serve as the command ship, relaying all orders. the other ships would only have to exchange communication codes."
it might work.
you don't sound too optimistic.
these have four species have never co-operated on a mutual endeavour.
"as far as i know, no one's ever tried to get them together before. from what i've heard about these romulans, they mean business. if they're behind these attacks, we have to find some way to stop them, or next time, they might come back with a thousand of those ships."
"some of these circuits are live, but i don't know what they're for."
and i can't figure out what half this stuff is.
what about the other half?
"well, i think i found an environmental system."
that'd make sense. these consoles look like crew stations.
here goes.
"well, how about that. in a few minutes, we'll have heat and air."
do you think it's possible that there's no one else on board?
why would a robot ship have a bridge like this?
it could be a prototype. outfit an existing ship with the latest in computer controls.
"well, that'd make things a whole lot easier for us."
how's that?
"if this ship's run by computer, what we need to do is find the off switch."
i'd rather co-habit with klingon targs than join forces with tellarites.
your personal mating preference is no concern of mine.
"if you're waiting for me to stop you, don't worry. i won't."
you heard what he said.
"and i heard what you said. so now it's time for both of you to listen to me. instead of insulting you to make you feel at home, and putting up with your arrogance as a sign of my respect, why don't the two of you try behaving like humans for a change?"
and you said you wouldn't be insulting.
"there's one thing humans seem to do better than any species we've met. when we're faced with a common threat, we put our differences aside and try to co-operate. someone is determined to start a war in this region. i've shown you how we can stop them. but if you don't understand that, feel free to strangle each other. just remember, that's exactly what this marauder wants you to do."
we've gone back to warp.
"just when it happened, i got a power spike from one of these conduits."
do you think warp control runs through here?
"if this ship was originally built for a crew, all of its controls should connect to the bridge. maybe they never got disconnected. keep your eyes on these consoles."
did you do that?
even money we just found their propulsion controls.
what are they doing?
i can't tell for sure. visual surveillance is offline. the drone is dropping out of warp.
you've found the off switch?
all i did was interrupt the power to the warp controls. there's probably a backup that'll switch on in a few minutes.
can you make any sense of this?
where's hoshi when you need her?
that's where we are.
i'm going to guess that's the power circuit i just shut down.
"if this were enterprise, that'd be the power coupling for the entire warp control system, including the backups."
should be right through there.
maestro.
one of them's left the bridge. he's in the service junction.
why?
it appears he's located the main coupling for the warp matrix.
what else is in there?
just what we need to kill him.
"okay, malcolm, i'm going to flip through these like circuit breakers. let me know how the diagram changes."
ready when you are.
there's the first one.
it went out.
he's disabling the warp system.
is self-repair still activated?
it'll take more than a day to reroute the major circuits.
we don't have a day.
one of them is still in the service junction.
seal him in.
i'm going to see if there's a communications circuit we can tap into.
"malcolm!  malcolm, did you touch something?"
wasn't me.
do the hatch controls work on your side?
negative. they're not responding.
"listen carefully, and you won't be harmed."
who are you?
i control the ship.
"not anymore, you don't."
"commander, what's happening?"
reactor coolant. radiation's at a hundred roentgens and climbing.
"that gives you seven minutes, commander. re-establish the warp matrix, or you will die."
compliments of the imperial guard. these are the communication codes we'll use for the joint operation.
"gral's informed me that the tellarites are also taking part, so they'll need these codes as well."
do what you have to.
i appreciate your cooperation.
"you're not especially difficult to work with, captain. unlike tellarites, you understand ethics and try to live by them."
try?
"well, nobody's perfect. have you served on all these vessels?"
"a few of them are a bit before my time, but they were all named enterprise. this one sailed earth's oceans almost four hundred years ago."
"my vessel, the kumari, was named for the first ice-cutter to circumnavigate andoria. perhaps future ships will be named after our vessels, especially if we do something historic together."
there's no reason our people can't become allies.
agreed.
"pay attention to that board, malcolm. i'm going to try to cut power to the reactor."
i've got a better idea. make sure you're well away from the door.
"you're wasting time, commander. the radiation will be fatal in three minutes."
i can save you.
"malcolm, what happened to the board?"
everything's off.
that's more like it. radiation's falling.
they've taken the reactor offline.
activate the backup sequencer.
i'm still in control. there is nothing you can do to save your life
except follow my instructions.
we've received the final confirmations. all one hundred and twenty eight ships are in position.
phlox to captain archer.
go ahead.
i require you in sickbay as soon as possible.
no.
i did everything i could.
you said she'd recover.
shran.
no.
"commander, what's your status?"
i should've brought my helmet. radiation's at one eighty and climbing. i can't shut it down.
you don't have to die like this.
you're not getting this ship back.
"you're wrong, commander."
eventually it will repair itself.
you'll have died for nothing.
all right. i'll reconnect the matrix. open the hatch!
"malcolm, no! that's an order!"
commander?
"do your duty, malcolm."
restore the matrix. save your commander's life.
"there. every tellarite ship is connected to your sensor network, despite the inefficient andorian codes."
now comes the hard part. we have to sit and wait.
we're not a patient people.
i've noticed. maybe that's something we can work
i only want to talk to him! i only want to talk.
we're listening.
"you  need to know about talas, the woman you killed."
she attacked us.
"the attack was over when you shot her, but i'm not here to argue that. her family was privileged, her parents wealthy. she could've chosen any career, never known discomfort. but she felt the call of duty. she pledged her life to the imperial guard. talas could've had anything. anyone. she chose me. i just wanted you to know."
"it's her blood. when a guardsman dies far from home, his companions, her companions, carry part of her back to the ice of andoria. i wanted you to know that, too"
before you die!
that's enough!
not until his blood pays for hers!
keep him away!
you will face justice at my hands!
that's not going to happen on my ship.
"yes, it will, pinkskin, because if you and the tellarites don't show respect for andorian tradition, the imperial guard will withdraw its ships."
what tradition?
"unless this murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance is finished!"
i'm reconnecting the warp matrix!
shut off the radiation!
when you're finished.
there! now shut it off! and open this hatch!
"commander, stay with me."
the matrix has been reactivated.
then we don't need the humans anymore.
why didn't you listen to me?
we're better off here than on the bridge.
take it to warp. set a course for home.
we're back at warp. i ordered you not to help them.
"i apologise for saving your life, commander. it won't happen again."
sorry.
"according to the bridge schematic, this is an access panel."
where's it lead?
away from the bridge.
what does that give us?
we should assume that we're being monitored. did you ever read the manual that came with that thing?
the warning about inadvertent overload?
how long does it take?
"by now, less than a minute."
what access panel are they talking about?
"it leads into the superstructure, away from any critical equipment."
we'll deal with them when the drone returns.
we've got to be a safe distance by now.
i wired it directly into the power conduit.
we've lost contact.
"the andorian tradition shran wants to follow is called the ushann. basically, it's a duel to the death."
the combatants fight with these.
it's called an ushann-tor.
it's an ice-miner's tool. andorians play with them as children. a tellarite won't stand a chance using one against shran.
i don't think that's going to be an issue. ambassador gral's refusing to let naarg fight.
andorians will consider that a further insult.
what else do we know about this tradition?
"please, make yourself at home. an old friend. i carry it everywhere."
"two hours ago, we spoke about a new partnership between andoria and earth."
a benefit to both our worlds.
you're throwing it away for personal vengeance.
"there's more to this than talas. i lost my ship, almost my entire crew. if i do nothing to avenge these losses, what kind of leader am i? why should any soldier follow me again? besides, you should be wishing me luck. i provide a voice for your species at the imperial guard. i'm valuable to humans."
"i spoke to ambassador gral about the rules of the ushann. specifically, the right of substitution."
the ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling?
not the ambassador.
you wouldn't.
i'm the substitute. you're going to have to fight me.
i'm going to have to kill you. you're my friend.
then call it off.
i can't.
you did all this with one phase pistol?
you're good at building things. i'm good at blowing them up.
i'm thinking we should get to the outer hull.
"no, we might be safer trying to find another area with life-support."
"the hull's covered with subspace transceivers. if i can link one of them to our communicators, we might be able to contact enterprise."
"admiral, the drone's restored contact. the repair systems are starting to work."
it'll take days. let me know when it's restored its ability to self-destruct.
come in.
updating your will?
you expect me to lose?
"shran is a member of the imperial guard, trained in combat from childhood. he won't back down."
he can't. i understand.
"if you back down, the imperial guard will withdraw their ships."
"if i kill shran, or one of the tellarites does, the andorians will pull out anyway. the tellarites'll do the same thing if shran kills one of them. so, i'm the only one who can be killed, because starfleet won't withdraw. this operation is important, considering that it might lead to an alliance of planets."
vulcans have a saying. one man can summon the future. what happens if that man throws away his life before his time?
"if i've learned anything these past few years on enterprise, it's that the future isn't fixed."
if anything happens to you.
then i'd better make sure that nothing does.
didn't expect to find you up this late.
what are you doing here?
too wired to sleep. hard to believe the captain's going to be fighting a duel to the death in a few hours.
"barbaric, if you ask me."
what are you looking at?
code of the ushann. t'pol wants me to go over it again. see if i can find a way out of this mess.
"the last i heard, the captain sounded determined to go through with it."
she wants me to find a loophole. some way to forfeit without offending the andorians.
two of us could get through that a lot faster.
look at this. either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely if there are no children to continue his clan.
how does that help us?
"as far as i know, captain archer doesn't have any kids. if he's killed, his clan would die with him."
that rule only applies if he's married.
don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours.
"even if we could, something tells me the andorians would cry foul. there are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honour code. there has got to be one that can get him out of this."
"instead of looking for a loophole, maybe we should be trying to find a way for the captain to win."
"if the captain wins, shran's dead. the alliance falls apart."
have you ever been to nobelia prime?
not recently.
"the tribal elders there, they can challenge you to a duel if you look at them the wrong way. happened to my father."
how did he get out of it?
which one of these has the combat rules?
"don't try and block with this. when he swings, intercept, deflect, and hook it away."
better to insert between the eyes and twist.
"andorian metabolism is higher than humans'. keep moving, you'll exhaust him."
how about i just win?
take your places. there is still time to end this.
it can only end one way. this is not what i wanted.
things have a way of turning out differently than we expect.
"i'm glad we met. in your honour, i'll continue to support co-operation between the imperial guard and your species."
let's get this over with. i got a ship to run.
"i'll take your blood to andoria, to the wall of heroes."
not today.
you have the first move.
"give up. a single stroke, and there'll be no pain."
you think i'm losing? i'm just trying to make you look good in front of your soldiers.
now do you give up?
never!
wrong choice.
you should've cut off my head.
"i considered it, but i still need your help."
what good is a guardsman without two antennae?
you'll begin to compensate within a day or two.
they take nine months to grow back.
"if left untreated. with electrical stimulation and brisk cranial massage, you'll be back to normal in half that time."
i was told that the loss of an antenna wasn't critical.
you humiliated me.
and that the ushann is settled when one fighter is rendered defenceless. are we done?
you respected andorian tradition. it's settled.
bridge to captain archer.
four ships have located the marauder's power signature.
can you pick up biosigns?
not at this distance.
"travis, plot an intercept course. take us to maximum warp."
intercept in forty seven minutes.
alert the fleet.
the drone's sensors have detected enterprise. it's closing.
activate the holographic skin.
something's starting to draw a lot of power. it's all those systems that went down in the explosion. they're coming back online.
what about the warp matrix?
"not yet, but if you want to contact enterprise, we'd better hurry."
approaching visual range.
on screen. magnify.
vulcan?
check their power signature.
it doesn't match.
tactical alert. charge weapons.
enterprise will reach the drone before the matrix is restored.
"senator, i was not told of your visit."
"you allowed our enemies to board and disable the drone. i have my sources, admiral."
then you know we are about to engage the human ship.
i'm here to witness its destruction.
one minute.
we have biosigns. two humans.
can you get a transporter lock?
we'll need to be much closer.
open a channel. archer to tucker and reed. respond.
"we're both here, captain."
fire.
target its weapons.
i can't get a lock through the camouflage.
"take out the emitters, but don't puncture the hull."
they do know we're on board?
they're probably trying to take out the weapons. enterprise
any chance of using the transporter?
you have to get closer to the hull.
can you do that?
we're on our way.
we've lost the emitters.
warp status?
two minutes. more enemy ships are closing. if enterprise stops the self-repair sequence.
the drone will escape.
"enterprise, we're at the hull!"
the ship's movement is too erratic. i can't get a lock.
they're targeting our warp core. hull plating's at forty three percent.  thirty six percent.
"shut down weapons. all power to hull plating. travis, bring us about. trip, malcolm, we can make one more pass. get the hell out of there."
their weapons are offline. they're vulnerable.
i can't imagine how things could get much worse!
i can.
they're clear.  sensors are down. i've lost them.
six more enemy ships within range.
twenty seconds to warp.
"we've got company, alliance ships."
tell them not to fire. our people are out there.
the matrix is restored.
withdraw.
they left us. you were right. this is worse.
anyone out there need a lift?
"if i had to wear this helmet for one more minute, i swear it would've fused to my skull. i tell you, i'd like to find the designer of this suit and make him wear it for three days."
yeah. thanks for what you did back there.
"yeah, you would've done the same for me."
"no, you took a big chance. which makes what i have to do all the more difficult. i'm putting you on report."
you're what?
you disobeyed a direct order.
"i saved your life! if you put a reprimand in my file, it could be years before i'm even eligible for"
are you pulling my leg?
"malcolm, you're just such an easy target."
the marauder got away. one of the tellarite ships was hit. an andorian warship rescued the crew.
"so, it's still out there. as you said, a common threat."
i believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes.
why wait until we get to babel?
the drone has re-entered romulan space.
disconnect the pilot.
this mission was supposed to cause dissension in the region. it's had the opposite effect.
"senator, you have a right"
the andorians and tellarites have formed an alliance. they're working together for the first time in history.
it won't last.
the group of senators doesn't share your optimism. they're presenting a motion to cancel this mission.
that would be a mistake.
the mistake was mine when i supported this endeavour. do you realise how you've weakened my position?
"when this is over, you'll be first consul."
"after a failure of this magnitude, i could be dead."
"this isn't a failure. it's a setback. we have to deal with the humans. they are the ones that brought the andorians and tellarites together. the second drone ship is armed and ready for battle. with two ships, i can deliver a devastating blow. we will hunt down enterprise and destroy it."
the drone is being operated by telepresence. it's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote location.
we experimented with that years ago. nothing came of it.
"a pilot can operate the drone from a great distance, over many light years."
"so, there really was no one on that ship."
"and the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and sound."
essentially.
doesn't seem fair.
is there any way to interrupt this telepresence?
"i'm still reviewing the data commander tucker brought back, but i believe we can construct our own telepresence unit."
and use it to hijack their ship?
doubtful. the most we can hope for is to interfere with their navigation.
get started.
there is one problem. the data from the marauder also contained a brain wave pattern. i believe it belongs to the pilot.
i've analyzed it. the individual is highly telepathic.
"apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device."
vulcans have telepathic powers.
not to this extent.
can you identify the species?
"there's no exact match in my database. however, the nearest genome is andorian."
the humans did considerable damage to the bridge. we'll have to replace the entire receiver array.
assign every spare man to the repair crew.
the ship isn't what concerns me. it's the pilot.
what about him?
operating the vessel is extremely taxing.
he'll have at least three days to rest.
"that won't be enough. he's suffering from severe mental fatigue. piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two"
then you'll have to increase the stimulants.
the dosage is already at a dangerous level. he could be permanently damaged. he could die.
"if i didn't know you better, i would say you're more concerned with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission."
"without the pilot, there would be no mission."
"just keep him alive long enough to destroy the earth ship. after that, his health is of little consequence."
come in.
i just received a transmission. our scientists identified the brain wave pattern.
and?
"it's from my world, but it's not from any andorian you'd know. it's aenar. they're a kind of subspecies. blind ice-dwellers. for most of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the northern wastes. they're extremely secretive. i can count on one hand the number of andorians who've seen one face-to-face."
could they have built a ship like the marauder?
"i seriously doubt they have the capacity. there are only a few thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. they don't believe in violence."
one of them does.
it seems that way.
we need to find out who's controlling that ship.
agreed.
travis.
"yes, sir?"
"set a course for andoria, maximum warp."
you should rest.
i just need a second.
phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty.
phlox? you were talking to him about me?
it came up in conversation.
"right. well, i don't have the option of taking a break. the captain needs this done fast."
i can manage.
"you might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of your league. these work better when you strip off the duranite caps. don't ask me why, they just do."
i'll make a note of that.
"you know, when i was on that ship with malcolm i was convinced i was going to die. you ever been there?"
"since enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more than one occasion."
"i'm not talking close scrapes. i mean when you're in a bad situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have time to think about it."
"in the expanse, when we were attempting to destroy sphere forty one, i didn't believe we'd survive."
what went through your mind?
whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector array. why do you ask?
just curious.
"the aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. once you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. i'd feel much better about this if you'd take a couple of macos with you."
"we go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of them."
we're going alone.
"captain, we don't know anything about these people."
that's why we're here. energise.
taste that air. really gets the blood running.
twenty eight below?
"lucky for you, it's the middle of summer."
yeah.
the entrance is twenty metres ahead. the vulcans say the desert teaches men the meaning of endurance. but it's the ice that forges real strength.
it's hard to believe anything can survive here.
it isn't easy. andorian cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal energy. i didn't see the sun till i was fifteen.
"careful, shran. you don't have your balance back yet."
"hands off, pinkskin. these tunnels branch out for thousands of kilometres. not a good place to get lost."
we'll be ready to launch in twelve hours.
and the pilot?
he's resting.
will he be ready?
i'll make sure that he is.
spoken like a soldier.
i'm a scientist.
"we're all soldiers, nijil, from the moment we're born. when we forget that we invite disaster. you know i was once a senator?"
no.
many years ago. vrax and i were colleagues. i even considered him a friend.
what happened?
i made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited expansion. i asked the question. is conquest truly the best course for our people? and i was expelled.
i'm sorry.
"i'm not trying to evoke your pity. i want you to learn from my experience. when i was led away from the senate chamber, i vowed never to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose."
i understand.
continue with your preparations.
ice-bores. worms. they live in the ice. generate heat through a chemical reaction. big swarm came through here a day or two ago.
i'm sure phlox would love to get his hands on one.
"best to avoid them. when i was a boy, i stumbled into a large den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body."
"shran, listen to me. we should find another way."
"afraid of heights, captain?"
shran!
the ice gave out beneath me.
you're losing a lot of blood. hold still.
"hold still. bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start again."
we can't stay here. we'll freeze to death.
archer to enterprise. archer to enterprise.
we're well inside the dampening field.
it doesn't hurt to try. how far are we from the aenar?
i think we just got a lot closer.
hello. we need your help. my friend's been hurt.
we'll assist you.
there's not as much data on the neural interface as i'd like.
it's all we have.
"i can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous."
how dangerous?
"if the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic shock, possibly resulting in brain damage."
there's got to be some way we can make it safer.
"diagnostics will only tell us so much, i'm afraid."
when can we test it?
a day.
i want to be the first one to try it out.
you're not telepathic. it wouldn't be a true measure of the unit's effectiveness.
"well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage."
i'll test the unit.
you're the ranking officer. too risky.
"considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable."
we could at least wait until the captain gets back.
our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he returns. that means conducting a full series of tests. the discussion's closed. we have a lot of work to do.
your wound is healing well. you'll be able to walk on your own in a few hours.
my thanks.
you're captain archer.
you can read minds.
"we have a strict law here, captain. no one may enter another's thoughts without permission. i know your name because the andorian chancellor contacted us."
i need to speak with someone in authority.
"we assign our leaders as the need arises. for this occasion, i have been chosen as speaker."
i take it you know why we're here.
"i know what the andorians have told us. someone's been attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved."
it's a bit more complicated than that.
"it will save time and foster our trust, if i can have your thoughts."
go ahead.
"you have an interesting mind, captain. many facets."
thank you.
some of those facets are in conflict.
that explains a lot.
shran.
the evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. it seems there was an aenar controlling that ship.
but you're sceptical.
"we're a nonviolent people. that a member of our race could cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing."
do you have any idea who it could be?
there's one possibility.
who?
"a year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting ice-bores. we assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never found his body."
now you know why.
gareb would not be doing this voluntarily.
you think he was abducted?
it's the best explanation.
it doesn't matter why he's doing it. he has to be stopped.
this device that you're building aboard your ship.
we're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the marauder.
you will need one of us to operate it.
"you owe us that much, at least."
i'll consult with the others.
"coffee, strong."
commander.
hey.
trip. i appreciate your concern for my safety.
i just don't want enterprise to lose a good officer.
i think you're letting your feelings impact your work.
"my work's as good as it's ever been. as far as my feelings go, they're purely professional."
i've never been able to sleep with someone standing at the foot of my bed.
i didn't mean to disturb you.
"actually, i was awake. what is it?"
i've never met a blueskin.
you're blind. how can you tell my skin is blue?
don't ask me to explain. i was never very good at science.
"is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises above freezing for weeks at a time?"
"every few years, there's a heat wave. i've been on worlds where the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water."
i can't imagine such a place.
i'm trying to forget it. i lost ten percent of my body weight in two days.
i came here to apologise.
for what?
"when i saw you for the first time, i sensed some of your thoughts. i didn't intend to."
it's never been all that hard to figure out what i'm thinking.
"i know what it's like to lose someone. gareb, the one who's missing, he's my brother."
i'm sorry.
"he would never hurt anyone, not intentionally."
so we've been told.
do you think he's in pain?
there's no way of knowing.
"i have nightmares. gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage. he's calling for me. he wants me to rescue him."
forgive me.
how do you feel?
i just need a moment.
whenever you're ready. indicator's moving. doc?
"so far, so good."
i'll be damned. it's working.
she okay?
her synaptic response is erratic.
i'll be fine.
"it's getting worse, commander."
that's enough. shut it down!
you're all right.
it worked.
"i'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again."
"you said gareb was abducted. if that's true, don't you want to help him?"
not with violence.
we're trying to stop violence.
"i won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our decision stands."
"forget it, captain. they've never even helped defend their own world. we're wasting our time."
systems ready.
launch the drones.
you need to rest.
i've had enough rest.
we should clear the dampening field soon.
wait
what is it?
a swarm.
i don't see anything.
"it'll take a few minutes for them to pass. gareb and i loved chasing ice-bores. once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught hundreds of them. we were almost at the surface. my family was very worried. they're going to be worried about me now."
are you sure you want to do this?
"i won't abandon my brother. what's it like, your ship?"
warm.
she wants to try again. you think it's smart?
"you know the risks. so does commander t'pol. commander, she's doing her job."
she's going to hurt herself.
take my advice. don't interfere.
i can't believe i'm getting this from you now. has everyone on this ship gone crazy?
not everyone.
"oh, i'm crazy?"
"it's not your fault. as far as i know, there are no species in the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation."
you're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. vulcan neuro-pressure was your idea.
you were having trouble sleeping.
what the hell am i going to do?
this is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. you'll have to suffer through it.
we've been here before.
"he's right, we're going in circles. they're trying to stop us."
how?
they're not letting us see the path to the surface.
it's time to come back.
i can't.
i don't want to fight anyone. i want to help my brother.
she's doing what she thinks is right.
she's betraying her people.
that's not true. shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own conscience?
how do you know? have you read her mind? i thought that was against your custom.
jhamel.
take my thoughts.
yes.
very well.
anything on long range sensors?
not yet.
what's our eta?
we'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours.
"tell malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners. if we run into that marauder again, i want to make sure every shot counts."
understood.
report?
she's good to go.
whenever you're ready.
"i'm ready, captain."
a lot of movement. fifty percent spike.
we can stop anytime you like.
it's strangely enjoyable.
she's maxed it out.
is that good?
very good.
is there another test we can try?
we could simulate a course correction.
synaptic trouble.
shut it down!
"i'm picking up debris. hull fragments. nacelle casings. several bodies, human."
keep scanning. try to find the marauder's warp signature.
is there any word from sickbay?
"she's going to be okay, but phlox says it's too dangerous to try again. looks like we went all the way to andoria for nothing."
what happened?
you had a convulsion. you're all right now.
"i was dreaming about gareb. i failed, didn't i?"
ridiculous. that kind of bravery is never a failure. i'm a commander in the imperial guard. i'd be afraid to go anywhere near that thing.
talas was a fortunate woman.
i was the fortunate one.
"my brother is going to die, isn't he?"
i won't hear that from you.
it's hard to be strong.
you make it look easy. keep being strong. for me.
a ship's dropping out of warp. it appears to be a tellarite freighter.
tactical alert. hail them. target their engines.
if it is a freighter.
anything?
one hundred kilometres.
fire.
what's happening?
we're under attack. i'm going to the bridge.
wait. i can feel him.
"connect me to the device, i need to try again."
i can reach him. i can make him stop.
let her try.
enterprise is taking heavy damage.
target with the second drone. attack vector one seven seven.
it may not be necessary.
follow my orders.
"yes, admiral."
"another ship's approaching, bearing oh one six mark twelve. an andorian battle cruiser."
t'pol?
it's power signature is not andorian.
target them!
"captain, i'm picking up an energy reading from sickbay. it's the telepresence unit."
archer to sickbay. what's going on?
is she up to it?
she's quite insistent.
cortical fluctuation. it could trigger a seizure.
jhamel.
i can do it.
disconnect her. now!
no!
she can do this.
they've lost warp power.
continue targeting their engines.
someone's tapping into the telemetric array.
jhamel?
it's me.
it's not possible. how?
you have to stop what you're doing.
where are you?
i'm on the ship you're attacking.
both drones are coming to a stop. we're defenceless.
they've stopped firing.
i thought you were dead. they said i was the last surviving aenar.
they lied to you.
i've killed so many people.
"it wasn't you. it was them, they forced you. you can stop it. you know what you have to do."
the first drone is targeting the second.
take all weapons offline.
i've lost access.
they're attacking each other.
"let's give them a hand. photonic torpedoes, full spread."
"aye, sir."
stop this! now.
no!
resume your attack on the earth ship.
"remember me, jhamel."
gareb!
i want to thank you again.
"i owe you a thanks. if i hadn't come with you, my brother would have died alone. goodbye, captain."
goodbye.
i regret much of what happened between us recently.
same here.
"when you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with another one. i may not see you for a while."
if there's anything we can do or say on your behalf.
"i appreciate the offer. let's just see what the future brings. try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin."
"senator, i assume i'm under arrest."
we're both under arrest.
"so it seems i'll be serving with you again. nijil, goodbye."
"the failure is mine, not yours."
spoken like a soldier.
come in.
i've been looking over your report. i think you're being a little hard on yourself.
there's no getting around it. i missed a ten degree variance in the telepresence emitter.
i spoke with phlox. he doesn't think it had anything to do with jhamel's seizure.
"but he can't be sure. either way, i should have caught it."
we were all under a lot of pressure.
my mind wasn't on the job.
"if that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now."
"captain, i want a transfer."
where?
columbia. they need experienced people.
you turned them down twice before. why now?
i think i can do some good over there.
"i need you here, trip."
they need me more.
what's this really about?
i told you.
i haven't heard one thing that explains this.
i've said everything i want to.
that's it? i'm supposed to accept that? and if i refuse your transfer?
"captain, as a friend, i'm asking you let me do this."
"it's your career, trip. but as a friend, i'm asking you to stay."
i can't.
all right.
thank you.
dismissed.
what do you want with me?
secure him.
i demand to see the magistrate.
my death sentence was commuted!
yeah?
she's a thing of beauty.
columbia's virtually identical to enterprise.
a good engineer can see the differences. you coming to the mess hall later? my going away party?
i don't understand the logic behind this transfer. you're not being promoted
you think i'm doing this to advance my career?
you wouldn't leave captain archer without sufficient reason.
"well, for one thing, this is a new challenge. it took me a year to fine-tune enterprise. i figure i can do the same for captain hernandez in half the time. she needs a chief engineer who's been out there, has the experience."
are you leaving because of me?
"look, starfleet's approved the transfer."
you didn't answer my question.
"this may come as a shock, but not everything in my life revolves around you."
i'm glad we got here early.
there never used to be a wait to get in.
"you didn't think madame chang's was going to be your little secret forever, did you?"
there are a lot of starfleet people here.
that's probably my fault. i told a few friends about the place.
a few?
"i'm a comm. officer. if there's one thing that i know how to do, it's disseminate information. you didn't tell me how your meeting went today at the ime."
they asked if i was interested in becoming director of xenobiology.
that's great. are you going to accept?
"i'm considering it. the truth is, i've grown rather fond of my shipmates. i'm not certain i'm ready to leave them just yet. what would you suggest?"
i'm the wrong person to ask. i've got a vested interest in keeping you around.
"you, denobulan. come with us."
what do you want?
maybe you didn't hear me.
dol'sha t'ung nev'rleel.
hoshi.
"i'm all right, sir."
who did this?
"that's what i'm trying to determine. commander collins, starfleet security."
jonathan archer. this is lieutenant reed.
there were three men. they were in the shadows. i didn't get a good look at them.
you told me before that one of them said something to the others.
right before i passed out. i'm pretty sure it wasn't english.
do you remember what he said?
"i'm sorry, sir."
the only dna we've recovered belongs to ensign sato and to your doctor. we did find some residual ionisation traces here.
a transporter signature?
very few people have access to that kind of technology.
"still, it's a likely explanation."
doctor phlox was involved in an altercation the last time he was in san francisco.
you think this is related?
assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. if the man who attacked him was holding a grudge
"he was a loudmouth in a bar. i doubt he could find his head with both hands, never mind organise a kidnapping."
"we're pursuing all avenues. excuse me, captain. lieutenant."
check with starfleet operations. see if their satellites picked up any transporter activity this evening.
the dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within point three microns.
the specs say point five.
who do you think wrote those specs?
a warp field specialist?
exactly. some guy who's probably never been outside the solar system. i've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside one of these engines. i know what i'm talking about.
"aye, sir."
"biggs, pierce.  i want you to recalibrate the field stabilisers. rivers and strong, start with the injector assembly. this bucket of bolts was supposed to leave dry dock six months ago. i guarantee you, columbia's going to warp out of orbit before the end of the week. let's get to work."
it's customary to report to the captain after a transfer.
"i'm sorry, ma'am. i wanted to see what the situation was like before we spoke. commander charles tucker, reporting for duty."
welcome aboard.
"trip, is it?"
that's right.
so what do you think? can she be salvaged?
i think there's a good chance. any news on doctor phlox?
"not so far. if i hear anything, i'll let you know. you certainly know how to motivate the troops."
we'll be pulling triple shifts if we want to meet this new launch date.
"you still need to eat. captain's mess, tomorrow. eighteen hundred hours. we can trade stories about your former co."
i'll be there.
"commander, drop by the quartermaster's at the end of your shift."
ma'am?
might want to update your uniform.
"aye, captain."
come in.
we've heard nothing from the kidnappers. not even a ransom demand.
i've spoken with the denobulan ambassador. he's notified the doctor's wives.
"hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers say something in another language, but she was semi-conscious at the time. maybe you could help her remember."
a mind-meld? i've never initiated a meld before. i don't have the proper training.
"i know it's dangerous, but i can walk you through it."
you?
i had surak's katra in my head for four days. i picked up a few tricks.
"computer, access satellite logs one three seven. time parameters nineteen hundred and nineteen forty five today."
"what? starfleet operations, this is lieutenant malcolm reed aboard enterprise. please acknowledge."
"burning the midnight oil, lieutenant?"
sir? i thought i was calling starfleet ops.
let me guess. you want to know why the grid covering san francisco was down for maintenance tonight.
something like that.
meet me at this address in one hour.
my mind to your mind. our minds are merging. our minds are one.
nothing's happening.
"t'pol, try to relax your emotional suppression just a little."
i feel what you feel. i know what you know.  can you hear me?
"yes, perfectly."
you and the doctor have just left the restaurant.
i'm glad we got here early.
there never used to be a wait to get in.
good.
they asked if i was interested in becoming director of xenobiology.
where were you attacked?
there.
"truth is, i've grown rather fond of my shipmates"
do you see them?
just yet. what would you suggest?
yes.
"you, denobulan. come with us."
what do you want?
maybe you didn't hear me.
focus on the moment. put aside any pain.
dol'sha t'ung nev'rleel.
dol'sha t'ung nev'rleel.
dol'sha t'ung nev'rleel.
bring him with us. it's rigelian.
"a rigelian freighter left orbit two hours after phlox's abduction. according to their flight plan, they were headed for proxima colony."
this trajectory won't take them anywhere near proxima colony. ensign.
sir.
put admiral gardner through to my ready room. shore leaves are cancelled. get everyone back on board.
am i to understand you are responsible for taking that satellite grid offline?
not me personally.
but you're involved. phlox is my friend. do you know where he is?
we have an assignment for you.
i wasn't aware that i was still a part of your section.
"there's a job that needs doing, lieutenant, and it may be the only way to save your friend's life."
"welcome to qu'vat colony, doctor. you will work with doctor antaak."
i will do nothing of the kind.
then you will die.
i'm certain there are easier ways for you to recruit a new lab assistant.
"you misunderstand me, doctor. antaak will be assisting you."
"it's good to see you again, doctor."
i beg your pardon?
"i wouldn't expect you to remember but we met briefly five years ago, at the ime conference on tiburon."
i don't recall meeting a klingon at that conference.
i was disguised as a member of the mazarite delegation. my people weren't invited.
"i will let you two get reacquainted. i suggest you work quickly, doctor. i expect a progress report by sunrise."
you must forgive the general's conduct. the warrior caste has little use for social protocols.
what do you want with me?
"the empire is facing its gravest threat since the hur'q invasion. a virus is spreading from planet to planet. millions are already infected. if this continues, the klingon species will cease to exist."
why didn't you simply ask for our help? starfleet and denobula would've provided you with all of the specialists you'd need.
"you don't understand the klingon way, doctor. to ask for assistance would make us look weak in the eyes of our enemies. it could even incite rebellion."
why me?
i was impressed by your lecture at the conference. your paper on viral propagation was very insightful.
"what field of study are you in, precisely?"
"metagenic research. i've already isolated the virus. i assume you'll want to start by mapping the nucleotides? it wasn't my idea to abduct you. nevertheless, you are here. millions of lives are at risk."
the freighter's warp trail has terminated.
they may have dropped to impulse.
how long to intercept?
"at our current speed, eight point two hours."
"archer to engineering. commander kelby, respond."
"kelby here, sir."
we could use a little more speed.
the injectors are running at a hundred and five percent.
commander tucker's pushed them higher than that before.
"i'll see what i can do, captain."
"i don't know who's in charge of your mess hall, but he could give the chef on enterprise a run for his money."
"i stole him from the republic. captain jennings said i could have anything i wanted when i left, so i took his cook. i've gotten two transfer requests from crewmen in your department."
who?
"it's probably better if i didn't mention names. i denied them. you're already short-handed. quite an impression you've made, commander. you've been aboard less than two days and already some of your team want to jump ship."
"i've knocked a few heads together, but we're getting the job done. we'll be ready for warp trials by thursday."
i was surprised you accepted this transfer. i saw an interview with you after the xindi mission. you said you couldn't see yourself serving on any other starship.
"well, you've got a good memory, captain."
it comes in handy.
"i was getting a little too comfortable on enterprise. got a lot of friends over there, but sometimes it's easier to work with people who are just colleagues."
why are you here?
i was about to ask you the same thing. is this a daydream?
i'm meditating. this is where i go in my mind.
"well, i would've thought you'd pick a more interesting place. like the beach, or one of those fire plains you showed me."
please leave.
exactly where am i supposed to go?
away.
this is my daydream. you go away.
"excuse me, commander? is everything all right?"
"yeah, i'm fine."
the diagnostic you asked for.
thanks.
bridge to t'pol. we're approaching the coordinates.
on my way.
no biosigns. i'm reading several bodies aboard.
is one of them denobulan?
they're all rigelian.
can you tell who did this?
"no, sir. i'll have to bring aboard some of the debris and analyse it."
scan for their data recorder. it might tell us something.
"unless i'm mistaken, this virus is a mutated form of the levodian flu."
it's immune to whatever antiviral we've tried.
we should contact the ime. they may have seen this mutation before. i'm certain they'll be willing to share their database with us. i know of a few indirect channels. no one would have to know.
there's no reason to contact them. we've acquired their entire database.
you stole it.
medical research isn't a priority for the high council. i'm forced to obtain information however i can.
that doesn't sound very honourable.
"given the choice between honour and saving lives, i choose the latter."
perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal a genome sequencer? we're not going to be able to map the virus without the proper technology.
this man's been infected.
very observant.
we're being exposed.
this patient is at stage one. the virus doesn't become contagious until stage three.
"when i asked you to bring me a subject for dissection, i assumed he'd already be dead."
he won't be alive much longer.
what do you think you're doing?
euthanising him.
out of the question. i thought you were committed to saving lives.
it is more honourable to give one's life to medical research than to die for no purpose!
that choice is not ours to make.
proceed.
"computer, establish an encrypted comm.-link. starfleet frequency seven nine baker."
lieutenant.
"you told me the klingons were going to rendezvous with that freighter, not destroy it."
"i regret what happened. but, they had to cover their tracks."
how many were on board that ship?
that's not your concern. have you analysed the weapon signatures yet?
yes.
you haven't told archer?
i'm not certain how much longer i can keep this from him.
orion raiders have been known to operate in this area.
you want me to lie again? i could explain the situation to the captain.
"you have a peculiar sense of humour, lieutenant."
i've worked closely with the man. you can trust him.
archer is a starfleet captain. his duty would be to report everything you tell him to admiral gardner. they would launch an investigation.
"i'm being compromised, sir, and i don't like it."
"then i suggest you adjust your comfort level, lieutenant. you made a commitment to us long before you joined the enterprise."
tactical alert. all hands to battle stations.
what was that?
i believe we're under attack.
hull plating's holding.
still no response.
target their weapons.
"we've been boarded. d deck, starboard side. access tube seven."
seal it off. get the macos down there.
target weapons on this location.
disable that ship. i don't want them getting away.
return to the transport site.
they've activated their transporter.
they're going to warp.
pursuit course.
the helm's not responding.
wake him up.
why did you attack us?
"sohvad pagh vijatlh, human."
"i have nothing to say to you, human."
that sounds like
klingon.
there must be some kind of mistake.
what is it?
"according to his bio-signature, he is klingon."
he must have been surgically altered to look human.
any theories?
i need to run further tests. their boarding party disabled our antimatter flow regulators. warp drive should be repaired in six hours.
"give our new chief engineer a hand. tell him to dig a little deeper, see if these klingons damaged any other systems."
the rigelian freighter. did you get anything out of the black box?
it's been erased.
"it might've been a safeguard, in case it fell into the wrong hands."
work with hoshi. see if you can reconstruct any data.
there is something familiar about these base-pair sequences.
familiar?
boshar! feeding time is over. go back!
do you think it's wise to keep wild animals in here?
there are dozens of creatures in your sickbay.
i don't let them roam free.
i could never keep boshar locked up. he was my first patient. he tore his side open when i was a child. i stitched the wound myself.
"i have seen these sequences before. six months ago, to be precise. this is augment dna. how did modified human genes find their way into this virus?"
"is that really such a surprise, doctor? it took only two human augments to commandeer a bird of prey and murder its entire crew. the empire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us. imagine, every starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineered humans."
earth banned genetic engineering decades ago. the augments who attacked you were relics of another era.
the vulcans told that to the high council. they weren't very persuasive. we were simply responding to a threat.
you were trying to create klingon augments. but soong's experiments were all killed. where did you get the genetic material?
several embryos were found in the wreckage of the bird of prey. we used them to re-sequence a number of test subjects. there were some unanticipated side effects.
their cranial ridges started to dissolve. augment dna was more aggressive than you realised.
"for a time it appeared we were quite successful. our augments might have looked human, but they were klingon. stronger, more intelligent. then, their neural pathways started to degrade. they died in agony. one of the test subjects was suffering from the levodian flu. the augment genes modified the virus."
it became airborne. you should have told me this earlier!
"if you hope to ever leave this place, i suggest you stop asking questions and resume work."
what do you think?
we may be able to reconstruct the directory with a recursive algorithm.
is it unusual to have weird dreams after a mind meld?
subconscious thoughts are often exchanged. they sometimes surface during sleep.
i had a bizarre dream last night. commander tucker was in it. we were in a strange place. it was all white. there was almost a romantic quality to it. i don't ever remember dreaming about commander tucker before.
most unusual.
the recorder was erased deliberately.
malcolm said there might've been a safeguard.
the memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler.
you're sure.
it left a unique magnetic signature.
we found it in storage locker c fourteen. the last person to access that locker was lieutenant reed.
"i'm not quite sure what you're getting at, sir."
"only someone with security clearance of alpha-four or higher had access to the black box. that's just t'pol, you and me."
i agree. it is a bit of a mystery.
you're sure that freighter was destroyed by orion weapons?
there's no doubt.
i asked t'pol to double-check your analysis. the freighter was fired on by klingon disruptors.
"with all due respect, sir, it must have been a mistake."
i've seen the sensor logs.
someone could have tampered with them.
"i want to know what the hell is going on.  answer me, lieutenant."
"respectfully, sir, i refuse to answer any more questions."
"malcolm, i never would've believed that you, of all people."
corporal. lieutenant reed's been relieved of duty. escort him to the brig and confine him.
we've set course for klingon territory. we haven't picked up any warp signatures yet. i may have to take this ship into their space. i don't have to tell you how dangerous that is. if you know where they've taken phlox.
"i have no idea where the doctor is, captain. on that, you have my word."
your word isn't worth a lot at the moment.
the malcolm reed i know would give his life before committing treason.
i'm not working for the klingons.
"who, then? you've betrayed everything that uniform stands for."
"captain, there are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty to you and this crew."
what the hell does that mean?
i can't say any more.
"you haven't said much of anything. you've told me a lot about your father, his years in the royal navy. their tradition of honour and service. how do you think he'll react when he learns you're facing court-martial?"
"i wouldn't know, sir."
we're running out of time.
i can't sequence these nucleotides any faster. perhaps you should've abducted doctor soong. he could've mapped this genome more efficiently than i can.
we tried. soong was under heavy guard.
"if you don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no one left to cure. the high council has dispatched the fleet. they have annihilated n'vak colony."
n'vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague.
they're massacring the victims?
the council will do whatever's required to contain this outbreak.
"general, we're making progress, but i'll need a few weeks to develop an antiviral agent. it will have to be tested."
millions will be infected by then. the council will not wait!
how long until the fleet reaches us?
five days.
i can't cure this in five days!
they wouldn't destroy us if they knew we had created klingon augments.
the experiment failed!
"it succeeded for a brief period. if phlox and i can find a way to stabilise the human dna prior to the onset of stage three, our augments would survive. if we're successful, you could use them as leverage, force the high council to give us more time to find a cure."
you don't seriously expect me to help you create klingon augments?!
you could save the inhabitants of this planet.
i won't assist you.
kill me if you must. i refuse to co-operate.
take him.
hail the dock master. this is captain hernandez. request permission to depart.
"you're cleared for departure. smooth sailing, columbia."
thank you.
"bridge to engineering. are we ready, mister tucker?"
just a few more seconds.  i hope. ensign?
dilithium matrix is stable. driver coils are configured for warp speed.
"nice work. engineering to bridge. we're ready whenever you are, captain."
"time to weigh anchor.  lieutenant, aft thrusters at one half until we clear spacedock. then take us to warp."
"so, what are you in for?"
is your captain hoping you'll obtain information from me?
i shouldn't think so.
why are you here?
that's a long story.
entertain me.
i lied to him.
you're fortunate to be alive. a klingon who betrays his captain would be immediately executed.
"why did you and your men board enterprise? you know, you may find this hard to believe but, you and i actually want the same thing."
and what is that?
a cure. there's no reason for you or any more of your people to die.
there's a malfunction in the intermix chamber. plasma pressure's rising.
the antimatter flow regulators are locked open.
did the klingons damage them?
uncertain.
pressure's approaching critical.
can we drop to impulse?
the reactor would breach. but we can reduce pressure by increasing speed.
go to maximum warp.  get down to engineering. see what you can do.
"you sabotaged us. how do we repair the damage? if our reactor breaches, you're going to die with us."
i'm a soldier of the empire. i'm prepared to die.
"captain. you need your tactical officer. please, sir. i can be useful!"
"commander, did you see that?"
please be more specific.
on the monitor.
t'pol to captain archer.
go ahead.
the warp matrix has been compromised
by a klingon subroutine.
can you remove it?
i'm not certain. it's infiltrated our command protocols.
do what you can.
bridge to captain archer. pressure's increasing again.
take us to warp five point two.
"sir, we can't hold that speed for long."
"we're out of options, travis. five point two."
acknowledged.
we have forty seven minutes until our reactor breaches.
what did the klingons do to it?.
"they altered our engineering subroutines. if we go below warp five, the reactor's going to explode."
how can i help?
i've just been talking with trip. columbia can rendezvous with us in thirty minutes. he says he can restore the subroutines.
he can't do that from columbia.
we're going to bring him onboard.
"the transporter won't operate at warp, and docking's out of the question."
trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp speed.
"in training exercises, yes, and at warp speed one. every move was rehearsed in simulators for weeks."
we don't have weeks.
we'll have to merge our warp field with columbia's.
"t'pol's doing the calculations now. at warp five, we'll have to move within fifty metres of each other."
has anyone ever done this before?
travis can handle the flying. can you get trip over here?
you'll have to let me out of this brig.
commander tucker.
are you ready for this?
as ready as i'll ever be.
open a channel.
columbia to enterprise.
this is archer.
we're matching speed and trajectory as requested.
"stand by, columbia. archer to reed."
go ahead.
we're in position.
have them start their rotation.
"coming up on one hundred metres. ninety, eighty metres."
this is the bridge. all hands brace for warp field contact.
"hold her steady, travis"
or chef'll know who to blame for the mess in the galley.
we're at fifty metres and holding.
make sure everything's ready for trip in engineering.
archer to reed. you're all clear.
understood.
"columbia, i'm deploying the tether."
"nice shooting, malcolm."
tucker to captain hernandez.
go ahead.
i'm heading out.
"quick as you can, commander."
never thought i'd see the stars like this.
"eyes on the cable, commander. i need you back here in one piece."
"you're doing fine, trip."
"t'pol, what's happening?"
i'm reading a fluctuation in the warp field.
take power from life support if you have to.
but keep the field constant.
"sir, i'm having trouble holding position. fifty two metres. fifty five."
"don't mean to be a pest, but could someone tell me what's going on?"
"you're almost here, trip. keep going."
"engineering, report!"
"i'm rerouting power now, captain. stand by."
fifty nine metres.
the tether's at its limit! hurry up!
t'pol to the bridge. it's not working. the field is still fluctuating.
almost there!
trip!
permission to come aboard?
"bridge, i have him."
"you all right, trip?"
"i'll feel a lot better when this is over. there's only one way to do this, captain. a cold start. i have to shut down the reactor and re-set the algorithms. once we bring the warp engine back online, the subroutines should be back to normal."
but if we shut down the reactor.
that's why we need to move inside columbia's warp field.
they can sustain our speed while i reinitialize the engines.
they won't be able to hold us for more than a minute or two. they don't have enough power.
i've got a shortcut in mind.
shortcut?
those subroutines
would take hours to decrypt. better just to purge them wipe them clean.
i'll contact columbia.
what're they here for?
the captain and i have had a slight misunderstanding.
how slight?
"these gentlemen are here to escort me back to the brig. don't worry, i'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy."
fancy meeting you here. intermix pressure?
fifteen twenty seven.
field variance?
eighty seven millicochranes.
somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine.
speak with the klingons. what are you doing?
you might want to take notes. i'm about to perform a manual shut-down and restart in less than two minutes.
that's not possible.
watch me.
columbia to enterprise.
go ahead.
i've routed everything i've got to my warp field.
"do me a favour, jonathan. make this quick."
archer to trip. ready when you are.
stand by! everyone get away from the bulkheads! it's going to get a little hot in here!
"reactor shut down in five, four, three, two, one!"
"t'pol, prime the injectors. jenkins, man the relays!"
"yes, sir!"
colombia to enterprise. you've got about forty seconds.
understood.
"trip, how's it going?"
"just another minute, captain."
you don't have a minute!
get ready to initialise the matrix.
"enterprise, we're losing the field."
"fifteen seconds, trip."
almost there. full power to containment! fire up the antimatter stream!
"ten seconds. nine, eight, seven, six."
commander!
here we go!
"four, three, two."
we've got warp power.
engineering to the bridge. the subroutines have been purged.
"appreciate the house call, mister tucker."
any time. i'd like to drop to impulse for a while
"captain, just to check things over."
stand by. enterprise to columbia. thanks for the lift.
you're not getting away with my chief engineer that easily.
any plans for the next few days?
what've you got in mind?
phlox. phlox. this will help.  my apologies for the general's conduct. so cruel. this is no way to treat a man of science.
then end it. contact starfleet.
"my people need you, phlox. we have no healers with your abilities."
you want me to create klingon augments. living weapons. i won't do it.
"no, no. i've been reviewing your work. it's brilliant. you have discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague. if we interrupt the transcription sequence here"
"yes. yes. that would stop the genetic effects of the virus in stage one. there'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural reordering, but no development of stage two characteristics. no enhanced strength or speed or endurance. but then general k'vagh would not get his augments. he would never allow it."
what if we don't tell him?
do you understand what will happen if the general learns that we've deceived him?
"a cure would save millions of innocent lives. what more honourable death could there be for a healer, klingon or denobulan?"
"i don't suppose you can tell me where i'm going this time? no, i didn't think so."
those are my personal files.
"not when they affect my ship. t'pol restored everything you tried to erase. we ran his face and voiceprint through our database. his name is harris. he worked in starfleet security up till five years ago. after that, his file ends."
"captain, there's nothing more i can add."
"i won't accept that. you endangered every member of this crew. you answer to me. i thought i knew you, malcolm. whatever hold this harris has on you, you could have come to me."
i'm under orders.
"i'm your commanding officer! if you don't tell me what's going on, i'll go to starfleet. whatever you think you've been trying to keep hidden is going to come out. is that what you want? is that what you want?!"
i can't tell you what i don't know.
then let me talk to someone who can. send a message to harris.
has the house of phlox always been one of healers?
"there is no, uh, house of phlox. denobulan family units are different from klingons."
"ah, yes. i've heard. three wives for each husband. three husbands for each wife. your mating practices must be very complex."
wondrously so. what about the house of antaak?
"we are a warrior caste. when i became a healer, my father disowned me."
"as a physician in the imperial fleet, you've served in the military."
"not as well as i should have. i did not screen my subjects properly. this plague, all its victims, it's my fault. my failure is the reason you're here."
the humans could not stop us.
i am your superior. you will salute.
enterprise was destroyed. starfleet will think it was her engines.
one of you is missing.
your son was slow. the humans killed him.
did he die with honour?
he let humans kill him.
report.
doctor phlox has made excellent progress.
details.
i've identified the rna sequences that code
details i can pass on to my superiors.
i know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus.
how long until you find it?
an hour.
one hour.
what do you want?
i have news for the high council.
explain.
the denobulan is close to perfecting the augment's genome.
the council has shut down your project.
"if you sterilise this colony, then all our research will be lost."
"the fleet will reach you in three days. if you're successful by the time we enter orbit, qu'vat will be spared."
"captain, it's going to be a while before everything's back to normal in engineering."
can kelby handle it?
i could pull a little double duty to help him out. i could check with captain hernandez.
something else?
what the hell's going on with malcolm?
nothing i can get into right now.
fair enough. guess i'd better get back to columbia.
i'll walk with you.
are you enjoying your time aboard columbia?
sure. why wouldn't i?
you haven't been experiencing any problems?
such as?
"adjusting to new food, new routines, trouble sleeping."
i sleep just fine. how about you?
fine.
you sure about that?
quite.
your hour is up.
we're getting the test results now.
we are running out of time!
"general, i know the klingon fleet is on its way, and i understand what this project cost you, personally. antaak told me about your son."
he died in combat for the empire.
at least he was spared the final stage of this disease. may i ask how he was infected?
"command chose his unit for the augment experiment when we had exhausted our supply of prisoners. my son was a warrior. he asked for no special treatment, and i gave him none."
what'd they give you?
it's dead. i can't eat that. no wonder you're all so weak.
physical strength isn't everything.
"well, you can't win wars without it."
being smart is more important. general sun tzu said that the greatest victories are those won without fighting.
the great kahless said there's no victory without combat.
do you ever question why you fight?
soldiers don't question. they obey.
what if your superiors are wrong?
"they're imprisoned, or killed."
that's not how we do things in starfleet.
which is why the klingon empire will defeat you.
then how come you're in the same brig that i'm in?
you said we'd become stronger. this is what you've done to us.
he will become infectious soon. he should be quarantined.
"we'll remain here. if we're going to die, we'll die together as comrades."
"be patient, lieutenant. the denobulan is working to stabilise the human dna. you will all be healthy again, and stronger than any klingon."
will he restore our appearance?
i don't know.
how do you expect us to return home looking like this? we will be outcasts. there will be no place for us in the empire.
your heart is still klingon.
"are you certain of that? during the battle with the starfleet ship i felt fear for the first time since i was a child. i wasn't alone. i could see it in the eyes of the others. we've become like them. weak, cowardly. it would be better for us to die."
"as long as i draw breath, the empire will not turn its back on you."
"i get the feeling you miss phlox, too. maybe it's just the stash of cheese he's got in sickbay.  hold that thought."
"captain archer, i'm told you have some questions for me."
where's my doctor?
"he's safe, on a mission of great importance to starfleet."
phlox was kidnapped. starfleet would never authorise that.
"reread the charter, article 14, section 31. there are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat."
what threat?
take your pick. earth's got a lot of enemies.
klingons attacked my ship. is that what we're talking about?
what i want to talk about is lieutenant reed. he's done good work for us over the years. don't be too hard on him. he was just following my orders.
you put him in an impossible position.
"i can understand why you would feel that way, but this is bigger than one captain and one ship."
you're going to have to do better than that.
"all i can tell you is that if you interfere before phlox completes his assignment, the repercussions will affect entire worlds."
one of these four strains has the genetic trigger that can neutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage.
which one?
i don't know yet. that's why i have to check each of them.
how long will it take?
a week. your fleet can quarantine this world while i complete my tests. sterilisation is not necessary.
fleet admiral krell will not extend his deadline.
the only possible way to get results on krell's schedule is to infect four healthy klingons!
you have four right here!
"only one of these strains will work. the other three will be lethal. ethically, it's unthinkable."
"the ethics, doctor, are simple. three lives to save millions."
"at first, it didn't seem like lying."
what else would you call it?
"covert operations. i was a young ensign, it was exciting."
how do you feel about it now?
i thought it was done. this is the first time that harris has contacted me since i've served on enterprise. he told me about the plague. he said they needed phlox to help the klingons find a cure. i was supposed to just slow us down.
did harris tell you about this?
i had t'pol take a closer look at our prisoner's medical scans.
it's human dna.
i'm guessing the plague is a side effect of a military experiment that went wrong.
i didn't know.
harris claims he's doing this because starfleet needs a stable klingon empire.
do you believe him?
"i don't trust him. if the klingons needed our help, there are easier ways to get it."
"i wanted to tell you everything, captain."
"there's a way out of this. i don't have to put you back in the brig, but you have to choose where your loyalties lie."
"i wasn't told where phlox was taken, but starfleet intelligence believe that klingons have a genetic research facility on qu'vat colony."
as you were.
how long until we reach qu'vat?
"six hours, sir."
"captain, we need to be ready for klingon patrols. i suggest that columbia withdraws to a safer distance so that we don't make a single target."
open a channel to captain hernandez.
why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting augments when doctor soong failed?
soong's mistake was that he made too few of them.
the earth once had thousands. they became tyrannical and started a war.
klingons have discipline.
"augments don't. their increased aggression is matched by their decreased inhibitions. you'd lose control of them, just as humans did."
how long until we know which one of us survives?
"an hour, at most."
would bloodwine affect the results?
i don't believe so.
then we shall drink to the bravery of these warriors! doctor?
never on the job.
we know phlox was taken to qu'vat colony to work on a cure. we're going to be there in less than an hour.
krell's patrols will crush you.
they've all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones.
"phlox will be in the medical facility. we need the co-ordinates. if you don't want to help us, help your people."
my brothers?
they're quite ill. so are you. try to rest.
doctor. the two guards are displaying the first symptoms.
that accounts for two of the three lethal strains.
"so either general k'vagh lives, or i do.  it's the general, isn't it? his strain has the cure."
"if we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time."
what now?
there's been a complication.
another one?
"this time, your people failed to stop enterprise. it's on its way to qu'vat, with columbia."
order them to withdraw.
you know i don't have that authority.
then i'll destroy them.
we had an arrangement!
you did what i wanted. i don't need you anymore.
you agreed that both our governments would benefit if the two of us worked together.
and you believed me.
load the amino acids. i'll extract the viral dna from his blood.
captain.
you all right?
better now that you are here.
father.
i was told that you had been killed.
the humans spared me.
i came to get my doctor back.
we need him here.
"i have two ships in orbit, heavily armed."
"gentlemen, please. i think i can speak for myself. captain. i need a little more time to cure this plague."
cure? you were supposed to be perfect the augment genome!
"i lied. your son may be alive, but he will not survive much longer unless i don't complete my work. a few hours, captain, that's all i ask. several million patients are counting on it."
"commander, three klingon battlecruisers have just dropped out of warp."
open a channel to columbia.
the klingons are jamming everything.
what is it?
krell's ships are here.
"keep working. archer to enterprise. tell the klingons we have the cure. enterprise, respond!"
this is fleet admiral krell.
i'm under orders to eradicate this colony.
you don't have to do that. my doctor can stop the plague.
i have a more effective solution.
"hello, admiral krell. this is doctor phlox. i am transmitting the details of an antivirus. feel free to have your physicians confirm my findings, and you're welcome to call with any questions."
my orders are clear.
"captain archer, your ships are now the property of the klingon empire. stand down or be destroyed! proceed as planned. leave nothing standing."
the lead ship's moving into a lower orbit.
they're charging weapons.
intercept course. columbia?
i can't get through.
they're firing on the colony.
target their disruptors!
how strong are the shields around this place?
not strong enough. you said you had two ships in orbit!
i'm sure they're doing everything they can. archer to enterprise.
they're closing from astern.  aft cannons are down.
columbia to enterprise. looked like you could use a hand. let's keep those ships off their tail.
your ships are taking damage.
how much longer?
"as i said, in another few hours."
"can you speed that up a little? phlox, i've got an idea. if we want to get out of here in one piece, we've got to get that cure, and we're got to get it fast."
i could finish the antivirus in less time if i had a human host to replicate enough antibodies.
i don't see any other humans around.
"captain, i would have to expose you to the plague. i cannot predict what it might do to you."
will it give you the cure?
unquestionably.
let's get started.
what do you intend to do?
this virus may be our best weapon against krell. ready when you are.
one of the ships is losing power. their port nacelle is vulnerable.
then fire at will.
"in addition to the virus, i'm injecting you with a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response. it won't be pleasant."
it's no use. i can't penetrate their shields.
commander. i've broken through their jamming frequencies.
t'pol to captain archer.
"captain, respond!"
doctor phlox here. the captain is indisposed at the moment.
i imagine you have your hands full up there.
to say the least.
"we have a plan to defuse this situation, but we'll need a few more minutes to carry it out. i'd appreciate it if you could keep the ceiling from caving in on us until then."
understood.
how much hull plating do we have left?
sixty two percent.
"mister mayweather, put us directly between that cruiser and the colony. you may want to divert all available power to our dorsal plating."
"aye, aye."
it's working.
they're shifting their orbit.
stay with them.
hull plating's down to forty percent.
"keep firing. captain hernandez, please direct your weapons at the battle cruiser."
wish i could help. we just lost our weapons!
it's done! hold him!
we've got it. is the canister ready?
it's set to disperse five seconds after transport.
send it. open a channel to krell.
hull plating's nearly down. we can't hold this position much longer.
admiral krell. doctor phlox again. by now you may have noticed the
"small package which we sent to your bridge. what you may not know is that it contains a potent sample of the metagenic virus. even as we speak it is dispersing throughout your ship, infecting you and your crew."
you're lying!
check your internal sensors. you will find
"that the atmosphere contains approximately twenty parts per million of the viral strain. or if you don't trust your sensors, trust your senses. you will feel the initial symptoms in about thirty minutes. a tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat"
tingling in your cranial ridges.
this is a cowardly attack!
"maybe so. but i'm prepared to give you the cure. thanks to captain archer, i've managed to complete the antivirus. of course, if you destroy this colony, well, treating you and your crew could prove difficult. i suggest you power down your weapons, admiral, and let me cure your people."
there's no trace of the virus in your bloodstream.
my targ won't even recognise me.
"in the future, it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic effects."
i suppose this is what i deserve. millions of my people will have to live with this disfigurement. it'll be passed on to our children. life won't be easy for us.
you did your best to correct your mistakes. that's all we can ask of ourselves.
i doubt my superiors will allow me to remain in my position. i'll need to find a new specialty. perhaps cranial reconstruction.
i have a feeling that's about to become very popular.
i'm grateful for everything that you've done.
how are you feeling?
"not too bad aside, from some strange cravings. a plate full of live gagh sounds pretty good right now."
"the cravings should disappear in a day or so, along with your ridges."
"no, i'd keep them if i were you, captain. it makes you look intimidating."
i should be get back on the road.
one of us needs to get some exploring done. thanks for your help.
i don't know how you survived all these years without me.
shouldn't you be joining her?
i asked trip to stick around for a little while to help us out with repairs.
indeed. our new chief engineer will no doubt be delighted for the help.
"no, kelby's got nothing to worry about. i'm only here temporarily."
what do you want?
i called to thank you. everything went according to our projections. the empire's been stabilised. i doubt very much they'll be experimenting with augments anytime soon.
we could've explained everything to captain archer.
that's not how krell wanted things done.
since when do we do things the way the klingons want?
"when it's in our interest. i had to keep certain details from you as well. i hope there are no hard feelings. this mission wouldn't have succeeded without you, lieutenant."
don't ever contact me again. is that clear?
maybe you didn't understand our recruitment policy. you can't simply walk away.
i answer to one commanding officer. jonathan archer.
"lieutenant, why don't we"
a vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventh planet over fifty years ago. the file states it's an m class world with a flourishing ecosystem. no intelligent life.
sounds promising.
they did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning.
and that is?
"a species of flying reptile, some reportedly over two hundred metres long. they're also said to breathe fire. there's been lingering questions over the accuracy of this report."
can't wait to find out.
there's a ship. it's on an intercept course.
i don't recognise the configuration.
let's see it.
doesn't look very friendly.
"tactical alert. let's see what they want, hoshi."
they're responding.
captain archer.
and you are?
"harrad-sar. deactivate your weapon systems immediately, or i'll be forced to open fire.  you're still targeting my ship."
and you're targeting mine. it seems we're at an impasse.
not for long.
"instead of sitting here pointing guns at each other, why don't we deactivate our weapons together?"
very well.
"now, what can we do for you?"
i have a proposal to make.
i'm listening.
i prefer to discuss business in person. you're invited aboard my ship.
we've dealt with your people before. the experience wasn't one i care to repeat. if you can give me some idea what this is about?
"what i have to say could smooth relations between your starfleet and the orion syndicate. my hospitality is renowned, captain. i don't offer it to everyone. and once i have been refused, i never offer it again."
the last orions we ran into almost turned nine of our crewmembers into slaves. let's at least ask him to come here.
i have a feeling he'd see it as an insult.
i can live with that.
"any chance to improve relations with the syndicate, i'm willing to take that risk. anything to have one less hostile species out there."
seven of the transfer conduits are back on line. the eighth is still giving us some trouble.
did you run a phase diagnostic?
came back negative.
better work up a bypass.
already underway.
kelby. kelby.
we have a problem?
"i'm not sure what you mean, sir."
"look, the captain asked me to stick around. as soon as the repairs are done, i'm back on columbia."
and it's no reflection on me that the captain wants you to oversee the work.
that's right. i was his chief engineer for four years.
"well, it doesn't look like he's ready to let you go. i'd better get on it."
he thinks he's going to lose his promotion.
is there anything i can do to help?
with kelby?
with the engine.
"i could use a second pair of eyes on the field matrix. the pattern's bothering me, and i can't figure out why."
i'll take a look at it.
thanks.
"commander, have you been experiencing any unusual daydreams?"
daydreams?
accompanied by intense auditory and visual sensations that would involve me.
you're wondering if i've been having any daydreams about you?
essentially.
"well, let me think. no, nothing comes to mind."
forget i mentioned it.
have you been having daydreams about me?
it's not important.
you going to tell me what this is about?
no.
"i am a privateer. my allegiance is to myself alone. i earn my living in various ways. buying, selling."
plundering.
when the situation calls for it. piracy is a risky business. i prefer commerce. this  is from a planet in the gorn hegemony.
the gorn?
"the less said about them, the better. but they do brew the finest meridor in the five systems."
delicious.
"i'm pleased. you have acquired something of a reputation, captain."
"favourable, i hope."
"well, you're wanted in the klingon empire, the orion syndicate. i don't know. i would imagine such a man would have a more robust appetite."
"with all those people after me, i need to stay quick on my feet."
yes.
you said you had something important to discuss with us.
"well, it's poor custom to discuss business before entertainment. if the food didn't arouse your hunger, this should."
what do you think?
i can't think.
captain?
i'd have to agree with my tactical officer.
i think she likes you.
"her name is navaar. she's the most experienced of the three. they're sisters. i purchased them at a trading post you once visited. incredible, aren't they? they can make you forget most of your troubles. of course, creatures such as these come with troubles of their own. but women are the same throughout the galaxy, aren't they?"
now we can talk business.
he claims he's discovered a planet with large deposits of magnesite. enough to build a thousand warp reactors. and that's just what his scanners could detect. he's offering to give us the coordinates.
why would he divulge this information?
he doesn't have the infrastructure to get the magnesite out of the ground.
so he wants starfleet to construct mining facilities.
and he'll get a ten-percent share. he's also promised to help establish a dialogue between starfleet and the orion syndicate.
are you going to accept his offer?
i already have.
i thought you were here seeking my advice.
"harrad-sar insisted that i accept a gift to celebrate the transaction. given the situation, i couldn't refuse."
"we're on d deck now, where most of the crew quarters are located."
where does captain archer stay?
on e. that's one deck below us.
how many levels are there?
um. er. a total of seven. seven decks. we've arranged these for you.
you need something to do? the other two rooms are right next door. i'll show you in a moment.
captain archer has a very large ship.
it's roomy.
but everything's so functional. there's no colour.
"i hadn't really thought about it, to tell you the truth."
at least it's private. what's your name?
lieutenant reed. malcolm.
"pleased to meet you, lieutenant reed malcolm."
"malcolm is fine. well, someone will be by shortly to show you how everything works. in the meantime, just try to make yourself at home. right. this way, ladies."
i've been hearing some concerns from the crew.
concerns?
the orion women. their presence is becoming disruptive.
you're telling me. the crew isn't used to having orions on board.
"it's more than that. our guests visited the mess hall this morning. as a result, twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts."
i get the picture.
it's primarily their attire.
or lack of it.  i'll see about assigning them some clothes.
"it might also be a good idea if you have a word with them. they're still under the impression they belong to you. unless a new policy has been instated, i believe starfleet doesn't condone slavery."
i'll speak to them first chance i get.
thank you.
lieutenant.
have you seen them yet?
i ran into one of them in the corridor. they're really
"yeah, i know. i know. what are you trying to do?"
get them out of my head! the pain helps. you should try it.
"yeah, okay."
"when i was on my parents' ship, we picked up some deltans once. their ship was having engine trouble."
i don't know that species.
the females are unbelievably attractive. very open about
"i was fifteen. i couldn't think straight. i could barely breathe. only thing that got me through it was weight training with my dad. he said if i was exhausted, idle hands and all that"
"well, did it help?"
helped my biceps. i'd go heavier.
what are you doing here?
"i wanted to thank you. you were very kind this morning, helping me find the mess hall."
"it was no problem. look, i"
wow. is that the engine?
it's the warp reactor.
you can feel the power. you promised you'd show me engineering.
i know.
harrad-sar never let us leave our rooms. i've never seen anything like this place.
i could show you around.
if it won't get you into trouble.
come on.
what've you got for a headache?
that depends on what's causing it. how long have you been experiencing this?
a few hours. what is it?
ensign keeley was here with a headache several minutes ago.
is she all right?
"perfectly, just as you are."
it's probably just stress.
there's been plenty of that going around.
or it could be our new passengers.
the orion females? why should they give you a headache?
i'm just not used to seeing guys trip over themselves like that.
just a little healthy sexual energy. helps keep the blood pumping.
"if you ask me, it's pumping a little too hard."
"i'm surprised at you, ensign."
why?
you never struck me as being prone to jealousy. this should do very nicely.
phlox!
"it's all right. well, i must be nearing a sleep cycle."
i thought you just had one.
"you're right, i did. a week ago."
it's a good bet the problem's right there. take it apart.
the injectors feed into the dilithium chamber.
that's where the matter and antimatter mix.
that's right.
the crystals let you control the reaction.
that's right.
lieutenant. talk to you a second?
what's going on?
sir?
"you're supposed to be recalibrating the eps taps, not giving a tour."
she's only been here a couple of minutes.
not to mention the fact that she doesn't have clearance. you should've checked with me first.
"well, i guess i can't do anything right."
just ask her to leave.
"no, sir. i'm not through talking to her."
that was an order.
and i'm refusing.
what the hell's the matter with you?
"you've been on my case since the second you got back. that's what the hell's the matter with me. and i'm telling you, it stops here."
"kelby, you're walking a fine line."
"so are you, commander."
you're confined to quarters.
and what if i don't want to go?
"it's either your quarters or the brig. get out of here, now."
come in.
"i was wondering when you were going to come see me. after all, i've been your property for two days."
"navaar, you and your sisters don't belong to me, or anyone else."
i don't understand.
"on my world, slavery's been illegal for hundreds of years."
are you saying that you don't want us?
i'm saying that you're here as our guests not our property.
"i've been a slave my entire life, on different worlds, for different owners. what's going to happen to me?"
"you're free to start a new life. in the meantime, i've asked my protocol officer, hoshi sato, to brief you on ship's operations. there are certain areas that are reserved for starfleet personnel."
i know what happened in engineering. i've already spoken to d'nesh. i'm sorry.
there's no reason to apologise. it's a big adjustment for the three of you.
may i ask you something?
do you find me attractive?
i'd be lying if i said no.
"i've known so few honest men. and even though you don't wish to own me, i still wish to please you. if i choose to do this,  would that violate your ship's protocol?"
not necessarily.
bridge to captain archer. bridge to captain archer.
archer here.
we're coming up on the planet.
i'll be right there.
"i recommend we go to tactical alert, sir. we can't be certain this isn't some kind of a trap."
go ahead.
we're already picking up large deposits of magnesite.
harrad-sar was telling the truth?
it would seem so.
keep scanning. i want to know how much is down there.
are you feeling all right?
i'm fine.
"a power reading. not on the surface, in the upper atmosphere."
a ship?
uncertain.
try hailing them.
the cloud layer is highly ionised. it's obscuring our scanners.
"get us closer, within ten kilometres."
they're not responding.
there it is.
it's an unknown configuration.
they're locking weapons. extremely low yield. barely scratched us.
"it's equipped with numerous sensors, most likely a science vessel. its presence here could simply be a coincidence."
they're firing again. no damage. they could shoot at us all day.
phase cannons.
sir?
a phase cannon hit will destroy them.
which means they won't be shooting at us anymore.
"if we simply withdraw, they'll most likely cease their attack and move off."
and maybe they won't. target them. lieutenant.
captain?
lock phase cannons!
no.
"sir, they're moving off."
"i have just as much experience. i'm smarter, younger."
you're better than him.
we're the only ones who think that.
tucker's going to take back his position?
"he denies it, but i know he's planning on staying."
it doesn't seem fair.
it isn't. let's not talk about it anymore.
what?
i'm used to being with men who take what they want.
what are you talking about?
you can't let him treat you like this.
he's my superior officer.
where are you going?
i thought you were different.
"stay. wait, don't leave."
what would you do to keep me forever?
forever?
what would you do?
anything. anything you want.
kelby! what the hell are you doing?
blow the dampeners! move!
"he blew out every junction in the eps system. if we hadn't got to him, we might not have a ship under our feet."
when can we get underway?
i'm not sure we can get underway. he did a pretty thorough job.
kelby.
i didn't do anything.
tell me what happened.
"whatever he told you, it's a lie."
three other people were there. they all saw you. tell me why you did this.
he's trying to get rid of me. don't listen to him!
kelby.
"captain, his adrenaline levels are dangerously high. i need to administer a sedative."
not till i get some answers first.
"in his current state, he can't give you coherent answers."
i just want to go back to engineering.
all right.
i just want to go back to engineering.
be quiet!
what's wrong with him?
"it's the same thing that's affecting everyone on this ship. it's a highly potent pheromone. when exposed to human males, it accelerates the metabolism, causing aggression and ultimately a form of delusion."
the orions?
women aboard the ship have also been affected. i've received an increasing number of complaints about headaches and listlessness. i suspect the pheromone acts as a defence mechanism against competition.
you okay?
it's impacted my sleep cycle. i'm having to rely on stimulants to stay awake.
doesn't seem to be affecting you.
"i've scanned a good number of the crew. so far, the only people who haven't been affected are t'pol and commander tucker."
why me?
"i would have to run some more tests, but for the rest of us the effect seems to be cumulative. the longer we're exposed, the more pronounced the results are."
"so, this is what you meant when you said we were free to start new lives?"
we found this in your quarters.
it seems we have no privacy either.
it's a communication device. you've been in contact with harrad-sar as recently as two hours ago.
and if i have?
"you were sent here to disable my ship. that was his plan from the start, wasn't it?"
harrad-sar contacted me to see if we've been treated well.
"doctor phlox believes that prolonged exposure to your pheromones makes men delusional, and extremely vulnerable to suggestion. that's how you convinced kelby to sabotage our engines."
your crewman acted alone. i had nothing to do with it.
it seems the only delusion here is your own.
damn it! it's time to start telling me the truth!
"i'm worried about you, captain. you don't seem well."
i'm not the one you should be worried about.
i can see you're not very experienced at making threats.
i'm a lot better at carrying them out.
"we were a gift, nothing more. a true commander would know how to appreciate such a gesture."
tell me. when's he going to attack us?
no one is coming to attack your ship.
please release us.
captain.
i'm obviously not the only woman with power over you.
get down to engineering. do what you can to help trip.
it's better if i stay on the bridge.
i don't need you to look after me.
you're not immune to these pheromones. your judgment is impaired.
i can handle it. we need to get the engines back online. i don't want to be a sitting duck when harrad-sar gets here. you have your orders.
the captain asked me to offer my assistance.
great. you can run through these diagnostics. see if you can find anything that isn't fried. you really think they're coming after us?
it's likely. the transmissions sent by the orion females suggest that harrad-sar's ship is getting closer.
"you know, i keep thinking back to our first mission, when we met the suliban. i was so damn naive. i actually thought it was the last time we'd have to fight someone."
i said leave it alone!
get your hands off me!
"knock if off! that's an order! start up again, and you'll end up in the brig, understand? now go help masarro with the injectors. now!  get back to work. that's the third one in the last hour."
there have been altercations throughout the ship. the captain's been affected. i'm concerned about him.
the thing i can't figure out is why i'm immune.
that might have something to do with me.
you?
"there's a long-held belief that when a vulcan mates, there's a shared psychic bond."
"we didn't mate. okay, what do you mean by psychic bond?"
"it's difficult to explain. feelings, thoughts, even images can be shared."
those daydreams.
what?
"when i said before that i wasn't having any daydreams about you, it wasn't actually true. so if we're bonded, what does this have to do with me not being affected by the orions?"
i'm immune to the pheromones because of my vulcan physiology.
and you're making me immune?
apparently.
i don't know whether to be relieved or really worried.
tactical alert. distance.
four hundred kilometres.
he's hailing us.
put him up.
"can i be of help, captain? do you need a tow?"
he's trying to knock out our weapons.
then take out his.
forward phase cannons are down.
protect our aft cannons.
he's moving too fast.
archer to engineering.
trip.
can we get more power
to the thrusters?
i'll see what i can do.
we just lost aft cannons.
try to divert some of the power from the grav plating.
"we're going to be a little lighter on our feet. what the hell, i've been meaning to lose a few pounds."
reducing gravity plating to ninety percent.
thrusters are back to full.
hard to starboard.
we're still too slow.
torpedoes.
that last hit just took them out.
he's powering down his weapons.
he's coming about.
thrusters. full astern.
it's not enough.
he's hailing.
"relax, captain. enjoy the ride."
we're not going anywhere.
i'm afraid you have an appointment with a pair of orion marauders. i don't intend to keep them waiting.
release my ship!
"i can see you're upset, and i sympathise, but it's truly out of my hands. we are both slaves to the situation."
they control you?
"you finally realise that. yes, captain, you've been operating under a misconception. it is the men who are the slaves, not the women."
you seeing what i'm seeing?
his grappler's directly above our main deflector reader.
get up to the bridge. i'll be right behind you.
the deflector?
"we can use it to send a positron burst through the towing cable. if we're lucky, it'll trigger an energy cascade."
and disable his power systems. do it.
t'pol to engineering.
i've almost got it. you'll have to reroute the main eps conduit.
understood.
captain.
captain.
"decon chamber, come in."
there's no one there.
what did you do to my men?
"we asked them to leave, after they released us."
they were very accommodating.
get off my bridge.
"is that what you really want? because if it is, i will gladly do as you say. i only want to make you happy. i didn't think you wanted me to go."
captain.
she's jealous. she'll try anything to keep us apart. she'll even destroy your ship.
her presence is affecting your judgment.
arrest her.
don't listen.
do it.
captain!
lieutenant reed.
yes?
take t'pol to the brig.
you heard your captain.
"aye, sir."
stop him.
we're ready.
his engines are down. weapons as well. it worked.
commander tucker. i'm impressed. i'm beginning to see who's the true master of this vessel.
"oh, save it. captain archer runs this ship. you're sweet-talking the wrong guy. let's go."
okay.
the dizziness should fade in a couple of hours.
glad to hear that.
"at least the pheromones are wearing off. i haven't thought about the orions for what, a whole ten minutes?"
the entire crew's been bumping into walls. it's like someone spiked the water supply.
the after effects will be around for at least a few days.
well done.
"thank you, captain."
you'll be glad to know my log won't mention your firing on a fellow officer.
i appreciate that.
a court-martial would hardly be a fitting ending to this incident. at least we've learned something about the orions.
"yeah, the women are in charge."
it proves that even the most disagreeable species have some positive attributes.
was that my imagination?
i don't think so.
it almost sounded like you were making a joke.
"at least, trying to make one."
"i assure you, if i ever decide to make a joke, you'll know about it."
there it is again.
"t'pol, if i didn't know better, i'd think you were picking up some of trip's bad habits."
i guess we proved it again.
proved what?
that you and i make a hell of a team.
we do seem to work well together.
even more now that we're in each other's heads.
you're returning to columbia?
i imagine captain hernandez is getting pretty antsy to have her chief engineer back.
there are still numerous repairs to be carried out here.
"i think kelby can handle them. he'd been observing my work pretty carefully, when he wasn't trying to blow up the ship."
"kelby is a fine engineer, but he lacks experience."
why don't you just say it?
say what?
that you want me to come back.
i believe i did. i think your presence here would be extremely beneficial to our operations.
no. that you want me back.
i don't know what you mean.
my mistake. see you around.
"wait, trip. i want you to come back."
then i'll think about it.
trip!
"three days ago, i told captain hernandez i wanted a transfer back to enterprise."
three days ago?
"i realised this is where i was meant to be, and that this thing between us isn't that big of a deal."
agreed.
guess we got a lot of work to do.
live long and prosper.
board that ship! take everything you can!
the booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods.
it can stimulate the pain centre of virtually any humanoid. a synaptic scan calibrates it for each species.
they call this progress.
"there's something to be said for a good, old-fashioned flogging."
"well, that's what's so exceptional about this device. traditional forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system. after a time, the brain ceases to feel anything."
"these sensors continually shift the stimulation from one nerve cluster to another, keeping the subject in a constant state of agony."
"i think you enjoy your work too much, doctor."
what exactly did mister terev do?
i'm not certain. i suspect he was late for his duty shift. aren't all tellarites guilty of something?
did you get a chance to look over my proposal?
i read it.
and?
"we're going to rendezvous with the fleet as ordered. i'm not going into tholian space based on data from some anonymous source. maybe you haven't heard, but we have a rebellion to put down. the tholians aren't part of it."
you saw the data. this technology would give us a tactical advantage. we could end the war tomorrow.
"you see this as your big chance, don't you?"
sir?
"you bring that ship home, and you'll be a hero. the emperor pins a medal on your chest. you might even get that command you've always wanted."
my only concern is saving the empire.
resume your station.
"captain, you're making a mistake."
you can either go back to the bridge or take the place of that tellarite. which do you prefer?
understood.
what do you think you're doing?
reviewing status reports.
this is supposed to be your sanctuary. a place to get away from status reports.
you're the one person on this ship that i don't mind giving in to.
and probably the only one who doesn't want to slip a knife in your back. i heard the battle went well at tau ceti.
is that what you heard?
"word on the ship is the war may be over soon. i'll go back to brazil, start teaching again. you'll accept a comfortable desk job at headquarters. we'll have the weekends."
you've been listening to propaganda. things went badly at tau ceti. very badly. we lost twelve ships. keep this to yourself. if the crew learns what really happened
forget about the war. this is our time.
don't!
you'll hang for this.
lock him in the brig.
"sir, let me take him down to the cargo bay. i'll finish him quickly, quietly."
i want him alive.
"still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the brig."
"if anything happens to forrest, i'll shoot you myself. are we clear, major?"
"perfectly, sir."
"stand aside, commander."
where's captain forrest?  contact security.
this is first officer archer. in accordance with starfleet orders this date
i've relieved captain forrest of duty and assumed command of enterprise. my orders are to
"take the ship into tholian space for a mission of vital importance to the empire. i can't reveal the details of our assignment, but i can tell you this."
"if we're successful, starfleet will crush the rebellion once and for all."
no crew in starfleet has been tested more in battle. i know i can count on each of you to perform your duty to the best of your ability. nothing will impede our march toward victory. long live the empire.
long live the empire.
we've received no such communiqués from starfleet command.
it was sent on a private channel.
i'd like to see those orders.
all in good time. alter our heading. two one five mark thirteen. maximum warp.
"yes, captain."
"corporal, escort commander t'pol to cargo bay two. you'll find a suliban cloaking device there. bring it to engineering and help tucker install it. we're going to need the cloak to complete this mission."
these orders appear to be authentic.
appear? all i require from you is your loyalty. do i have it?
you are in command.
i'm glad we can agree on something. do you recognise this?  it belonged to zefram cochrane. he used it to kill the first vulcan who stepped onto terran soil. i wonder how history would have played out if cochrane hadn't turned the tables on your invasion force. humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around.
i'm not a slave.
you're vulcan. never forget that. how long until we cross into tholian space?
it's likely we already have. they frequently annex systems outside their core territory.
there's a warp signature encoded on this. notify me the moment you find it.
if there's nothing further.
there is. i'm promoting you to first officer.
major reed's next in line. he won't be pleased.
"reed is a capable soldier, but he has trouble following orders. and i know he has ambitions of his own."
you've made it clear you don't approve of vulcans.
"maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and your people. without vulcan technology, the empire wouldn't be where it is today. dismissed."
"serving as my personal guard will have its privileges. you'll have your own quarters, better food. you'll accept orders from me and me alone, is that clear?"
"yes, sir. and captain, if i may? i'd like to be the first to congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. i'm certain that in years to come."
"you already have the job, sergeant. don't talk yourself out of it.  don't mind porthos. he hasn't had his dinner yet.  come in."
that'll be all.
you didn't receive a communiqué from starfleet. i would have known if something came through. a mutiny. didn't think you had it in you.
i'll take that as a compliment.
where's captain forrest?
he's safe.
how do i know that you didn't push him out of an airlock?
i want to talk to him.
not right now. he'll remain alive as long as you don't cause any trouble. no hidden distress signals to starfleet. i need you and your expertise.
is that all you need? you've never forgiven me for leaving. i'm sorry if i hurt you.
"you saw an opportunity for advancement, and you took it."
"just as you did. you should've been captain from the moment we left spacedock. you've always known that. if it hadn't been for all those admirals conspiring behind your back, enterprise would have been yours. tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous captain is yours for the taking."
i've never been one to argue with tradition.
t'pol to captain archer.
maybe we should keep our relationship on a professional level.
"captain archer, please respond."
go ahead.
we're approaching the warp signature.
on my way. i expect you to be in a better mood when i get back.
captain on the bridge.
we're closing on target. twenty thousand kilometres.
there's one biosign aboard. tholian.
power the tractor emitters.
he's seen us. he's arming weapons.
disable his ship. i don't want the pilot injured.
done.
there's an overload building in his reactor.
major!
"it wasn't my doing, sir. i targeted his weapons only."
i believe the pilot may be attempting to destroy his own ship.
lock on the transporter. beam him into the decon chamber.
captain.
we have the pilot.
archer to sickbay. we beamed a tholian into decon.
modify the atmosphere in there.
it may take a moment. tholians have rather extreme life support requirements. increasing temperature to four hundred and eighty kelvin.
"if you're angry now, just wait."
how is he?
"how is it would be more accurate. tholians possess both male and female characteristics. its biosigns, such as they are, appear to be stable."
will it understand me?
"i'm captain archer. you're on board the terran flagship, enterprise. answer my questions, or you will be harmed."
it's demanding to be released.
i want to know where you're holding the terran vessel you captured.
my people will find your ship and destroy it.
a minor adjustment to life support should make it more co-operative. decreasing temperature fifty degrees.
tell me what i want to know.
something about your maternal ancestor.
take it down another fifty.
its exoskeleton is beginning to fracture.
i agree. i agree.
go on.
the ship is in the vintaak system at a facility orbiting the gas giant.
what the hell is that?
a short-range transmission.
a distress signal. you think it has a comm. device in there?
its crystalline structure may act as a natural transmitter.
"sir, i recommend we beam it into space immediately."
"no. i need to keep it alive for now, until i can verify what it's told us. find some way to knock that thing out."
"yes, captain."
"you forget something? biggs! get the commander a radiation meter. you don't want to end up like me, do you? i've absorbed enough delta rays to guarantee my grandchildren glow in the dark."
flux coupler.
"they say for every year you spend next to one of these things, you lose a decade off your life expectancy. which means i'll probably be dead by the end of the week."
you should speak to captain archer about a promotion.
"well, you're his first officer. you could talk to him for me."
why would i do that?
i did you a favour once.
we agreed never to discuss that.
and i haven't.
i'd hardly call it a favour. you enjoyed yourself.
"several times, as i recall. so, how many years is it until your pon farr comes around again?"
where the hell's that coming from?
pull the matrix converters!
can you repair the cloak?
it'll take at least a day.
you have six hours.
"there are dozens of eps feeds on this deck, and the only one that overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device."
"the power surge disabled other systems. internal sensors are down, we've lost grav-plating on g deck."
the cloak's your first priority.  someone's responsible for what happened. find out who.
"my people can investigate this. i don't need his kind crawling around, pulling relays."
get the cloak online.
who sabotaged the cloak?
was something damaged?
i know admiral black has an agent on enterprise. i want the name.
you really think that the admiral would plant a spy on my ship and then tell me who it is?
"go to his quarters, search his personal files. look for messages from starfleet."
"follow his orders, and you'll be executed as a co-conspirator."
"aye, captain."
"this isn't like you, jonathan. you never lusted for power and glory. that's why i trusted you at my side for all these years, because you have no ambition."
"if that's right, then why are you in the brig?"
release me and i promise your death will be quick. you won't get that guarantee from the admiral. kill me and she'll never forgive you.
the saboteur entered this junction and deliberately overloaded this eps waveguide.
that junction's supposed to be off-limits.
the intruder alarms were disabled.
how?
there's only one way i know of. by running a high-level diagnostic scan. commander tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes before the overload.
who ordered you to sabotage the cloak?
i didn't!
"reed, i'll kill you when i get out of this!"
i'd like to see you try.
"i checked the records. admiral black recommended you for chief engineer. he insisted forrest replace his own man with you. you're working for the admiral, aren't you? what have you told him?"
"captain, you've got it all wrong. it wasn't me!"
what have you told him?
"please, captain. i've always been loyal to you!"
break him.
it hasn't been that good in a long time. the things a girl will give up for her career.
the data i gave you. did you transmit it to the fleet admiral?
of course. what was it?
insurance policy.
what's wrong?
"tucker's a competent engineer. if he wanted to damage the cloak, he could have done a much better job."
"well, it couldn't have been easy with t'pol looking over his shoulder."
"computer, locate commander t'pol."
unable to comply. internal sensors are offline.
the sensors were damaged by the overload.
what's going on?
stay here.
i wondered what was keeping you.
i needed time to find help.
no alarm?
i've disabled the internal sensors and the comm. system.
we'll take the bridge first.
"set a course out of tholian space, maximum warp."
i can't alter our heading.
full stop!
the helm's not responding.
having trouble?
you did this.
autonavigation can't be released until we've reach the coordinates i've set.
restore the controls now.
i can't. they've been encrypted with a random code.
can you override the helm?
it'll take several days to break the encryption.
"we'll arrive at the co-ordinates long before then.  the bridge is yours, captain."
ten hours in the booth. impressive.
get him out of there.
bring major reed. i want him to spend some time in this invention of his.
you going to shoot me now or wait for court-martial?
"fleet admiral gardner's ordered you released. he received the data you sent him. the admiral finds your suggestion intriguing. since you've already locked us on this course, i've been ordered to investigate your mystery ship. you betrayed me. don't think for one moment i'm going to forget that. get cleaned up. you're briefing the senior staff in an hour."
a parallel universe? the science directorate has examined all of these theories. they've found no evidence of alternate realities.
"the tholians are a little more open-minded than your people. they detonated a tricobalt warhead here, inside the gravity well of a dead star. the explosion created an interphasic rift. a doorway into another universe."
a doorway.
"the rift was unstable. it was too dangerous to send one of their own ships through, so they transmitted a distress call into the opening, hoping to lure a ship from the other side. their plan worked brilliantly."
how did you learn all this?
the tholians rely on outside labourers. humanoids. some of them can be bought for the right price.
i hope you didn't pay too much.
my contact transmitted these images before his signal was jammed.
you can barely see anything.
"computer, enhance grid three alpha."
an earth ship?
"according to some theories, everything that exists in our universe should also exist there."
another terran empire? another starfleet?
so what? how does this help us?
"the tholians quantum-dated a piece of the hull. this ship is not only from another universe, it's from another time. about a hundred years into the future. imagine the technology we can find on that ship. new tactical systems, advanced bio-weapons. engines that can reach speeds we can only dream of. all of it ours for the taking!"
"this is ludicrous, captain. someone has fabricated this evidence to lure us here. commander archer is guilty of assault and mutiny."
"that's enough, commander."
"sir, i believe we should send"
i said shut up! we're investigating this. get that cloaking device working.
the captain wants a progress report.
i'll need another minute to calibrate the field converters. i spent four hours in the booth because of you.
perhaps you should direct your anger at commander archer.
you disabled the alarms in that junction and made it look like i did it.
you're mistaken.
the hell i am! i think i'd remember if i had sabotaged the ship!
not necessarily.
what did you do to me?
i lured you away from engineering with the promise of a sexual encounter.
my mind to your mind.
"once we were alone in my quarters, i implanted a telepathic suggestion."
my thoughts to your thoughts.
i compelled you to sabotage the power grid.
"after you completed the assignment, we melded again. i altered your memory of what had happened. it was my duty to help captain forrest regain command."
you're going to regret what you did.
threats are illogical.
engineering to bridge!
go ahead.
we're ready.
i'm going to have to channel everything except auxiliary power.
engage the cloak.
we've reached the coordinates. autonavigation has disengaged.
let's see where we are.
magnify the moon on the far right.
"primary systems are offline, including life support. we're reading thirteen biosigns, all alien. one of them appears to be reptilian. they're clustered in this section."
any sign of the crew?
we've detected no human signatures.
it's likely the crew was executed.
look at the size of those coils. i'll bet that thing could do warp seven.
"we'll send an assault team aboard. you brought us here, you lead it. download whatever you can from the database, then destroy the ship."
destroy it? we have to take the ship with us.
it's too dangerous. we are deep in tholian space.
"sir, you can't do this."
you have your orders! dismissed.
"go with him. i don't want archer to return from this mission. do i make myself clear, commander?"
someone's removed these components.
they're gutting the ship.
human.
"if you'd like, sir, i could hold that for you."
nap time isn't over yet.
i'm picking up a transmission. it's coming from decon.
bridge to phlox.
what's happening down there?
the sedative is no longer working.
"well then kill it, now!"
with pleasure.
three ships are moving toward our position.
doctor?
"a few more seconds, captain. will you kindly die?"
phlox to bridge.
you won't be having any further trouble from our guest.
one of the tholian ships is hailing us.
this must be the captain.
his neck's broken.
we should be able to overload the reactor from here.
get started.
four more ships.
contact archer. tell him to abort the mission. lay in a course out of here.
they're jamming us.
target the nearest ship. fire!
no damage.
"torpedo launchers, fire when ready."
they can see us.
"get us out of here. engineering, disengage the cloak and transfer all power to engines."
"the cloak's not responding, sir."
how much longer?
maybe you'd like to take a stab at it.
i can activate their systems.
"stand aside, commander."
almost there.
enterprise is under attack.
"hull plating's down. we've lost power on decks c, d and e."
engineering to bridge. the containment fields are failing.
can you vent the antimatter?
negative. reactor breach in three minutes.
this is the captain. all hands to escape pods. abandon ship. you heard my order!
what do you think you're doing?
"i'll buy you as much time as i can. get out of here, now."
enterprise is taking heavy damage.
can you bring weapons and engines online?
i'll see what i can do.
give me a hand with them!
commander.
commander!
you've got thrusters.
release the docking clamps.
i can't.
what about weapons?
this power grid's a mess! it's going to take a few minutes.
"sir, the shields are functional."
raise them.
"our shields are weakening the clamps, but they're still holding."
i'll alternate port and starboard thrusters. that should shake them loose.
we're free.
firing aft thrusters.
six tholian ships moving toward us.
how much longer for weapons?
the power couplings have been removed. i don't know if i can bypass them.
sir.
mister tucker.
"stand by. i could use some help over here.  when i tell you, shunt the plasma to the forward emitters."
three more ships approaching.
just a few more seconds!
what was that?
they've locked on a tractor beam. we're being pulled back into the dock.
it's now or never!
stand by! now.
tactical systems are online.
full thrusters.
the remaining ships are retreating.
the station's opened fire.
does this thing have aft torpedoes?
you better believe it. they're armed.
escape pods. twelve kilometres off the port bow. they're ours.
bring them onboard.
we need warp drive.
"engineering's been stripped to the bulkheads. but the good news is, most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck. but i need time to figure out how to put it all back together."
how much time?
"two or three days. sir, i'm not even sure what some of these systems are supposed to do. it's like i'm chief engineer on a steamship coming aboard the first interplanetary transport."
"if we don't have warp capability in twelve hours, i'm going to find a new chief engineer."
i suggest we make use of the alien workers. they may know something about these systems.
"keep them under close surveillance. once warp drive is restored, we'll set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet."
we're in no condition for battle.
we made quick work of the tholians.
"this ship is designed to be operated by a crew of four hundred. there are only forty seven of us. the logical course of action is to take defiant to earth, allow starfleet to study it, reverse-engineer its systems."
there's no time! the empire could lose this war in a matter weeks if we don't get the defiant and its weapons to the front lines. dismissed! commander.  not you.
i should shoot you for betraying me.
the orders giving you command of enterprise were obviously fabricated. it was my duty as a starfleet officer to help captain forrest regain control of his ship.
you swore your loyalty to me.
you should be aware captain forrest ordered me to kill you.
why are you telling me this?
forrest is dead. his orders are no longer valid. you are my commanding officer.
"i never had a problem with your people until they became a part of this rebellion. if i had another officer capable of doing your job, i'd show you to the nearest airlock. i need you to get this ship up and running. but if i hear so much as a rumour that you're working behind my back"
understood.
get out.
what are you wearing?
i found it in the captain's wardrobe.
these people had some strange ideas about uniforms.
i can't find a mention of it anywhere.
a mention of what?
"the empire. as far as i can tell, it doesn't exist in the other universe."
no empire?
"a lot of the names are the same, but their history has been rewritten. instead of building an empire, earth became part of an interspecies alliance."
the united federation of planets?
more like a federation of fools.
what about us? do we exist in this universe?
"computer, access biographical file, starfleet officer hoshi sato."
working.
"hoshi sato. comm. officer on starfleet's first warp five ship. in her late thirties, she created the linguacode translation matrix."
at least she was remembered for something.
i can tell you who she married. it even says how you died.
stop. i don't want to know.
but this isn't you.
i don't care. computer. display file on starfleet officer jonathan archer.
working.
"son of famed warp specialist henry archer, jonathan was appointed captain of starfleet's first warp five ship. his name is among the most recognised in the federation. he earned an impressive list of commendations during his career. historians called him the greatest explorer of the twenty second century. two planets were named after him."
hey.
there's nothing great about that man. he sold out earth's future to a group of subhuman species. great men are not peacemakers. great men are conquerors.
forget about him. your future is just beginning. can you imagine the look on the emperor's face when he sees this ship? you'll be declared hero of the empire. starfleet'll have to give you a command of your own.
i already have a command of my own.
what's the problem?
commander. somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these housings.
why are you bothering me with this? they're probably on the hangar deck.
"no, sir, you don't understand. they were here ten minutes ago. i went to get this coupler. when i came back, the regulators were gone."
"you'd better find them, because if this junction's not on line in ten minutes, i'm going to tell archer you're the reason we don't have warp drive."
"yes. yes, sir."
who's in here?
i found traces of reptilian saliva in the ensign's wounds.
something bit him?
"the bite radius would suggest a particularly large reptile, more than two metres in length."
can you find this thing on internal sensors?
it's not in the primary hull. sensors are still offline on the engineering decks.
perhaps it was a pet owned by one of the original crew.
"unless one of them owned a velociraptor, i find it extremely unlikely."
"there's no sign of the regulators. without them, we can't initialise the reaction chamber. we're stuck at impulse."
whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components to steal.
"the slaves we captured, bring one of them to the briefing room."
"certainly, sir."
what attacked my crewman?
he promised he'd kill us if we told you.
i'll kill you now if you don't.
please!
stand aside.
t'pol to major reed. bring another prisoner to the briefing room.
acknowledged.
"from what i'm told, the maximum setting can actually disintegrate a person. i've been looking forward to trying it."
his name is slar.
who's name?
"our slave master. he was in charge of the salvage operation. when you boarded the ship, he hid in the service crawlways. he was planning to sabotage the ship."
where in the crawlways?
possibly near the power transfer conduits on deck twenty two. it's warm there. his species likes it warm.
what species?
gorn. he's he's a gorn.
we had it cornered in turboshaft three but it appears to have escaped through this access tube. that's when we lost contact with mckenzie and browne.
"they're taking too long. when my ship was in jeopardy, i didn't let security handle the situation. i took care of it myself."
i'd have better luck sending a squad of tellarites to capture this thing. put an assault team together. i'll lead it myself.
"sir, i'm picking up a signal from inside the ship. i think it's the reptile."
can you pinpoint its location?
the frequency's scrambled.
i want to talk to it.
the translator matrix is tied in.
this is captain archer. return our plasma regulators now.
i want to leave this ship.
"give me what i want, and we'll talk."
no. i'm familiar with your species. humans are not trustworthy.
you will give me a shuttlecraft. once i'm away from this ship
i'll tell you where to find the regulators.
"this is not a negotiation! the regulators, now! if you don't comply, i'll give the order"
he closed the channel.
"major, get the team together. your best men."
the gorn's offer is reasonable.
"he has no intention of returning the regulators. if we give him a shuttle, he'll contact his people and come back here with a warship. without warp drive, we'll be an easy target."
defeat this gorn and you'll finally earn the respect you deserve.
"there's a biosign, very faint, in access tube seven alpha near junction three."
"i'll seal off the bulkhead here. that'll leave him with only one escape route. flush him out, drive him into this junction. i'll be waiting for him."
understood.
reed to captain archer.
go ahead.
it's not here.
he's modified a communicator to emit a false biosign.
meet us in junction three.
acknowledged.
shut that bloody thing off.
it's a trap!
"i've failed you, captain."
archer to t'pol. where is it?
the gorn's moved into the primary hull.
it's on deck nine.
we're going to plan b. access the environmental controls on that deck. wait for my signal.
acknowledged.
"archer to t'pol. section four a, on my mark."
standing by.
now!
enhancing grav-plating.
grav-plating's at twenty g's.
give me your weapon.
what's major reed's condition?
"at this point, he could go either way. no doubt there'll be several discreet celebrations if he should expire."
i notice you've been making extensive use of the library database.
"i was merely researching classical literature. i wanted to compare our major works with their counterparts in the other universe. i skimmed a few of the more celebrated narratives. the stories were similar in some respects, but their characters were weak and compassionate. with the exception of shakespeare, of course. from what i could tell, his plays were equally grim in both universes."
"examine their historical files. you may want to learn more about their federation. did you know in the other universe, humans and denobulans are considered equals? as are vulcans. you don't find this interesting."
"i find it dangerous. if i were the captain, i'd restrict access to that database. i'm certain he wouldn't want to give his crew any ideas."
perhaps you should reconsider the repercussions
this is the captain. all hands to battle stations.
report!
hull breach on b deck. emergency bulkheads are engaged.
concentrate your fire on the andorians.
"hull plating's at thirty two percent. admiral, there's another vessel approaching."
more rebels?
no.
direct hits.
the tellarite ship's opened fire. no damage.
lock on their reactor. fire when ready.
target destroyed.
the vulcan ship's trying to escape.
pursuit course.
"captain, they're no threat to us. i recommend we"
fire when ready.
the last andorian ship is retreating.
weapons are locked.
no. let them go. i want the other rebels to know what happened here. get me admiral black.
archer?
"sorry we're late for the party, admiral."
where's enterprise? is captain forrest with you?
"it's going to take some time to explain, sir. perhaps you'd like to see the defiant for yourself."
"a most impressive vessel, commander. with the technology on this ship at our disposal, the rebels won't stand a chance."
"glad you agree, sir."
i intend to recommend that you get your own command at the earliest opportunity.
"respectfully, sir, you have the authority to grant a battlefield promotion."
"unfortunately, we don't have a ship to give you at the moment."
the defiant.
i'm sure the fleet admiral has other plans for this ship
"they're never going to give you this ship, you know that. they'll tear it apart, try to learn its secrets. if you're lucky, you'll end up commanding a moon shuttle. don't you see what the admiral's planning? he's going to present this ship to the emperor himself. he'll take all the credit, and you'll end up a historical footnote."
"once we reach earth, we'll disassemble its tactical systems. our experts will want to examine  with any luck, we should be able to replicate the phase cannons and upgrade  the rebels won't know what hit them. what you've accomplished could alter the course of the war. the people of the earth are in your debt, commander."
"that's captain. you're relieved, admiral."
"our entire assault fleet wiped out by a rebel attack. thousands of your fellow starfleet officers dead. if the defiant hadn't arrived when it did, all of you would be among them. and who are we to blame for this? not the brave men and women who gave their lives for the empire. the criminals who are losing this war are sitting in their comfortable offices back at starfleet command. their weakness invited our enemies to strike, and their corruption and arrogance have brought the empire to the brink of defeat! i've been a soldier all my life, and i will not stand by and let these people destroy an empire that has endured for centuries! i ask you, all of you to join me. we cannot put down this rebellion so long as our forces are commanded by dishonourable men. before we can defeat the rebels, we must defeat them. that ship out there is the key to our victory. with the defiant on our side, there will be nothing to stop us."
long live the empire!
shoot the first one who stops applauding.
enter.
"it's not wise to make that gesture, even behind closed doors. it is agreeable to see you again."
did you review the historical files?
the implications are intriguing.
intriguing?
this alternate universe is very different from ours. i'm not certain a federation could ever exist here.
i thought you were an idealist.
that was many years ago.
we have to take action. archer intends to overthrow starfleet and the emperor.
"not for our people. the weapons on that ship will annihilate the rebels, including thousands of vulcans. we can give them an advantage."
how?
i can download the data on defiant's engines and tactical systems. we'll give it to them.
data will be of little value. archer still controls that ship.
i'm going to destroy that ship.
what?
"i can disable defiant's power systems, but i'll need your help. do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the empire?"
i'm too old to become a revolutionary.
"i know archer. he blames our people for inciting the rebels. if he becomes emperor, he'll lay waste to vulcan. i can't do this without you."
my senior officers don't think i can do this.
they'll come around.
"t'pol doesn't approve, either. i can see it in her eyes."
"maybe it's time to get rid of her, now that this ship's operational."
not just her. we'll get rid of all the non-terrans. i'll transfer them off defiant.
all of them?
the rebels have spies everywhere. i can't afford to have a single alien aboard my flagship.
"i hope you're not planning on getting sick anytime soon. in case you haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien."
i've got nothing against phlox. his people aren't rebels. it's not in their nature. he can stay.
i've never been the consort of an emperor before. is there anything i need to know?
"i think you, i think you've got the basics down."
put me through to fleet admiral gardner. corporal. escort commander t'pol to transporter room two. your service aboard this ship is no longer required.
archer. what the hell is going on?
i take it you received my message.
you demanded starfleet's unconditional surrender! have you lost your mind?
you've seen the specs on the defiant. you know what its weapons can do.
i want to speak with admiral black.
he's not available right now. i suggest you order your forces to stand down. starfleet can't afford to lose any more ships.
"this is your only warning, commander. do not approach earth or you will be fired upon!"
bridge to doctor phlox.
this is phlox.
there's a medical emergency on the avenger. you're needed immediately.
acknowledged.
neither of you appears to be injured.
you're the only non-terran on the defiant. any of us would arouse suspicion.
you heard archer's speech. he's delusional.
"it's not a delusion if the captain has the power to do what he says. and from what i've seen, he most certainly does. i should report you both."
are you loyal to the empire or not?
of course i am!
archer plans to kill the emperor and take his place.
the captain has proven himself in battle. perhaps he should rule the empire.
"if archer fails, his crew will have to answer for his crimes."
"we'll be executed. there's an old tradition. if someone saves the emperor's life, it's said there's no request he can refuse them. consider the possibilities. a medical facility of your own with unlimited resources. you could conduct experiments as you see fit."
don't forget the females.
females?
you'll be able to choose as many concubines as you'd like.
"if the emperor were my patient, i'd be obligated to save his life. i suppose what you're suggesting isn't that different."
what's this?
"save it, commander. the schematics you downloaded. where are they?"
schematics?
let's go.
i was hoping you'd put up a fight.
i'm surprised you're not exhausted from all the beds you've jumped into recently.
commander tucker told me i should give you a few pointers in that area.
bring her.
shut down the turbolifts.  secure the bridge.
who are you working with? i hope you're prepared to die.
my death will change nothing. you will not prevail.
the defiant will prevail. it's simply a matter of firepower.
the federation is our future.
you're mistaking our universe for someone else's.
"it may take centuries, but humanity will pay for its arrogance."
these interruptions aren't helping.
i need an estimate.
the inside of this panel
doesn't look anything like the schematic you gave me.
you need to remove the duotronic module.
the relays are behind it.
i've removed the module.
you have to disengage the flow regulators before you remove the relays
or the plasma will ignite.
"someone's trying to override the bridge lockouts. doctor, you must hurry!"
the warp field's fluctuating.
it's a power drain. primary eps relays.
i'll alert the captain.
no. it's probably just a micro-fracture in the conduit. do you really want to interrupt the captain for that? i'll handle it.  take over.
"yes, sir."
take a team aboard avenger. confine every alien on that ship.
there's no point in continuing. she's not going to talk. we should kill her.
"you've been looking forward to that for a while, haven't you?"
archer to the bridge. report!
main power's offline. we've dropped out of warp.
close to ten thousand metres. target their primary hull.
phlox to soval. i'm finished here. stand by to transport.
what the hell have you done?
i need weapons!
everything's offline.
continue firing.
primary systems are coming back. we have shields.
raise them!
soval to phlox.
their power grid's being restored. what's happening? doctor? respond!
weapons are online.
destroy them!
get us out of their weapons range! divert all power to hull plating!
they've taken heavy damage.
they're trying to escape.
photon torpedoes. lock on to their reactor.
"before i forget, first thing tomorrow, i want you to erase the historical database. i don't want anyone else getting any ideas about this federation of planets."
we'll lose all the data on our counterparts.
exactly.
it'll only take a day for the fleet to return to earth. do you think the commanders will support you?
"they're loyal to the emperor. they don't really care who it is. by the time the fleet arrives, the reign of emperor jonathan archer will have already begun."
"once we put down the rebellion, i'll expand the empire throughout, throughout"
are you all right?
open a channel to fleet admiral gardner.
channel open.
"this is the starship defiant. if you don't surrender immediately, we'll begin targeting your cities. respond."
where's archer? who the hell are you?
you're speaking with empress sato. prepare to receive instructions.
how serious?
"if the swelling gets worse, it could inhibit her breathing."
"i told you to notify me if there was any trouble. now, you say this has been going on for days?"
the monitoring equipment didn't detect the symptoms until this morning.
it isn't calibrated for this type of patient.
well?
fever's diminished. she's fighting it off.
"that's good news, for both of you."
intravascular pressure has stabilised. blood oxygenation is good.
she looks so innocent. it's almost possible to forget what she represents.
we don't want to disturb her.
no.
"having endured a catastrophic world war, earth's governments came to this city for the purpose of creating a just and lasting peace among nations. today, we have assembled here again, representatives of numerous worlds, to forge an unprecedented alliance. with this coalition of planets, we seek to strengthen our bonds of friendship, render permanent the peace that now exists among us for the ongoing exploration of our galaxy. let us dedicate ourselves to these worthy goals so that future generations can look back upon this moment with pride and eternal gratitude. thank you."
people are watching.
nobody knows that better than him.
clap louder. that's an order.
i thought it was a fine speech.
just missing a few names.
you'd think this was all his idea.
it's not about who gets credit.
he could've at least mentioned enterprise. who does he think got the andorians and tellarites talking?
i'm sure history will reflect our contribution.
not if he's writing it.
that's enough.
i hope i didn't embarrass myself too much.
"far from it, minister."
call me nathan. i want to thank you again for attending. having enterprise here seems to put everyone at ease. people feel comfortable in the presence of heroes.
whatever we can do to help.
"well, it certainly helps that the delegates can understand each other. these universal translators work perfectly, thanks to you."
i just updated them with a few things we picked up on the mission.
"whatever you did, they're extremely precise. though, when i'm listening to the tellarite ambassador, i wish they were just a little less precise."
you've set a formidable goal. the drafting of a charter in six weeks?
i've always believed that formidable goals produce formidable results.
i decided to stop waiting.
for what?
you to come over and say hello.
you were busy working.
we never had a problem mixing work and pleasure. smile. i never could get you to smile for the camera.
"how have you been, gannet?"
busy. there haven't been many slow news days since the xindi attack. i hear you're going to be in the neighborhood awhile.
at least until the conference is over.
"we should get together. if we wait another four years, we're going to have too much catching up to do."
can't argue with that.
i'll pretend that was an enthusiastic yes. back to work.
commander tucker does have a point. enterprise laid the foundation for this event. perhaps it should be you they're photographing.
"samuels likes the spotlight, and he's welcome to it."
they're going to kill her.
excuse me?
don't let them.
i'm sorry.
it's a phase-pistol wound.
she's going into shock. get me a med kit!
i just received word from starfleet medical. the wound was too severe. she didn't survive.
do they think it could have been self-inflicted?
they didn't say. do we know who she was?
her name was susan khouri. she was a medical technician. she'd been having some emotional trouble. took a leave from work over a year ago.
any idea who the hair belonged to?
i have a very good idea.
it was from a child no more than six months old. i used every dna identification protocol i'm aware of. i even used a klingon procedure.
go ahead.
"it contains vulcan and human dna. i had the computer search for any matches in the starfleet databank. when i got the results, i ran the search three more times just to be certain."
and?
"according to every analysis, this child is the offspring of commander tucker and commander t'pol."
come in.
we got to talk about this.
it's difficult to talk about something that doesn't make sense.
phlox said dna doesn't lie.
"neither do i. i've never been pregnant, trip."
then how do you explain all this?
i can't. do you believe me?
"yeah. phlox must be wrong, that's all there is to it. if you've never been pregnant, then you can't have a baby."
"trip, the moment phlox said that the child was ours, i knew it was true."
but you said you'd never been
i haven't.
then what are you saying?
"i can't explain how it exists, but i know it does. there's a child out there, and it's ours."
how do you know that?
i'm vulcan.
"fortunately, the news hasn't spread to the general public, and i'd like to keep it that way."
"if we made an announcement, someone might come forward with information."
an announcement of this nature could derail the conference.
how?
"you haven't spent much time on earth lately. after the xindi attack, there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia."
we got a taste of it.
"it died down somewhat, but not completely. there are still people out there who want us to stay in our little corner of the galaxy. the news of a vulcan-human hybrid could inflame them, give them something to rally against."
i can't believe we're talking about more than a small minority.
"as i said, you've been away for a while."
maybe i just have a little more faith in humanity than you do.
can't afford to operate on faith. there's more at stake here than a simple trade agreement. you fought the xindi. you know better than anyone how earth's survival depends on alliances with other species. we don't have the vulcans watching our backs anymore.
this isn't about finding someone else to watch our backs.
all i'm saying is that there's strength in numbers.
all right. i was hoping you'd have some word on the investigation. my engineer and science officer are eager to get some answers.
"i'm sure they are, but i've heard nothing new."
there's got to be something we can do.
starfleet investigators are more than capable of handling this. i suggest we let them do their job. i'll notify you the moment i hear something. i appreciate your co-operation.
reed.
it's captain archer. i want you to talk to an old friend.
"the last time we spoke, you asked me to never contact you again."
i contacted you. susan khouri
"first, we need an understanding."
about what?
"that by speaking to me, you're back in the game. simple as that."
who was she?
"she was more than just an emotionally troubled nurse. she was a member of an underground isolationist movement, terra prime."
i've heard of them. they want to stop all contact with alien species.
they believe it's corrupting our way of life.
i remember they made a lot of noise back when enterprise was launched.
they had a resurgence following the xindi attack. we think khouri was trying to leave the movement.
that's why they killed her?
her defection may have had something to do with the child.
i was getting to that.
the child belongs to two of your crewmen. you tell me.
they claim they don't know anything about it.
"that doesn't seem likely, does it?"
i believe them.
"i admire your loyalty. we think terra prime is involved, and that they're planning something."
you just don't know what?
"we suspect it has something to do with the child. find it, and we'll have the answers."
you recruited her.
i needed her expertise. i thought she was reliable.
"obviously, you were mistaken."
"if she'd told them anything truly damaging, i think we'd know it by now."
"we can't be sure what she told them. anyway, i'm more concerned with why she turned away from us."
i think that she might have become attached to the patient. she spent a great deal of time caring for her.
and what about you?
me?
yes. you've spent as much time with that child as she did.
i feel no differently about it than anyone else that i've treated.
"this isn't anyone else. this is an abomination. and when the time comes, it will be treated as such."
i understand.
"well, i'm going to miss this place. the simplicity. there's no middle ground here and i can see the earth. send in greaves on your way out."
"yes, sir."
i gave the men your message. we'll be ready at a moment's notice.
tell them i appreciate their hard work.
they already know.
"there's one other thing. a loose end that needs tying up. put together a group, have them meet me at the third junction in, say, one hour."
done.
the tellarites are pushing for an embargo against the orions. they claim they've been attacking their freighters.
we have traded with the orions for centuries. we would've known of these attacks. this is tellarite slander.
you have to appreciate their point of view.
the tellarites only want to deprive us of valuable commerce. coridan will never agree to any trade sanctions.
"ambassador, captain archer."
ambassador.
i need to contact my government about the today's developments. excuse me.
how can i help you?
i want everything starfleet has on the investigation.
why come to me?
because the chief investigator turned me down. you can change his mind.
i can't do that. i'm sorry.
susan khouri was a member of terra prime.
"if that's true, it's extremely troubling."
not as troubling as something else we learned. you were once a member.
it seems you're doing fairly well investigating on your own.
that's why you wanted this kept quiet.
i've already explained why there was a need for secrecy. i was very young when i joined terra prime.
you were eighteen.
"didn't you make any questionable choices when you were that age, captain? it was a stupid mistake. i was a fool. my father had died in a freighter accident and i blamed the pilot, who happened to be denobulan. we all have our demons. i've exorcised mine."
"i don't care what you did when you were young, minister. i need your help."
i underestimated you. i suppose i'm not the first person to make that mistake. you'll have your case file within the hour.
thank you.
i can't decide if i like you better in uniform or not.
what are you doing here?
"i've been assigned to do a story on enterprise. they can build a ship that goes faster than light, but they can't give you a decent-sized room."
a story?
"it's told from the perspective of the crew. it'll cover the missions, the perils, life in space. so, shall we start with a tour?"
i've got some work to do.
you're not on duty.
gannet.
"okay, so, maybe i wasn't assigned the story. maybe i suggested the idea to my editor."
he know how you feel about space exploration? that it's the last vestige of colonial impulse?
i only said that to keep you from signing onto this mission.
find another story to do.
it's too late. it's due a week from today.
then you're going to have to find another source for your information.
why are you avoiding me?
can you give me one reason why i shouldn't avoid you?
we both called it off. it was a mutual decision.
and it looks like you've changed your mind.
i haven't decided yet.
that's the first honest thing you've said.
"so, reward me by giving me that tour."
got a minute?
certainly.
"this baby, can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?"
it's a girl.
"a girl. is it okay? i mean, it's part human and part vulcan."
"vulcan and human physiology are not all that dissimilar. from the evidence i have, there's no reason to believe she's anything but perfectly healthy."
that's good to hear.
"you'll also be interested to know she has your eyes, and t'pol's ears."
i still can't believe it.
i'm in something of a quandary about it myself. especially since t'pol's never been pregnant.
she could have gotten pregnant and not told me about it.
"and she had the embryo removed, also without your knowledge? i believe you know the answer to that theory, commander."
"yeah, i guess i do."
"we'll get to the bottom of this soon enough. until then, i suggest you keep any such theories to yourself."
"that's good advice. you know, my father always wanted a granddaughter. he bugged my sister about it constantly."
it seems he got his wish.
yeah.
"in the shadow of this incalculable devastation, we find ourselves facing a colossal challenge. there's an entire world to rebuild. not only our cities and homes, but mankind itself! now is not the time not the time for timidity and second guessing. we cannot afford to doubt ourselves."
the third world war had just ended and the cease-fire was barely three years old.
"unless we act decisively, we will pass on the scars of mutation and decay to future generations."
colonel green.
colonel green. one of many men history has misunderstood.
"for the sake of our children, and our children's children, we must reject the impure and cast it out!"
"before my father died and left me in this facility, i was studying to be a historian. until i had a very verbal confrontation with a certain professor who claimed that green was nothing more than a genocidal madman."
sounds like we had the same professor.
"green euthanised hundreds of thousands who were afflicted with radiation damage. their millions of descendants would've endured horrible disease, yet history, history never says anything about that suffering that greene prevented."
guess it all depends on who writes the history.
makes me wonder if i'll be remembered with any more accuracy.
i don't think you're going to be misunderstood.
"really? sometimes, i'm not certain i understand myself."
"we did what we had to do, not what we wanted to do."
i'm sure greene told himself the same thing.
"he was right, and so are we."
"daniel, you are a wise man."
medical report on the patient. her symptoms are gone. she's one hundred percent.
that's wonderful. wonderful. thank you.
"that was some serious flying, trying to keep the warp fields aligned. columbia was fifty metres above us. one wrong move and we would've lost commander tucker."
how did you keep your cool?
"when i was studying to be a pilot, i memorised something chuck yeager said. i never let myself be afraid. i just focus on the dials and concentrate on flying."
"that simple, huh?"
"most of the time, simple works best."
these are the shuttlepods.
which one did you use to penetrate the sphere in the expanse?
shuttlepod one. do you want to see inside?
if it's okay.
beautiful little ship.
"i always thought so. unfortunately, we use the shuttlepods less and less."
why?
we're getting more comfortable with the transporter.
makes sense. gets you there in a few seconds.
"yeah, but there's no skill involved."
nothing to fly.
"i've always had a tendency to get attached to machines. it's crazy, but every time we use the transporter, i feel we're kind of turning our backs on these guys."
you can't make a choice without leaving something behind.
"when i saw you at that conference, i started thinking about things, decisions i've made."
"is it my imagination, or are you actually opening up to me?"
don't do that.
what?
"whenever things get a little serious, you always turn it into a joke."
it's a bad habit. i have a lot of those.
"here's another one. when i'm attracted to someone, i can't hide it for long."
you and your bad habits.
the autopsy data confirms what we already knew: susan khouri was killed by phase-pistol fire.
the case file contains very little else in the way of evidence. some biographical data on khouri. most of it's out of date.
they don't even know where she'd been living for the past year. it's like she dropped off the face of the earth.
that may be exactly what happened.
you know something?
her blood had elevated levels of growth hormone. i ran some more tests and found traces of myofibrilin.
that's what they prescribe for extended zero-g missions. it's hardly used anymore outside of military exercises. not since the invention of artificial gravity.
it is still given to workers in remote places where artificial gravity isn't practical.
like mining colonies.
"the nearest one is orpheus, on the moon."
"i have heard that the moon is a hotbed of terra prime activity. you know, i think travis has a friend who worked on orpheus. he might be able to get a couple of us inside. we could pay a little visit, undercover."
i want to be a part of that visit.
i'd like to volunteer as well.
tell travis to see what he can do.
"yes, sir."
this is the second time we've been through here. we've seen all this before.
we still have twenty minutes before we have to report to the foreman.
maybe you downloaded an outdated map.
the map is correct.
maybe you're reading it wrong.
we could ask for directions.
give me that.
i think i know what the problem is.
what?
we're lost. let's try that direction.
any particular reason?
it's the only tunnel i don't recognise.
trip.
i think we're getting there.
"i know you're not convinced i've told you the truth, about the child."
what do you mean?
you think i might have gotten pregnant without your knowledge.
i never said that.
i know.
you been talking to phlox.
no. have you?
"look, it's because you're vulcan, isn't it, that you know all this."
i believe so.
i am sick and tired of this bond we've got.
"i don't particularly enjoy it, either."
"listen, for the last time and for the record, i do believe you. and if you get anymore feelings. what?"
"there it is. come on, let's go."
i'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod.
i thought you liked shuttlepods.
i like flying them.
"sure felt like we were flying. i have a rule. if i'm in bed with someone, they have to be in bed with me."
what was that?
you are not here.
i'm just worried about some friends of mine.
want to talk about it?
i'm under orders not to talk about it.
that's the last thing you should tell a reporter.
let's change the subject. how come you haven't settled down?
"i'm never going to settle down. it doesn't mean i'm not going to get serious with someone, if the right circumstance comes along."
and what constitutes the right circumstance?
i'll know it when it happens. what did you mean earlier about reconsidering some decisions you've made?
"i've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to the next. seeing you, i was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at least for me, is to stay in one place for a while."
hoshi.
hmm?
no word yet from trip or t'pol.
is there anything i can help with?
"six of the universal translators started confusing rigelian with andorian. there's a glitch somewhere, but i can't find it."
carry on.
fresh off the boat? one of the s-k models. they only give them to grubbers.
i guess you found me out.
josiah.
turner.
what brings you to this dump site?
change of scenery.
"yeah, that's what i was after, too. only it wasn't the landscape i got sick of. at least there aren't as many of them up here. seems like everywhere you go, humans are getting to be an endangered species."
know what you mean.
bad enough you can't walk down the street without some freak show scaring the hell out of your kids. now the government's making treaties with them.
sometimes i wonder where it's all going to end.
it's going to end with human beings becoming second-class citizens on their own world.
someone's got to make a stand.
"yeah, that's how i feel, too. some of us are meeting tonight at twenty two hundred. level seven, junction four. i think you'll like what we have to say."
i'll try and make it.
i'll look for you.
i've learned something.
one of the locals isn't very fond of vulcans. you were saying?
a doctor from one of the medical facilities was found dead yesterday. they think it was a cave-in.
you're not buying it.
he worked at the same clinic as susan khouri.
i think we each know what we're doing tonight.
seven million people wiped out by aliens. did the xindi even apologise?
no!
did our government ever demand an apology?
no!
"and where are the reparations for the families of those seven million? and now those same leaders want to form a coalition with tellarites, andorians, rigelians, coridanites and vulcans! vulcans, who not too long ago, massacred forty five humans working at the earth embassy! nathan samuels claims that future generations will look back on this era with pride. but if things keep going the way they're going, there won't be any future generations. at least not human. i love humanity too much to sit by and let that happen."
"it's estimated that there are at least five thousand unregistered aliens on earth. now, another study puts that figure at ten thousand. this insanity is the direct result of our government's policy and the enforcers of that policy, starfleet! we need to send a message to the people in power. and there's someone here tonight who is going to help us do just that. commander tucker, of the starship enterprise!"
all that stuff i said about leaving the ship.
"of course, it's off the record. while you're on duty, you mind if i stay here and work a bit?"
i need to speak to gannet.
something wrong?
come with us.
where?
what's going on?
"she's not here to do a story on enterprise, travis."
she's a spy for terra prime.
are you all right?
i think so.
what did you do to her?
"hey, hey."
not nearly enough.
"it's not worth it, romeo. juliet's in good hands. the two star-crossed lovers. i can't help but wonder whether your little drama will end happier than that famous double suicide in a medieval tomb."
who the hell are you?
john frederick paxton. i run this facility.
not for long.
"you're right there, commander. my mining business is about to take a turn for the worse. daniel, get started."
you're behind this.
"behind this? no. i lead this, and proudly too. before you ask, your child is safe and sound, finally sleeping through the night. i forgot how much trouble a newborn can be."
i want to see her.
"no. and no is a word that starfleet better get used to hearing from now on. because up until today, it's always been yes, hasn't it? yes, yes, go right ahead. roam the stars. yes, inform potentially hostile species of the whereabouts of earth. yes, entrust the entire future of our world to non-human creatures who don't even feel like we do. yes, promote the total degradation of mankind by encouraging alien-human relations. well, yes is a word that ends here and now. i'm returning earth to its rightful owners. i am giving earth back to humanity, back to human beings. it is my life's work. it is what i was born to do, and there is no one, not an alien, not a human, that will stop me from achieving it."
"my father designed this facility. he knew that mining was an unpredictable business. mines tap out, veins dry up."
"everyone's aboard, sir."
"go to launch mode, daniel. you're an engineer. i think you'll appreciate this. take a good long look."
where are we going?
"for you, this'll be like a walk across the street. lock it up."
you better hang onto something. she gets a little rusty out of the gate.
you reconfigured your universal translator to record messages from all the other translators. you were spying on the delegates.
you accidentally triggered an id protocol in the network. i tracked it back to the source.
i don't know what you're talking about.
you sure know what everyone else was talking about.
maybe she was after a story. it doesn't mean she worked for terra prime.
"we did a background check. in the last month, you made three trips to the lunar colony."
is that a crime?
depends on what you're doing there.
i was on assignment.
for?
my news agency.
your editor claims he never sent you.
"look, if i'm under arrest, then"
two of my crewmen are at orpheus mining complex. we've lost contact with them.
i don't know anything about your crewmen.
are they in danger?
i want to speak with counsel. now.
take her to the brig. get her whoever she wants.
bridge to captain archer.
"i'm sorry, travis. archer."
a large vessel is taking off from the mining facility.
can you identify it?
"sir, sensors indicate it is the mining facility."
we're being hailed. it's starfleet command.
ignore them. reactor status?
ready.
you're going to warp?
a five second burst.
inside the system?
we'll be lucky if we don't fly apart.
i plan on luck. go.
ten seconds.
"hail them. pursuit course, travis."
aye.
"no response, sir."
tell starfleet command we're going after them.
we're in mars orbit. all systems functioning.
"that was a magnificent piece of flying, daniel."
that's yet to come.
impress me again.
taking us down.
let's see it.
slowing our descent.
tie us in.
it's ours.
let's take in the view.
this is where it all begins. josiah.
they're on the surface.
where?
they've landed near the verteron array. it's used to redirect comets.
they're sending a subspace message on all frequencies.
my name is john frederick paxton. i've just taken over the verteron array on mars. i can now fire on any ship or facility in the system.
he's targeted earth's moon.
"i have no intention of using this weapon again, provided that every single non-human in our system leaves immediately. a new era is at hand, an era that will expose the concept of interspecies unity as an absolute and vicious lie. an era that will witness the advent of a human-centred consciousness"
"that will place our world before all others. as of this moment, mankind casts off the shackles of alien interference and now determines its own fate."
terra prime forever.
"do not be deceived. this is no ordinary, innocent child. this is an alien-human hybrid. living proof of what will happen if we allow ourselves to be submerged in an interstellar coalition. our genetic heritage"
i want that transmission blocked.
we're trying. we can't break through the signal.
then find some way to contact enterprise. i want to speak to archer.
"terra prime is dedicated to the protection of life in all of its diversity. so for the next twenty four hours, we guarantee safe passage to all aliens leaving our solar system. so long as non-humans keep to their own worlds,"
scan paxton's ship for vulcan biosigns. get a transporter lock on the baby and t'pol.
"but if any alien, if one single alien remains after the deadline, terra prime will defend the sovereignty of every single human being"
"and we will begin by destroying the institution whose blind arrogance and moral cowardice have put us all at risk. starfleet command. we do not seek war, but if the aliens do not leave, and force us to fight, i make this solemn promise to all of the sons and daughters of earth. our future will be secure because humanity will prevail."
"he's targeted us with the array. apparently, they don't like being scanned."
get us out of here.
damage?
massive power surge! we've lost half our relays. the beam was only two percent of the array's total output. he could have vaporised us.
we'll consider ourselves warned. set a course to earth.
if you'll excuse me.
of course.
ambassador?
spontaneous demonstrations have already begun around the vulcan compound.
"isolated incidents, i'm sure."
there are protesters chanting outside the andorian embassy. and they're using words that aren't in the universal translator.
it's obvious paxton's ultimatum is part of a co-ordinated plan.
why are we all still here? we could be obliterated at any second!
"paxton's a fanatic, but he's a man of his word. he won't act before his deadline's up."
"the deadline aside, the fact that paxton has the support of so many of your people is almost as troubling."
"i agree. earthmen talk about uniting worlds, but your own planet is deeply divided. perhaps you're not quite ready to host this conference."
paxton's holding two of my officers hostage at the array. we can't attack it.
"the council's aware of that. if you can't bring yourself to fire on them, another captain can be assigned to enterprise. no one will think less of you."
it's not just the hostages. any attack on the array will trigger a massive explosion that could kill thousands of colonists.
"this wasn't an easy decision for the council. the potential for disaster's even greater than you think. over the next thirty months, the terraforming project has fourteen comets set to collide with mars. without the array to divert them toward the polar caps, the comets could hit anywhere, even the domed cities."
i'll take in a small team. we'll break into the facility and stop them.
paxton can destroy any ship that approaches mars.
"if he can't see us, he can't destroy us."
"it's unharmed, just as i said."
her medical readings appear normal.
there's nothing normal about it.
she's not an it.
how did you obtain our genetic material? the child is a binary clone.
they'd need cells from both of us.
the medical freezers on your ship hold bio-samples from your entire crew. terra prime has supporters everywhere.
someone on enterprise helped you? who?
i've let you see your daughter. that's my half of the bargain. now it's your turn.
i need to make modifications on my ship.
i'm listening.
i need you to refine my targeting system.
you really think i'm going to help you turn that array into a weapon?
you really think i'm going to give you a choice?
two meetings in the span of a week. people might start to talk.
i don't like it any more than you do.
"so, you want to go to mars and you need my help."
you know the situation.
i believe i'm aware of the broad strokes. i also understand paxton's tapped into the planetary sensor grid. no one can get within a thousand kilometres of the verteron array without being detected.
and you're going to tell me how.
what makes you think i even have that information?
because your section routinely thinks about the unthinkable. and because you'd never miss a chance to put me in your debt.
"you're a good judge of character. the grid was designed to function in the planet's original atmosphere, but terraforming's made the air much thicker."
how does that help us?
"sections of the grid continually need re-calibration and are prone to false signals. you can exploit that weakness. the good news is, with terraforming there's no more need for pressure suits in the lowland. oxygen, yes. thermal garments"
"according to this, if we keep our altitude less than ten metres above the surface, paxton won't see us."
you'll still need to reach the surface undetected.
"that part's taken care of, without your help."
"so, the student has surpassed the teacher. when you're finished with mars, why don't you come work for me?"
i've got quite enough to keep me busy on enterprise.
"and if archer's coalition is formed, enterprise could be busier than ever."
"indeed? well, then i imagine this'll be the last time we meet."
"always the optimist. good luck, malcolm."
"comet burke, deflected by the array eight years ago. set to hit the north pole of mars at dawn."
you're not serious.
"i have experience with comets, sir."
"compared to penetrating xindi defenses, this'll be a walk in the park."
but that's only fourteen hours from now. what happens if this plan of yours doesn't work?
enterprise will destroy the array as ordered.
all the rocking in the world will not make that child vulcan or human.
"human and vulcan genes produced this child, which indicates our two species have more similarities than differences."
"don't you realise that baby is,  that baby is as much a threat to your species as it is to mine?"
she's not a threat.
"that child is a cross-breed freak. how many generations before our genome is so diluted that the word human is nothing more than a footnote in some medical text? the same thing could happen to your people, or don't you care about that?"
"neither of our species is what it was a million years ago, nor what it'll become in the future. life is change."
"change in this case means extinction, and i, for one, will not let that baby bring humanity to that point."
i won't let you hurt her.
i won't have to.
what does that mean?
we're within range.
bridge to engineering.
kelby here.
we're coming up on the comet.
"i'm on it, sir. this is it, people. cycle the ports. ensign, rig the intakes for cometary debris."
"yes, sir."
"engineering is good to go, sir."
you've got full impulse and warp standing by.
"all right, travis, let's hitch a ride to mars."
"aye, aye, sir."
thank you for seeing me.
what's so urgent?
i never got my lawyer.
you'll have to talk to the captain.
"apparently, he's busy."
we all are. that's it?
i don't work for terra prime. i work for starfleet intelligence.
that's not possible.
you are not the only one who wants to serve his people.
"if you were an s.i. agent, you'd be out of this brig with one call to your division head."
"and then everyone on enterprise would know who i am, including the real terra prime operative."
"mayweather, go ahead."
we're ready for you in the launch bay.
on my way. you know i'm going to tell the captain about this.
he won't believe you.
probably not. why are you telling me this now?
"you're going after paxton. if someone on enterprise is working for him, he could know you're coming."
so you're revealing all of this because you're worried about me.
yes.
i'm touched.
"travis, wait!"
you're not going to manipulate me again. goodbye.
keep the sensors locked on the array. the moment it powers up
"i won't hesitate, sir."
i remember when you used to jump every time the engines hiccupped.
i still do. i'm just better at hiding it.
captain.
don't get too used to that chair. i'm going to want it back.
understood.
"you know, i never used to like vulcans all that much myself. they always seemed so smug. making us jump through hoops for every little advance in warp technology, and they knew the answers all along. so what was it with you? the ears? the fact that they're vegetarian?"
they're not human.
"well, you can't deny that."
and they sat by while millions of our people died. world war three.
we didn't make contact with the vulcans until ten years after the war.
"but they were up there with their superior technology. they could've stopped it, but they didn't. i think it suited their plans. a devastated earth was much easier for them to control."
is that the kind of paranoid crap paxton's been feeding you?
get back to work.
you ever actually met a vulcan?
your friend. she's the first.
"if you got to know some, actually took the time to talk with one"
you obviously did more than talk. and look at what you got for your trouble. some half-human thing.
go ahead.
okay.
you're a traitor. a traitor to humanity.
hull plating's steady at ninety four percent.
what's wrong with the inertial dampeners?
"we need to maintain an erratic flight profile, so we look like a chunk of the comet."
thirty minutes to the atmosphere.
i'm taking us closer to the nucleus. it's going to start getting a little rough.
start?
would you like me to give you something?
i've already had the maximum dosage.
here's a bag.
no.
there's nothing aliens like better than to see us fighting one another.
where're t'pol and the baby?
they're together. you'll eat as soon as you finish your work.
i am finished.
all you've done is try to sabotage the targeting system.
i don't know what you're talking about.
"please. i've been monitoring your work from the control centre. to be honest, i'd have been disappointed if you hadn't tried to sabotage the array. but you did, which proves you're a man of principle. that is why i know you're going to refine the array just as you promised."
i told you i'd make modifications to your ship-- not your weapon.
"in two hours i am going to fire a verteron beam directly at starfleet command. now, with this targeting system the way it is, i will hit starfleet but i'll also take out half of san francisco along with it. i need a scalpel, not a bludgeon."
i don't care what you need.
"starfleet's been warned, if that's what concerns you. now you can either help me, and a few empty buildings will be destroyed, or you refuse me, and millions may die."
you told starfleet when you're planning to fire the array. and you don't think they're going to blast this facility off the face of the planet?
"if you are so eager for a bloodbath, a bloodbath is what you will get. put him in detention. and make sure he has a news screen. i want him to see the bodies when they start to pull them from the rubble."
hello. i'm your mother. you're going to need a name. we should discuss that with your father.
the gravity's starting to tear the comet apart.
we're picking up ionisation from the upper atmosphere.
what was that?
"the engine shut down, but there were no warning lights. the console's locked up."
hull plating's offline. hull temperature climbing! we're coming in too hot.
bypassing auto flight control. switching to manual!
at this speed?
we're out of options.
ground proximity?
five seconds to impact.
"well, that was fun. can we do it again?"
a mark three interlock.
"the closer we get, the more we risk being spotted by paxton's sensors."
get close to that ridge line.
i was thinking the same thing. you'll want to keep your arms inside the vehicle at all times.
thirty-two.
hmm?
this is the thirty second planet i've set foot on.
two hundred and forty eight.
the verteron array is on the other side of that rise. we'll head through there.
i'm told you have something to say to me.
in private.
i keep no secrets from my men.
you and i both know that's not true.
"josiah, give us the room."
i'll be outside.
my daughter's ill. you will arrange for medical care at once.
no one leaves this facility.
"you will provide immediate transport for my child, commander tucker, and myself. the hospital at utopia colony will be suitable until enterprise arrives."
"what, have you been inhaling the atmosphere? what makes you think you can dictate terms to me?"
this.
"taggart's syndrome. since you obviously didn't die by age twenty, you're receiving treatment. rigelian gene therapy?"
you're not a doctor.
"the very thing you're warning humans to avoid is what's keeping you alive. alien knowledge, freely shared. you're not only a terrorist, you're a hypocrite."
this is not the time for timidity and second guessing. we cannot afford to doubt ourselves.
"colonel green also said, to be human is to be pure. under his rule, you would have been euthanised for having a genetic disorder."
i'm not the first significant leader who failed to measure up to his own ideal.
you're not significant!
"history will determine that! so go ahead, tell my followers what you wish. see if they take the word of an alien over mine. what's wrong with your child?"
"elevated white-blood cell count, low-grade fever."
"well, its two halves are warring with one another. alien and human. conflict was inevitable."
josiah.
"your child and the coalition of planets, both doomed from the beginning."
ten metres.
paxton's deadline is up. we have to face an unpleasant reality. captain archer's mission's failed.
paxton will need two minutes to power up the array before he can fire.
two minutes?
it's enough.
i'm not prepared to take that chance. your estimates could be wrong.
i won't destroy the array unless we have no other choice.
i understand your reluctance.
i'm following orders.
i'm giving you new orders. do it now.
"i'm sorry, sir."
i can have you relieved of duty.
"actually, i can only be relieved by a higher ranking officer in my chain of command."
open a channel to admiral gardner.
belay that order. i won't risk exposing our position by breaking radio silence.
you're risking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
i know what i'm doing.
the guard's still walking away.
there's another guard approaching.
took you long enough.
where's t'pol?
"crew quarters, but paxton's getting ready to fire the array."
if he powers it up
enterprise has orders to destroy the complex.
i've spoken to our operatives. there's no indication that the vulcans have withdrawn from their consulates in canberra or berlin.
i never expected them to comply. let's get this done.
i'm picking up a power surge in the array.
you're out of time. destroy the complex now.
take us in. full impulse. charge weapons.
"josiah, begin the firing sequence."
target locked
give the order!
co-ordinates locked in.
two minutes to pulse activation.
step away from the controls.
"jonathan archer, the man who delivered us from the xindi. well, look at you now."
archer to enterprise.
"go ahead, captain."
we're inside the control room.
standing by.
shut it down.
main controls are in there.
ninety seconds to pulse activation.
the room's depressurising. get malcolm out of here! go!
"plasma grid, control panel."
"i know the reason you turned your back on humanity. i blame your father. he wanted the secrets of warp technology so badly, he allowed the vulcans to turn him into their pet human. and you, well, the sins of the father."
plasma grid offline. firing sequence aborted.
"my father never asked anything from anyone. his mining operations transformed the moon from a mere colony into a completely self-sufficient world, and that is how we should go to the stars. taking the worlds we need and taming them, with human hands, and human minds, and human souls."
"that might've worked for the moon, but the galaxy's a lot more crowded than we thought."
that's not our problem.
"it's an opportunity. it's over, paxton."
we're each his father's child.
i've been a miner all my life. you get used to the low oxygen.
firing sequence resumed. pulse activation in thirty seconds.
"pulse activation in fifteen seconds. ten, nine, eight"
i've locked the sequence. you can't stop it from firing. i've locked it!
"four, three, two, one. pulse activated."
"terra prime, forever."
looks like paxton's aim was off.
with a little help from you.
maybe a little.
commander.
she's dying.
i guess we shouldn't keep calling her she.
elizabeth.
my sister would've liked that.
it appears my initial prognosis was incorrect. it's genetic. her vulcan and human dna aren't compatible.
is there anything you can do?
"i'm attempting to stabilise her nucleotides, but there's never been a child like her."
her name is elizabeth.
i can't figure out why the console locked up at the same time the engines shut down.
it does seem a bit coincidental.
"flight control and engine power are routed separately. until they reach that junction. the panel's open. if ionised gas got in here, it could've melted the primary circuits of both systems."
it could've been knocked loose by an impact.
no. it's been forced. this was deliberate.
come in.
"on your feet, sir. shuttlepod one was sabotaged."
sabotaged?
we nearly crashed!
is this your signature?
yeah. you think i had something to do with it?
is there any reason why we shouldn't?
that's a shuttlepod maintenance log. commander tucker took me off that team when he came back from columbia.
who replaced you? who!
ensign masaro.
they really want to postpone the conference?
"postpone is a diplomatic way of saying it's dead. paxton's unnerved them, and there's not a lot i've been able to say to change their minds."
"excuse me, sir. sato, go ahead."
it's archer. are you still with samuels?
we're in the mess hall.
is ensign masaro there?
"no, i don't see him, sir."
we think masaro may be working for terra prime.
samuels may be in danger.
reed and mayweather are on their way.
"wait here, sir."
samuels is in here. he's safe.
captain.
you don't want to do this.
i have to.
give me the phase pistol. that's an order.
"i can't, sir."
ensign.
i wanted you to know i'm sorry. i believed in what we were doing. tell my parents i'm sorry. i never wanted anyone to get hurt.
ensign!
i wish i could do more.
i know.
"when you invited me to join this crew, i thought it would be an interesting diversion for a few months. some time away from the complications of family, which on denobula can be extremely complicated. i didn't expect to gain another family.  it hurts as if she were my own child. make something good come from this, captain."
"fellow delegates, this last week we've seen what humans can be at their worst. but we cannot, we must not use that as an excuse to end the dream that began here. for then, the demons of our past will have won. instead, i want to look to the future and begin by honouring the people responsible for our being here tonight. they represent all of us at our best."
"up until about a hundred years ago, there was one question that burned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream of traveling to them, are we alone? our generation is privileged to know the answer to that question. we are all explorers, driven to know what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. and yet, the more i've experienced, the more i've learned that no matter how far we travel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are not necessarily beyond that next star. they're within us, woven into the threads that bind us, all of us, to each other. the final frontier begins in this hall. let's explore it together."
i hear the conference is back on track.
it's a first step. the captain says it's going to take years to work out the details.
"but it'll happen, and you're part of the reason why."
just doing my job.
so was i.
i know.
"if vulcans and andorians can get along, you'd think we could."
a lot of details to work out.
isn't that the fast way home?
the least i can do is give you a ride.
the launch bay's this way.
come in.
"the delegates at the conference, they've asked about the service for, for elizabeth. they want to attend."
she was important.
"there's something else. i spoke with phlox. it turns out there was a flaw in the technique that paxton's doctors used in the cloning process. human dna and vulcan dna, phlox says there's no medical reason why they can't combine. so if a vulcan and a human ever decided to have a child, it'd probably be okay. and that's sort of comforting."
when are they expecting you in brazil?
"i told them a couple of weeks after the ceremony. with all the receptions, and then i'll need at least a week to clear up the linguistic database."
"after ten years on this ship, i'll bet it'll take a while getting used to the humidity again."
and the bugs.
does the captain have to give a speech?
he's working on it now.
he hates giving speeches.
and he'll undoubtedly make every effort to take no credit.
undoubtedly.
that'd be like zefram cochrane not taking credit for warp drive.
how do you pronounce the name of the second tellarite liberator? challash?
shallash.
"shallash, thanks."
"how's it going, sir?"
"whatever i write, it sounds like i'm trying to take credit for this."
"captain, admiral douglas is asking you to approve the decommission protocols."
"one thing at a time. after the charter's signed, i'll give him whatever he needs to put enterprise in mothballs."
"all senior staff, report to the bridge."
"computer, freeze programme."
save from this time index.
programme saved.
end programme.
"first officer's personal log,  stardate 47457.1. with the unexpected arrival of admiral pressman, my old co, i find myself in an awkward position. counsellor troi has suggested i might get a few insights by calling up an historic holo-programme."
you're sure you don't want to talk about what happened?
i've told you everything i can.
if it's a question of breaking a promise.
not a promise. an order.
have you learned anything on the holodeck about breaking orders?
not yet. i've gone back a couple of days earlier to get a perspective. but i really don't see how this is going to help.
that's why you run a starship and i'm a counsellor.
reed's shorter than i thought he'd be.
maybe the programme's off.
"no, i'm sure it's fine. it's just, you expect larger than life people to be larger than life."
has the andorian hailed them?
not yet.
you might want to leap ahead to that point. it's where things start really happening. and you should consider taking over the galley.
why?
"well, starfleet ships didn't have counsellors in those days, but the chef on the first enterprise came pretty close. i read almost everybody confided in him."
i'll keep that in mind.
supper?
you bet. i'll give you an update.
okay.
"that's impossible. shran's been dead for what, three years?"
this is quite a surprise.
": i'm sorry, pinkskin, but it was essential certain people believed i had met my demise."
including me.
"i know it's been a while, but as i recall, you still owe me a favour."
"i remember. but this isn't a good time, shran. i assume you know where we're heading."
"i may no longer be a member of the imperial guard, but i'm aware of the proposed coalition."
it's more than a proposal. we're on our way to earth to sign the charter.
"the ceremony isn't for three days. if my plan works, you'll be home in plenty of time."
i'm afraid a detour is out of the question right now.
my child's been abducted! kidnapped. you owe me.
you never told me you had a child.
jhamel gave birth five years ago. a daughter. they've taken her.
who?
former associates. it's a long story. you need to let me come aboard.
set a rendezvous course.
"computer, freeze programme. advance ahead one hour. switch to objective mode."
who would've thought civilian life would be more dangerous than commanding a ship for the imperial guard.
i still don't understand why you left. you were a hero.
a hero with a family. i always believed that change was a good thing. i was a fool.
why would you fake your own death?
"i made some poor choices. picked the wrong friends. people involved in questionable business ventures. they think i took something that belonged to them. with the help of some old colleagues from the guard, i managed to make myself disappear. it worked for nearly three years."
your friends found you?
"six months ago. i've been on the move ever since. they took her in the middle of the night. i was in the next room, asleep. useless! it's been a week. they say if i don't return what's theirs, they'll kill her."
then give them what they want.
i don't have it! i never did.
but you have a plan.
"it cost me everything i had, but i managed to find out where they've taken her. they're on a trading outpost, rigel ten."
i'm familiar with it.
"i know these men quite well, captain. i can outwit them, i've done it before. but i'll need at least seven men. you have to help me. it's my little girl."
he's an admitted criminal. you said so yourself.
he said he fell in with some disreputable people. that doesn't make him a criminal.
"if we're late for the ceremony, it will have far-reaching consequences."
"if shran hadn't helped us, i never would've gotten aboard the xindi weapon. have you forgotten that? this alliance is based on friendship and loyalty, exactly what shran is looking for right now."
i don't trust him.
"you don't trust andorians. you never have. thank god the vulcan council is a little more enlightened than you are. if they're willing to forge an alliance with andoria, the least you can do is give shran the benefit of the doubt. when we met ten years ago, i didn't trust you. for that matter, i didn't trust any vulcans. you helped me get past that, remember? i listened to you, now it's your turn to listen to me. i can't turn my back on him, t'pol. try to understand."
i'll try.
"by the way, drop by the galley when you get a moment. chef's trying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together. he wants to know everybody's favourite dish."
there are eighty three crewmembers aboard.
"just go see him, all right?"
don't worry. chef's promised at least six kinds of cheese.
"i appreciate the gesture, but it's not necessary to prepare a special dish for me."
come on. i've already started to reduce the plomeek broth. all i need to know is which roots you prefer.
"in that case, i prefer to be surprised."
pull up a chair. i could use the company. i heard a rumour i may be whipping up some andorian cabbage soup tonight.
we have already lost five hours picking up shran's shuttle. now we're going to lose at least another day diverting our course to rigel.
his child's in danger.
is there anything aboard this ship you don't know?
jonathan is a compassionate man. you should know that by now.
his compassion has gotten us into trouble on many occasions. we could miss this ceremony.
don't worry. i've got a hunch you're going to make it. tea?
thank you.
phlox has giving me his largest edosian suckerfish.
excuse me?
looks like a catfish. i'm hoping it tastes like one. commander tucker's crazy for catfish. do you ever miss him?
"i spent the morning with him, recalibrating the plasma array."
that's not what i mean.
"if you're referring to our intimate relationship, that's been over for six years."
"but the question remains, do you miss him?"
i'm vulcan. i don't miss people.
"sorry, i forgot. is he as concerned as you are about making this ceremony?"
trip rarely questions the captain's decisions.
he doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders blindly.
he's not. he simply tends to agree with the captain most of the time. he trusts him.
would you peel these for me?
"before i joined this crew, i never could have imagined anything more important than following orders."
and now?
"humans believe that sometimes you have to follow your instincts. a very illogical approach, but one i've come to embrace."
"computer, freeze programme. thanks."
there you are.  someone you know?
someone i knew.
pegasus?
phil wallace. hell of a handball player. pressman was getting ready to promote him.
how many died?
seventy one. all but nine of us.
how do you feel about learning the ship wasn't destroyed?
what difference does it make? seventy one people died.
you're feeling guilty. you think in some way you were responsible?
you're the empath. why don't you tell me?
i think it's something else. something about seeing that ship again.
why don't we change the subject? okay?
okay. how did things go on the holodeck?
they picked up the andorian. they're on their way to rigel ten.
i was referring to any insight you may have gained.
i took your advice about the chef. you were right. t'pol opened up to me.
have you met with commander tucker?
"no, i haven't made it to engineering yet. have you spent any time on the nx-01?"
i've never run the programme.
what about the ship itself?
"i think i went when i was a little girl, but i get all those museum ships mixed up."
now's your chance. come on down with me.
i have an appointment in an hour.
i'll get you back in plenty of time. come on.
our brig is bigger than this.
a lot of things change in two hundred years.
watch yourself!
no fish tank.
how could archer survive without a fish tank?
allow me.
"he does have a dog, though."
"right, i remember. one of the musketeers."
porthos.
"ooh, comfy."
no seat for the first officer?
perhaps archer wasn't as fussy as captain picard when it came to people sitting in his chair.
i remember seeing one of these in a photograph.
"kirk's ship had them, i think."
engineering's down this way.
there's something lonely about a ship without its crew.
"computer, add an appropriate crew complement, objective mode."
that's better.
"if you recall, rigel ten is filled with a very unsavoury element. and i rather doubt shran's scheme will be quite as simple as he claims."
i can't imagine the captain would put us in jeopardy this close to signing the charter.
i don't like it. what exactly are you doing?
these injectors need to be purged every six months. are the deuterium filters clear?
we've done all but three.
make it quick.
"aye, sir."
"well, what's the point? this ship will be joining the mothball fleet next week."
"i pretty much built this engine. plan to take care of it as long as i can. been a hell of a run, malcolm. never thought it would come to an end."
all good things. captain thinks there'll be another enterprise before too long.
i imagine.
it won't be the same.
that's okay. come on.
it's sad. commander tucker had no idea he wouldn't make it back.
how reliable are your sources?
"they're criminals, but honourable ones. they promised me that talla's being held here at upper level four. have you fashioned the amethyst?"
"the photograph you gave us had poor resolution, but i'm confident our replication will look authentic."
the tenebian amethyst they think i stole was flawless. they'll undoubtedly have magnifying equipment with them.
they'll need a spectral micrometer to see it's a fabrication.
how many do you expect to show up?
"computer, freeze programme."
he's cute.
don't get any ideas.
reg'll be furious if i'm late. are you going to stay?
"yeah, for a little while."
"good luck. computer, arch."
"computer, how long before they reach rigel ten?"
"sixteen hours, twenty two minutes."
advance to that point. stay in objective mode.
move into a stationary orbit.
"aye, sir."
put a team together. meet us in the launch bay.
"captain, can i have a word with you?"
we can handle this without you.
"well, that's flattering."
you know what i mean. you've got the biggest day of your life coming up. a lot of people are counting on you being there.
"i appreciate you worrying about me, but i'll be fine."
"you don't need to be putting yourself in harm's way. i'm telling you, we can take care of it."
"rigel was the first place we visited, remember? now it's going to be the last. poetic justice. why should you have all the fun?"
we're going through the troposphere. might get a little bumpy.
have you been down to see chef yet?
first thing this morning. you?
he talked about you.
me?
us.
what about us?
it's not important.
"why'd you bring it up, then?"
do you ever miss me?
you mean?
yes.
you know how long it's been?
that's not what i asked you.
"well. yeah, i guess, sometimes."
i haven't thought about those days in a long time.
benefit of being a vulcan.
"after speaking with chef, i realised we may never see each other again."
what are you talking about?
we're taking different assignments. there's no way of knowing.
there's every way of knowing. i can guarantee you we're not going to lose touch. stop thinking like that.
"however long it may be, i believe i'm going to miss you."
archer to shuttlepod two.
"go ahead, sir."
shran's made contact. everything's set. i'll lead you in.
understood.
"stop there. unless i'm mistaken, i thought you had no idea where the amethyst was."
where's my daughter?
"funny how a missing child has a way to jog the memory, eh, shran?"
where is she?
i thought you were happily married. who's the vulcan?
"i'm not interested in your associates, so don't question mine."
put the case down and open it.
we want the child first.
i could shoot you both.
"you'll never get this case open, i promise you."
"you let a female negotiate for you, eh, shran?"
you heard her.
are you all right?
i'm hungry.
now open the case.
"set it down. now, back up."
let her take the girl.
"fine, but you stay. one step, and this little blue beauty won't have a father to come home to."
i want you to go with t'pol. you'll be safe with her. she'll find you something to eat. obey your father.
now step back.
what are you doing?
stand still and you won't be harmed.
hold on!
"thanks, boss."
any time.
you're certain it won't be a problem?
i'll feel more comfortable getting you away from your friends at warp four.
"my shuttle may be slow, but their ships can barely make warp two."
"all the same, you'll be under your own power by tomorrow night. we'll contact your wife and tell her to expect you the next morning."
i told you my plan would only take a few hours.
you're welcome. you should let phlox take a look at her before you go to your quarters.
"whatever you say, captain."
"thanks, pinkskin."
you must be getting tired of saving my life.
i'm glad i didn't take your advice about not coming along.
"yeah, you and me both. then again, you almost got yourself killed down there. wouldn't have gone over too big at the ceremony."
"signing documents are easy. training a new engineer, that can be a real pain in the ass."
data to counsellor troi.
"yes, data."
i was wondering if this might be an appropriate time to continue our discussion on the long-term effects of space travel on my positronic net.
can i give you a rain check?
"you may check me for rain if you like, counsellor, but i assure you there is no water in my"
"data, i'll get back to you. come in."
i know it's past office hours.
what is it?
it won't be long before they find the pegasus.
you haven't made your decision. the holodeck?
they rescued the andorian's daughter.
"so you're coming to the moment of truth in there, as well."
i need you to promise you'll keep this confidential.
you know i will.
what do you know about the treaty of algeron?
2311. it redefined the romulan neutral zone.
it also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on starfleet vessels.
the pegasus?
a secret group in starfleet security developed a prototype. pressman was put in charge of testing it.
that's why they're so eager to find it before the romulans do.
"the accident, the seventy one people who died, we were testing the cloaking device."
it was covered up.
the nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to secrecy.
and you've lived with that for twelve years?
they want to pick the experiment up where they left off.
are you sure?
pressman told me himself. what they're doing is wrong. it could jeopardise the treaty.
and you want to tell that to captain picard.
i took an oath of secrecy. pressman still outranks the captain.
"will, you didn't get this far in your career making easy decisions. i'm confident you'll make the right one now."
i wish i was.
"he was anything but tactful. what his countrymen might refer to as a hick. for the life of me, i couldn't understand what captain archer saw in him."
"thinner. roll it a little bit thinner, like this."
"yeah, right."
go on.
"that's about it, really. i used to think that first impressions meant something. i guess it's not always true. to be honest, i didn't think he was going to last a month, old friend of the captain's or not. and now, i can't imagine what these last ten years would've been like without him."
did you ever find yourself attracted to him?
"maybe a little. i never really thought he was my type. didn't even graduate college, he learned about engineering working on boat engines, i think. never cared much about languages, could barely speak english. but he did have his moments. i still find him kind of cute. keep that to yourself."
always do. captain said they'd known each other a long time.
close to twenty years. he taught the captain how to scuba dive somewhere off the coast of florida.
"you're pressing too hard. just slow, steady movement."
sorry.
no need to apologise.
they've got a shorthand they use sometimes. comes from spending so much time together.
did trip ever take a swing at picard?
at who?
"archer, captain archer?"
"not that i know of. when push comes to shove, commander tucker usually ends up doing the right thing. how am i doing?"
don't let it get too big. now fold it over. there you go.
"and he's always pushing himself, often to the point of exhaustion. he's forced me to order him to relax on more than one occasion."
to relax?
"yeah. wasn't very keen on getting neuro-pressure treatments from t'pol, but it was that or become addicted to sedatives."
"if i remember correctly, that's when"
"their romance began? precisely. one time, he became so exhausted i had to demand he get six hours sleep. he negotiated it down to four. a very stubborn young man."
i quite enjoy this.
so did he follow your orders?
didn't have a choice.
you've always got a choice.
so do you think this alliance is going to hold?
we'd better hope so. there are thousands of planets within reach. got to start somewhere.
who would have guessed? vulcans and andorians in the same bed.
"the tellarites were never big fans of the andorians, either. this is a special bottle of whiskey. zefram cochrane gave it to my father the day they broke ground at the warp five complex."
"and here we are, toasting to warp seven."
here's to the next generation.
written your speech yet?
i always crammed before exams. i've got three days left.
"the biggest day of your life, and you're going to wait until the night before."
it's the biggest day of our lives.
"i hate to contradict you, captain. you're the man they're waiting to see."
archer to the bridge. what's going on?
"we're under attack, sir. a small vessel."
who are they?
we don't know yet.  intruder alert.
we've come for shran and the child.
i thought you said their ship couldn't catch up to us.
remind me to mention that to shran.
you're leaving me very little choice.
shran left six hours ago. you're too late.
you're lying. his shuttle is still in your launch bay. kill him.
hold on. wait a minute.
i'll take care of this.
the hell you will. i'll bring you to shran. i know where he is.
"i gave you an order, commander."
you heard me. i said i'd bring you to shran.
trip!
"very well. turn around, both of you."
"hey, this guy's the captain."
that's enough.
"he's my boss. if i'm going to disobey his order, i don't want him coming along."
"trip, that's enough!"
"listen. i won't do this if you kill him, but could you please shut him up?"
stop. you can't expect me to just leave him here alive?
he's out cold. he's not going to cause any trouble.
"stay here. if we're not back in ten minutes, kill him."
didn't you hear what i just said? i won't help you if you kill him. this might take longer than ten minutes.
take me to shran or i'll kill him right now.
"okay, okay! i've got a better idea. i'll bring shran to us. we don't have to go anywhere."
be very careful.
you can all come see for yourselves. this is just a comm. station.
i'm going to need to open this so i can bypass the security protocols. is that okay?
as long as you keep your hands where we can see them.
no problem.
"now, all i need to do is connect this to the relay inside that panel."
"stop. open it for him. if there's a weapon in there, you're going to die before your captain."
satisfied?
proceed. hurry up. you're running out of time.
there's just one other thing i need to tell you. you can all go straight to hell.
trip?
he's not responding.
add two percent syntho-surfactant.
doctor.
the plasma was super-heated. it thermalised his lungs. initialise the hyperbaric sequencer.
sorry about the rifle-butt. i was just trying to
"i know, trip. just take it easy. everything's all right."
we gonna be late?
no. we'll be right on schedule. i'll even have time to write my speech.
great news. wait till they hear
we need to get him into the chamber now!
clear!
need any help?
"no, thank you."
for his parents?
will they still be coming to the ceremony?
i told them i thought trip wouldn't want it any other way. don't forget this.
i'd like to meet them.
his parents?
yes. i'd like to meet them.
they're a little eccentric. i think you'll see where trip got his sense of humour.
"my mother was somewhat eccentric, as well."
i remember.
"trip told me as the years went by that i would miss her less. but he was wrong, because i find myself missing her more. why would he tell me that?"
"time heals all wounds, but absence makes the heart grow fonder. i guess it's a little tricky. emotions have a way of contradicting themselves."
and you wonder why we suppress them.
"when i took command ten years ago, i saw myself as an explorer. i thought all the risks would be worth it because, just beyond the next planet, just beyond the next star, there would be something magnificent, something noble. and now trip is dead, and i have to give a speech about how worthwhile it's all been."
trip would be the first to say it was worthwhile.
fried catfish with hush puppies.
"obviously, the captain mentioned why i wanted to see you."
"keep in mind, within a week i'll be eating the real thing. i'm taking my folks down to mobile."
nothing like a challenge.
"captain asked for meat loaf, didn't he?"
i haven't spoken to him yet.
how about t'pol? she won't be very co-operative. you wait and see.
i've already started her plomeek broth. all she has to do is choose a few final ingredients. she'll be down here in about an hour. i hear we're on our way to pick up shran.
can you believe it? we all thought he was dead and gone.
don't you think the captain's cutting it a little close?
"you mean, getting back to san francisco? nah, he won't let anything get in the way of that. trust me. can you spare one of those carrots?"
they're not peeled yet.
that's okay.
"you know, he'd never admit it, but this thing means a hell of a lot to him. he's real proud to be one of the people signing this charter. and he ought to be."
you sound like a lifetime member of the jonathan archer fan club.
"i can count on one hand the number of people i trust. i don't mean trust like i trust you aren't lying to me or, i trust you won't steal my money. i'm talking about the kind of trust where you know someone's not going to hurt you, no matter what. where you know they'll always be there for you, no matter how bad things get. you ever know anybody like that?"
yeah. one or two.
"well, i got some packing to do before i go back on duty. you figured out what you're going to do?"
do?
"you gonna sign on to another ship, or are you gonna open up that little restaurant in the berkshires you told me about?"
"you know, i haven't decided yet. you got any advice?"
nope. but i'm sure you'll make the right choice.
are you certain these are the right seats?
yep.
they don't seem very vip to me.
i'm sure the admiral wanted us to have a view that took in the scope of the occasion.
from this distance you can't tell an andorian from a tellarite.
have you given an answer to captain stillwell yet?
"i've asked him for a little more time, until captain archer decides what he's going to be doing."
i'll bet you a month's pay he'll be on the bridge of a new ship. he won't be able to resist one of those warp seven beauties.
i've heard he's already been tapped for admiral.
malcolm's right. they'll never keep him behind a desk.
it's very wise of you to stick with him. that's exactly what i plan to do.
"please stand still. if you hadn't waited until the last minute, you would have had time to memorise your speech."
you sound like my ninth grade teacher.
"there are dignitaries here from eighteen different worlds. it's a good sign. i wouldn't be surprised if this alliance begins to expand before we know it. you should be very proud of yourself, captain."
i'll be proud of myself if i get this speech out in one piece.
that's not what i meant.
"i know what you meant, phlox, and i appreciate it, but this is not about me."
why do so many humans refuse to take credit where credit is due? there are times when modesty and humility are quite illogical.
"whenever you're ready, sir."
"well, i've got three wives waiting. i'd better go and join them. i'd wish you good luck, captain, but you've always had an ample supply."
"thank you, doctor."
you'd better get out there. you don't want to miss me screwing this thing up.
"i'm going to remain down here, if you don't mind."
"you never did like crowds, did you?"
you look very heroic.
is he nervous?
wouldn't you be?
"oh, he'll be fine. i had to memorise this speech in grammar school. you wish you could tell them all that this alliance will give birth to the federation."
i think i'm ready to talk to captain picard. i should have done it a long time ago.
"so, i guess we're through here."
"i guess we are. computer, end programme."
"space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission"
"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations"
to boldly go where no man has gone before.
